More than wishful thinking, yearning, or shallow \noptimism, we turn to You for lasting hope. We have learned that true \nhope is based on the expectation of the interventions of Your spirit \nthat always are on time and in time. You are the intervening Lord of \nthe Passover, the opening of the Red Sea, the giving of the Ten \nCommandments. You have vanquished the forces of evil, death, and fear \nthrough the cross and the Resurrection. All through the history of our \nNation, You have blessed us with Your providential care. It is with \ngratitude that we affirm, ``Blessed is the Nation whose God is the \nLord.''--Psalm 33:12.\n  May this sacred season culminating in the Holy Week before us, \nincluding Passover, Good Friday, and Easter, be a time of rebirth of \nhope in us. May Your spirit of hope displace the discordant spirit of \ncynicism, discouragement, and disunity. Hope through us, O God of hope. \nFlow through us patiently until we hope for one another what You have \nhoped for us. Then Lord, give us the vision and courage to confront \nthose problems that have made life seem hopeless for some people. Make \nus communicators of hope. We trust our lives, the work of the Senate, \nand the future of our Nation into Your all-powerful hands. In the name \nof the Hope of the World. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3171-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are now well into this year, the second \nyear of this congressional session, preparing to go on a recess, to go \nback to our districts, do our business. So it is sort of interesting to \nreflect a bit on where we are and I guess more importantly where we go.\n  It seems to me that this has been an extraordinary year, a year in \nwhich for the first time in 30 years, there has been a great effort to \nbring about a fundamental change in the operation of the Federal \nGovernment. Much of it, I think, results from the fact that the 1994 \nelections, at least to most of us, had a message. The message was, the \nFederal Government is too large, costs too much, and it is \noverregulated. And there are consequences, there are consequences to \nthat.\n  Obviously, the consequence of being overregulated, one of them, is to \nkeep a damper on the growth of the economy. It has to do with jobs, it \nhas to do with wages. And we all want to change that.\n  The idea of overspending, of course, has a couple of consequences. \nOne of them is that we enjoy the benefits, we continue to add cost to \nGovernment without paying for it, to put it on the credit card--on your \ncredit card. And you will be paying for it.\n  The other is, of course, it takes more and more money from families, \nmoney that was earned by families, sent to the Government when more of \nit could be used by families themselves.\n  What has really happened over the 30 years is we tended to go ahead \nwith the Great Society programs in the social arena. We tended to \nsimply discuss here how much more do we put into the\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nprograms that have been there for a very long time. They are not all \nbad programs. But certainly after a number of years, there needs be to \nbe a real look at whether or not those programs need to be there, \nwhether, those, programs can be done more efficiently, whether, indeed, \nthose programs can be transferred to local governments, closer to those \nwho are governed, whether they need to be discontinued.\n  So I am very pleased, frankly, with this year, even though we have \nnot come to closure on as many things as I hoped we would have. We \nstill have an opportunity in this week. And this week has been a good \nweek for that.\n  Nevertheless, the debate has changed entirely. The debate has changed \nfrom one of how much more money do we put into the program, to a real \nanalysis of the program, a real change. Frankly, I guess being a \nfreshman here makes it a little more exciting to help bring about that \nchange, as the Presiding Officer would agree.\n  But it is something that I think most of us want to do, and we intend \nto continue to do that. I had the good opportunity this last week, Mr. \nPresident, as I often do, to go to schools in my district. I went to CY \nJunior High in Caspar, WY. They asked me to come and talk a little bit \nabout politics and particularly the primary. I am always happy to do \nthat. I am happy to do it for a couple reasons.\n  One is, of course, even though we sort of despair about politics and \nwe call them politicians and all those things, politics is the way we \ngovern ourselves. Politics is the way people in Caspar, WY, in my \nprecinct where I am a precinct chairman, have input into what is done \nin this country, regardless of the party that they are in. So that is \nwhat politics is about. Obviously, I have urged young people to learn \nabout it and become involved in it.\n  The other, of course, is the primary, which is a very interesting \naspect of our society, particularly when we generally have two parties, \na two-party system. So there is in general a difference between the \nparties. Indeed, there should be. It is legitimate that there be that. \nThat is what gives people a choice on how they govern themselves.\n  Of course, generally, Republicans have been more conservative, the \nRepublicans have been for less government, the Republicans have been \nfor moving more government to the States. The Democrats, on the other \nhand, have generally supported more Federal Government and making more \nof the decisions there. Both of these are legitimate views. I happen to \nfeel rather strongly about my view. I do not insist, however, that it \nis always correct.\n  But it has been interesting this week, I think, Mr. President, to see \nhow many of the things we have talked about just in the last couple of \ndays would tend to show that that is indeed the case.\n  The farm bill, we talked about the farm bill yesterday. It was a \npretty clear choice as to where we go in the future. The choice is \nbasically whether we continue to have a farm program--and I happen to \ncome from a background of agriculture, and I can recall people, when I \nfirst got into agriculture in the 1960's, people saying, ``Hey, we have \ngot to get out of this farm program. We have to get so we're producing \nfor the market. We have got to get to doing something where farmers \nhave more choices for themselves.'' We have not done that until \nnow. Now we have an opportunity in this farm bill to move out over a \nperiod of adjustment into the marketplace, where we ought to be. It is \npretty clear, a pretty clear division. We could see it on the floor \nyesterday.\n\n  Health care--we will work today, we will work this week, we have \nworked for a very long time on health care. There are some very clear \ndefinitions there as to whether we want to deal with health care in the \nprivate sector, where people can make their choices, where we have \nIRA's for health care, where we do something about private insurance, \nor whether we move, as the administration sought to, 2 years ago, to a \nGovernment-controlled program. It is pretty clear.\n  I think it is really important that we do understand that there are \nsome philosophical differences here that have impact. I used to debate \na Congressman from California, Mr. George Miller, on issues about land \nand the environment, but we had to make it clear to begin with that we \nhad a great difference of philosophy, because often we were not really \narguing about the bill but arguing about philosophy. George Miller \nwould like to have the Government own more land. I tend to say there \nought to be a limit, and private ownership ought to be sustained.\n  Jobs and wages--I think all of us are concerned about that. We see \ntwo very different approaches taking place. One is to encourage the \nprivate sector. The Republicans are saying we should do something about \nthat, do something about capital gains so people are encouraged and \ngiven incentives to invest, to create jobs, do something about \noverregulation; on the other hand, our friends with a little different \npoint of view, different philosophy, say, ``Look, we ought to get the \nGovernment involved here and put these corporations in different \ncategories, and if they behave properly with respect to Government \nregulations, then we give them some sort of preference.''\n  I guess, Mr. President, what I am saying is, we talked a bit about \ndifferences, about choices. Obviously, no one agrees entirely with \neverything their party is for, but they find the party that most \nclosely represents their point of view. That is what primaries are \nabout. That is what elections are about. People ought to see where they \nare--the 10th amendment, the idea of involving the States more.\n  Mr. President, I think this has been an exciting year. I look forward \nto completing more of that fundamental change that has been brought \nabout here. One of the final comments I make, it was interesting that \nthe Chief of Staff of the White House was indicating the other day it \nis up to the Congress to deliver to the President the kind of bill that \nhe wants. Let me suggest that is not exactly the way it is set up, in \nmy view.\n  Under the Constitution, there are three equal divisions of the \nFederal Government--judicial, legislative, and executive. Each of them \nhas the authority to make some decisions for themselves, and, indeed, \nthe President has the perfect right to veto, and he should veto. That \nis his constitutional privilege. To veto does not mean the Congress has \nto continue to bring everything back until it meets his particular \npoint of view. This is not a unilateral decision. This is a joint \ndecision.\n  My only point is the White House needs to make some accommodations, \nas well. The way you make that work is after a couple vetoes, you do \nnot send any more, and there is no opportunity for the President to \nwork.\n  I hope we do come together. Certainly, we never will all agree. We do \nhave the responsibility to move forward. We do have the responsibility \nto make the system work.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can move on some of those things. We \nhave passed a great number of items in this Congress, all of which have \nmet the same fate at the White House. We will change that. We will have \nto change that, so that we can move forward and respond to those voters \nwho spoke very clearly in 1994.\n  I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague from Wyoming. Many of my remarks will reinforce \nthe point he is making. Sometimes we need to step back from the fray to \nsort of size up the situation we are in.\n  Here in the waning days of March 1996, over 3 years after the \nelection of President Clinton, I think we can come to the conclusion \nthat the President does not want a balanced budget. He does not want a \nbalanced budget.\n\n  Those that might be listening would say, ``Well, how do you come to \nthat conclusion?'' First, this recent budget we received from the \nPresident is his ninth attempt--ninth. He promised the American voters \nin 1992 that he would balance the budget within 5 years. He has yet to \ntake an affirmative step to do that. In the first 2 years, he raised \ntaxes in an unprecedented level--over 200-plus billion dollars. And the \nfirst effort he made was to add $20 billion to the deficit. That was \nhis first financial overture to the people of the United States.\n  Well, we wrangled over that for a period of time, and finally the \n104th Congress, this Congress, sent the President\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\na balanced budget, and he vetoed it. This Congress tried to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and he rose in \nopposition and defeated it. He caused six Members of his own party who \nvoted for the exact proposition the year before to change their votes \nbecause he did not want a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, a discipline that would cause America to have to live \nwithin its means.\n  At the time he and his colleagues said, ``Well, we just have to have \nthe will. We do not need an amendment to the Constitution. Congress \njust has to have the fortitude and utilize its own jurisdictional \npowers and pass a balanced budget.'' Lo and behold, we did. And he \nvetoed it, and he opposed the balanced budget amendment. Then he would \nnot submit a balanced budget. Then the Government closed down twice.\n  Now we have the latest attempt in his last year of office under this \nterm. He submits his ninth attempt. What does it do? Well, the first \nthing that happens is that 70 percent of the savings that theoretically \nwould produce a balanced budget occur after he leaves office, if he is \nelected the second time. So all the work has to occur when he is long \ngone. As a world statesman, it is sort of like, ``Here, you handle it, \nAmerica. You take care of it.'' Mr. President, 70 percent of the \ncorrectional devices occur after he is out of office.\n  It makes no structural adjustments in the area of Medicaid and \nMedicare. In the case of Medicare, he totally ignores his own trustees \nwho have told the President, they have told the Presiding Officer, they \nhave told me, our colleagues in the Nation, that Medicare will write \nits last check in 5 years. This budget ignores that crisis, and \ntherefore is ignoring all those senior citizens dependent upon that \nprogram. Once again, ``Here, you handle it--later. We will look at that \nafter the next election.''\n  Mr. President, these budgets talk of big, big numbers. They are hard \nto follow, even if you work on it every day, much less if you are \ntrying to do the things that you are responsible for at home--get the \nkids up, get them fed, get them to school, get to the job, leave the \njob, someone is sick, get to the school, to the doctor, back home, one \nof the parents comes--we know the routine very well, Mr. President. \nThose families are the ones that are most impacted by the failure of \nthis budget.\n  What it does to that family, that average Georgia family at home, is \nit leaves enormous burdens right on their shoulders and backs. That \nfamily today makes about $40,000. Both parents work, as I just \ndescribed, and they have two kids. Under this plan that the President \nhas given us, they are going to take about 20 to 25 percent of the \ntotal earnings--gross earnings--of that family and ship it up here to \nWashington. Another 10 percent--$3,000 to $4,000--comes out to take \ncare of State and local government. This is an interesting figure: Out \nof the $40,000 they make, they will contribute $6,500 for the \nregulatory apparatus we have set up in America.\n  Under this President, it is going up. Just since he has been \nPresident, the bill for the regulatory apparatus has gone up $688 in \nthe last 36 months. They are going to get to pay about $2,000 as their \nshare of the interest on our debt, which we just increased last night.\n  When you add it all up, how much do they have left to do what we have \nasked them to do for the country? Remember what we asked them to do, \nMr. President? We said raise the country, educate the country, feed it, \nhouse it, transport it, see to its health. What does this budget that \nthe President has just given us leave for that family to do its work? \nAbout half. They have $20,000 to $22,000 to do all the work we have \nasked them to do and to build their dreams--to build their dreams. That \nis what this President's budget leaves for them.\n  When he vetoed a balanced budget, in effect, he took $3,000 out of \ntheir checking account--$3,000. Just think what that family could do \nwith that. That is the equivalent of a 10- to 20-percent pay raise in \nthat family. But this President thinks that the $3,000 is better used \nup here than in their checking account. Sometimes we wonder why people \nare so frustrated.\n  When we took that $3,000 out of their account and brought it up here, \nit reminds us that when they sent Secretary O'Leary and her aides and \nfriends all over the world, flying first class, staying in the best \nhotels, it cost $3.7 million, which took 739 Georgia families to pay \nfor that travel bill. It took all that they sent up here to pay for \nthat travel bill. To send her to China took 170 Georgia families, my \nneighbors, just to get her to China. No wonder they are furious. To \nsend her to India, it took 144 Georgia families--everything they have \nearned and worked for and sent up here went to get her to India. It \ntook 140 families to get her to South Africa.\n  When the First Lady and her entourage went to Beijing, that took 499 \nGeorgia families to pay for that. Here is the whopper: To send Commerce \nSecretary Ron Brown and his aides around the country and the world, it \ntook 13,700 Georgia families. We ask them to raise the country, feed \nthe country, house the country, educate the country, prepare the \ncountry for the future. And here we have 17,000 Georgia families, and \neverything they earn, all that hard sweat that came up here just to \nfund this kind of foolishness. This budget that we just got from the \nPresident leaves all that burden and all that apparatus right in place, \nand it leaves all that pressure on those families. And it is not right.\n  Sooner or later, the demand for balanced budgets, which leaves those \nresources in those families, will prevail, despite the opposition of \nthis President.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. What is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to commend the \nSenator from Georgia. He really talked about the effect on people of \nwasteful, big Federal Government. He did not just talk about numbers on \na page that do not relate to anything. He talked about how much it \ncosts to have a bureaucrat waste taxpayer dollars, how many Georgia and \nTexas families it takes to pay for the waste in Government, families \nthat do not have the ability to waste money because they are working so \nhard to do the things for their children that they would hope to do. So \nI thank the Senator from Georgia for bringing this into a debate about \npeople and the effect on people's lives.\n  Balancing the Federal budget is not about the runaway Federal \ndeficit, or the debt ceiling, or even about temporary Government \nshutdowns. It is about the future of our country, about what America \nwill be like tomorrow and the next day and a generation from now.\n  Most Americans believe they are better off than their parents. But it \nis amazing how many Americans do not believe their children will be \nbetter off than they were. The American dream has always been about \nprogress, about growth from one generation to the next, about \ngenerational improvements, that our children will have more \nopportunities, more choices, better lives than their parents. Why is \nit, for the first time in history, that a generation of Americans have \nlost hope, have lost confidence in our future? The answer is that too \nmany people are in Washington, DC, making decisions about how to spend \nour money. For too long, Washington has spent more than it takes in.\n  I was listening to the radio this morning, and a man called in and he \nsaid, ``I remember a quote about Thomas Jefferson.'' Thomas Jefferson \nwas brought the Federal budget, and his budget advisers put it on his \ndesk. Thomas Jefferson had one simple question: ``Do we take in more \nthan we spend? That is the only question that matters because if we do \nnot take in more than we are spending, take it back, do something with \nit, that is the only question that you have to answer right.''\n  Thomas Jefferson said what we should be saying today instead of too \nmany people in Washington spending our tax dollars the way they see fit \nand many times for the wrong reasons.\n  The President's budget proposal asks for $600 million for increased \naudits\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\nand enforcement and $850 million, on top of the $4 billion already \nspent, to improve tax collection procedures. Americans want the Federal \nTax Code to be made simple, fair, and uniform. But they really do not \nwant billions more to be spent on IRS bureaucrats.\n  The President's budget fails to institute real work requirements for \nwelfare recipients. It also guarantees that illegal immigrants will be \nable to receive food stamps. By refusing to sign the welfare reform \nlegislation that Congress has sent to him twice, the President \nguarantees that welfare dependency will continue in the country and \nthat the American people will continue to foot the bill. The working \nAmerican will continue to foot the bill.\n  I believe that is why Republicans were elected in 1994--to end \npolitics as usual. For decades, politicians came to Washington and put \nBand-Aids on a bad situation until the next election.\n  That is not what we are here for. We were sent here to offer real \nlong-term solutions--not for the next election but for the generation.\n  That is why we are trying hard to do what we said we would do and \nbalance the budget. It is why we sent a balanced budget to the \nPresident. But he has vetoed that balanced budget. The balanced budget \nis not about numbers. It is about people just as the Senator from \nGeorgia was just saying.\n  I think of parents with children in high school afraid their children \nwill not be able to attend college because they cannot afford the \ninterest rates for college loans. I think of the newly married couple \nthat wants to buy their piece of the American dream--a new home--but \nthey are not going to be able to afford the interest rates on the \nmortgage. I think about working people in their forties and fifties who \nare trying desperately to set aside that little bit of extra money they \nare earning for their retirement security. And yet in the budget that \nthe President has submitted it does not even allow homemakers to set \naside $2,000 a year for IRA's like those who work outside the home are \nable to do. They are not even thinking about one-income earner couples \nthat are sacrificing so that one spouse--the homemaker--will stay home \nand raise children. And I think of senior citizens who are depending on \nMedicare but are afraid that it may not be there when they really need \nit.\n  These are real people with real concerns and real fears. \nUnfortunately, instead of hope, President Clinton hyped the status quo. \nInstead of inspiring Americans to have confidence in their future, \ninstead he incites fear.\n  It is wrong to ask that American people live within their means but \nnot ask the Federal Government to do the same. Is it wrong to demand \nthat Washington stop wasting taxpayer dollars? Is it wrong to demand an \nend to politics as usual?\n  That is what we are demanding--a return to principle instead of \npolitics; a commitment to the next generation instead of the next \nelection.\n  We are 4 years away from a new millennium. The year 2000 should be a \nnew beginning. Where will we be in the year 2000? As we look forward to \nthe year 2000, where will we be starting with what we need to do today?\n  As that ball drops in Times Square, and people all over our Nation \nare celebrating a new beginning, will we be firmly on the path to a \nbalanced budget, and a growing economy? Or will the deficit still be \neating away at the working people's livelihood in this country? Will we \nhave reformed the welfare system, or will it continue to undermine the \nwork ethic destroying families and ruin the very lives of people who \nare receiving welfare? Will we have reduced the excessive tax burden on \nthe American family leaving them with more of their money in their \npockets or will we continue to have taxes that takes people's extra \nmoney so they cannot put it away for saving for their retirement? Will \nwe have reformed Medicare so that our future generations will know that \nit will be there for them so that it will be stronger? Or will we have \ncontinued on the path that we are on now? And will Medicare be 2 years \naway from going out of business so that seniors in this country really \nwill have to fear whether it is going to be there for them?\n  In short, Mr. President, will we have continued business as usual for \nthese 4 years that we have been elected to make change, or will we have \nkept the promise that we made to the American people?\n  I hope that in the year 2000 we will have said this year there is no \nmore politics as usual, no more excuses, that we kept our promises in \n1996 so that in the year 2000 when we are celebrating a new beginning \nwe will indeed have a strong and thriving economy, and that we will \nhave American families with the hope that their children will be able \nto have a better life than they have had just as so many generations in \nthe past have been able to hope.\n  Mr. President, the time to prepare for a new beginning in a new \nmillennium is right now, and we are missing that opportunity with a \nbudget by the President that does not speak to tax fairness and equity \nfor the working families of this country. We are trying to make a \ndifference.\n  The President has vetoed welfare reform. He has vetoed a balanced \nbudget. He has vetoed middle-class tax cuts. All of the things that he \npromised and all of the things that we promised--and we are trying to \ndeliver--have been vetoed by the President.\n  The time is now for us to put partisanship aside and do what all of \nus said we would do for the American people--balance the budget. That \nis our commitment. And, Mr. President, we have a chance to keep our \npromise.

Mr. President, this is, it seems to me, a time to talk \nabout change in this country. I think the central question is what kind \nof change will make this a better place in which to live?\n  We have had a lot of struggles in our history in this country about \nwhat the role of government is. Is there a role for government? What \nkind of government, and how much government do we want? We have \nstruggled over the decades with that question.\n  I go back to the early 1900's which relates to the struggle we had \nover the question of food inspection. I have told my colleagues this \nbefore. Some know it because of the readings they have done. But even \nthen we began the struggle over all of these issues.\n  On the issue of food inspection, Upton Sinclair wrote a book at the \nturn of the century. He did an investigative book on his discoveries in \nthe meat, packing plants, I believe in Chicago, where he discovered \nthat in the meat packing plants they had rats running around the \nplants. And they were trying to, of course, control the problem of rats \nin the meat packing plants. That is a pretty big problem. So they would \nput out bread laced with arsenic and lay it around the meat plants. And \nthe rats would eat the bread, and die. And they would throw the rats \nand the bread and the meat down the same chute, and out comes mystery \nmeat on the other side sold as sausage in some location somewhere in \nAmerica to an unsuspecting consumer. Rats, arsenic, poison bread, meat \nand sausage.\n  Upton Sinclair wrote about that--about the outrage of that, about the \nthreat to this country's health as a result of that. And guess what \nhappened? The debate in this country turned quickly to the question of \nhow to stop that. How do we prevent that? How do we assure ourselves \nthat our food supply is safe?\n  We created in this country a level of government that says we are \ngoing to inspect food so that when you eat food you are not going to \neat mystery meat laced with bread and arsenic that was used to poison \nrats. Even then we had people who said it is none of government's \nbusiness; let the private sector decide. Well, arsenic and rats in meat \nare the public's business.\n  Oh, we have gone several stages from that. And in the mid-1960's half \nof America's senior citizens had no health care. They reached an age \nwhere they were not working. They reached retirement age, and did not \nhave any money; nothing really to speak of. And they had no health care \ncoverage.\n  I remember driving one fellow to the hospital some 55 miles away when \nI\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nwas a teenager--an old fellow that lived by himself, had no one, had \nnothing, had no insurance, and was very sick. And my father, who could \nnot take him, asked me to take him to the hospital. I drove him there. \nThey said, ``Do you have money, or insurance?'' Of course not. They \ntook him in anyway.\n  But back then half of American seniors had no health coverage at all. \nIn the mid-1960's we had a discussion about that in this country, and \nwe decided that we would develop a Medicare Program.\n  A lot of people--90 percent of the majority party now--in Congress \nvoted against it and said we do not want Medicare the first time we \nvoted on it. Some are still bragging they voted against it.\n  Do you know something? Ninety-nine percent of American senior \ncitizens are now covered by health care. I am proud of that.\n  Do we have some problems with Medicare? Yes, we do. Should we fix it? \nYou had better believe it.\n  But should we decide to retreat on the things we have done to make \nthis a better country--food inspection and health care and dozens of \nother areas? I do not think so. I do not think it really does much good \nto suggest that somehow all of government is unhealthy or unholy and \ndoes nothing to protect people. Government is our teachers. Government \nis our police force. Government is our fire department. Government is \nthe food inspectors, the air traffic controllers. A lot of folks do a \nlot of good work.\n  Now, we are reducing the size of government, and we should. There are \nfewer people working for the Federal Government today than have been at \nany time since John F. Kennedy. Why? Reinventing Government, headed by \nAl Gore, the Vice President, developed by Bill Clinton. Reinventing \ngovernment is reducing the size of government. Do not believe me? There \nare 200,000 less people working for the Federal Government now than \nthere were 4, 5 years ago. We have program after program after program \nthat has been abolished or disbanded because it did not work. Other \nprograms are reduced. Some programs that are important are expanded.\n  That is what we ought to do. We ought to use good judgment to see \nwhat works and what does not. Let us get rid of what does not work. We \nought to ask two questions about everything we do in Congress: Do we \nneed it? Can we afford it? And if the answer is yes, let us go and do \nit as a country.\n  I am a little confused, I guess, about some of the things that I have \nheard in some discussion today, and I have certainly heard a lot of it \npreviously, about what an awful place this is, America has gone to hell \nin a handbasket. Gee, this country is just in terrible shape. And then \nwe have folks out running for President who want to build a fence \nbetween the United States and Mexico and keep the Mexicans out. And we \nhave folks from every other country of the world who want to come to \nthis country. We have a serious immigration problem.\n  Why would that be? Is it because this place is such an awful place to \nlive? No, it is because this place is still a remarkable country, a \ncountry filled with people with enormous strength and vitality and \ninterest to make this a better place.\n  How do we make it a better place? Do we make it a better place by \ncalling for changes that say, well, let us decide to retract our \ncommitment to Medicare; let us decide it is not important for a poor \nkid to have an entitlement to a hot lunch in the middle of the day at \nschool; let us decide that is not important; let us decide that what we \nreally need to do is cut the Star Schools Program which is designed to \ntry to boost our country in math and sciences and education; let us cut \nStar Schools by 40 percent, and let us increase the star wars program \nby over 100 percent because we want to build more missiles and put an \nastrodome over America with missile defense and we want to do it much \nfaster with much more money than the generals and admirals think is \nappropriate because these folks know better about that, so increase \nthat spending 100 percent and cut Star Schools investments by 40 \npercent. Does that advance this country's interests? I do not think so.\n  Maybe build some orphanages, as a welfare solution. Maybe give every \npoor kid a laptop, take their lunch away but give them a laptop. And \nthe other one is term limits. If you can just have term limits, you \nwould solve all the problems. I tell you, it is hard not to laugh out \nloud to see people walk in this Chamber who served here 30 years and \nvote for term limits and say, ``Yes, the problem is I have served here \ntoo long so stop me before I run again, except the term limit I want to \nvote for will not apply to me.''\n  That is what they say. It is hard not to laugh out loud when you see \nthat. They do not believe that. And it is wrong not to deal with the \nreal issues.\n  Do you know what the real issues are, in my judgment? The real issues \nI think you can categorize in about three areas. Kids. That is our \nfuture. Jobs. There is no social program in this country more important \nthan a good job that pays well. Jobs. How do we get jobs? How do we \nexpand jobs and create jobs and have an economy that provides more \nopportunity? Kids, jobs, and the other issue is values.\n  Those are the core issues I think we have to address. We can run \naround on dozens of other issues. I just heard discussions about the \nbalanced budget amendment. We ought to pass a balanced budget \namendment. But anybody who thinks they are going to get a balanced \nbudget through this Chamber that loots the Social Security system by \ntaking the Social Security trust funds to the tune of nearly $700 \nbillion in 7 years is dreaming.\n\n  I am not going to vote for that. I did not come here to vote to loot \nthe Social Security trust funds. We ought to balance the budget \nhonestly. The Social Security trust funds are dedicated only to be used \nfor Social Security, and to use them for other purposes is dishonest \nbudgeting. To those who say, well, we could not get it through the \nChamber of the Senate, I say I voted for a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, one that said the Social Security trust funds will \nhave a firewall; you cannot use Social Security trust funds as \noperating budget revenues because it is dishonest. Guess what. The \nfolks who said they wanted a balanced budget voted against that because \nthey wanted a balanced budget amendment in the Constitution that \ncreated a constitutional opportunity for them to misuse $1.2 trillion \nin Social Security trust funds over 10 years.\n  No wonder it did not get through the Senate. It is the goofiest idea \nI ever heard--tell people we are going to take money out of your \npaychecks, called Social Security taxes; we are going to put it in a \ntrust fund; and we promise we will get it in a trust fund dedicated \nonly for that use. But now we have decided to put in the Constitution a \nprovision that says we are going to use hundreds of billions of dollars \nof the trust funds as offsets against other operating revenue. And by \nthe way, what are our priorities for the revenue and expenditures on \nthe rest of the budget? Well, we say, while we balance the budget let's \nprovide a tax cut. Let's provide a very large tax cut for people with \nvery large incomes and let's provide a minuscule tax cut for all the \nrest. It seems to me maybe people are bound to be a little skeptical \nabout that.\n  So what do you do about the central issues that I think really relate \nto people's lives? Kids, what about our kids, jobs and values? When \npeople in my hometown sit down to have supper --we call it in Regent, \nND; we sit down for supper--and you talk about your circumstances, what \nis important? What is important is how are your kids doing. What kind \nof opportunities are your kids going to have. It is also important, how \nare we doing? Do we have more income now? We are working harder. Are we \nmaking more? How are we doing? What kind of economic opportunity will \nwe have?\n  And then the issue of values. There is a collapsing kind of value \nsystem, coarsening language, difficulty with what our children see on \ntelevision, more crime, and a whole series of related issues that I \nthink fall under the heading of values. But let me talk just for a \nmoment about kids.\n  The first issue with kids that matters most to this country, in my \njudgment, is not all the peripheral antigovernment nonsense. It is, do \nyou have in this country the best education system in the world or do \nyou not? Because if you do not, we will not win. Our country ought to \ndedicate itself at\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\nevery single level of Government, and we ought to dedicate ourselves in \nevery home with every set of parents and in every school that America \nis going to have the best education system on the face of the Earth. \nAmerican kids are going to be the best educated kids in the world. That \nought to be the central debate.\n  Now, most of education is run by State and local governments. It is \nnot run by the Federal Government. We play a peripheral role. We play a \nrole of providing financial aid to college students largely, plus we \nhave some title programs--title I which moves some money to school \ndistricts to help some of the disadvantaged kids. But education is \nlargely a function of State and local government. We must, it seems to \nme, as a country, not necessarily with a central plan but as a country \nin which all of us work together, decide our goal is to have the finest \neducation system on the face of the Earth. That is the way this country \nwill succeed and win in the future.\n  I have told my colleagues before, and I am going to again because I \nthink it is so illustrative, the first week I came to Congress some \nyears ago I walked into the office of the oldest Member of the House, \nClaude Pepper, and I will never forget what I saw on the wall behind \nhis chair. Two pictures. One was Orville and Wilbur Wright making the \nfirst airplane flight down at Kitty Hawk, and Claude was an old fellow, \nwonderful old fellow at that point. He had an autographed picture of \nOrville Wright making the first flight autographed to Congressman \nClaude Pepper, an autographed picture to him before he died, and then \nhe had a picture of Neil Armstrong walking on the Moon autographed to \nCongressman Claude Pepper. I thought to myself, here is the person who \nhas an autograph of the first American to leave the ground and fly and \nthe first person to step on the Moon. What is the significance of \nleaving the ground to fly, and flying to the Moon? Education, massive \ninvestments in education, so that this country led the world in \ntechnological achievement in dozens of areas from airplanes to \ntelevision to medicine--you name it. Education; it is the key to this \ncountry's future.\n\n  Second, with respect to kids, is welfare. I know people talk about \nwelfare in this Chamber with respect to able-bodied people who will not \nwork. Able-bodied people on welfare ought to go to work. We offered a \nprogram called Work First, which I am enormously proud of, that says to \npeople, ``If you are down and out and disadvantaged we will give you a \nhand up and a helping hand, but your obligation is to get up and out \nand get a job.''\n  But understand the reality of welfare. Two-thirds of the welfare \npayments in this country go to kids under 16 years of age. A young boy \nnamed David spoke at a hearing I went to some years ago, a 10-year-old \nboy from New York who lived in a homeless shelter. He said, ``No 10-\nyear-old boy like me ought to have to lay his head down on his desk in \nthe middle of the afternoon at school because it hurts to be hungry.'' \nWelfare largely relates to America's children as well. One in four \nchildren in America under the age of 3 is living in circumstances of \npoverty. We must have a welfare system that says to able-bodied people, \n``We are going to help you get a job because you cannot, as able-bodied \npersons, remain on welfare indefinitely.''\n  But we must also have a welfare system that understands kids and the \nneeds of kids. It is not their fault they were born in circumstances of \npoverty. And those who parade around these Chambers and say, ``By the \nway, let us retract the entitlement for a poor kid to be able to get a \nhot lunch in the middle of the day of school,'' do no service for \nchildren. Let us care about kids, educate them, help them become better \neducated citizens for the future of this country.\n  With respect to jobs, we can talk about a hundred other issues but \nthere is no social program that we will discuss in the 104th Congress \nthat is as important to this country and as important for Americans as \na good job that pays a good income.\n  We have seen what causes the anxiety. The chief executive officers of \nAmerica's corporations increased their compensation 23 percent last \nyear; last year alone, a 23-percent increase for the people at the top. \nBut guess what? For 60 percent of the American families now, when they \nsit down for supper at night and talk about their lot in life after 20 \nyears, they are working harder and they are making less money. When you \nadjust their income for inflation they have less purchasing power now \nthan they had 20 years ago.\n  How can all that have happen? Last year we had the largest trade \ndeficit, merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country; the \nlargest merchandise trade deficit in history. That means jobs are \nleaving, not coming. It means we are competing with 2 or 3 billion \nother people in the world, some of whom will make 12 cents, 18 cents, \n50 cents, or $1 an hour, working in unsafe plants that are dumping \npollution into the air and water. That is not fair competition and we \nshould not have to deal with it. We must deal with the issue of jobs \nand do it now. We must bring jobs issues to the floor of the Senate and \nrespond in a real way.\n  Those who come to the floor talking about helping people do no \nservice, especially to working people at the bottom of the ladder, when \nthey also embrace policies that will pull out the rug from under those \npeople on the earned income tax credit, because that is the kind of \npolicy designed to help working people at the bottom of the economic \nladder.\n  Finally, on the issue of values, I think there is general agreement \nin this Chamber, between Republicans and Democrats, that there is a \ncollapsing of values in this country that is troublesome. There are, \nperhaps, many reason for it. But the restoration of values starts in \nthe home, in the neighborhood, in the community. It starts with all of \nus. Television is too coarse, language is too coarse during times when \nchildren are watching. There is too much violence on television. \nAmerica has become too violent a country. We are the murder capital of \nthe world. We are the cocaine capital of the world. We have 23,000 \nmurders and 110,000 rapes every year, and we must respond to it. And \nthat is one of the areas, I think, in which Republicans and Democrats \nhave joined in trying to respond in a significant way. But we must \nunderstand the collapsing of values in this country is also causing \nsignificant concern.\n  Let me, finally, point out about those who spend a lot of time \ntalking about how awful Government is--and there are plenty of areas of \nGovernment that have gone awry, that we must rein in and correct--I \napplaud those and join them when they want to do that. I would also say \nit is important for us to talk about what works and what is right. Do \nyou know we now use twice as much energy as we did 20 years ago, but we \nhave less water pollution and less air pollution? We have cleaner air \nand water than we did 20 years ago, despite the fact we have doubled \nour energy use. Is that accidental? No, it is not. It is because this \nCongress decided we are going to start penalizing people who pollute; \nthere is only one Earth to live on, and we want the environment to be \nclean.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to understand, there is a lot of what has been \ndone by people of this country in public policy, ranging from cleaning \nup our air and water to providing health care for senior citizens, \nintervening in the lives of young children to provide education and to \ndeal with hunger and nutrition issues, and many other areas that have \nmade this a better country.\n  As I conclude, let me just say I had a town meeting in which I said \nto people who, I am sure, listen to all of the talk shows--and everyday \nin every way we have all these shows that talk about what is wrong with \nAmerica. They hold up this little thing and say, ``Isn't this ugly? See \nthis? Is this not awful?'' I understand, it is what entertains.\n  I said, ``Why don't we talk about what works? Let us be positive for \na half-hour. Let's talk about only what works in our lives.'' It was a \nremarkable transformation, because a lot of people talked about a lot \nof good things in their lives, a lot of things that are improving, a \nlot of things that are working. Then from that we discovered what is \nleft, what is left for us to do as a people together to make this a \nbetter country.\n  I hope, in the coming months, the challenges that were discussed by \nthe Members of the majority party today and myself and others are \nchallenges we will decide to embrace quickly and\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\ndebate in a thoughtful way. What about the future of our children? What \nabout our kids? What kind of jobs and opportunities will we have in the \nfuture? How do we address the issue of collapsing values in our \ncountry? Those are the central challenges I think we face in our \ncountry today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the past 2 weeks I have tried to \ncome to the floor every day, whenever my colleagues would generously \nallow me a few minutes, to announce the realization of another \ncomponent of our initiative to prevent violence against women, which \nthe Senator from Utah has been a very, very strong leader in, the \nnational domestic violence hotline. The hotline, which officially \nopened on February 24, signifies the realization of the key provision \nof the Violence Against Women Act, passed by the Congress as part of \nthe 1994 crime bill.\n  The toll free number--I have tried to announce this on the floor over \nthe last several weeks--is 1-800-799-SAFE. This will provide immediate \ncrisis assistance and counseling and local shelter referrals to women \nacross the country, 24 hours a day. There is also a TDD number for the \nhearing impaired, and that number is 1-800-787-3224.\n  Today, on the last day of the 2-week period in which I promised to \nhighlight the hotline, I want to take the opportunity to stress how \nmuch work still has to be done to fight domestic abuse in our country. \nOn Tuesday of this week, the chief prosecutor in Alexandria, VA, John \nKloch, called for tougher strategies against domestic violence in \nresponse to a murder of a local schoolteacher, Karen Mitsoff, who was \nkilled early Monday of this week by an ex-boyfriend who had been \nstalking her.\n  Miss Mitsoff's former boyfriend, Mr. Senet, reportedly broke into her \napartment on March 10 and threatened to kill her and himself. Senet was \ncharged with burglary and then released on a $2,500 bond in a routine \nhearing.\n  This past Monday, 1 week after his arrest, he apparently broke into \nMiss Mitsoff's apartment and fatally shot her before killing himself. \nCommonwealth Attorney Kloch was quoted as saying:\n\n       This case shows that there are holes in the system. Somehow \n     we failed to stop this. This case clearly illustrates that in \n     many instances, potential threats to women are not addressed \n     with enough urgency.\n\n  Let me explain just how urgent these threats to the safety of women \nand children are.\n  Every 12 seconds, a woman is beaten by a husband, boyfriend, or \npartner in the United States of America--every 12 seconds;\n  Over 4,000 women are killed every year by their abuser;\n  Every 6 minutes in our country, a woman is forcibly raped;\n  Severe repeated violence occurs in 1 out of every 14 marriages, with \nan average of 35 incidents before it is reported;\n  Roughly 1 million women are victims of domestic violence each year, \nand battering may be the most common cause of injury to women, more \ncommon than auto accidents, muggings, or rapes by a stranger.\n  According to the FBI, Mr. President, one out of every two women in \nAmerica will be beaten at least once in the course of an intimate \nrelationship. Let me repeat that. According to the FBI, one out of \nevery two women in America will be beaten at least once in the course \nof an intimate relationship.\n  It is estimated that the new hotline, that we have shown and brought \nout to the floor of the Senate as often as we could over the last 2 \nweeks, will receive close to 10,000 calls a day.\n  The first day I came to the floor to talk about the hotline, I shared \na story told to me by my wife, Sheila, while she was speaking in \nsouthern Minnesota 2 days before the hotline opened. I would like to \ntell the story again of a courageous woman in danger whose story \nillustrates how crucial the existence of a national domestic violence \nhotline will be in saving the lives of women and children in danger.\n  This woman had been living in New York with her abusive husband and a \n5-month-old child. Her husband had moved to New York following their \nmarriage, and he kept his wife and child very isolated there. The \nhusband was very controlling and made it impossible for his wife to \nsocialize, to make friends, or have a job. He checked on her all the \ntime to make sure that she was at home with her baby.\n  In addition to beating her routinely and savagely, he took out a life \ninsurance policy on her, so she lived in constant fear of being killed.\n  This woman told my wife, Sheila, that every time she opened the \napartment door, she was sure someone would be on the other side with a \nshotgun.\n  Her husband had a one-time, out-of-town business deal. He left in the \nafternoon and planned on returning the following morning. After he \nleft, she decided that it was her only chance to get away. Panicked and \npressed for time, she called a local hotline number but found it was \ndisconnected. She was devastated. She called the Legal Aid Society in \nNew York City and was initially told that they could not help her.\n  Out of sheer desperation, she persisted with Legal Aid and was \nfinally given a local agency phone number. Calling the local agency, \nthe woman informed them she wanted to return to Minnesota. They were \nable to access a computer and put her in touch with a battered woman's \nshelter in Minnesota in her hometown. She and her baby were on a plane \nthe next morning before her husband got home.\n  Mr. President, this woman was lucky; she was able to obtain the \ninformation she needed. But how much better it would be if that hotline \nhad been up and running to give her the information immediately. \nUnfortunately, some women might not have the whole day to track down \ninformation. I think this shows how crucial a national network, like \nthe hotline, will be for keeping women and children safe, literally \nsaving their lives.\n  So today, I ask everyone listening to honor the memory of Karen \nMitshoff of Alexandria, VA, as well as all the other women who lose \ntheir lives every year at the hands of a husband or a boyfriend or a \npartner.\n  I also ask you to honor all of the women who have been hurt at the \nhands of someone with whom they have had an intimate relationship. \nChances are you already know one of those women --a coworker, a sister, \na mother, a daughter, or a friend.\n  I commend innovations like the national domestic violence hotline. I \nwant to support more creative solutions to stopping this family \nviolence. I want all of us to do that, Democrats and Republicans alike. \nBut most important, today I want to remember Karen Mitshoff who lost \nher life on Monday, and remind everyone that these efforts to stop this \nviolence in our homes must be ongoing.\n  Mr. President, once again, at the end of this 2-week period, I want \nto one more time talk about the hotline number. The toll free number of \nthe national domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE and 1-800-787-\n3224 for the hearing impaired.\n  Everyone has the right to be safe in their own home. Share the number \ntoday, those of you who are watching, and maybe you will help someone \nmake themselves safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Utah, Senator Hatch, is recognized to speak for up to 20 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3177-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3177-S3181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL SELECTION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address a subject that I have \ndiscussed several times in the past few weeks, and that is the issue of \njudicial selection. As I said in those speeches, differences in \njudicial philosophy can have real and profound consequences for the \nsafety of Americans in their neighborhoods, homes, and workplaces. \nSound judging is every bit as much a part of the Federal anticrime \neffort as FBI and DEA agents and prosecutors.\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\n  It does the Nation little good to put more cops on the beat if judges \nput the criminals back on the street. And, I might add, the President \noverstates the number of police that the Federal Government is helping \nput on the street.\n  I see that the President has attempted this week to respond to my \nspeeches through his subordinates. One argument, made by his former \nWhite House counsel, maintains that it is really the home State \nSenators who appoint judges. This argument is just another example of \nthe President attempting to hide from the consequences of his \ndecisions. The last time that I looked in the Constitution, it stated \nthat the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges.'' Presidents may \nlook to individual Senators to recommend good nominees in each State, \nbut the Constitution itself makes clear that the choice of judges is \nthe President's responsibility and the President's alone.\n  I do agree with one thing that Lloyd Cutler said in his Washington \nPost op-ed. It sometimes is difficult to predict what nominees will be \nlike once they ascend to the Federal bench. While the executive branch, \nas Mr. Cutler said, has ``an extensive vetting process,'' we in the \nSenate do not. For the most part, a President's nominees usually are \nconfirmed by the Senate. When the people elect a President, they put \ninto office with him his judicial philosophy and the judges he will \nappoint. But perhaps the Senate does need to spend more resources \nvetting nominees. Perhaps the Senate should interview each and every \njudicial nominee as a matter of routine, if Lloyd Cutler is right.\n  Another argument made by President Clinton's current White House \ncounsel, Jack Quinn, is that there are soft-on-crime decisions by \njudges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush. As I said on Monday, I \ndo not agree with every decision by a Republican-appointed judge or \ndisagree with every decision by a Democrat-appointed judge. Moreover, \nwe all know that prosecutors and police sometimes go over the line, and \nthat it is the job of state and federal judges to correct those \nmistakes. Unfortunately, sometimes those decisions will benefit \ncriminals that we all know to be guilty.\n  But what we are talking about here are not a few isolated cases or \nincidents. We are talking about track records: about the fact that \njudges appointed by Democrat Presidents, and President Clinton in \nparticular, generally will be softer-on-crime and will be more likely \nto follow an activist judicial philosophy than judges appointed by \nRepublican Presidents. Just as President Johnson appointed Judge J. \nSkelly Wright to the D.C. Circuit, a notorious judicial activist, and \nPresident Carter appointed, among many others, Judge Stephan Reinhardt \nof the ninth circuit, a judge who is so activist that the Supreme Court \nregularly overturns his decisions, so has President Clinton appointed \njudges such as Judges Baer and Beaty, Judges Michael and Calabresi, and \nJudges Sarokin and Barkett, whom I will discuss today.\n  The President seems to think that it is wrong to evaluate the \ndecisions of these judges. ``The point is that it is unfair to evaluate \nany judge on the basis of any single case,'' writes his counsel in the \nWall Street Journal. I disagree. It is only by reading the opinions of \nthese judges that we can make a determination of the kinds of men and \nwomen that President Clinton has chosen to send to the Federal bench. \nLet me also be clear that it is not the result of an individual case \nthat is the problem. The problem with these Clinton judges is the way \nthey reach their decisions--their willingness, perhaps even eagerness, \nto stretch the law, to expand criminal rights at the expense of the \ncommunity, to seize on petty technicalities to release defendants, to \nfind new constitutional rights where there were none before. Many of \nthese judges are activists who simply cannot understand that their role \nas is to interpret the law, not to make it.\n\n  But the President's approach--that once a judge is on the bench, and \nyou cannot read his or her opinions--is a convenient one. It is the \nonly way that he can explain his decision to appoint Judge H. Lee \nSarokin to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Judge \nRosemary Barkett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. \nThese were judges with crystal-clear track records of being liberal, \nsoft-on-crime activists, when President Clinton appointed them. These \ntwo judges, who sit on the second most powerful courts in the land, \nhave displayed an undue and excessive sympathy for the criminals who \nare destroying our society and who are all too willing to impose their \nown moral beliefs onto the law and onto our communities.\n  I led the fight to oppose the confirmation of these two judges \nbecause their judicial records indicated that they would be activists \nwho would legislate from the bench. Senators from both sides of the \naisle joined me in that fight. I regret to conclude that we have been \nproven right in our predictions of their activism on the Federal bench.\n  Let us look at what Judge Sarokin has been up to since President \nClinton chose to elevate him in 1994. The Senate confirmed his \nnomination 63-35--a pretty large vote against him--on October 4, 1994. \nI think that it is safe to say that no Republican President would have \nnominated a judge like Judge Sarokin, and that if the Republicans had \ncontrol of the Senate in 1994, Judge Sarokin would never have been \nconfirmed.\n  Let me tell the American people about the cases of William Henry \nFlamer and Billie Bailey, which were heard by the third circuit late \nlast year. Delaware versus Flamer; Delaware versus Bailey. This was a \ncase involving two multiple murders in which Judge Sarokin voted to \noverturn a jury's imposition of the death penalty.\n  In the Flamer case, on a snowy February 7, 1979, at 8:00 a.m. in the \nmorning, Arthur Smith, the 35-year old son of Alberta and Byard Smith, \nwalked across the street to his parents' house in Delaware. He found \nthem sprawled on the living room floor obviously murdered in cold \nblood. Both parents died of multiple stab wounds in the head and neck. \nThe medical examiner counted 79 wounds on Mr. Smith's body and 66 \nwounds on Mrs. Smith's body.\n  Their car was stolen, a television was missing, chairs were \noverturned, bags of frozen food were strewn about, and Mr. Smith's \npockets were turned inside out. The son--can you imagine what it must \nbe like for a son to discover such violence to his parents in their own \nhome--called the police.\n  Eyewitnesses indicated that William Henry Flamer, whose mother was \nMrs. Smith's half-sister, might be the killer. Police went to his \nfamily's residence and found the missing television, frozen food \nsimilar to that strewn about the Smiths' home, and a bayonet with dried \nblood stains on the blade. When police arrested Flamer, they found \nblood on his fingernails and coat and fresh scratches on his neck and \nchest.\n  After he had been read his Miranda rights numerous times and after \nhis arraignment, Flamer confessed. He told police that he and another \nman brought a knife, the bayonet, and a shotgun, and that he had told \nMrs. Smith, his aunt, that his grandmother had experienced a stroke and \nwas missing in order to gain entrance to the Smiths' home.\n  In early 1980, a jury convicted Flamer of two charges of \nintentionally causing the death of another person and two charges of \nfelony murder. A jury then sentenced Flamer to death because of several \naggravating sentencing factors, such as Flamer's prior criminal record, \nthe age of his two victims, the frailty of his aunt Mrs. Smith, and his \nexploitation of his aunt and uncle's trust in order to gain entrance to \ntheir home.\n  Flamer had the opportunity to challenge both his conviction and his \nsentence on direct appeal. The Delaware Supreme Court rejected his \nappeal and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in his case twice. \nFlamer filed for post-conviction relief in State court, but his \npetitions were denied. Nevertheless, Flamer filed a habeas petition in \nFederal district court alleging a number of trial errors. Judge Joseph \nFarman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, who was \nappointed by President Reagan in 1985, dismissed the petition. Flamer \nappealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The third circuit consolidated Flamer's appeal with that of Billie \nBailey, another multiple murderer convicted by the Delaware state \ncourts.\n  Bailey had been assigned to a work release facility in Wilmington, \nbut he\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nescaped and then proceeded to rob a package store at gunpoint. He \nreceived a ride to Lambertson's Corner, 1\\1/2\\ miles away from the \nstore. Bailey then entered the farmhouse of Gilbert Lambertson, who was \n80 years old, and of his wife, Clara Lambertson, who was 73. Bailey \nshot Mr. Lambertson twice in the chest with his pistol and once in the \nhead with the Lambertsons' shotgun. He shot Mrs. Lambertson in the \nshoulder with the pistol and in the abdomen and neck with the shotgun. \nBoth Lambertsons died. Bailey fled from the scene but was spotted by a \npolice helicopter. He shot at the helicopter, but was apprehended.\n  Bailey was convicted of murder and was sentenced by a jury to death. \nThe jury found that two factors--that the defendant's conduct had \nresulted in the deaths of two persons where the deaths were a probable \nconsequence of the defendant's conduct; and that the murders were \noutrageous or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman--and they in turn \nsupported the imposition of death. Bailey appealed, but the Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, and the U.S. \nSupreme Court denied certiorari.\n  Like Flamer, Bailey filed a writ of habeas corpus in Federal district \ncourt, claiming that the jury had considered improper factors when \nimposing the death sentence. Judge Roderick McKelvie, a Bush appointee, \ndenied the writ.\n  On appeal before the entire third circuit sitting en banc, Flamer and \nBailey argued that the imposition of the death penalty was \nunconstitutional because the juries had considered an invalid factor: \nwhether the murders were wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman. It is \ntrue that the Supreme Court had held that such a factor is so vague as \nto be unconstitutional. But in the case of Zant v. Stephens in 1983, \n462 U.S. 862 (1983), the Supreme Court also held that so long as the \njury's capital sentence was also based on other, legitimate \nconsiderations, then the death penalty is not unconstitutional.\n  This, of course, was precisely the case with both Flamer and Bailey. \nIn both situations, the juries had found that other factors, such as \nFlamer's commission of the murder in the course of a robbery, also \njustified the death penalty. As a result, a majority of the third \ncircuit affirmed the convictions.\n  Let me add that no one challenged the finding that either Flamer or \nBailey committed the horrendous murders. No one showed that either jury \nwas biased or had reached the wrong result. Instead, the defendants \nwere using the writ to raise technical objections in the hopes of \ndelaying the rightful execution of the death penalty. It is abuses of \nthe writ such as these that lead the American people to believe that \nsomething is wrong with our courts. It is abuses like these that lead \nthe American people to demand habeas corpus reform.\n  The American people's belief would only be confirmed if they read the \nFlamer and Bailey case, because Judge Sarokin was in dissent. Judge \nSarokin believed that the defendants had received an unfair trial, even \nthough they had both had the opportunity to fully appeal all the way to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. He argued that the judge's instructions and \ninterrogatories asking the jury what factors they relied upon in \nreaching their decision had ``shifted the neutral balance contemplated \nunder the statute and with it, the scales of justice as well.''\n  According to Judge Sarokin, State judges cannot ask juries why they \nimposed the death penalty, even though judges do this to ensure that \nthe juries were unbiased. In Judge Sarokin's mind, for judges to ask \njurors this commonsense question renders the whole process \nunconstitutional.\n  The eighth amendment says only that ``Excessive bail shall not be \nrequired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments \ninflicted.''\n  Further, Judge Sarokin argued that allowing juries to consider the \ninvalid vile, horrible, and inhuman factor--and who can doubt that \nthese murders were utterly heinous--so infected the juries' \nconsiderations as to render them unconstitutional. He reached this \nconclusion despite the Supreme Court's clear holding in Zant that \nconsideration of one invalid factor does not make the whole decision \nunconstitutional.\n  By a 10 to 4 vote, the majority on the court reached the right \nresult, because the Constitution guarantees a fair trial, not a perfect \none. Allowing defendants to win reversals on technicalities even when \nno one disputes that the defendant is guilty and deserves the death \npenalty would truly undermine the public's faith in our criminal \njustice system. As the Supreme Court has said many times, and as the \nmajority recognized in Flamer, a harmless error does not render a trial \nunconstitutional, and there was no showing in this case that any error \nhad influenced the jury's verdict or caused the defendant's any \nprejudice.\n  If one needed any more confirmation that Judge Sarokin was wrong, one \nneed only look to the epilogue of the Flamer and Bailey story. Both \ndefendants appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court again. The Court \nrefused to grant certiorari in either the Bailey or the Flamer cases, \nand the Court refused to stay their executions. Both men were executed \nin late January 1996. Certainly the U.S. Supreme Court thought little \nof Judge Sarokin's dissent. Unlike Judge Sarokin, the Justices of the \nSupreme Court thought enough was enough and that it was time to allow \nthe State of Delaware to operate its own criminal justice system.\n  But Judge Sarokin was willing to overturn the considered judgments of \nthe juries, of the Delaware Supreme Court, of the U.S. Supreme Court, \nof two Federal district court judges, and of the majority of his \ncolleagues, because the jury did not think about the death penalty the \nway he wanted them to, and because the judge asked the jury a \nquestion. Judge Sarokin believes that Federal judges have a roving \nmandate to interfere in the operation of the State criminal justice \nsystem, just because he found a technicality that no one showed had any \ninfluence on the outcome of the trial.\n\n  Judge Sarokin suffers from the same problem that Judges Beaty and \nBaer do--an inability to understand their role as judges. They have not \nbeen appointed as Federal judges to legislate from their benches or to \nact as philosopher-kings. If Judge Sarokin does not like the way that \nDelaware has chosen to operate its criminal justice system, then he \nshould be running for Governor of the State--but the last place he \nshould be imposing his policy views is from the Federal bench.\n  Of course, as I said earlier, judicial activism of this sort is not \nrestricted solely to judges appointed by Democratic Presidents. In the \nFlamer case, Judge Timothy Lewis, who was appointed in the waning days \nof the Bush administration, also argued that the capital sentences \nshould be overturned. Judge Lewis agreed with Judge Sarokin that the \nconsideration of the invalid factor had an injurious effect on the \ndefendant, even though no such influence on the verdict was shown, and \nthat the judge's interrogatories prejudiced the jury. Judge Lewis also \nquestioned why, quoting Justice Blackmun, ``We should no longer tinker \nwith the machinery of death.'' He called the Nation's system of capital \npunishment cluttered and confusing and ultimately questioned whether it \ncomported with fundamental principles of liberty and due process.\n  While one Reagan judge, Judge Carol Mansmann, also joined Judge \nLewis, it should be noted that the rest of the Reagan-Bush appointees, \njoined by one Carter judge, correctly upheld the imposition of the \ndeath penalty. The two judges appointed by President Clinton--Judges \nSarokin and McKee--did not. I believe that Judges Lewis and Mansmann \nwere wrong, just as Judge Sarokin was wrong. But I believe that their \nmistake is not representative of a pattern and practice of activism, as \nit is on the part of Judge Sarokin.\n  If there can be any more doubt about the activist character of Judge \nSarokin, one can find proof in his other opinions. Although I do not \nhave the time to discuss other decisions in detail, I would just note \nthe case of United States v. Baird [63 F.3d 1213 (CA3 1995)].\n  In Baird, Judge Sarokin, dissenting, argued that administrative \nforfeiture of drug proceeds preclude criminals from being prosecuted \nunder the double jeopardy clause. That case involved the seizure of a \ncriminal's drug factory, drug stockpiles, and ill-gotten drug proceeds, \nin the amount of $2,582. The\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration carried out an administrative \nforfeiture of the drug proceeds.\n  Following the DEA's administrative forfeiture, Baird was then \nindicted for a variety of Federal drug and drug-related crimes. For \nJudge Sarokin, the administrative forfeiture was enough to opine that \nif Baird, the drug-producer, had owned the money, then the first \nproceeding was enough to bar the Government from prosecuting him for \nthe drug crimes.\n  Judge Sarokin relied on a Supreme Court case, Austin versus United \nStates, that did not even apply to the double jeopardy context. Judge \nSarokin showed a willingness to stretch Supreme Court precedent beyond \nits proper bounds and to read the double jeopardy clause expansively at \nthe expense of law enforcement, and to the benefit of illegal \ndrugmakers and dealers. Incidentally, Baird never even claimed \nownership of the money, making Judge Sarokin's result all the more \nstrange.\n  In Judge Sarokin's strange universe, if the Government convicts a \ncriminal of drug selling, it cannot require the criminal to forfeit the \nmoney made through his illegal activity; but if the Government first \ntries to forfeit the proceeds, then it cannot prosecute the drug \nseller. Again, Judge Sarokin has shown a willingness to interpret the \nConstitution expansively to defeat society's legitimate interest in \ncombating crime and maintaining public health and safety.\n  Judge Sarokin, who I understand will soon be taking senior status, is \nperhaps second only to Judge Barkett in his continuation of an \nactivist, soft-on-crime approach upon reaching the Federal bench. In \n1994, by a vote of 61 to 37, the Senate confirmed Judge Barkett--a \nnominee that no Republican would have appointed to the Federal bench. I \nopposed her nomination because, time and again, Judge Barkett as a \nmember of the Florida Supreme Court erroneously had favored lawbreakers \nand criminals over the interests of the police and of the community to \nenforce the law. The full record of my concerns is set forth in the \nMarch 22, 1994, Congressional Record. As I declared there, there were \njust too many cases, across too wide a range of subjects, where Judge \nBarkett had stepped beyond the line of responsible judging.\n  In particular, I warned that Judge Barkett should not be confirmed \nbecause of her unduly restrictive view of the fourth amendment that \nwould hamstring the police, especially with regard to controlling \ndrugs. I highlighted the case of Bostick versus State, a case involving \ncocaine trafficking, in which Judge Barkett adopted an across-the-board \nper se ban on bus passenger searches, even though Supreme Court \nprecedent clearly called for an analysis of the search based on the \nparticular circumstances present. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates had to grant certiorari and reverse Judge Barkett's soft on \ncrime decision.\n  I am sorry to say that Judge Barkett's misunderstanding of search and \nseizure law has only continued. Only now, thanks to President Clinton, \nher opinions apply to all prosecutions brought in Georgia and in \nAlabama as well as in Florida. Her ongoing willingness to raise \ngroundless fourth amendment arguments to prevent our Nation from \ncombating the damage that drugs are causing our society is evident in \ntwo recent opinions, Merrett versus Moore [Feb. 26, 1996], in which \nJudge Barkett dissented from denial of en banc review, and in Chandler \nversus Miller, [73 F.3d 1543 (CA11 1996)], in which Judge Barkett again \ndissented.\n  In Merrett, Florida law enforcement officials and the Florida Highway \nPatrol set up roadblocks on four Florida highways for the chief purpose \nof locating illegal drugs. On two successive days from 4 p.m. to 10 \np.m., Florida police briefly stopped vehicles, checked for obvious \nsafety defects, and examined drivers' licenses and vehicle \nregistrations. While this examination was undertaken, the police used \ndogs to sniff the outside of each car for illegal drugs. If a dog \nalerted to the presence of drugs, the car was pulled out of line. As \nJudge Edmonson, a Reagan appointee, noted for the majority, these \nsearches were minimal and the entire encounter between police and the \nmotorist lasted only a few minutes. Police also moved traffic through \nwithout stopping cars when long backups developed.\n  Of the 2,100 vehicles that passed through the checkpoints and of the \n1,300 vehicles stopped, there were few long delays, one car overheated, \none minor accident occurred, the dogs scratched a few cars, and one \nperson was bitten by a dog. Judge Edmonson, joined by Judge Birch, a \nBush appointee, and Judge Hill, a senior judge appointed by President \nFord, properly held that the roadblocks were reasonable under the \nfourth amendment's search and seizure clause. The intrusion of the \nsearch was minimal and was far outweighed by the State's interest in \nenforcing its traffic laws and in preventing the flow of drugs into our \nNation. Indeed, recognizing these facts, the Supreme Court has approved \nreasonable roadblock searches before for the purpose of checking \nsobriety, [see Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz [496 U.S. \n444 (1990)], and for border patrols [see United States v. Martinez-\nFuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976)].\n  But the persuasive reasoning of Judge Edmonson and his colleagues, \nthe decisions of the Supreme Court, and the need to stem the flow of \ndestructive drugs into our society were not enough for Judge Barkett. \nJudge Barkett voted to grant review of the decision before the entire \neleventh circuit, and she wrote a dissent joined by Judges Kravitch and \nHatchett, both Carter appointees, when she lost. Fortunately, the six \nReagan-Bush appointees, the one Ford appointee, and one Carter \nappointee voted to keep Judge Edmonson's ruling in place.\n  Continuing her unduly restrictive view of the fourth amendment's \napplication to drug searches, Judge Barkett declared:\n\n       In my view, permitting law enforcement to stop every \n     vehicle at a roadblock based on the mere possibility that one \n     or more of the vehicles passing through will contain illegal \n     drugs--evidence of a crime completely unrelated to highway \n     safety--is * * * intolerable and unreasonable.\n\n  I would have thought that drug use would be a great threat to highway \nsafety, and as I have noted, the Supreme Court has already held that \nsobriety checkpoints--alcohol is, after all, a drug--are \nconstitutional.\n  Judge Barkett and her dissenting colleagues also should examine the \ntext of the fourth amendment, which she never even quoted in her \nopinion. The fourth amendment states that ``The right of the people to \nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.'' Unlike the \njudges in the majority, Judge Barkett never asked whether the roadblock \nsearches were reasonable. Instead, she sought vainly to say that using \nroadblocks to search for drugs was patently illegal. But most judges of \nthe courts of appeals, most Justices of the Supreme Court, and, I \nthink, most of the American people, would agree that the minimal search \ninvolved here--a stop for a few minutes combined with a sniff by a \ndog--is certainly reasonable, especially when balanced against the need \nto combat the influx of destructive drugs in our society.\n  Judge Barkett also continues to remain suspicious of the efforts of \npolice to defend our communities against crime and against drugs. In \nMerrett, she declared that she believed that Florida's claim that the \nroadblock was also used to check for traffic violations was only a \npretext for an illegal search for drugs. In Judge Barkett's mind, this \nraised the fundamental concern that officers will attempt to evade the \nrequirements of the fourth amendment by using a traffic stop to detain \nsomeone for a purpose that would not lawfully support a detention.\n  I believe that our police officers are good people who are laying \ntheir lives on the line to protect our lives, our families, and our \ncommunities. Like Judge Baer, Judge Barkett sees our law enforcement \nofficers as using any pretext they can to conduct illegal searches. I \nsee them asking for a minimal amount of time to ensure that drugs are \nnot being transported for distribution to our children and to our poor. \nJudges like Judge Barkett and Judge Baer are all too willing to place \nlegal technicalities as obstacles before our law enforcement officers, \nwho are only trying to take criminals off of the street.\n  Furthermore, as the majority in the original case noted, and as the \nSupreme Court has made clear before, roadblocks are often more \nrespective of\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\nfourth amendment values because they are random. They do not rely upon \nthe discretion of the police officer to choose whom to stop and \nsearch--all are treated the same. Roadblocks, in the Supreme Court's \nwords, avoid the standardless and unconstrained discretion present in \nindividual stops. [Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 661 (1979).]\n  I presume that Judge Barkett also would find fault with the metal \ndetectors at airports and government buildings, or stops at the border, \nor customs searches, because even though they are all minimal \nintrusions into an individual's privacy, they subject everyone to a \nsearch without a warrant. Fortunately, Judge Barkett's feelings on this \npoint conflict with Supreme Court precedent, and even though Judge \nBarkett seems to have always had trouble following the precedent of the \nSupreme Court, most other Federal judges do not, including the \nRepublican-appointed judges on the eleventh circuit.\n  Merrett is not the only case in which Judge Barkett has been willing \nto place obstacles before our Nation's war on drugs, a war in which the \nadministration has been AWOL--absent without leadership. In Chandler \nversus Miller, a January 1996 case, Judge Barkett again dissented in a \ncase involving drugs and search and seizure. Georgia passed a statute \nrequiring drug testing of political candidates and nominees for State \noffices. In cases such as National Treasury Employees v. Von Raab [489 \nU.S. 656 (1989)], Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Association [489 \nU.S. 602 (1989)], and last Term's Vernonia School District v. Acton \n[115 S.Ct. 2386 (1995)], the Supreme Court has declared that courts \nmust balance the individual's privacy expectations against the \nGovernment's special interests in preventing drug use in that area.\n  In these cases, the Supreme Court has upheld drug testing of drug \nagents, of railway workers, and of high school athletes. For Judge \nBarkett, however, these were all narrow exceptions to a general rule in \nher own mind that no one should be subject to drug testing, including \ncandidates for high public office. In her mind, controlling drug use \namong the highest public officials involves no immediate or direct \nthreat to public safety, and that there is no showing that waiting to \nobtain a warrant based on individualized suspicion would cause any dire \nconsequences. In Judge Barkett's words, ``[t]here is nothing so special \nor immediate about the generalized governmental interests involved here \nto as to warrant suspension'' of the warrant requirement.\n  But as the majority correctly held, the Government's interest in \npreventing drug use among its highest public officials is a powerful \none. In the majority's words, the people of a State place their most \nvaluable possessions, their liberty, their safety, the economic well-\nbeing, ultimate responsibility for law enforcement, in the hands of \ntheir elected and appointed officials, and the nature of high public \noffice demands the highest levels of honesty, clear-sightedness, and \nclear-thinking. We permit drug testing of drug agents; we permit drug \ntesting of railroad engineers; we even permit drug testing of high \nschool athletes. Judge Barkett would have us believe that the damage \nthat would be caused by drug use in these situations is far greater \nthan that caused by drug use by legislators, by executive branch \nofficials, and by judges. Judge Barkett's reasoning strikes me as \nunreasonable, and her efforts again appear designed to restrict the \ntools that our society can use to combat drug use, even in the face of \ncontrary Supreme Court precedent.\n  Perhaps Judge Barkett's position on the fourth amendment in Chandler \nwas a reasonable one. But no one can claim that her further statements \nin that case had any grounding in Federal constitutional or statutory \nlaw. Not only did Judge Barkett argue that the Georgia statute was an \nillegal search, she also argued that it was a violation of the \ncandidates' first amendment rights.\n  I am not making this up.\n  If you don't believe me, Mr. President, listen to her own words. \n``This statute is neither neutral nor procedural, but, * * * attempts \nto ensure that only candidates with a certain point of view qualify for \npublic office.'' Judge Barkett interprets the drug testing requirement \nas an attempt to ``ban[] from positions of political power not only \nthose candidates who might disagree with the current policy \ncriminalizing drug use, but also those who challenge the intrusive \ngovernmental means to detect such use among its citizenry.''\n  Such reasoning reeks of the very worst of the moral relativism that \ncharacterizes liberal judicial activism. Judge Barkett appears to \nbelieve that if one is in favor of drug legalization or against drug \ntesting, why, one must be a drug user. In fact, Judge Barkett appears \nto believe that drug use is an ideology and that drug testing is, in \nher words, ``a content-based restriction on free expression.'' If that \nis so, then does Judge Barkett believe that any effort to prevent drug \nuse is an attempt to suppress the first amendment rights of drug users, \nand that drug use itself is a form of expression?\n  Mr. President, this is the 1990's, not the 1960's; America has not \nbeen transformed into a Woodstock from sea to shining sea. The first \namendment does not protect illegal, harmful conduct, and it does not \npermit people to plan and encourage illegal conduct. Although this \nadministration has been absent without leadership in the drug area, the \nAmerican people and the Congress are not. We are determined to prevent \ndrugs from ruining the lives of our young people, and the tolerant \nattitude of some of the Clinton administration's nominees, who equate \ndrug use with protected first amendment expression, will not stand in \nour way.\n  Why is this so important? As a practical matter, the Senate gives \neach president deference in confirming judicial candidates. A \nRepublican President would not nominate the same judges that a Democrat \nwould, and vice versa. The President has been elected by the whole \ncountry and, while this President has been unable to put all of his \nchoices on the bench, there are hundreds of judgeships to fill in order \nto keep the justice system functioning.\n  Indicia of judicial activism or a soft-on-crime outlook are not \nalways present in a nominee's record. But, in the cases of Judge \nSarokin and Barkett, there were crystal clear signs of their activist \nmindsets. Yet the President appointed these two judges and pushed hard \nsuccessfully to get them through the Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate, despite opposition, largely on this side of the aisle.\n  We can now view the products of the President's choices. We do not \njust have two trial judges, Judges Baer and Beaty, who have trouble \nunderstanding the role of the Federal courts in law enforcement and in \nthe war on crime. We now can see that President Clinton has sent \nliberal activists to the Federal appellate courts, where their \ndecisions bind millions of Americans.\n  Judge Sarokin's opinions, if they garner a majority, are the law in \nPennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Judge Barkett's opinions, if \nthey garner a majority, are the law in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. \nCriminals whom they would set free on technicalities can strike again, \nanywhere, anytime. This makes all Americans potential victims of these \njudges and their soft-on-crime outlook.\n  The general judicial philosophy of nominees to the Federal bench \nreflects the judicial philosophy of the person occupying the Oval \nOffice. We, in Congress, have sought to restore and strengthen our \nNation's war on crime and on drugs and to guarantee the safety of \nAmericans in their streets, homes, and workplaces.

Mr. President, last night we had several hours of \ndebate and that debate was around the issue of the Foreign Relations \nRevitalization Act relating to Taiwan. As we addressed the disposition \nof the conference report, this particular portion received a good deal \nof scrutiny. There were a lot of words spoken, a lot of technical \ninterpretations. What I am going to do today is simplify that debate by \nreferring to the Taiwan Relations Act as the law of the land. I will \nalso give a brief explanation of the section that was the subject of \nthe debate, but I will use the actual factual language, as well as \ndefinitions, not just personal interpretations.\n  I was surprised by the debate surrounding one provision in \nparticular, and that was section 1601, which states that sections 3(a) \nand 3(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act supersede any provision of the \n1982 joint communique between the United States and China.\n  I was surprised by the debate because, obviously, a number of people \nseem to be cloudy on just what ``supersede'' means. Allow me to clear \nup any misconceptions of that term. The Oxford dictionary refers to the \nterm ``supersede'' specifically as ``overrides, takes precedence \nover.'' That definition seems pretty clear to me, Mr. President.\n  The administration indicated it is going to veto the entire \nconference report, in part because of opposition to section 1601, even \nthough that section only restates reality.\n  In order to enlighten some of my colleagues on this issue, I have a \nchart here. I would like to refer to the chart. This is April 10, 1979, \nsection 3(a):\n\n       . . . [T]he United States will make available to Taiwan \n     such defense articles and defense services in such quantity \n     as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient \n     self-defense capability.''\n\n  Section 3(b):\n\n       The President and the Congress shall determine the nature \n     and quantity of such defense articles and defense services \n     based solely upon their judgments of the needs of Taiwan. . . \n     .\n\n  It could not be any clearer, ``solely on their judgments of the needs \nof Taiwan.'' That is to say, the President and the Congress shall \ndetermine the nature, quantity of such defense articles, et cetera. It \nis crystal clear. The issue is the interpretation of the United States-\nChina joint communique. The previous reference was the law of the land. \nThis is a communique. In the communique, August 17, 1982, the \nadministration pledged, ``to reduce gradually its sales of arms to \nTaiwan, leading over a period of time to a final resolution.'' \nParagraph 6.\n  This pledge to reduce arms sales over time, for those of us who have \nlabored in this vineyard and those in the defense community, we \nrecognize this as the ``bucket,'' so to speak; that is, after the \nexecutive branch implemented the pledge by decreasing the amount of \ndefensive goods and services that would be sold to Taiwan. That is \nreadily understood. That was the specific intent.\n  This is the communique, the other is the law of the land. But you can \nsee the difference. Congress, and the President, clearly have the \nauthority under the law of the land to designate and determine the \nnature and quantity of defensive arms provided to Taiwan.\n  Yesterday in the debate, several of my colleagues claimed that \nsection 1601 nullified the entire basis of United States-China policy.\n  This simply is not true, Mr. President. I should know, this was my \nlegislation. I know what the legislative intent was. As the original \nauthor of this legislation, I know the intent of the legislation is \nsimply to reassert the legal primacy of the Taiwan Relations Act as \npublic law over a statement of policy, such as the joint communique.\n  It is this intent that so many of my colleagues on the other side, \nand evidently the State Department, are missing. It reasserts the legal \nprimacy of the Taiwan Relations Act as public law over a statement of \npolicy, such as the joint communique, if the two are in conflict. That \nputs the burden on the President and the Congress where it belongs.\n  For example, if the threat to Taiwan is increasing, defensive arms \nsales may need to go up, and this should not be arbitrarily limited by \nthe bucket. It has not been in the past. The bucket is whether it is \ninside or outside, and we have seen sales outside. Prior \nadministrations have followed the principle and practice, such as \nPresident Bush's decision to sell the F-16's to Taiwan, even though \nthey were outside the dollar limits and, therefore, outside that \nbucket. It is referred to, basically, as decreasing in the amount of \ncollective arms sales to Taiwan.\n  The point I want to make today is, more important, that Secretary \nChristopher, in a letter dated April 22, 1994, to me assured me that \nthis administration's position is as previous administrations; the \nTaiwan Relations Act as public law takes legal precedent over the 1982 \nJoint United States-China Communique. That is the issue, does it take \nlegal precedent or does it not? The Secretary of State said it did.\n  Let me make one more distinction, Mr. President. That communique I \nreferred to, has never been ratified by Congress. The Taiwan Relations \nAct is the law of the land.\n  In referring to this letter of April 26, 1994, the Secretary provided \nthat letter and asked me not to release it for the Record. I am going \nto honor that commitment.\n  But now the administration seems to say it is ready to veto the \nentire conference report, and one of the reasons, in part, is because \nof a provision that simply acknowledges their prior position. If they \nare going to veto it, that is their own business, but let us be up \nfront about the veto, if other rationale is the driving force.\n  Why is this being selected? I do not know. Has the administration \nbeen pressured to change some of its positions? I am sending a letter \nto Secretary Christopher today asking him to clarify his position: Does \nthe administration stand by the April 22, 1994, letter or not? If not, \nthen why not? It is my hope to share that answer with my colleagues.\n  This is important, because many on the other side are very \nuncomfortable now as they recognize what the law of the land says and \nthe fact the law of the land supersedes the communique if the two are \nin conflict. Very few people seem to have picked up on that difference \nand it's significance.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked why this provision was necessary and \nif it was. My response is simply this: it sets legal precedent. This is \na reason I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nappreciate. Sometimes it is necessary to remind the executive branch \nthat the Executive policies cannot ignore the law of the land, and that \nis where we are today. The Taiwan Relations Act is the law of the land.\n  So, Mr. President, this administration cannot ignore Taiwan's \ndefensive needs nor the role of Congress in determining these needs, \neven if some in China demand it. That is what this legislation is \nreally all about.\n  Some of my friends in this body may imply that this language somehow \nsuggests that former President Reagan was wrong when he signed the \ncommunique. That is certainly not my interpretation, nor my my \nintention. But the reality is, this is 1996, not 1982, and this \nlanguage dictates that if the threat to Taiwan is greater now than in \n1982, arms sales may go up accordingly.\n  So that is where we are, Mr. President. I hope that sheds some light \non the debate over this language. I simply stated what was actually \nwritten, and hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nrecognize this.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3182-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3182-S3183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to make reference, in my \nremaining time, to some facts on the budget.\n  It is rather curious, but in the last 13 months, President Clinton \nhas sent up\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\nto the Congress nine separate budget bills. We have one now, like the \nothers, containing, in my opinion, some fairy-tale numbers, some rosy \nscenarios. They propose economics and delays into the next century when \nthe spending cuts are actually going to take place, when it will be \nreduced.\n  Mr. President, 60 percent of the President's spending cuts are in the \nyears 2001 and 2002 when we know, regardless of what happens this year, \nPresident Clinton will not be in office.\n  Spending will increase 25 percent from $1.5 trillion this year to \n$1.9 trillion in the year 2002. Spending will increase 25 percent, and \nthe national debt will rise by more than one-third, from $4.9 to $6.5 \ntrillion.\n  Think about that, Mr. President. From $4.9 trillion to $6.5 trillion \nwe are increasing the debt. That is like increasing the balance on your \ncredit card or increasing the overdraft, if your bank holds such an \noverdraft.\n  Although the deficit drops to $158 billion this year under the \nPresident's proposed reelection budget, the deficit goes up to $164 \nbillion next year. This is our annual deficit. This means every year we \nare spending more than we are generating in revenue. We will spend $164 \nbillion more than we generate in revenue, yet we mandate the American \npublic balance their checking accounts. The Federal Government goes \nthrough a budget process. Everything it needs, beyond what it generates \nin revenues, it gets by adding to the deficit to the tune now of \nincreasing it from $4.9 trillion--that is the total accumulated debt \nthat has arisen as a consequence of the debts each year--we are going \nto increase that up to $6.5 trillion.\n  I spent a little bit of time in the banking business before I got in \nthe business of being a Senator from the State of Alaska. Interest \ncosts are, I think, one of the most interesting and underrated \nconsiderations in this process, certainly among the more deceptive \nelements of the President's budget.\n\n  This year we are going to spend 14 cents of every $1 of Federal \nspending on our $235 billion interest bill--14 cents out of every $1 of \nFederal spending. That costs us $235 billion. Next year the interest \ncosts are going to rise to $238 billion. That is about 14.5 percent of \nthe budget.\n  Interest is like having a horse that eats while you sleep. It \ncontinues throughout the night eventually eating faster than you can \nfeed it. Interest does not employ anybody, does not provide any new \njobs, and does not pay any taxes in that sense. It has to be addressed \nif you have debt. The United States has debt.\n  There is a rather curious process going on here. I will try and wind \nthis up because I see my friend from Tennessee is on the floor as well. \nBut the administration says that by the year 2002, interest costs are \nonly going to be 12 percent of the budget and interest spending will be \ndown to $223 billion. How is it possible for debt service costs to go \ndown while the debt goes up from $4.9 trillion to $6.5 trillion? Is it \nlower interest costs? The President assumes flat interest rates at 5 to \n10 percent on 10-year notes. So that is not it.\n  As I said, I used to be a banker. It does not take a rocket scientist \nto figure out that if the size of your debt rises by a third and \ninterest rates are flat, the amount of interest you are going to pay \nhas to go up.\n  Why does that not happen under President Clinton? I wonder if we have \nrejected some of the principles of mathematics. The answer, Mr. \nPresident, is hidden in the back of the President's budget. I think \nthis deserves the light of day. During the next several years, trust \nfund surpluses, especially the surpluses in the Social Security trust \nfund, rise by nearly $1 trillion. For every $1 of surplus, the Federal \nGovernment issues a special debt note--a debt note--to the trust fund \nthat is not counted as interest under our budget rules. I would ask the \nChair why. I am sure the Chair would have the same difficulty in \nexplaining it.\n  But for every $1 of that Social Security trust fund, which is going \nto be somewhere in the area of $1 trillion, for every $1 of surplus, \nthe Federal Government issues a special debt note to the trust fund \nthat is not counted as interest under our budget rules. That is $1 \ntrillion of debt service not counted in the President's budget.\n  If you counted the interest we will pay the trust fund on the $1 \ntrillion in new debt we owe the trust fund, as a consequence of that, \ngoing into the interest formula, the real interest figure would look \nmore like $350 billion as interest on the debt in the year 2002 instead \nof $225 billion, which is what the administration would have us \nbasically accept or believe in this proposal.\n  My point is, Mr. President, the administration projects the interest \nat 14.5 percent, or 14.5 cents on the dollar, when in reality it is 18 \npercent as a consequence of borrowing from the trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I will attempt to pursue this after the recess with \nsome charts that I think will more visually show just what is going on \nhere. The American public better be concerned because, as we look at \ngreater portions of our total budget going for interest on the debt, we \nrecognize we are going to have less for social needs and other \npriorities in our country.\n  This must come to a halt. It could only come to a halt by adopting a \nbalanced budget. We still have not been able to convince the White \nHouse of the realism of a real balanced budget that will actually cut \nspending.\n  I thank the Chair and wish the Chair a good day.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3182-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3183-S3184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORGAN DONOR AWARENESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to an issue \nthat is literally an issue of life and death. Mr. President, any one of \nthe Senators here today or any member of our families, whether through \naccident or misfortune, could find ourselves needing a life-saving \norgan transplant operation tomorrow. If that should happen, we would be \nplaced on a waiting list to join about 43,000 other Americans who right \nnow, this very second, are waiting their turn--or their death if they \nnever get that turn.\n\n  Since 1990, the number of people diagnosed as needing an organ \ntransplant has doubled. Today, every 18 minutes a new name is added to \nthis list of people waiting. By the end of this year, the list of \npeople waiting for a transplant will be over 50,000 people long. But \nthose are just the people that we know about, people who are lucky \nenough to have made it into the medical system, who have jumped through \nthe financial hurdles of diagnosis and have been recommended to a \ntransplant center.\n  The real numbers are even more staggering: Approximately 100,000 \npeople--100,000 people--need an organ transplant this very year. Yet, \nonly a small fraction of that 100,000 people will receive a transplant \nto live or to have a better quality of life.\n  In fact, every day eight people die because a donor, an organ donor, \ndoes not become available. We have 100,000 people that could benefit \nfrom transplantation, yet only one in five, about 20,000, will actually \nreceive a transplant.\n  Why? Is it because donors must be a certain age or race or blood type \nor physical condition? Is it because of outdated State laws or Federal \nregulations? Or is it because it is difficult to qualify or to \ndesignate one's organs for donation? The answer to all three of those \nquestions is no.\n  The reason can be summed up in four simple words: lack of public \nawareness. There are no limits for organ donation for any of the \nreasons I just mentioned. Every person is potentially a donor. Even \nthose under the age of 18 can sign up with a parent's permission. Yet, \ntragically, there are only about 5,000 actual donors every year. \nExperts estimate that organ donation could be increased by 80 percent \nsimply through better public education and awareness.\n  I began my training to become a heart and lung transplant surgeon 22 \nyears ago. At that time, I could only dream of the science and the \ntechnology and the medical know-how that today is routinely used to \nsave people's lives through transplantation or to give people a better \nquality of life. It is no longer an experimental procedure, but a life-\nsaving, life-improving medical operation that is performed routinely in \ncenters all over this country. Yet, today, for people who need a heart \ntransplant, about one out of four die needlessly, senselessly because \nan organ donor is not available.\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\n  Now I am a U.S. Senator, now in a position to change and help people \nsave lives through public awareness; and that is my goal, to bring \npublic awareness in line with the advances in medical science and \ntechnology that we have today.\n  Together with my colleagues, Senator Simon, Senator DeWine, and \nSenator Levin, we have just launched a drive to focus congressional \nattention on organ transplantation and to encourage every Member of \nCongress to consider signing up as an organ donor. We ask them to do \nthree things: First, learn the benefits of transplantation; second, \nconsider signing an organ donor card; and third, and probably most \nimportantly, discuss their decision with their next of kin and loved \nones.\n  So far, more than a third of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate have \ndone so, and more are adding their names to this list every day. On the \nHouse side, Congressman Joe Moakley of Massachusetts is urging his \ncolleagues to do the same. We must continue to do this because just as \nour list is growing, so too is that list of children and men and women \nwho are waiting for that transplant procedure.\n  I want to urge today every one of my Senate colleagues and every \nMember of the House to perform that heroic, life-saving act, which is \nselfless, unselfish, and sign an organ donor card to give others a new \nchance at life. Our goal is 100 percent congressional participation.\n  The week of April 21 through the 27th is National Organ and Tissue \nDonor Awareness Week.\n  That is one month from now. On Tuesday of that week we will be having \nhearings in the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \ndedicated to this issue of public awareness surrounding organ donation, \ntissue donation, and transplant patients. We can start right here by \nrecognizing that public policy--and we, as legislators--can only do so \nmuch. The problem is the shortage of organs. The solution is public \nawareness. Doing our part, here today, and over the coming months to \nraise public awareness will go a long way in helping us achieve our \npolicy goals, as well.\n  The 104th Congress has been unparalleled in the amount of attention \nthat we have been able to focus on the important issues now before our \nNation. This is one of them. We have the opportunity to give the most \nimportant service you will ever give to fellow Americans. Be a hero. \nJoin the fight, and save a life.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3183-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3184-S3185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, over the last 30 years, we have \ngreatly improved the environment in the United States. Our air and \nwater in this country is the cleanest it has been in 40 years. Now we \nare at a crossroads in environmental policy. We can preserve all of the \nenvironmental gains of the past three decades and move forward to \nassure our children a safer, cleaner, and healthier environment. But we \nwill not be able to do it under the old top-down, command and control \nsolutions from Washington, DC.\n  This approach is outdated and counterproductive. Rather than \nadvancing our important environmental goals, the Washington bureaucracy \nand its extremist allies are actually harming the environment. Timber \ngrowers have been known to cut trees on the basis of even a rumor that \ntheir property might have an endangered species to be listed. Why? In \norder to avoid having Washington bureaucrats tell them they cannot cut \ndown a tree that they have spent their lifetime harvesting.\n  In central Texas, the Fish and Wildlife Service originally suggested \nsetting aside an area the size of the State of Rhode Island to protect \nthe golden-cheeked warbler. In order to do that, they told the property \nowners they could not cut cedar trees. Now, cedar trees have another \nharmful impact on the people who must have water for our cultivation of \nlands and to drink, because cedar trees absorb water to a greater \nextent than most other trees. If you do not cut cedar trees, which our \nfarmers and ranchers are trying to do as much as they can, the water \nsupply dries up, and it affects the water supply of the city of San \nAntonio and affects the ability of farmers and ranchers to use their \nland. The size of the area is a ridiculous amount--the size of the \nState of Rhode Island for one bird, when we could have set aside a \nreasonable number of acres for its preservation.\n  In the Texas Panhandle, protecting a bait fish called the Arkansas \nriver shiner may keep both the agricultural producers and municipal \nutilities from being able to have access to an adequate supply of \nwater, even though there is a thriving population of the Arkansas river \nshiner in the State of New Mexico. Now, many of my constituents are a \nlittle fed up with a Government that gives snakes and salamanders \npriority over human beings and constitutional rights.\n  The Endangered Species Act has worked well as a means of focusing \nattention on the need to preserve plants and animals from extinction. \nThere have been many successes for high-profile species, but the \nheavyhanded means that are being employed to preserve hundreds of \nsubspecies are increasingly counterproductive. If we cannot rely on the \nsupport and cooperation of the people who live with the animals that we \nwant to save, I think those animals chances of survival are not very \ngood. That is why I am making a priority of reforming the Endangered \nSpecies Act. We need to forge a new consensus about saving endangered \nspecies and making private property owners stakeholders, not \nadversaries in the process.\n  The Superfund was created to identify and clean up hundreds of \nhazardous waste sites around the country, but the regulations written \nin Washington to govern cleanup are so complicated and cumbersome that \nalmost no cleanup is getting done. Only 291, or about 25 percent, of \nthe 1,238 worst hazardous waste sites have actually been cleaned up.\n\n  Where is the money going? Billions of dollars have gone into this. \nThe money has gone to lawyers, consultants, and bureaucrats in \nWashington. That is where the money has gone that should have been \ngoing to clean up these hazardous waste sites. Companies contributing \nto the cleanup have spent 39 percent of their money on lawyers, 20 \npercent on negotiations, 9 percent on studies, and 15 percent on \ncleanup.\n  It is not just business that is being sued. The Catholic Archdiocese \nof Newark has been sued for a landfill in New Jersey. The archdiocese \npurchased land to expand its Holy Name Cemetery and inadvertently \nbecame potentially responsible for its cleanup. One landfill site in \nNew York has 600 defendants, including an Elks Club, an exercise gym, \ntwo nursing homes and a kennel, which has a septic tank that needs to \nbe cleaned.\n  Something must be done. We must put the money where it will benefit \nthe public and the environment. This waste will go on and on unless we \nreopen the Superfund law and put some common sense back into it. \nHazardous waste sites are local problems. We want to have a voice at \nthe local level to be sure that the waste site in a town is cleaned up \nand made safe.\n  Unlike other major environmental laws, it is all handled by Federal \nbureaucrats, not the State and local representatives. While the \nlawsuits have gone on for years and years and the consultants and the \nbureaucrats argue endlessly about how many parts per million is \nacceptable, our children are at risk.\n  The Clean Air Act requires States and localities to meet a series of \nambitious new pollution reduction targets in the years ahead. Achieving \nthese goals will make the air we breathe cleaner and healthier. But the \nWashington bureaucrats have not been content just to set the standards. \nThey are also trying to dictate how to achieve the goals, down to the \nsmallest detail. In order to reduce auto pollution, emission testing \nrequirements are part of the Clean Air Act. Rather than allowing States \nto decide, Federal regulators have been using threats to force States \nto set up entirely new automobile inspection networks, completely \nseparate from the existing State auto inspection systems, and it is \ncosting our consumers millions of dollars.\n  What we need to do, Mr. President, is achieve better protection of \nhuman health and the environment by regulating smarter. The fact is, \nbusinesses--\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nbig and small--private property owners, and commuters, are spending too \nmuch time, too much money, trying to comply with too much paperwork and \ntoo many regulations from too many Washington bureaucrats.\n  If we are going to move forward for a safer, cleaner, healthier \nfuture, we must change the way Washington regulates. States and \ncommunities should be allowed and encouraged to take a greater role in \nenvironmental regulations and oversight. But the improvements we need \nin Washington go far beyond State and local involvement. We need to \nplan for the future, not just for today.\n  Science and technology are constantly changing and improving, but the \nFederal Government is not keeping up with these changes, and the old \nregulations are outdated. Extremists in the environmental lobby are \ntrying to keep the status quo. What we want are some immediate changes \nthat will give us better regulations for the environment, to preserve \nit, and allow people the freedom to use their private properties and \ncultivate the land at the same time.\n  Mr. President, I know my time has expired.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period of \nmorning business be extended until the hour of 1:30, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will have 3 or 4 more minutes.\n  Mr. President, here are the things that I would like to see done to \nchange the regulatory harassment from Washington, DC. Let us put some \ncommon sense into the regulation. Let us do a thorough review of the \nenvironmental regulations that are now in place to determine what we \nneed, what we do not, and make sure we do not add any new unnecessary, \nunproductive regulations.\n  Washington should be required to disclose the expected costs of \ncurrent and new environmental regulations. I think the public has a \nright to know how much they are going to cost, and whether they are \ngoing to get their money's worth.\n  Three, in trying to make regulatory decisions involving the \nenvironment, the Federal Government should use best-estimate and \nrealistic assumptions, rather than worst-case scenarios advanced by \nenvironmental extremists.\n  Fourth, new regulations should be based on the most advanced and \ncredible knowledge available--in other words, good science. We have a \nsituation where we have seen the devastation of the timber industry in \nthe Northwest. It has cost thousands of people their jobs. Their \nfamilies and their livelihoods have depended on the timber industry. It \nhas cost every person in America that has built a new home more because \ntimber prices have increased. Why? To protect a spotted owl.\n  Mr. President, what has happened is that reports have come back that, \nin fact, the spotted owl is not going into extinction, that it has been \nspotted in places nearby. So we have had a devastation of an industry, \na devastation of people's lives and their livelihoods, their jobs, and \nwhole communities have been ruined, when we did not even have good, \nsound science.\n  In Texas, in the city of Big Springs, 15,000 people had to move a \nreservoir to protect a conclo snake that was later determined to be \nprolific in a county nearby. They spent $6 million in taxpayer money--\nthe money of hard-working people--to move a whole reservoir in order to \naccommodate a snake that was not really endangered.\n  So, Mr. President, it is time to restore common sense to \nenvironmental law. This is how we would move forward for a cleaner, \nsafer future for our country, and to protect private property rights \nand jobs as we do it. We can work together to keep endangered species, \nto clean air and water, and clean hazardous waste sites. We can do all \nof these things and still have a thriving economy.\n  Mr. President, that should be our goal, and that is why we are trying \nto reform Superfund, reform the Endangered Species Act, and make the \nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act \ngood for people as well as animals and the environment. We need to work \ntogether so we can live together in safety.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

William S. Cohen,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Seapower, Committee on Armed \n         Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, David Packard passed away \n     Tuesday, March 26, 1996. I would like to submit the following \n     statement for the Congressional Record.\n       We are deeply saddened by the passing of a great American \n     and a true friend of the Department of the Navy, David \n     Packard.\n       David Packard, together with his friend and Stanford \n     University classmate, Bill Hewlett, sparked the development \n     of the high technology industry from a one car garage back in \n     1938, to a giant in the electronics industry as the Hewlett-\n     Packard Company. He set a new standard in management style \n     that became known as ``the HP Way'', which emphasized \n     ``management by objective, rather than by directive'' and \n     encouraged employees to work toward common goals by giving \n     them a wide range of freedom in which to operate. He created \n     more than just a company, he created an industry and a \n     management philosophy.\n       Mr. Packard served as Deputy Secretary of Defense under \n     Secretary Melvin Laird where he developed a reputation for \n     candor and independent thinking and a tendency to challenge \n     political influence on defense decisions. He was part of a \n     team that is considered by many to be one of the strongest \n     teams ever to run the Defense Department.\n       A decade ago he made another huge and enduring contribution \n     to good government. He chaired the Packard Commission, which \n     recommended a revolution in defense procurement procedures \n     through the application of standard business practices. His \n     recommendations are still being implemented today. They \n     enable the military to modernize more quickly and at a lower \n     cost.\n       Although he was one of the richest men in America, he lived \n     modestly. He donated the bulk of his wealth to a foundation \n     that has given hundreds of millions of dollars to Stanford \n     University, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and other charitable \n     causes.\n       David Packard was a giant in industry, in public service \n     and philanthropy. We will miss him greatly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John H. Dalton,\n                                            Secretary of the Navy.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3185-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3186-S3187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n                    THE PASSING OF EDMUND S. MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, last Tuesday, the State of Maine and the \nentire Nation mourned the loss of a political giant, Edmund S. Muskie.\n  From Maine to California, the newspapers are filled with long stories \ndetailing and encapsulating the life and times of Ed Muskie and his \naccomplishments. There were columns that appeared in the New York \nTimes, the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, the Bangor Daily News, \nthe Portland Press Herald--all across the country.\n  While each of the articles was written from the unique perspective of \nthe authors, there were common elements in each one of them. The \narticles spoke of Senator Muskie's intellect, which indeed was \nmuscular. They spoke of his integrity, which was unquestioned. They \nspoke of his candor, which was unmatched. They spoke of his courage, \nwhich I think was incomparable.\n  He took on some of the most powerful interests in this country and, \nnever once, did he ever flinch, he never sought favor, and never acted \nout of fear. He was indeed a brave heart.\n  He was careful, and some say he was cautious.\n  I read a tribute recently, which I will quote:\n\n       Perhaps the strongest feature in his character was \n     prudence, never acting until every circumstance, every \n     consideration, was maturely weighed; refraining when he saw \n     doubt, but when once decided, going through with his purpose \n     whatever obstacles opposed. His integrity was the most pure, \n     his justice the most inflexible I have ever known, no motives \n     or interest or consanguinity, or friendship or hatred being \n     able to bias his decision. He was indeed, in every sense of \n     the words, a wise, a good, and a great man.\n\n  These words were not about Ed Muskie. These are the words of Thomas \nJefferson assessing the character of George Washington. But they might \njust as well have been said about Ed Muskie.\n  In Ecclesiastes, the question is asked, ``What is best for men to do \nduring their few days of life under the sun?''\n  Well, it was clear from the very beginning what the answer was for Ed \nMuskie. He was not born to be a spectator or a bystander. He did not \ncome into this world to sit in a darkened theater and express his \napproval or rejection of those on stage.\n  He knew, as Justice Holmes before him knew, that ``Life is action and \npassion, and we must share in that action and passion at the risk of \nbeing judged not to have lived.''\n  Ed Muskie was at the very center of the action of his days--whether \nit was on the civil rights legislation, or protecting the environment, \nor waging the fight to control the budget, as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, or promoting America's role in a dangerous world, as the \nSecretary of State.\n  When he was on the Senate floor in full-throated debate, and when he \nblended that magnificent mind of his with the rhetorical power and \ngrace of the orator, then he became one with the poet Hopkins, who \nsaid, ``What I do is for me; for this I care.''\n  Dr. Robert Sheehan once wrote, ``The world belongs to those who laugh \nand cry. Laughter is the beginning of wisdom, the first evidence of the \ndivine sense of humor. Those who know laughter have learned the secret \nof living.''\n  Well, Ed laughed a lot. He had a wry, down-east Yankee wit. He loved \na good cigar, a good story, and he loved a good joke.\n  While passion was his virtue, it was also said to be his vice. He had \na cool, cerebral intellect, but he also had a quick and, some would \nsay, also Vesuvian temper, particularly when he witnessed an injustice \nbeing done, an act of hypocrisy or unfairness being inflicted. He had \nlittle tolerance for character assassination.\n  We are all familiar with that fateful moment in New Hampshire when he \nwas standing on a flatbed during a snowfall. Ed Muskie decided that he \nhad enough of the dirty tricks that were being practiced upon him at \nthat time, enough of the daily diatribes that appeared in one of New \nHampshire's newspapers. But, of course, he was not the only object of \nattack that week. He rose on that day to denounce the attacks against \nhis wife, Jane, as being mean and cowardly. There was one prominent \njournalist, David Broder, who wrote that Senator Muskie appeared to be \ncrying during that time--although, to this day, there is some question \nas to whether they were actually snowflakes falling or streaming down \nhis cheeks, as opposed to tears.\n  But it was a moment in history--a turning point in his campaign for \nthe Presidency because many, after that moment, judged him to be too \npassionate to be President.\n  There is some irony in the retelling of this story and this event \nbecause, some 16 years later, another Democratic candidate for the \nPresidency was thought to be too cool, too bland, and bloodless in his \nresponse to a question about what he would do if his wife had been \nraped.\n  So we have come to learn that politics is not a sport where the rules \nare always well defined, or indeed consistent.\n  Some people who have run unsuccessfully for the Presidency are broken \nby the experience. Defeat never shattered Ed Muskie's love of politics \nand his love for this institution. He possessed an inner self-\nconfidence and self-awareness of his place in the uncompleted puzzle of \nexistence. It was a serenity which permitted him to continue to serve \nnobly in the Senate and then later as Secretary of State.\n  Mr. President, back in 1976, I had given consideration to running \nagainst Senator Muskie. I was then a young Congressman from the Second \nCongressional District of Maine. I was being urged, indeed, to run \nagainst Senator Muskie. I was pondering. I thought about it for a long \ntime. I retreated to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine to contemplate whether \nor not I would take this great step. I had with me at that time a book \ncalled ``Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'' written by Robert \nPirsig. It was one of the most intellectually challenging books I think \nI had read at that time.\n  As I was reading through the book, the decision really clicked into \nmy mind. I came across the words of Pirsig when he said:\n\n       When you try to climb a mountain to prove how big you are, \n     you almost never make it. And even if you do, it's a hollow \n     victory. In order to sustain the victory you have to prove \n     yourself again and again in some other way, and again and \n     again and again, driven forever to fill a false image, \n     haunted by the fear that the image is not true and someone \n     will find out. That's never the way. . . .\n\n  I knew, upon reading these words, that I was in danger of letting my \nown ambition race beyond my abilities and that even if I could defeat \nEd Muskie--and the polls showed me doing that--I knew in my heart that \nI would need a fistful of four-leaf clovers and a whole lot of money. \nEven then in my heart of hearts I knew that it would be a tough race \nfor me to run, and that, even if I were to win--which was always in \ndoubt--the State of Maine and this country would not have been well \nserved. He was by far a superior man, and history has proven that to be \nthe case.\n  So I declined to enter the race. I called Ed Muskie and told him of \nmy decision--never revealing at that time that I had been reading ``Zen \nand the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'' which helped me reach that \nconclusion.\n  John Kennedy once remarked that when the high court of history sits \nin judgment on each of us, recording in our brief span of service \nwhether we fulfilled our responsibilities, our success will be measured \nby the answers to four questions:\n\n  First, were we truly men of courage?\n  Second, were we truly men of judgment?\n  Third, were we truly men of integrity?\n  Fourth, were we truly men of dedication?\n  As history judges Ed Muskie, the answer to each of these questions is \nan unqualified ``yes.'' These are the very qualities that characterized \nhis service in Government. He will be remembered as one of the finest \npublic servants to ever have graced the Governor's Mansion in Maine, \nthe U.S. Senate, and the Office of Secretary of State.\n  Tomorrow when he is laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, Ed \nMuskie will be in the hearts and in the minds of the people of Maine \nand this country and shall remain there for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it has been 37 months since President \nClinton outlined his welfare reform goals. On February 2, 1993, he told \nthe Nation's Governors he would announce the formation of a welfare \nreform group within 10 days to work with the Governors to develop a \nwelfare reform plan. But welfare reform was not enacted that year nor \nthe following year.\n  Fourteen months ago, President Clinton declared at a joint session of \nCongress that, ``Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common \nresponsibility than our failed welfare system. It rewards welfare over \nwork. It undermines family values.''\n  In response, the new Congress passed welfare reform twice in 1995. \nH.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1995, \nreceived bipartisan support in both the House and Senate as it was \nbeing drafted. Yet, 10 weeks ago, President Clinton vetoed welfare \nreform for a second time. With a stroke of his pen, President Clinton \nwiped out the welfare reform American families need and expect. By \nvetoing welfare reform, President Clinton has accepted the status quo \nin which millions of children are trapped in a vicious cycle of \ndependency.\n  Two weeks after he vetoed H.R. 4 President Clinton once again pledged \nhis support for welfare reform in his 1996 State of the Union Address.\n  The President also declared that, ``the era of big government is \nover.'' But his actions contradict his words.\n  On February 6, the Nation's Governors issued their own bold challenge \nto reform the welfare state. The Governors' unanimously adopted a \nbipartisan--I emphasize ``a bipartisan''--blueprint for returning the \npower and authority over the welfare system, including Medicaid, to the \nStates. Since then, the Finance Committee has held three hearings on \nthe welfare and Medicaid proposals forwarded by the National Governors' \nAssociation. The Governors specifically built upon the welfare reform \nconference report rejected by the President.\n  On February 28, Secretary Shalala testified for the administration on \nthe Governors' proposals. Once again, we found that the administration \nhas an incredible capacity to blow hot and cold air at the same time. \nWhile lauding the Governors for their effort, Secretary Shalala opposed \nevery major provision of the bipartisan proposals.\n  The Nation's Governors assembled again this week, this time in \nPalisades, NY, for a National Education Summit. The purpose of this \nmeeting was for the States to share their ideas and strategies for \nintroducing new technologies, standards, and assessments to improve the \neducation of our children.\n  The Governors invited the business leaders who will help develop the \nnew learning systems which will combine education and technology. The \nGovernors also invited President Clinton to address the summit and, who \nno doubt, pledged his support and commitment to our children's future.\n\n  But among all of the dignitaries, there was an uninvited and \nunwelcome guest at the banquet. Medicaid, the uninvited guest, will \nconsume much of the necessary resources intended for education and will \nleave only scraps for the education of our children.\n  The insatiable appetite of Medicaid spending is limiting the ability \nof the Governors to fully fund education as they wish as Medicaid's \nshare of State spending has nearly doubled in just 7 years. Its share \nhas grown from 10 percent of State spending in 1987 to 19.4 in 1994.\n  During this same time, the share of State spending for elementary and \nsecondary education dropped from 22.8 to 20.3 percent. Higher \neducation's share dropped from 12.3 to 10.5 percent.\n  In 1990, Medicaid spending replaced higher education as the second \nlargest State spending category, exceeded only by elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  If present trends continue, Medicaid will soon pass elementary and \nsecondary education as well. As shares of total State spending, both \nelementary and secondary education and higher education are at their \nlowest point in memory.\n  Between fiscal years 1993 and 1994, elementary and secondary \neducation grew by just 2 percent. In comparison, Medicaid grew by more \nthan 12 percent.\n  These alarming trends have consequences in other vital services as \nwell. Transportation's share has dropped from 10.6 percent of State \nspending to 8.9 percent. The broad category of all other which includes \npublic safety, investment in infrastructure, and many other services \nhas declined 3 percentage points.\n  Another hidden threat of Medicaid is how State government is funded. \nMedicaid forces States to borrow more to finance the cost of education.\n  States cannot sell bonds to finance Medicaid, so the cost and burden \nof borrowing is passed on to other budget categories.\n  In 1987, 6.4 percent of bonds issued were to finance higher \neducation. In 1984, 19.2 percent of bonds were used to fund higher \neducation. This debt, of course, is ultimately passed on to our \nchildren. Even worse, as Medicaid spending consumes even greater shares \nof spending, leaving less for education, the cost of education may well \nrise beyond the ability of many families to spend their children to \ncollege to all.\n  The consequences of the failed welfare system are realized in many \nways. It spreads its ill effects throughout society.\n  Now we find that unlimited entitlement spending threatens our \ndemocratic institutions as well. Mandatory Medicaid spending is \ndraining State and Federal budgets. Governors and State legislatures \nare no longer in control of their State governments--they are being \nheld hostage by the demands of Federal bureaucrats.\n  Mr. President, if we truly care about the education and future of our \nchildren, we must enact authentic welfare reform. Medicaid is the \nlargest welfare program and the threat of its uncontrolled growth is \nspreading. Without welfare and Medicaid reform, whatever President \nClinton promised for education last Wednesday in New York, is certain \nto be consumed by Medicaid tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for roughly 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3186-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3187-S3188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PACIFIC NORTHWEST SALMON RESTORATION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Columbia River is the crown jewel of \nour Pacific Northwest. Its waters passing through our dams light our \ncities and towns. Its waters held back at times by those dams have \nsaved thousands of lives from destructive floods. Its waters spread on \nour dry land have made the desert bloom and provide food for millions \nof people around the world. At the same time, that magnificent Columbia \nRiver has been the home to the most munificent runs of salmon anywhere \nin the lower 48 States of the United States of America.\n  Now that very civilization that has built those dams and used these \nwaters so constructively threatens the future of these wonderful salmon \nruns. What should we do? How should we see to it that we both have the \nbenefits of power and of irrigation and flood control and at the same \ntime preserve and strengthen and restore these wonderful runs of \nsalmon?\n  I think it is becoming more and more evident what we should not do. \nIn the last 5 years, Federal bureaucrats here in Washington, DC, have \nbilled us in the Pacific Northwest $1.5 billion for salmon restoration, \nhalf a billion dollars last year alone, and we have not seen any \npositive results at all. In spite of this investment, an investment the \npeople of the Pacific Northwest have not begrudged, the results are \nnothing. The results are a continued decline in our salmon runs. These \ncosts are welcomed by the people of the Pacific Northwest, but the \nresults are not.\n  I am convinced that this failure of Washington, DC, bureaucrats means \nthat we cannot succeed if we continue to do business in the same way \nthat we are doing it at the present time. I believe, and I believe \nfirmly, that we can do a far better job in the Pacific Northwest if we \nare allowed to make the decisions that affect our lives and affect our \nresources.\n  Personally, I am totally committed to restoring an abundant salmon \nfishery in the Columbia and the Snake Rivers. Healthy and strong salmon\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\nruns are vitally important to our economy, to thousands of people whose \nlivelihoods rest on them. But there is something more important even \nthan those who are professionals in these fields. Salmon are a distinct \npart of our society and of our culture. Everyone who grows up in \nthe Pacific Northwest has his favorite stories--his or her own big \ncatch, the thrill of the child catching that first salmon, or just of a \nsummer cookout with the family with salmon on the grill. I would find \nit unacceptable that my grandchildren would not have in their lifetime \nthe same opportunities that I have had.\n\n  I have also to confess that my thinking, along with that of many in \nthe Pacific Northwest, has grown and expanded over the years to \nemphasize the vital importance of native salmon runs. We have spent \nmuch of our time building hatcheries and creating artificial runs where \nnative runs once existed. Those hatcheries are important. They are an \nimportant supplement. But we now recognize that it is vital that we \nstrengthen the native runs and help restore them at the same time.\n  I am convinced that the people of the Pacific Northwest are willing \nto pay money, money literally in the hundreds of millions and billions \nof dollars that has already been wasted, in order to restore these \nsalmon runs, but at the same time the people of the Pacific Northwest \nwant that money to be spent effectively. They also want the amount of \nmoney they are going to spend to be predictable, and they want it to be \nspent in a scientifically credible fashion.\n  Last November, the National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious \ninstitute of science in the free world, came up with a set of reports \nindicating what we know and what we do not know and suggesting some \ncourses of action. That report has been almost totally ignored by the \nFederal bureaucrats who are in charge of spending our money and telling \nus what to do.\n  So I believe we need a change. I think we need to change a system \nthat has failed and come up with a system that will work. I believe \nthat that system is most likely to be developed by the people who are \ngoing to pay the bills and benefit from any success and pay the penalty \nfor any failure.\n  Mr. President, do you not agree that the people of our region are \nbetter capable of answering these questions than the bureaucrats here \nin Washington, DC? Should not authority over how we deal with these \nruns be turned over to us, collectively--our sportsmen, our commercial \nfishermen, our citizens in cities and towns, our irrigators and \nfarmers, our Indian tribes? Are they not going to be able to come up \nwith a better answer to this question than we have gotten so far from \nWashington, DC?\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that is the case. I am convinced that \nthis Congress should require a significant amount of money to be spent \non the restoration of our salmon runs, should allow our people to spend \nmore, if they wish to do so, should allow us to come up with a \npredictable number of dollars for this effort, and then, most vitally, \nshould allow us, using the best science we can possibly find through \nthese wonderful national and international scientists, to decide how \nbest to spend that money so that we, you and I and all of us from the \nPacific Northwest, may be able to pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren the wonderful heritage of an abundant fishery at the same \ntime that we preserve power for our cities and towns, water for our \nfarms, rivers for our recreation, and safety for our citizens.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

NO, BIGGEST GOVERNMENT EVER\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have received last week the President's \nofficial budget for 1997 and for the next 6 years thereafter. I would \nlike to take some time this afternoon not to do the standard \npresentation that we all make, where we take the President's budget and \nsay what in it is phony, what is smoke and mirrors, and what in it has \nno hope of coming true?\n  If people took the President's budget this year and did that, I think \nthey could make a magnificent presentation because the President's \nbudget is based on optimistic assumptions that things are going to get \nbetter without any change in policy to make them better.\n  But that is not what I want to do this afternoon. What I want to do \nthis afternoon is to talk about the President's budget proposal from a \npoint of view that we don't use enough, and that is, if we assume that \neverything in the President's budget is valid, if every word in here is \nbacked up by sound policy, if everything the President assumes will \nhappen will happen, if we grant the President every benefit of the \ndoubt, then let us look historically at the kind of America that this \nbudget will produce. That is what I would like to do for a few moments \nhere this morning.\n  I would like to set it in historical perspective by using a series of \ncharts. On this first chart I compare expenditures on national defense \nstarting the day that World War II ended. So I look at the decade of \nthe 1940's after World War II, the decade of the 1950's, 1960's, \n1970's, 1980's, and then I look at the Clinton budget as projected for \nthe next decade, in his own numbers.\n  To simplify the comparison and avoid the impact of inflation or \noverall growth in the economy, I have decided to look at budget \nexpenditures as a percentage of the total production of the American \neconomy. So when I am going through these numbers, think of it as the \nNation's overall income, the value of everything we produce and sell, \nand how much of that is going for these particular purposes.\n  Looked at in this way, this chart shows that in the second half of \nthe 1940's, from 1945 to 1950, 7.9 cents out of every dollar earned by \nevery American was spent on national defense. As the cold war \naccelerated, that grew to 10.6 cents out of every dollar. It fell off \nsome in the 1960's to 8.9 cents out of every dollar. In the 1970's and \n1980's, it was 6 cents out of every dollar.\n  If President Clinton's budget is adopted exactly as it is written, if \nevery word in it turns out to be backed up by sound policy, and if \neverything it assumes will happen happens, under his policy we will, in \nthe decade of the Clinton budget, be spending 3.4 percent of the \nFederal budget on national defense.\n  There are several important points here. First of all, that is the \nlowest expenditure on national defense--3.4 cents out of every dollar \nearned by every American going to national defense--since the 1930's.\n  Second, that is 43 percent less than we spent in the decade of the \n1980's, and if every penny that has been cut out of defense had gone to \ndeficit reduction, we would have a balanced Federal budget today.\n  Let me state it in another way. The whole peace dividend for winning \nthe cold war, which allowed us in real terms to spend about $150 \nbillion less on defense every single year, every penny of the peace \ndividend has been seized and spent by Government. This is the first \nmajor victory in the history of America where the fruits of that \nvictory--whether it was the Civil War, World War I or World War II--\nthis will be the first time in American history that when the conflict \nended we did not give the money back to the people we took it from to \nfight the conflict. Every penny of the peace dividend will have gone to \nGovernment and will have been spent on nondefense programs.\n\n  The second point I want to make is about social spending. Again, \nbeginning the day World War II ended and for each of the decades, I \nhave the percentage of all of the income in America that was spent by \nGovernment on nondefense programs, basically social programs with the \noverwhelming preponderance entitlement programs. Again, the level was \n7.4 percent in the 1950's, it rose to 10.2 percent in the 1960's, rose \nto 14.6 cents out of every dollar earned by every American spent by \nGovernment on social programs in the 1970's. That rose to 17.1 percent \nin the 1980's and, under President Clinton's budget, if we met every \nsavings proposal that he has, if all of his assumptions came true about \nsaving money--and it would be the first budget in history where that \never happened--even under the best scenario,\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\nPresident Clinton has promised the largest expenditure on social \nprograms in the history of the United States of America. By his own \nnumbers he will spend 17.3 cents out of every dollar earned by every \nAmerican in Washington DC, through the Federal Government, on social \nprograms.\n  So, when our President says the era of big Government is over, and \nwhen we are trying to assess what that really means, I do not know what \nhe means when he says it but his budget spends 69 percent more on \nsocial programs, as a percentage of the income of all Americans, than \nwe spent during the decade the great society programs began under \nLyndon Johnson.\n  Taxes: Beginning the day that World War II ended, the American people \nhave borne the following tax burdens. From 1945 to 1950, on average, \nAmericans paid 16.5 cents out of every dollar they earned in taxes to \nthe Federal Government. That has steadily risen, and under President \nClinton's budget, if fully implemented, we would have the highest \nFederal tax burden in the history of the United States of America.\n  Under President Clinton's budget, if implemented, Americans would \nsend 19.3 cents out of every dollar earned by every American, on \naverage, to Washington to be spent by the Federal Government.\n  Let me sum this up on these three charts. President Clinton's budget \ncalls for the lowest level of expenditure on defense since World War \nII--since the 1930's, the highest level of expenditures on social \nprograms in the history of the United States of America, almost 70 \npercent higher as a percentage of our national income than we had in \nthe mid-1960's at the peak of the Great Society, and Clinton's own \nbudget calls for the largest tax burden in American history.\n  This is what the tax burden looks like if you plot it out, adding up \nState and local government. What you see by this chart is that, if \nimplemented, President Clinton's budget would give us the largest tax \nburden ever borne by Americans at any time in the history of our \ncountry.\n  The President talks about a tax cut in his budget, but what really \nhappens in his budget is that the tax cut is sunsetted and ends while \nthe tax increases continue. By the time you get to the year 2001, we \nhave actually a tax increase in the Clinton budget.\n  But now, to get down to why all this is relevant. What difference \ndoes it make that the Clinton budget has the highest social spending in \nAmerican history? What difference does it make, other than to the \ntaxpayer, that it has the highest tax burden in American history?\n  What I have plotted here is economic growth. This represents the rate \nof growth in the production of income and opportunity and jobs in \nAmerica. These numbers are very revealing.\n  In the 1950's, the American economy grew at 4 percent a year on \naverage. What that means is that in the aggregate, the average family \nin America was seeing its income grow by roughly 4 percent a year.\n  In the decade of the 1960's, that grew to 4.4 percent, most of that \ngrowth in the first half of the 1960's.\n  By the 1970's, it was down to 3.2 percent.\n  In the 1980's, it was down to 2.8 percent, and in President Clinton's \nown optimistic assumptions, with his Government spending burden and his \ntax burden, his own budget concludes that, on average, for the next 10 \nyears, we would have 2.3 percent economic growth, meaning that, whereas \nin the 1960's the average family could look forward to its income \ngrowing at 4.4 percent a year, under the President's program of taxing \nand spending, the average American family will be able to look forward \nto economic growth at roughly half the rate that we experienced in the \n1960's.\n  Why is that relevant? Let me give you a figure. If the American \neconomy for the next 20 years grew at 4 percent a year, which is about \nthe rate it grew in the fifties and sixties, rather than at the rate \nthat it will grow under the Clinton budget by his own assumptions, that \nwould mean that the average family of four in America 20 years from \nnow, would have $40,157 more of income than they will have at President \nClinton's growth rate.\n  Why is this budget proposed by the President so destructive? It is so \ndestructive because it is giving America a future that is shortchanging \nthe people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon in \nAmerica. It is giving American families an economy that is growing at \nroughly half the rate it grew in the 1950's and the 1960's.\n  What that means is that when families sit down around their kitchen \ntable every night and they dream the American dream and they make hard \nchoices to make it come true, only roughly half as many families are \ngoing to achieve the American dream under the Clinton budget as would \nhave achieved the American dream if we could go back to the kind of \neconomic growth that we had for the first 20 years after 1945.\n  What really happened in the 1960's, and it happened roughly in 1965 \nwhen you look at the figures, is that America made a decision--a \ndecision that was never debated and that there never was one single \nvote on it--but we made a decision that has profoundly affected our \ncountry. Prior to that point, for all of the 20th century, the American \neconomy had grown at over 3 percent a year. From 1950 to 1965, the \nAmerican economy had grown at over 4 percent a year. But beginning in \nthe mid-1960's, we traded in an economy growing at 4 percent a year for \na Government that has grown at 9 percent a year ever since.\n\n  Since the mid-1960's, the American Government has grown twice as fast \nas the income of the average American family and, in recent years, \nthree times as fast.\n  The net result is we have had a decline in jobs, in growth, and \nopportunity. When you ask Americans, ``Are you confident your children \nare going to have a brighter future than you had?'' and when over 60 \npercent say no, they clearly perceive what is happening in America.\n  I am opposed to the President's budget. I intend to work to defeat \nit. I intend to adopt an alternative, because I do not want the highest \ngrowth rates in American history for social programs. I do not want the \nhighest tax burden in American history, and I do not want the lowest \nlevel of opportunity for working people in this country that we have \never had in the history of the United States of America. That is what \nthis budget promises.\n  Budgets represent a vision for the future. They define a relationship \nbetween the Government and the people. The relationship that is defined \nin the Clinton budget is a relationship of Government getting bigger, \nof Government spending getting larger, of taxes getting higher and of \nopportunity getting smaller. That is not the future that I want.\n  Let me conclude by reminding my colleagues and anyone who might be \nlistening that the President earlier this year vetoed a budget that \nbalanced the Federal budget. The President vetoed a budget that, \nbecause it balanced the Federal budget, would have brought interest \nrates down by 2 percent, that would have saved the average family in my \nState in Texas $2,754 a year on their mortgage payments because of \nlower mortgage rates, and would have given an average family of four a \ntax cut of $1,000 a year which they could have invested in their own \nfamily, in their own future. If we had adopted that budget, we would \nnot be looking at the lowest economic growth rate in American history.\n\n  I think it is vitally important, Mr. President, that we reject the \nClinton budget, not because it is phony, not because most of its \nfigures are made up, not because the numbers do not add up--all that is \ntrue--but the reason we should reject that budget is because it does \nnot paint a future that America wants. Americans do not want higher \nGovernment spending, higher taxes and less growth. They want less \nGovernment. They want more freedom.\n  Our job is to see they get it. That is why I am opposed to the \nClinton budget. That is why I am in favor of balancing the Federal \nbudget by cutting spending. I thought it was important to come over \ntoday and talk about these numbers and give this speech because later \nthis afternoon we are going to be voting on a spending bill that spends \n$4 billion more than we set out in our appropriations earlier this \nyear. The President is saying that he is going to veto this bill \nbecause it does not spend $8 billion more than we set out in our \nappropriations earlier in the year.\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\n  Somehow there is a disconnect between what we are saying in \nWashington and what we are doing. If we want the return of jobs, growth \nand opportunity--if we want to restore the kind of opportunity that was \nroutinely available to America when the Presiding Officer of the Senate \nwas growing up and when I was growing up--we are going to have to \nchange the way we do business.\n  We are going to have to spend less of the taxpayers' money in \nWashington, so that the taxpayer can keep it, so the taxpayer and the \ntaxpayer's family can spend it, so that they can invest it in their \nfuture and, therefore, America's future. That is the difference between \nthe Clinton vision and the vision of Republican Members of the House \nand the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague. I want to apologize to \nhim. During the speech of our colleague, Senator Gorton, I had walked \ninto the anteroom, and he did not see me here on the floor. I am sorry \nfor the inconvenience.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Texas for those comments. We \ntry on the floor to respect those who have arrived earlier. I had not \nknown that the distinguished Senator from Texas had been awaiting \nrecognition. I walked in; he was not on the floor. But I learned a \nlittle by listening to Senator Gramm, which I do when I listen to \nSenator Gramm. I have had occasion to listen to Senator Gramm a great \ndeal over the past year and have learned from the Senator over the \ncourse of the last year in other activities I have undertaken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3188-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3190-S3191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition, Mr. President, to express my \nchagrin and disappointment that we are apparently not going to have an \nomnibus appropriations bill, but later today are going to proceed with \nanother continuing resolution. Perhaps it is appropriate on April 1, on \nApril Fool's Day, that Washington, DC, again looks like a collective \ngroup of April fools unable to pass a budget, and on April Fool's Day \nunable to finish the business of the preceding year, 1995.\n  Within the past hour I have come from the conference of the House and \nSenate where very strenuous efforts have been made for the past several \ndays to find a compromise on appropriations.\n  I have the honor to chair the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health \nand Human Services. Perhaps I use the wrong word when I say it is an \n``honor.'' It has been really an embarrassment that we have not been \nable to bring a bill, the legislation, to fruition for funding which \nshould have been in place by last October 1. But that bill has been \ntied up for a variety of reasons, with equal blame apportioned on both \nsides of the aisle, while we have been in gridlock on a number of \nmatters.\n  For many, many weeks I have been pressing very hard to try to get the \nmatter resolved, have been working with Chief of Staff Leon Panetta to \nfind offsets, have scheduled a series of hearings with the Secretaries \nof the three Departments--Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation--and we finally brought the bill to the Senate floor and \nfinally got it passed by a very substantial number, 79 to 21.\n\n  The key part of that bill was a bipartisan amendment worked out by \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, and myself, \nSenator Harkin being the ranking member of the committee. We passed \nthat amendment 84 to 16. During about 20 hours of conferencing, Mr. \nPresident, I think we had been able to finally thread the needle to \nfind a bill which would probably have been signed by the President and \nwhich was acceptable to the House of Representatives.\n  That is pretty hard to do in Washington, DC, today. There is \nconsiderably more flexibility in the U.S. Senate in trying to arrive at \naccommodation. We passed the bill which had the amendment which Senator \nHarkin and I had constructed and fashioned, which added $2.7 billion to \nsome very important functions, to education, worker safety, and to \nhealth and human services.\n  Notwithstanding that addition, the President had sent word that he \nwanted some $484 million more. Well, we were at the break point with \nthe bill which we conferenced with the House of Representatives when we \nhad called for $2.7 billion more in spending.\n  Let me point out that that $2.7 billion was endorsed by both leaders, \nSenator Dole and Senator Daschle, 37 out of the 53 Republicans voted \nfor the amendment, 37 Republicans voted for it and 16 voted against it, \nmore than two-thirds of our Republican body voted for it, which is a \nvery, very strong showing, given the constituency of our Senate caucus, \nand the amendment received all of the 47 Democratic votes. So, when we \nwent to conference with this bill I thought, Senator Harkin thought, \nSenator Hatfield thought, that we were within range to have it signed \nby the President. We were not sure, but we thought we were within that \nrange.\n  We also constructed the bill so that it would be agreed to by our \nHouse colleagues. We were not sure about that either. It was very, very \ntough on negotiations. Finally, the House Labor, Health and Human \nServices conferees approved the bill by a vote of 6 to 5. You cannot \nget any closer than 6 to 5. But what we were veritably doing is running \nbetween the raindrops in a hurricane to find something which would \nsatisfy our House colleagues and something which might be signed by the \nPresident.\n  Regrettably, that is all for naught or mostly all for naught--mostly \nfor naught or probably for naught--because when we do not get the bill \nand have a 3-week hiatus, it all unravels.\n  Senator Baker was the majority leader when I first came to this body. \nI learned a great deal from Senator Baker. One of his famous \nstatements--we were here at 11:30 one night. We were on the finance \nbill. There were 63 amendments pending. Senator Baker said, ``We're \ngoing to proceed and finish this bill because amendments, like \nmushrooms, grow overnight.'' We stayed through until 6:30 in the \nmorning. We had some accepted. We had half a dozen votes. Many dropped \nby the wayside. We finished the bill.\n  The dynamism in the U.S. Senate and the House is, if you do not push \nto get it through, it all unravels. We were on the verge of getting it \nthrough. I compliment our distinguished colleague, Senator Hatfield, \nfor his prodigious work in shepherding this matter through and would \nnote his consternation and amazement when he heard last night that we \nwere going to have a continuing resolution. That was not known by the \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who was chairing the \nconference.\n  I think it is very regrettable because, if we were going to have the \ntime to present this bill on the floor today, or perhaps tomorrow--it \nwould not be unheard of or out of line for us to work on a Saturday, \neven if it would mean a day less of the recess. That has happened \nbefore.\n  These matters just do not coalesce until the very last minute. If \nthere is more time for argument, more time for discussion, and more \ntime for disagreement, when we finally work it out, it is an \naccommodation and a compromise. Nobody is really happy, and if you have \nmore time to argue it some more, you expected to be in session last \nnight until past midnight and then again today.\n  With that pressure on, we were on the verge of having an omnibus \nappropriations bill, which I think would have concluded the matter. It \nis with considerable chagrin and considerable disappointment, speaking \nfor myself, that we are not finishing. I think it is with considerable \nchagrin and considerable disappointment that the American people are \nwatching the process and seeing April 1 come and seeing a bunch of \n``April fools'' in Washington, DC, at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, \nunable to get the matter done. There is a responsibility in both \nHouses, a bicameral responsibility, and a responsibility on both sides \nof the aisle--Republicans and Democrats are equally at fault--and \nresponsibility at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, because there is no \neasy compromise and no meeting of the minds without an elaborate, \ninordinate thrashing process where the White House always wants more \nand some here always want less. We are on the verge of getting it done.\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\n I think it is very regrettable we did not conclude it.\n  Mr. President, when we added the $2.7 billion included in the \nSpecter-Harkin amendment, we were able to add to some very, very \nimportant programs on education--that is a priority, second to none--\nand important matters on worker safety, important matters on Health and \nHuman Services.\n  I know my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island is on the floor \nwaiting to speak, and I will not go through the detail which I would \nhave. Sometimes on Friday afternoon at 1:30 there is nobody seeking \nrecognition on the floor. Instead, I will have printed in the Record \nthis chart which shows a comparison, a transition, as to where the \nappropriations process had been, how we made the additions, how we came \nto the accommodations and compromises, and finish within $20 million, \nwhich is a small fraction of the $2.7 billion, we came in $20 million \nunder the $2.7 billion, and actually only $14 million, because a $6 \nmillion addition was added by Congresswoman Pelosi on an education \nprogram, which I thought was fine.\n  So we did the job. Regrettably, it is not altogether finished. \nHopefully, a good part of this work will last, and we will be able to \nbuild on this when we come back, to finish this omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  There are a few outstanding matters on language and a few other \noutstanding issues, but I think they would have been resolved fairly \nquickly had the pressure been maintained to finish this, without the \ntalk of a continuing resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Mr. President, 3 days ago in Palo Alto, CA, a very \nremarkable and truly great American died, David Packard. David Packard \ndeserves ranking with the most innovative and outstanding builders and \nmanufacturers in our Nation's history.\n  He and his partner, Bill Hewlett, were the fathers of the electronic \nindustry in Silicon Valley. Starting just 60 years ago, literally, in a \ngarage, David Packard and Bill Hewlett began building an innovative \naudio oscillator\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\nunder the name of the Hewlett-Packard Co. How did they choose the name \nHewlett-Packard? To decide whose name came first, they flipped a coin, \nand Dave lost. His name came second. From that humble beginning, just \n60 years ago, grew a company that today has more than 100,000 employees \nand sales last year of $31.5 billion. It is a worldwide leader in the \nelectronics industry.\n  What a success story. A great part of the success, Mr. President, of \nHewlett-Packard has come about because of the management style which \ncould be called managing by objective, namely, setting goals and giving \nemployees wide latitude in achieving those goals. This was the style \nthat Dave Packard believed in deeply. Obviously, it works.\n  But David Packard's achievements went beyond his success with \nHewlett-Packard. He was a philanthropist who did much more than write \nout a check. He became deeply involved with the projects to which he \ncontributed.\n  A case in point: The Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital in \nPalo Alto, which the Packard family gave to Stanford University Medical \nSchool and which I have had the privilege of visiting. This is a \nchildren-friendly hospital, built for children, and one in which \nchildren can feel safe at home. Dave and Lucile Packard made sure that \nwas the way it was built. Let me give an illustration: The registration \ndesk in this hospital when you come in--usually, a very forbidding \nstructure--has peepholes in it at a child's level, so when a child \ncomes in with his or her parent, the child can look through the \npeephole and see what is going on behind this forbidding desk.\n  The Packards founded and funded the Monterey Bay Aquarium, first \nopened 11 years ago, in 1985. Dave Packard was deeply involved with the \ninnovations at that aquarium. He designed and built, in his own \nworkshop, some of the wave-generating equipment that is in that \nmarvelous aquarium. The Monterey Bay Aquarium, with an annual \nattendance of over 1.5 million people every year, is the second-most \npopular aquarium in the United States of America.\n\n  In his book called ``The HP Way,'' Dave wrote the following: ``The \nword `philanthropy' is derived from a Greek word that means `lover of \nmankind.' '' I think this is the phrase that best describes David \nPackard. It was his enduring belief that his efforts, both individual \nand corporate, could make this world a better place for all to live in.\n  In 1969, David Packard became Deputy Secretary of Defense, and that \nis when I came to know him, because I was, at the time, appointed \nSecretary of the Navy. My distinguished colleague from Virginia also \ncame to know Dave Packard at the same time, when the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia was appointed Under Secretary of the Navy. For 3 \nyears I had the privilege of working with Dave Packard and came to \nadmire him greatly. He had the ability to cut right to the heart of a \nproblem. He was laconic. He was not a great talker or backslapper. \nIndeed, he had a semi-gruff-appearing visage, but he was extremely \nfair, and he was helpful if one ran into a problem. Most of all, he \nwanted to see the job done and done well.\n  He made extremely valuable contributions to our Nation as Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, especially in the procurement area. During the \nyears we were together in the Defense Department, my wife Ginny and I \ncame to become friends with David and Lucile Packard. It was a \nfriendship we greatly valued. They were truly a team--and a wonderful \none. Lucile was a lovely lady in every way.\n  Dave was always a bit bemused by the abundance of aides and \nassistants one had in the Pentagon. I remember him commenting that he \nand Bill Hewlett ran Hewlett-Packard Co. sharing one secretary and one \noffice.\n  Always a good athlete and an outdoor sportsman, Dave played \nbasketball and football at Stanford, and later, while working for \nGeneral Electric in Schnectady, NY, in the depths of the Depression, in \n1935, he made a few extra dollars a week playing professional \nbasketball. A hunter and fisherman since boyhood, he maintained those \ninterests throughout his life, and was a major contributor to \nconservation organizations.\n  Dave Packard was an extremely thoughtful person and would go out of \nhis way to help an individual. I was the beneficiary of his kindness in \nmany areas, many times, including a special tour for Ginny and me of \nthe aquarium, by he and Lucile, contributions of his, and his personal \nappearances at various political fundraisers for me in San Francisco \nand hospitality at his Palo Alto home.\n\n  In his death, I feel like a great oak tree has fallen in the forest. \nI have lost a real friend, and our Nation has lost a unique and \nextraordinarily constructive and thoughtful patriot.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I add my comments to those of my \ndistinguished colleague and my former boss in the Department of the \nNavy, Secretary John Chafee of Rhode Island. Those are days that \nneither of us will ever forget.\n  It is interesting to go back in history. When President Nixon was \nsearching for a Secretary of Defense--and I will test the recollection \nof my colleague--there was much thought about one of the most famous \nMembers, contemporary Members of the Senate, Scoop Jackson, taking the \npost. Senator Jackson did consult with the President, but there came a \ntime when Jackson felt he could fulfill his goals with the Senate. They \nwere extraordinary goals, which, indeed, he did fulfill, and that is by \ncontinuing in the Senate. But Jackson pointed this out to Secretary \nLaird, then-Congressman Laird from Wisconsin, ranking member of the \nDefense Subcommittee on Appropriations. I remember Laird saying that it \nwas difficult for him to give up a life in the House of Representatives \nand in the Congress and representing his State, which he loved so \ndearly. But he did it.\n\n  But, as a condition, he said, ``Mr. President, I want to pick my team \nin the Department of Defense,'' thereby deviating--and at that time I \nwas in the transition office of President Nixon--from the White House \nsort of selecting the principal deputies. It was Melvin Laird who \nselected David Packard, and it became known as the Laird-Packard team. \nWe must also remember that, at that time, our Nation was engaged in the \npeak of the war in Vietnam, and the responsibilities on the leadership \nin the Department of Defense were enormous, particularly that of \nSecretary Laird, who had to be before the Congress with great \nfrequency, and all across the Nation, to answer the question, ``Why \nmust we continue in this war?''\n  I spoke briefly today with Secretary Laird. He remembers that Dave \nPackard and Melvin Laird were the architects of Vietnamization under \nthe guidance of President Nixon. That was the first time this Nation \nbegan to focus on how, with honor and dignity, we could begin to allow \nthe Vietnamese people--South Vietnam--to assume the burden of the war \nand to begin the withdrawal of the American forces.\n  I remember so well Secretary Laird telling me, when he arrived at the \nPentagon, that there was not a single plan as to how, eventually, the \nUnited States could turn over the burden of that war to others. They \nworked together. The responsibilities on Dave Packard were greater than \non any Deputy Secretary of Defense, because of the war. It was a team. \nAs was mentioned, Packard was awesome. He was awesome in size--over \nsix-foot-four, in perfect physical condition, proportionately. He was \nawesome not only in physical stature but in intellectual ability. His \nhallmark was humility. Would the Senator not share that opinion?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. He certainly was awesome. He was a big six-foot-\nfour. He took charge. He had what you might call ``command presence.''\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I remember, when I first got in the Pentagon, the phone \nrang from Mr. Packard, and I stood up before I answered it.\n  I would like to say one other thing. I remember Secretary Laird \nsaying this when he was seeking a deputy. He asked all through the \nbusiness world, and he knew what he wanted. He wanted somebody who \ncould handle the procurement side of the Pentagon. Mel Laird and David \nPackard worked out what you might call a ``Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside'' \nteam, in which Mel Laird would deal with the Congress. He knew George \nMahon, head of the Appropriations Committee, intimately. He knew\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\nSenator ``Scoop'' Jackson, and so forth--\n\n  Mr. WARNER. And Senator Stennis, of course.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Senator Stennis, of course. Mel Laird would handle the \nlegislative side of matters, the appropriations, the relationships with \nthe White House and with the Congress. That is no easy job. Dave \nPackard was assigned what you might call the inside of the Pentagon. He \nwas the man that we would consult with on procurement problems. We were \ndeep into procurement problems--the F-15, the F-14, the 963 destroyers, \nthe 688 class submarines, and on and on it went. Those are the matters \nwe would report to David Packard on. He would watch over how we were \ndoing and whether we were coming in on cost, whether we were meeting \nour milestones in the construction, and the whole process.\n  Mr. WARNER. On that, we also want to mention Senators Thurmond, \nTower, and Goldwater.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, and Margaret Chase Smith.\n  Mr. WARNER. Who all had great reverence for him. I remember one \ncontract very clearly. It was a contract for the new antisubmarine \naircraft, the S-3. At that time, the contractor was having severe \nfinancial difficulties. Packard called me in and he said, ``Look, we \nare not going to award this contract until you determine that there is \na financial program by which this contractor can go through and assume \nthe enormous responsibilities of the carrying costs of this contract.'' \nI worked under the tutelage of Dave Packard for some several weeks, \nand, finally, we made the decision to give that contractor the \nopportunity to build it. They did build that plane, and it became a \nworkhorse of the U.S. Navy. That contractor today, although merged, is \nstill one of the major contractors in national defense. But he wanted \nto give the opportunity to the industrial base to prove itself. He held \nthem accountable, I say to my friend from Rhode Island, in those days.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the conclusion of our \ncolloquy today a statement by the former Secretary of Defense, a former \nMember of the U.S. Congress, Melvin Laird, who contributed quite a \ndocumentary on Dave Packard upon learning of his death.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. Laird told me today, in a saddened voice, that he had \njust talked to Dave not more than a week ago, as they did almost every \nweek of their lives after leaving the Pentagon. They were like \nbrothers. That is one of the rich heritages of those privileged to have \nserved in Federal service--bringing, from all across America, people to \nwork in the departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and the \nforming of lifetime friendships as a basis for that public service.\n  So I say to my friend, I am privileged to join with him. I think the \nSenator covered his contributions in the field of health and, indeed, \nthe military services. They have their own educational facility now for \nthe purpose of preparing young men and women for doctors and medical \nassistants.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Actually, I did not touch on that.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is an important contribution.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I failed to mention that. The Uniformed Services Medical \nCollege.\n  Mr. WARNER. That was his dream.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It came from Dave Packard. He was the principal proponent \nof it. He felt we were having trouble getting physicians in the \nmilitary service forces, and that we had these major research hospitals \nand outstanding hospitals, Walter Reed and Bethesda, and we needed our \nown medical school, which we did get.\n  Mr. WARNER. You touched on the procurement reform. Each time Congress \ngoes back in an effort to try to strengthen procurement reform, they go \nback time and time again to that report.\n  I want to conclude with a personal note. Back to the word \n``awesome.'' There was a certain amount of trepidation each time we had \nto encounter David Packard. One of the principal avenues to soften him \nwas his lovely wife, who was called Lou. She was a statuesque, \nbeautiful woman, and very quiet and dignified. She, and she alone, \ncould handle Dave Packard. That is my recollection.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, the Senator is absolutely right. There was a \ncertain trepidation when you got a call that ``Mr. Packard wants to see \nyou in his office.'' I would hustle around to see if I missed out \nsomewhere, or if I left something undone that I ought to have done. It \nwas sort of like when you were in school and being called to the \nprincipal's office. I tell. It kept you on your toes.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Indeed it did.\n  We should also mention that the concept of the All-Volunteer Force \noriginated under Secretaries Laird and Packard. We accept it today, and \nit has worked far beyond the expectations of any of us. But there was a \nlot of concern when we initiated that. Would we see a precipitous \ndropoff in the ability of the United States to attract quality young \nmen and women to the uniformed services? They were the men that had the \nvision to give us the opportunity to prove it, and it has worked. And \nit has worked well.\n  So the achievements of the Laird-Packard team were monumental and--\nwith the exception of the present company of the Senator and myself--\nthey were able to draw from all quarters of the United States the \nfinest to come and serve in the Department of Defense in the three \nmilitary departments. The introduction of greater responsibility for \nwomen in the military services indeed was during that period of time. \nThey laid the foundation for the service academies being opened to \nwomen.\n  As I remember, as I succeeded Senator Chafee, one of the last things \non my watch was opening up Annapolis to women. And that has worked \nexceptionally well.\n  So, Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to join with my former \nboss and dear friend to say these brief remarks on behalf of our lost \ncompany.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          Remarks of Former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird\n\n       A giant of a man in every way, David Packard helped me in \n     the '50s as a young congressman when I was ranking member of \n     health, education, and welfare and labor developing the \n     university programs for NIH, Health and Education research. \n     He also helped me as my deputy while I was serving as \n     Secretary of Defense. His contribution in both cases was \n     monumental.\n       We established the draft lottery system and created the All \n     Volunteer Service, ending the draft, managed the orderly \n     withdrawal from Vietnam, an organized the Defense Department \n     procurement policies.\n       His contribution to our nation and the world will be an \n     everlasting memorial to him.\n       He was a true friend, a great contributor to the best \n     things our nation stands for. We all will be forever in his \n     debt, a true friend for whom I will always have the deepest \n     love.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, David Packard is a legend in \nCalifornia, and will forever remain a treasured part of California's \nproud history.\n  A man of humble beginnings, through sheer ingenuity and \ndetermination, David Packard became one of the most influential \nentrepreneurs in American business.\n  One of the original cofounders of computer giant Hewlett-Packard, he \nwas considered the patriarch of hi-tech's famed Silicon Valley. His \ninnovation sparked the technology revolution that put California on the \nmap as the information leader of the world.\n  But it was his leadership that inspired generations of hi-tech \nwizards to break new ground and reach new heights. He truly believed \nthat nothing was impossible if the spirit to succeed was there. And \nDavid Packard believed in the American spirit.\n  David Packard set a standard of excellence for business schools all \nover the world with his ideas of ``management by objective'' and \n``management by walking around.''\n  And he put a human face on success by never climbing out of the reach \nof the people who worked for him. ``The HP Way'' broke barriers between \nmanagement and employees, fostering teamwork and a pride of ownership \nthat reached every level of his company.\n  David Packard also served his country as Deputy Secretary of Defense \nunder President Nixon, and, with his wife Lucile, was unmatched as our \nNation's most dedicated and generous philanthropist. The David and \nLucile\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\nPackard Foundation last year distributed more than $116 million to more \nthan 700 recipients.\n  His contributions to Stanford University, my alma mater, leave a \nlegacy that will touch many future generations, who will stand on his \nshoulders and continue to lead this Nation to new heights of \nexcellence, compassion, and greatness.\n  David Packard will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to proceed as if in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3191-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3194-S3195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               WHITEWATER\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as we are working on many important matters, \nincluding wrapping up of the appropriations conference, on which we, \nunfortunately, are not able to close all sections today, we also are, I \nhope, going to resolve the issue of whether the Whitewater Committee is \nextended.\n  There have been a lot of questions asked. What has Whitewater found? \nWhy are we here?\n  I have a very lengthy analysis which I will make available, because \nmany people who have not had the pleasure and the privilege--as the \noccupant of the Chair and I have had--of sitting through the lengthy \nhearings may not appreciate what we have learned and how many more \nquestions there are.\n  Mr. President, the investigation of the matters involving financial \nland transactions of the President, the First Lady and top officials in \nArkansas, and subsequent actions by these officials, or their \nsubordinates to interfere with, obtain information about, or delay \ninvestigations into those matters has come to be known generally as \nWhitewater.\n  From the beginning of this episode, we saw efforts to mislead \nCongress or to deny information. My first encounter with this matter \ncame over 2 years ago when, before the Banking Committee, the Deputy \nSecretary of the Treasury misled us in answering my question as to when \nthe White House was first advised of the significant nonpublic \ninformation that a criminal referral was pending in the investigation \nof the financial irregularities in Arkansas. He said they were not. \nThey were.\n  The most recent example was the unexplained, mysterious reappearance \nof the critically important billing records of Mrs. Clinton's law firm, \nwhich, although subpoenaed more than 2 years ago by the independent \ncounsel and the Resolution Trust Corporation and this past fall by the \nWhitewater Committee, only found their way to all of us in January \n1996.\n  Investigation of records further demonstrated that Mrs. Clinton--and \nother representatives of the White House--had not spoken truthfully \nabout her involvement with the failed savings and loan in Arkansas and, \nin specific, her transactions involving one of the most egregious and \ncostly land transactions utilized to loot the savings and loan known as \nMadison Guaranty in Little Rock, AR.\n  Throughout this process, many of us have had questions about why the \nadministration has been so deeply involved in what appears to be \nimproper efforts to cover up and interfere with the Arkansas activities \ninvestigation. Had the role of the President and the First Lady been \nlimited solely to an investment in a failed land development--as the \nWhite House initially contended, and was contended in the campaign of \n1992--it would not have made any sense for so many officials to risk \ncharges of perjury or obstruction of justice. The cost to many of these \nindividuals for activities involved in this coverup have been \nsignificant, as colleagues on the other side of the aisle have noted. \nThe cost of legal counsel has been burdensome for many.\n\n  More important, however, is the fact that the broad Washington \nmisconduct has led to resignations of the White House counsel, a Deputy \nSecretary of the Treasury, a general counsel of the Treasury, as well \nas a rapid turnover in the post of White House counsel ever since.\n  Indeed, the nature and extent of the activities directed by the White \nHouse toward the investigations in Arkansas made it incumbent upon us \nto determine what happened in Arkansas that was potentially so \ndangerous that they warranted these extensive coverups.\n  Although the committee is still reviewing the delayed production \ndocuments and has not been able to interview central figures in \nArkansas, it appears that the Whitewater matter involves substantial \nabuse and misuse of gubernatorial power in Arkansas, the use of \nofficial positions for private gain, possible violations of Federal tax \nlaws in the reporting of deductions, and active legal representation by \nthe First Lady of individuals and institutions involved in fraudulent \nactivity resulting in the significant losses to the savings and loan \ninsurance fund and the rest of the taxpayers.\n  So far in Arkansas, there have been nine guilty pleas. These include \nguilty pleas by the real estate appraiser who appraised a fraudulent \nland value on land in one of the scam transactions; a judge who \ndefrauded a Federal agency; two bankers who attempted to bribe a \nFederal loan agent; three Madison employees who made false statements \nto defraud a Federal agency; and a friend of the Clinton's who had \nconcealed cash payments to the 1990 Clinton campaign.\n  In addition, as most of us know, there is, right now, a criminal \ntrial underway against the Clintons' major fundraiser, who was also a \nformer business partner and the President's key political ally, who is \nnow the Governor of Arkansas. Indictments are pending against the \nClintons' friend and former business partner and criminal indictments \nagainst two Clinton supporters for concealing cash payments to his 1990 \ncampaigns.\n  Mr. President, we have learned this. We have learned this in the \ncourse of hearings. I set this out today not because the investigation \nor the hearings have concluded. We have not answered all of the \nquestions that need to be answered. But some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle in this body--and on the Whitewater Committee--\nhave said we have not learned anything, that there is not anything \nthere.\n  Well, Mr. President, there has been a tremendous amount of smoke with \nthe recent revelations of the documents that just mysteriously have \nstarted appearing in the last several months. We have found out why \nthey all hang together. The documents--the billing records of Mrs. \nClinton at the Rose Law Firm--would have told us, would have enabled us \nto phrase our questions and come to an earlier resolution. These were \ntaken out of the White House. Webster Hubbell had them and apparently \ngave them to Vince Foster, and then somehow, mysteriously, they just \nappeared in the book room, in the reading room of the White House in \nJanuary. They were under subpoena. They were under subpoena. And, lo \nand behold, they just turned up.\n  The assistant in the White House who picked them up initially \nrealized in January that these were records that had been subpoenaed, \nand she brought them forward. Notes of a never disclosed, heretofore \nsecret meeting in the White House between White House lawyers and \nGovernment officials and the defense attorneys representing the \nClinton's personally--notes from this meeting which told about so many \ninteresting activities--all of a sudden started appearing from \neverybody's files 2 weeks before the hearings were to conclude.\n  Those memos, those notes, suggest possibly that the meeting engaged \nin efforts to obstruct justice by tampering with witnesses. The billing \nrecords themselves show that Mrs. Clinton and others did not speak \ntruthfully about her role in Madison Guaranty representation and in her \nwork on Castle Grande. We have been unable in the Whitewater Committee \nto interview central witnesses to these transactions because they have \nbeen subpoenaed to testify in the trial being conducted by the special \nprosecutor in Little Rock. I hope that we are near to an agreement to \nextend the life of this committee so that we can complete the analysis \nof all the documents that have just turned up, so that we can determine \nwhether the author, Mr. James Stewart, of ``Blood Sport,'' may have had \naccess to relevant documents that we have been denied, so that we will \nbe able to question people who may be able to give us direct testimony \non many of the things that we have now seen by strong circumstantial \nevidence, though it is only circumstantial\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\nevidence. I believe there is clear evidence of wrongdoing. There is \nclear evidence that we have not been told the truth in political \ncampaigns, in press statements by the White House, and in sworn \ntestimony to us, to the committee, and to others.\n\n  Mr. President, I had a draft report prepared that represents my views \nof what we have learned as of the current time on the Whitewater \nCommittee, and also listing the questions that must be answered by the \ncommittee before we can close this; questions like: Who placed Mrs. \nClinton's subpoenaed records in the White House book room? Where were \nthey for the years that they were under subpoena but not brought \nforward? Was there obstruction of justice by the White House officials \nwho met and as a result of that meeting people visited a key witness in \nArkansas? Did the White House improperly receive confidential \ninformation about the SBA investigation into certain wrongdoings in \nLittle Rock? Was there witness tampering by the White House response \nteam? Did some of the people who have in the past testified that they \nlied to their diary come up with other falsehoods that are totally \ninconsistent with written records?\n  These are questions that must be answered.\n  Mr. President, I send this report forward, and I ask if anyone would \nlike to receive a copy of this report, please contact my office.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3194-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3195-S3198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 170\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that \nagreement be in effect notwithstanding the receipt of the papers from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate, I hope this can all be done by voice vote. \nI know there is one request on the other side for a rollcall vote. I \nthink it is a simple extension. The appropriators worked all through \nthe night. It is no one's fault they did not finish everything, because \nthey have been working with the White House. I hope that we do not \npunish our colleagues who had to leave earlier in the day. So perhaps \nafter the debate we could have a voice vote. But if necessary, I guess \nwe will have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this joint resolution provides continuing \nappropriations until April 24, 1996, for the departments and agencies \nof the Federal Government normally provided for under the five \nappropriations bills that have not yet been signed into law.\n  Special provision has been made for a labor-management matter at the \nFederal Aviation Administration, for the Federal payments to the \nDistrict of Columbia, for a matter relative to the Auburn Indian \nRestoration Act, and for economic assistance to Bosnia.\n  Adoption of this joint resolution will extend funding authority for \nthe departments and agencies concerned for another 3\\1/2\\ weeks, \nenabling the appropriations committees, the joint leadership, and the \nWhite House to continue discussions on the omnibus appropriations bill \nnow in conference, and reach agreement thereon. We have already made a \ngreat deal of progress on the omnibus bill.\n\n  Mr. President, most of our issues have been resolved and major \nportions of the bill have been closed. But there are still some \nsignificant matters requiring leadership attention that will need to be \ndiscussed during the recess and resolved when we resume the conference \non April 15. I have indicated that I will convene that conference on \nthat date, April 15, at some hour during that afternoon.\n  I am confident that our discussions will be fruitful and we will \nproduce a bill that the President will endorse. That is our goal. I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the \nappropriations committee has made a most appropriate and eloquent and \nall-embracing statement concerning the conference report, concerning \nthe continuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, this resolution will continue the operations through \nApril 24, 1996, of those departments and agencies for which full-year \nappropriations for fiscal year 1996 have not yet been enacted. As \nSenators are aware, five of the regular thirteen appropriation bills \nhave not been enacted: Commerce/Justice/State, the District of \nColumbia, Interior, Labor/HHS, and VA/HUD.\n  As Senators also know, an appropriations conference has been ongoing \nover the past several days on H.R. 3019, an omnibus appropriations act, \nwhich would provide full-year funding for all of these departments and \nagencies. That measure contains approximately 1,500 pages of bill \nlanguage, and while I greatly credit Chairman Hatfield, Chairman \nLivingston, and the other House and Senate conferees on the intensive \neffort that has been underway to complete action on this measure, \nseveral issues still remain in a number of the chapters which have \ncaused us to reach the point of bringing this short-term continuing \nresolution to the Senate for its consideration.\n  In addition to the extension of the date of the present continuing \nresolution through April 24th, House Joint Resolution 170 would also \nprovide the District of Columbia with its full payment for the entire \nfiscal year and, importantly, would provide the $198 million requested \nby the President in funds for assistance for Eastern Europe and the \nBaltic States. The need for these funds is immediate, and I support \ntheir inclusion in this short-term continuing resolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate should not be considering the \n12th continuing resolution of this fiscal year. Congress should have \ncompleted work on the fiscal year 1996 budget last October, when it was \nsupposed to have been completed. It is indeed unprecedented and \noutrageous that Congress has so utterly failed to address this year's \nbudget in a timely fashion.\n  It is unprecedented in the history of this Nation to find ourselves 6 \nmonths into the fiscal year with four appropriations bills unfinished. \nThis Senator finds it all the more outrageous that the Senate is \nconsidering another short-term continuing resolution when it could have \neasily completed its work this week.\n  Leaders were in the process of negotiating a number of difficult \nissues that would have led to a reasonable omnibus appropriations bill \nthat the President could sign. Negotiations were progressing on this \nbill, and if they were permitted to continue for only a few more days, \nCongress might be able to complete all of the unfinished business in \nthis year's appropriations process. Because much more work is needed, \nCongress should have stayed in this weekend or into next week to finish \nthe fiscal year 1996 budget.\n  But the majority insists on leaving for a 2-week break.\n  The omnibus bill passed the Senate over a week ago. But the majority \ndid\n\n[[Page S3196]]\n\nnot schedule its first meeting of the conferees until this Wednesday, \nmore than a week after the Senate passed the bill. As a result, \nconferees found themselves working late into the night yesterday, \nactually until 1 a.m. this morning. Still, today they could not \ncomplete the people's business, so Congress is off for a 2-week recess.\n  Instead of working through the difficult issues remaining to be \nresolved in the fiscal year 1996 budget, the Republican leadership \ndecided to delay with yet another stopgap measure. And the American \npeople will pay the price.\n  Continued government by continuing resolution spells slow death on \nthe installment plan for a number of critical Government programs. The \nfunding levels are simply too low to adequately fund a number of basic \nfunctions of Government. In addition, the uncertainty facing Government \nagencies and the people they serve has undermined the effectiveness of \nprograms designed to improve our children's education, clean up the \nenvironment, and put police on the streets.\n  Under the 12 continung resolutions this year, education is suffering \ndrastic funding cutbacks. Schools can't plan. Children, teachers, and \nfamilies are being shortchanged.\n  Environmental cleanup efforts have been slowed, and superfund sites \nleft unattended.\n  Because of reductions in the COPS Program, fewer police are on our \nstreets.\n  Having said that, it is important to note that this continuing \nresolution does accomplish several important goals that I fully \nsupport.\n  First, the District of Columbia is finally provided in this \nlegislation the balance of its Federal payment for the rest of this \nfiscal year.\n  Another provision clarifies that Federal Aviation Administration \nlabor representatives retain their statutory role.\n  Perhaps most important is the $200 million in reconstruction aid for \nBosnia contained in this bill. This money is critically important if \nthe Dayton Accord's peace plan is to be implemented successfully. \nBosnia's infrastructure has sustained great damage in its years of war, \nand this aid is critically needed to help with the restoration effort. \nI am pleased it was included.\n  Nevertheless, on balance, this legislation does not deserve the \nsupport of this body. I will vote no on this continuing resolution, not \nbecause of what it includes, but because of what it does not include--\nthe essential education, environment, and law enforcement services it \nfails to provide--and because of the mismanagement it represents. \nCongress should remain in session and finish the real work that should \nhave been completed 6 months ago.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin \nbe recognized for his time following Senator Kennedy in the previous \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. Without \nobjection, the joint resolution is considered as having been read for \nthe third time.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the joint \nresolution. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

With respect to the prospective passage of \nHouse Joint Resolution 170, the yeas are 64, and the nays are 24. And \nthe joint resolution is deemed passed.\n  So the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 170) was deemed passed.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe joint resolution was deemed passed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take only a few moments. I know the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee has pending business.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to comment a little bit on the continuing \nresolution that we just passed--and to express my dismay and perhaps a \nlittle bit of frustration at what has happened here in the last week or \nso, and with this continuing resolution.\n  I took the floor a couple of weeks ago. I said March madness is in \nfull swing around the country with all of the basketball games going on \nwith the men's final four and the women's NCAA. But beyond that, Mr. \nPresident, in school after school in Iowa and across this country \nschool administrators and school boards are wrestling with the decision \nabout which teachers will lose their jobs and which students will not \nget title I reading assistance.\n  They are contemplating what vocational educational activities will go \nby the wayside; how to deal with the cuts in the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchool Program. The list goes on.\n  In my State of Iowa, school districts must send the layoff notices by \nApril 30, a mere 6 days after this resolution expires.\n  That means school districts will have less than a week to make \nimportant decisions about how many teachers they will be able to keep \non the payroll, how many kids will be denied the opportunity to improve \ntheir reading and math skills. In the next 4 weeks, the uncertainty \nabout the level of funding for our schools will cause problems for many \nfamilies. Teachers and their families are worried about their jobs and \nparents are worried about their kids and about being denied the most \nbasic help they can get.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to read the whole letter, but I have \nhere a letter from a parent of a child who is in the title I program. \nThe letter is dated March 7. These parents are saying that their son \nhas had tremendous help and tremendous improvement because of title I, \nand she said:\n\n       I wish you could personally follow our son's progress. This \n     program has truly been a godsend for him and for us. We feel \n     confident he can attend future grades with an excellent \n     attitude toward school because of what title I has gained for \n     him--most importantly, his self-esteem and attitude. Yes, he \n     is still going to struggle some but not as severely as it \n     would be without the aid of chapter 1.\n\n  For these parents and for our children and school boards and school \ndistricts across the country what we are doing today really is not much \nhelp.\n  I have here two articles that were in the newspaper in Cedar Rapids, \nIA, the\n\n[[Page S3197]]\n\nCedar Rapids Gazette. The first one is dated February 27, and it says \n``6 Schools To Lose Remedial Reading.''\n  ``Cedar Rapids district cites expected $350,000 cut in Federal \nfunds,'' in the title I program. That is February 27.\n  Shortly after that, the Senate adopted the Specter-Harkin amendment, \nwhich was supported, I might add, on this floor with a strong \nbipartisan vote, 84 votes in favor of the Specter-Harkin amendment, to \nput the money back in for title I and other education programs. So now \nhere is the followup article on March 14 in the Cedar Rapids Gazette. \n``Senate Restores Reading Funds.'' And it talks about the Specter-\nHarkin amendment, that it was approved 84 to 16.\n  Well, I guess tomorrow there will be another story in the Cedar \nRapids Gazette; they will go right back to this: ``Cedar Rapids To Lose \nRemedial Reading.''\n  What kind of a yo-yo is this to these people? These are parents like \nthe one who just wrote me this letter about their son who has been in \ntitle I, still in title I. What are they to think? What are the \nteachers to think? How about the school boards? Pink slips are going to \nbe going out pretty soon.\n\n  I had the Farm Bureau in here this week. I talked at a breakfast to \nmy Farm Bureau members. After it was over, I had a couple of the people \nwho were there at the Farm Bureau meeting come up to me. They did not \nwant to talk about farm programs. They wanted to talk about what we are \ngoing to do about title I, because they serve on the local school \nboards and they saw what was happening to their funding cuts and how \nmuch they needed this program. Their basic question was, ``What should \nwe do?''\n  I had to answer, ``Well, I thought we were going to get the \nappropriations bill through that would have the funding for you.'' I \nwas confident we would do that. Well, today, with this short-term CR, \nwe do not have it. We go back down to the lower levels on title I \nfunding.\n  Mr. President, that is why I voted no on this--not that I wish to \nshut the Government down, but we were very close to having an \nagreement. This is the 12th CR of this year--the 12th one. It is a \nprescription for disaster for our kids. If the cuts in this bill are \nallowed to continue, the Iowa Department of Education estimates that \nacross the State, 7,300 fewer students will get title I assistance; 200 \nteachers will be laid off. This scenario will be repeated in every \nsingle State and school district across the country: 40,000 teachers \nwill be laid off nationwide as a result of this $1.1 billion cut in \ntitle I.\n  Mr. President, the sixth national education goal calls upon us to \nensure that by the turn of the century every adult American will be \nliterate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete \nin the global economy, but the deep cut in job training programs in \nthis bill is a retreat from that goal. These cuts could not come at a \nworse time. You can hardly pick up a newspaper or turn on the evening \nnews without seeing yet another story about downsizing some company, \nworkers are put out of work, dislocations caused by downsizing.\n  Last year, JTPA assisted 105 workers who lost their jobs in the small \ntown of LeMars, IA; 85 individuals employed in the small town of \nSergeant Bluff, IA. The cuts in retraining for dislocated workers means \nthat next year 300 fewer Iowans will benefit from such assistance.\n  In the Senate, we acted in a bipartisan manner to correct these \nproblems. As I said, Senator Specter and I worked together with the \nassistance of Senator Hatfield. We crafted a bipartisan compromise to \nrestore most of the cuts to these education and training programs. \nAgain, as I said, the Senate passed the amendment 84 to 16. It was a \npowerful signal from this body on a bipartisan basis that we wanted to \nmove ahead and fund these programs, get the money out, and send a clear \nsignal to our schools, our teachers, and our parents across the country \nthat we were going to fund these programs.\n\n  Well, we were meeting, and I must say that Senator Specter sat there \nday after day in meetings with our House counterparts. I would join \nhim. We had already worked out our differences. We did not have any \ndisagreements. But we could not quite seem to get over a lot of these \nhurdles.\n  Finally, we worked out our differences. We had our agreements made. \nBut there were some riders that were attached, riders that more \nappropriately belong in the authorizing committees, not the \nAppropriations Committee, that held this up. Therefore, we could not \nreach an agreement. But we were very close.\n  Again, I wish to pay my respects and my thanks to the chairman of our \nAppropriations Committee. I was there last night. We were all dogged \ntired at about 1 a.m. in the morning, and he wanted to continue. He \nwanted to finish it, because I know the Senator from Oregon realizes \nhow important these programs are. And he was reflecting the will of \nthis body, the 84 votes that we had, to make sure that we reached an \nagreement and moved ahead.\n  I daresay, I do not know how many hours and how many days the Senator \nfrom Oregon put in in the last 2 or 3 weeks trying to get this thing \nput together, working, as I said, to the midnight hour and beyond last \nnight, to make sure we did not have these draconian cuts. All of that \nwork we have done, all the work that we did in a bipartisan fashion in \nthe Senate, all of the work that Senator Hatfield has done has now been \nthrown overboard. All of us lost in this bill which continues the \ndraconian cuts of the previous 11 continuing resolutions.\n  We were close. I am deeply disappointed. I heard last night--we had a \nbreak in our conference last night, and I heard some rumblings from \npeople that there was going to be a short-term CR. So I expressed my \nopinion in the conference last night. I said: Here we are; we are \nworking trying to reach these agreements, coming very close, but if the \nrug is going to be pulled out from underneath us by a short-term CR, \nthen why are we here?\n  I feel that if we are going to continue like this, then what use is \nit of the Appropriations Committee to try to hammer out these \nagreements. These are tough negotiations. And yet we reached all the \nnumbers. We had no problems with our numbers. We had agreed on all of \nthe numbers. We had agreed on the offsets. We had a few items, as I \nsaid, some disagreements on riders which more appropriately belong with \nthe authorizing committee, not the Appropriations Committee, and as the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee knows, if the authorizing \ncommittees would do their work and get the authorizing down, we would \nnot have the riders on our bill holding us up.\n\n  So I thank Chairman Hatfield for his doggedness and his \ndetermination, and I am just sorry that the rug got pulled out from \nunderneath us. Those are not his words; those are mine. But that is \nexactly how I feel. I hoped before that that would be the last CR. I \nhope this is the last CR. If it is not, we are really going to be in \ntough shape, and I think a lot of our school districts around the \ncountry now are just going to throw up their hands in despair; they \nthought they were going to have the cuts. Then they thought they were \ngoing to be restored. I know from talking to people in Iowa that they \nthought they could now go ahead and plan for their schools next year \nbecause of that overwhelming vote we had in the Senate. Well, now they \ndo not know what to do.\n  Mr. President, this is no way to run the Government. This is no way \nto govern. It is totally and absolutely irresponsible. And all I can \nsay is, I sure hope this is the last short-term CR. I hope the good \nwork we have done on appropriations we can hold onto, that when we come \nback from the Easter break, rather than starting all over again, we can \npick up where we were and hopefully have this resolution done \nexpeditiously so that we can get our funding out for education, worker \ntraining, dislocated workers, Head Start, and all the other programs so \nvital to the future of our country.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to express my thanks to the \nSenator from Iowa for his analysis of the situation we find ourselves \nin as the Appropriations Committee. I would also like to again \nreiterate that we have 13 appropriations subcommittees. In other words, \nwe have 13 subcommittees with chairs for each of those subcommittees, \nranking members for each\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\none of those subcommittees. I think our committee is unique in that \nsense, because we do not bring a bill to the floor unless it has been a \nbill developed on a bipartisan basis within each of those \nsubcommittees.\n  Mr. Harkin, our colleague from Iowa, was formerly chairman of the \nLabor-HHS Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, which now is \nchaired by Senator Specter, of Pennsylvania. So he brought into that \npartnership that kind of background and understanding, as we have on \nmost every one of our subcommittees. The chair is now being occupied by \nthe Senator from Washington State, who chairs the Interior \nSubcommittee. His ranking member is former chairman, Senator Byrd.\n  So, in effect, we have been jointly producing these bills; it is \nbipartisan, and giving the Senate a very strong position. Then, when we \nwent to conference, we had 40 Democrats and 39 Republicans voting for \nthe Senate product, including both the leaders, the Republican leader \nand the Democratic leader.\n  Sure, we knew we were going to be in tough negotiations, but, \nnevertheless, we had a great number of accomplishments. We had, as the \nSenator knows, 12 of our 13 subcommittees involved, most of them with \nlanguage, but with 5 unresolved appropriation bills. We were able to \nreduce the five to two. In other words, we closed the chapters on three \nof them. We closed the chapter on a couple of the others that were in \nthe language area. So that, in effect, when we come back on April 15 \nand we take up the unfinished business of the Labor-HHS, for which the \nSenator from Iowa is the ranking member, we will have the figures, the \ndollars, pretty well resolved, as the Senator has said. We are now \ntalking about language, riders.\n  I wish we did not have them. I wish we would have those issues taken \nup by the authorizers where they belong. But there is a trend line \nupward, by the fact that the authorizing actions have become very, very \nslow. As an example, the Endangered Species Act; 4 years ago it \nexpired. We, in the Appropriations Committee, have been keeping it \nfunded and keeping it going.\n  I could say that when there was an effort made by a few of my \ncolleagues to convince me, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nthat we should not fund expired authorization programs, I did not have \nany idea what the scope of that might be, so I went to CBO. I asked CBO \nto give us a quick analysis of the expired authorizations that we were \ncontinuing to fund. Mr. President, $95 billion is what they came up \nwith for their estimate on expired authorizations; a goodly percentage \nof them in the Justice Department, and particularly those relating to \nfighting crime--expired authorizations.\n\n  So we, in effect, have almost taken on double our responsibility, of \nnot only funding but, assuming that in that funding we authorize for \nthat year, we extend the authorization that has expired. It is not a \ntask that we have desired or we have asked for.\n  I like to always remind our colleagues, no other committee but the \nAppropriations Committee has to pass legislation. Every other committee \ncan consider authorization, but there is no basic command to perform. \nOnly the Appropriations Committee must keep the Government running. We \nhave to pass a bill--in fact, 13 of them. So, lots of times, knowing \nthat, we get piggybacked. Others who are finding an inability to either \nextend authorization or renew authorization or deal with authorizing \nitems come and piggyback on the appropriations bill. We are taking on \nthose duties, but I am saying to the Senator, there are a lot of \nreasons why this situation becomes increasingly difficult.\n  I thank the colleagues on the committee. I have never seen a more \ndedicated group working together on a bipartisan basis to do their duty \nas I have with the subcommittees of our Appropriations Committee and \nthe staff. I just cannot pay too high a tribute to the staffs on both \nsides that assist the members. It is a collegial experience.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness in order to introduce a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatfield pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1662 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oregon yield the floor?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I would just take 1 minute from my \nother remarks to say, though this may have been the last major \nappropriations conference the distinguished Senator from Oregon \nmanages, with his fairly delicate but forceful touch, as I watched him \nas a member of the committee deal with a number of issues, a number of \ntemperaments, always with his excellent eye on the mission, I marvel at \nSenator Hatfield's patience and diligence and skill.\n  This is no time for eulogies or good-byes, but he will be missed. \nThat aisle does not separate our friendship in any way at all. As a \nmatter of fact, few issues separate our friendship. But my respect for \nhis ability, for his service to country will be a permanent thing. I \nhope that it is also recognized in this body of ours that too few times \ndo we have an opportunity to work with someone who has the kind of \ncompassion and concern that is essential if one is to render the best \nservice possible to this country of ours.\n  I thank the Senator for his sacrifices, for his willingness to bend \nto the task, and his skill for getting the job done for so many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3198-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3198-S3200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO KATHLEEN STANFIELD WEINSTEIN\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nconstituent of mine whose name was Kathleen Stanfield Weinstein.\n  Unfortunately, she has been in the papers a lot in this last week. \nHer life was at once ordinary and extraordinary. She was a resident of \na town called Tinton Falls in New Jersey. She was a wife to her \nhusband, Paul, and the mother to their 6-year-old son, Daniel. Mrs. \nWeinstein taught special education classes at Thorne Middle School in \nMiddletown Township in New Jersey.\n  She was a teacher, the kind of a teacher that we all wish our \nchildren had at some point in their education. She had begun a program \nin which children were given special recognition for committing \n``random acts of kindness,'' toward their fellow students and the \ncommunity--random acts of kindness. Everyone knows that plays on other \nwords. The other words will become clearer in focus as I discuss Mrs. \nWeinstein's end of life.\n  Today, Mr. President, the billboard in front of Thorne Middle School \nreads ``Mrs. Weinstein, Thank You for Your Random Acts of Kindness. We \nWill Miss You.''\n  She did not retire, Mr. President. Some days ago while on her way to \ntake a test for a graduate school course, Kathleen Weinstein did what \nso many of us do ordinarily. She stopped at a local delicatessen in a \nshopping mall for a sandwich. When she returned to her car, a young man \njumped in the car with her, threatened her, saying he had a gun, and \nabducted her with the car. Some time later, a day or so, her body was \nfound in a wooded area where she had been smothered with her own coat.\n  Unfortunately, in these times, Mr. President, this kind of event does \nnot seem extraordinary. Indeed, Kathleen Weinstein was an extraordinary \nwoman. At some time during her ordeal she had the presence of mind to \nreach into her coat pocket and turn on a small tape recorder. She \nrecorded the conversation that she had with her soon-to-be killer, \ncapturing her final conversation.\n  Kathleen Weinstein pleaded for her life, but not until she had \nengaged her young--turned out to be 17-year-old--attacker, just turned \n17, in what has been described as ``a meaningful conversation about a \ngreat many things.''\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\n They talked about the consequences for his young life, and there was \nstill time, she cautioned him, to turn things around. They talked about \n``what happens by the decisions * * * that you make.''\n\n  The young man did not take her advice. You see, he was about to \nbecome 17 years old, and in New Jersey that is the age for a driving \nlicense. He wanted a car just like hers. So he took it. In the process, \nhe took her life--a despicable, horrible, outrageous act.\n  Mr. President, Kathleen Stanfield Weinstein's exceptional character \nand tragic death have touched the heart of Americans from around the \ncountry. It is ironic that a woman dedicated to teaching random acts of \nkindness to our children should be taken by a single random act of \nviolence. She was ordinary, yet extraordinary. The legacy of her life \nwill continue to touch New Jerseyans for a long, long time to come.\n  I have an excerpt from a newspaper, the Cincinnati Post, that \nincludes some of the conversation that she had with this young man. I \nwill take the liberty of reading some parts of it.\n\n       In a secretly recorded tape she hid in her coat pocket, the \n     teacher is heard doing everything she can to reason with a \n     teen-age carjacker, authorities said. Eventually she breaks \n     down and begs in vain for her life.\n\n  She says to him, ``You haven't done anything yet. All you have to do \nis let me go and take my car.''\n\n       The woman's miniature tape recorder clicked to a stop \n     before she was smothered with her own coat and other pieces \n     of clothing, officials said.\n       She ``valiantly and persistently used every skill and power \n     she had to convince her attacker to simply take her car and \n     not her life,'' [the prosecutor] said.\n       This 24-minute recording provides the key piece of evidence \n     against the 17-year-old suspect.\n\n  Through this article are accurate, precise statements that she made. \nThe attack was described this way:\n\n       After her attacker grabbed her from behind and forced his \n     way into her car at gunpoint, she managed to turn on the \n     voice-activated miniature cassette player hidden in a bag.\n\n  She said to him, before he killed her,\n\n       Don't you understand, though, what kind of trouble you are \n     going to get in? Don't you think they are going to find you? \n     You haven't done anything yet. All you have to do is let me \n     go and take my car. For my life, don't you think I should be \n     concerned and let you take my car? For my life! Do you really \n     want that on your head?\n\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the full article as it \nappeared in the Cincinnati Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Cincinnati Post, Mar. 20, 1996]\n\nTeacher's Final Minutes Taped Secret Recording: She Begs Carjacker For \n                                  Life\n\n       When investigators found the body of Kathleen Weinstein, \n     she was still able to tell them about her last moments alive.\n       In a secretly recorded tape she hid in her coat pocket, the \n     teacher is heard doing everything she can to reason with a \n     teen-age carjacker, authorities said. Eventually she breaks \n     downs and begs in vain for her life.\n       ``You haven't done anything yet. All you have to do is to \n     let me go and take my car,'' Ms. Weinstein tells the boy.\n       The woman's miniature tape recorder clicked to a stop \n     before she was smothered with her own coat and other pieces \n     of clothing, officials said.\n       ``I have no doubt Kathleen Weinstein spoke to us through \n     that tape,'' prosecutor Daniel Carluccio said as he released \n     transcripts of the tape Tuesday.\n       She ``valiantly and persistently used every skill and power \n     she had to convince her attacker to simply take her car and \n     not her life,'' he said.\n       The 24-minute recording provides the key piece of evidence \n     against the 17-year-old suspect-identified only as M.L.--who \n     was caught Sunday driving the women's car. His first name, \n     age and details about his past were on the tape.\n       The prosecutor read some of Ms. Weinstein's comments but \n     did not disclose any of the youth's taped comments.\n       He was jailed on murder and carjacking charges. Carluccio \n     said he would seek to have him tried as an adult.\n       Ms. Weinstein, 45, of Tinton Falls, disappeared Thursday \n     after staying home from her job as a special education \n     teacher to study for a graduate school exam. She was en route \n     to take the test when she stopped to buy a sandwich.\n       After her attacker grabbed her from behind and forced his \n     way into her car at gunpoint, she managed to turn on the \n     voice-activated miniature cassette player hidden in a bag, \n     Carluccio said. She later removed the tape and slipped it in \n     her coat.\n       her body was found Sunday in woods near a highway in \n     Berkley Township. She leaves a husband and 6-year-old son.\n       Text of fax box follows:\n       A victim's final words\n       Here are excerpts from the 24-minute recording made by \n     Kathleen Weinstein, the teacher who secretly recorded her \n     pleas to a teen-ager who police said stole her car and then \n     killed her. Authorities provided only selected quotes:\n       ``Don't you understand, though, what kind of trouble you \n     are going to get in? Don't you think they are going to find \n     you?''\n       ``You haven't done anything yet. All you have to do is to \n     let me go and take my car.''\n       ``For my life, don't you think I should be concerned and \n     let you take my car? For my life!''\n       ``Do you really want to have that on your head?''\n       ``Why don't you just tell me? Of course it's important, \n     it's determining your whole life and the direction you're \n     taking. It's important. We're here for a purpose. That's what \n     happens by the decisions and things that you make.''\n       ``Whatever trouble you're in, you didn't add to it yet, \n     right?''\n       ``I'll make you a promise that I won't tell anybody. \n     Because you won't be taking my car and you won't be hurting \n     me. And maybe you can get away another way.''\n       ``You can't have a life of crime like this. You'll wind up \n     spending your life in prison if you don't get killed.''\n       On her plans to take in a foster child or adopt a child: \n     ``I want to give something to somebody, to give . . . to give \n     something back.''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I make particular point of this horrible murder \nbecause it strikes a chord in all of us of our disappointment in the \nviolence that threads our society, whether it is a young kid like this \nout to take a car or another youngster out to take a jacket--a \nsenseless killing. Or like the killing recently here in Washington, DC, \na 15-year-old boy, apparently a nice young man, good student, in trying \nto defend an argument between his younger sibling and another child--\nstabbed to death.\n  Mr. President, I ask a question that must go on in every home in \neveryone's mind in America: When will we stop this violence? How do we \nstop it? We sure do not stop it by a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives that says, ``Take away the ban on assault weapons. Let \nthem have their assault weapons. That is part of freedom in America.'' \nThat is nonsense.\n  If I was not on public record I would use other words, perhaps, to \ndescribe it--to make sure that people could get their hands on weapons \nthat are designed to kill people. That is what the vote was over \nthere--some 230 votes for, and against, 170.\n  I fought in World War II, Mr. President. I was no war hero, but I \ncarried a weapon that could fire less shots than these assault weapons. \nI was supposed to kill the guys on the other side of the line. I was \nnot called on to do it and they did not do it to me, either. The fact \nof the matter is the weapons issued to me as a soldier in the European \ntheater were far less menacing than the kind of weapons we want to make \nsure everybody in America has, because the National Rifle Association \nsays that is what we ought to do--make sure we free people up so they \ncan bear their arms against their fellow citizens. That is hardly a way \nfor a civilized society to conduct itself. When will we be so sick of \nviolence that we will say no, no, no, you just cannot get a gun because \nyou want one, and you are going to have to wait and pass a test just \nlike you do when you want to drive a car?\n\n  In my State, and in every State in this country, in the State of the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair, there is a confrontation that \ncould very well result in death and disaster. Lots of weapons are \ninvolved. In my State, a man walked into the post office in Montclair, \nmy hometown, and shot four people. He is an ex-employee of the post \noffice. At the Long Island Railroad out of New York City, a man shot \nand killed a number of people, one of them a young woman from New \nJersey, whose parents I know. He did not know them, did not ever see \nthem before.\n  We hear about children picking up guns and killing other children. We \nhear about despondent daughters or sons taking their father's \nlegitimately owned gun and blowing their heads off. We had four kids \ncommit suicide in New Jersey a couple of years ago. They got hold of \nweapons and killed one another. There are disgruntled employees, \ndisappointed partners, and family members who kill everybody in the \nfamily.\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\n  We hear this trite old expression that makes me ill: ``Guns do not \nkill people, people kill people.'' Well, how do people get the ability \nto kill other people? I never heard of a drive-by knifing.\n  Mr. President, one of these days, we are going to have to come to our \nsenses about gun ownership, the proliferation of guns. I have \nlegislation that I introduced the other day to reduce, on a Federal \nlevel, purchases of guns more than once a month. One gun a month, 12 \nguns a year. That does not sound like much of a restriction. But we \nhave a fight on our hands. Maryland just passed it in one of the bodies \nof legislature there, in their Senate. It is predicted that it will go \nthrough with dispatch. Virginia has a one-gun-a-month program. Because \nVirginia has a limit of 1 gun a month--can you imagine, 12 guns a year \nare able to be purchased? They have reduced the gun presence in the \nNortheast of guns coming from the State of Virginia by 60-some percent \nby restricting gun purchases to one gun a month. The madness of it all. \nIn order to protect those who demand an arsenal, they can buy 12 guns a \nyear. It does not seem like that is a necessary thing to me.\n  But I am willing to take whatever steps I can to reduce the \nproliferation of guns in our society. I have become friends with Sarah \nand Jim Brady. I would not have before Jim was shot because we were in \ndifferent parties and of different political or philosophical \npersuasions, because I never belonged to a gun organization. But Jim \nBrady was a good friend of the National Rifle Association, until \nsomeone attempted to kill President Reagan and shot Jim Brady in the \nattack. Jim Brady, who has been physically disabled, wheelchair bound \nsince that time, has turned the opposite way, and so did his wife, when \nthey saw what a terrible thing a gun could do. There are others I have \nmet who used to support the National Rifle Association agenda, and when \nthey suddenly see violence in their homes, they are opposed to gun \nownership as randomly as it exists in this country.\n\n  I have also introduced legislation that says that anyone convicted of \neven a misdemeanor on domestic violence charges should not be able to \nown a gun. Right now, someone who has indicated that their rage is so \nimpossible to control that they can come home and beat up their wife or \nkids and get convicted and stand in front of a judge in Baltimore \nCounty, and he says, ``I cannot assign criminal penalties to someone \nwho is not a criminal,'' after the man killed his wife. He gave him \ncommunity service and, I think, 5 months in jail after he killed his \nwife. He does not call it a criminal act.\n  Now, Mr. President, we cannot do the job by simply building more \njails. There was an editorial piece, an op-ed piece, in the New York \nTimes the other day--and that is not gospel, but it was reporting \nfacts--written by Anthony Lewis. He said that the biggest program for \nbuilding in California was the building of jails. While the number of \nstudents per teacher increases, meaning less attention to the students' \nneeds, jails are being built. I think criminals ought to be punished \nand punished hard. But I think we also ought to look at what it is that \ndrives all these people to criminality with all of the penalties that \nwe impose, each of them getting longer and larger and tougher. That has \nnot curbed the violence problem. Maybe we ought to say, hey, perhaps \nthere is a different way to do this and examine the alternative. I hope \nthat we will, Mr. President.\n  If I sound agitated, I am. I think about this young woman, a devoted \nparent and teacher, a teacher of the type that we all respect and want \nin our schools. She was murdered by some young punk who decides he \nwants her car. He was encouraged by what he sees on television and what \nhe sees in gun ownership. She is threatened by a gun and did not even \nknow that it existed, but she knows when someone says they have a gun, \nvery often that is the case.\n  I hope we will learn from this courageous woman's death, and many \nother murders around the country, that we ought to do something \ndifferently. I hope that police departments across the country will \nstart to prepare some advisory so that women can protect themselves. I \nhave heard--and I do not know whether this is true; I state it \nsecondhand--that a woman is better off to resist in a public place than \nto permit herself to be taken out of the public limelight. I do not \nknow whether it is true, but I hope police departments--I would like to \nsee police departments across the country prescribe actions in response \nto an attack of that type, to do something to protect themselves, to \nthwart the intentions of somebody who wants to take their lives, or \ntake their property first and, typically, then their lives, and often \nwhether or not the property is gained.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope we do not have to keep on discussing these \nkinds of things in the U.S. Senate, or in the Congress, or in our \nGovernment, and that we can look forward to a more peaceful time within \nour society. We are all shocked and horrified by the prospect of \nmilitary engagement in Bosnia and in other parts of the world, and we \nlook with horror upon the period in Vietnam when so many of our young \npeople fought bravely and gallantly against a bad policy decision. We \nlost 50,000 people in the period of years that the Vietnam war went on. \nNow we lose over 15,000 people a year in this country to gun murders. \nUnfortunately, it does not get a lot of attention.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3198-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CORRECTION OF THE RECORD\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe it was on March 21 that I spoke on \nthis floor in reference to Senator Sam Nunn and the late Senator \nRichard B. Russell and their fine work on the Armed Services Committee \nof the Senate. I made a comparison in the course of those remarks of \nMr. Nunn to Marshal Michael Ney, who was one of the top officers in \nNapoleon's army. I referred to Marshal Ney's having been separated from \nthe army of Napoleon, but having fought his way back to join the army. \nHe fought through thousands of cossacks and had come to the river \nDnieper, D-n-i-e-p-e-r. He had lost all of his guns, but he crossed the \nriver and rejoined the main forces of Napoleon's army.\n  I stated that Napoleon was overjoyed when he heard that Marshal Ney \nhad escaped and rejoined the army. And he made the comment to other \nofficers at that point--he said, ``I have more than 400 million francs \nin the cellars,'' c-e-l- l-a-r-s, ``of the Tuileries,'' T-u-i-l-e-r-i-\ne-s. ``I would gladly have given them all for the ransom of my old \ncompanion in arms.''\n\n  Well, I suppose I was talking like I had my mouth full of turnips, \nand the official reporter did not get the name of the river correctly \nspelled--D-n-i-e-p-e-r--Dnieper; the reporter substituted the name of \nthe river Niemen, N-i-e-m-e-n. It was a river in White Russia. When I \nsaw that name I thought, ``My, I never heard of the name of such a \nriver.'' So I went to Webster's dictionary and I found there, indeed, \nthe name of a river called the Niemen River. So it sounded very much \nlike the Dnieper River.\n  I make these remarks today, Mr. President, just to call attention to \nthe error which was inadvertent on the part of the reporter and was \nreally my fault. I ask unanimous consent that the permanent Record be \nshown to state that it was the Dnieper River, D-n-i-e-p-e-r, not the \nNiemen River, to which I referred in my remarks. I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3200-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.J.

Mr. President, a little more than an hour ago, the Senate \nvoted for the 12th time in this 6 months of the 1996 fiscal year for a \nshort-term continuing resolution for many of our most important Federal \nagencies.\n  Mr. President, I voted for that continuing resolution as I have for \nits predecessors out of a sense of frustration and the absence of any \nother reasonable alternative. But, Mr. President, I am taking this \noccasion to announce that will be my last vote for such a continuing \nresolution because I believe that we are acting in a highly \nirresponsible and embarrassing--and adverse to the interests of the \npeople of this Nation--manner by the way in which we are conducting the \nfiscal affairs of this great Nation.\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\n  When the Congress, or any other entity responsible for spending \nfunds, sets out to enact a budget, one of those important goals of such \nenactment is to chart the future. The essence of budgeting is to carry \nout a plan with certain objectives and destinations. Budgets should be \nthe means by which that plan is given life.\n  In a cruel irony, however, Mr. President, a perverse Washington twice \nhas turned budgeting upside down. The current budget process \nfrustrates--even prevents--effective planning and implementation. \nInstead of reducing uncertainty about the future, our current budget \nprocess--the one that we have followed for the last 6 months--enhances \nuncertainty.\n  How, we would ask, did this happen? We are in the 6th month of the \nFederal fiscal year, but we have still not approved a budget for nine \nof the most important departments of the Federal Government and \nnumerous other Federal agencies. Instead of approving an annual budget \nfor these nine Cabinet departments and Federal agencies, Congress has \npassed now 12 separate continuing resolutions to operate parts of the \nGovernment at 75 percent of funding levels for brief periods of time.\n  Mr. President, this is Band-Aid budgeting, and it is a Band-Aid that \nhurts. These Band-Aid budgets are hurting the very people our \nGovernment is trying to help. And just as important, our failure to \npass a final--a real--budget for 1996 makes planning difficult, if not \nimpossible, for those charged with carrying out the mission of \nassisting our people through or with the financial support of the \nFederal Government.\n  To that lament, some might say, ``So what?'' So what if Government is \ninconvenienced by an uncertain budget process. So what if bureaucrats \nhave to survive with a certain amount of anxiety, uncertainty, and \nclosely bitten nails. To those who say ``So what,'' I offer the simple \ntruth that the way we are doing business with these Band-Aid budgets is \nbad business.\n  When managers cannot plan, when contracts cannot be honored, when \ncommitments cannot be fulfilled, that, Mr. President, is bad business.\n  Today I want to highlight just a few examples of the impact of our \nBand-Aid budgeting. In my State of Florida, we are on the verge of \nshutting down substance abuse programs.\n  Let me repeat that. If we do not straighten out this budget mess \nwithin the State of Florida, there will be a termination of substance \nabuse programs.\n  It is ironic that possibly in the next few weeks we may be \nconsidering the question of whether the United States should punish \nthrough decertification certain countries that we consider to be \ninadequate in their commitment to the fight against the supply of drugs \ncoming into the United States. The irony is that those same countries \nlook north, and they say the reason that there is this supply of drugs \nis because the United States of America is such an overwhelming and \ninordinate user of drugs; it creates such an enormous demand for these \nillegal substances. If we were to send the message to these countries \nthat we are now about to cut off our programs that are intended to deal \nwith the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, they might be \ninclined to say they should decertify us because we were not using our \nfull efforts in order to deal with this scourge.\n  What is it going to mean in Florida for 150 agencies which are \nproviding substance abuse services--150 agencies and nonprofit groups \nwhich depend in whole or in part on Federal funds for their ability to \nprovide these services?\n  The range of services which will be terminated include \ndetoxification, drug rehabilitation for children, adolescents, and \nadults, in-jail services, and substance abuse prevention.\n  In Florida, 27,000 people a year are referred to detoxification \ncenters. The typical per-day cost of these facilities is $123. If we \nshut down the detoxification centers, we would have some options--more \nexpensive options. We could send these people to jail. We could send \nthese people to a hospital. If we sent them to a hospital, the average \nper-day cost is $450 for detoxification services.\n  One way we deal with heroin addiction in this society is methadone \ntreatment. Many people on methadone are able to live a reasonably \nnormal life and hold down a self-sustaining job. What happens when you \nshut down the methadone programs? People go into withdrawal. The odds \ngo up that these expensive, negative results will occur. There will be \na relapse to heroin or other drugs. There will be the use of dirty \nneedles that spread HIV. Jobs will end, and crime will begin.\n  Mr. President, those are some of the consequences in the area of \nsubstance abuse treatment, education, and prevention that is about to \noccur because of the Band-Aid budgeting in which we are engaged.\n\n  The problem does not, however, end with substance abuse. What about \neducation? In Dade County, Miami, FL, our educators are so uncertain \nabout the next year's school budget that they do not know whether they \nshould retain some 1,000 teachers and aides who are currently providing \neducational services.\n  What is the reason for this uncertainty? The reason is that these \nteaching positions are funded by title I Federal grant dollars. These \nare funds which are used to provide educational services to the most \nat-risk and to the most at-need children.\n  Dade County received approximately $59 million in title I funding \nlast year. How much will Dade County schools receive next year? Mr. \nPresident, your guess is as good as mine because we still do not have a \nbudget.\n  In Fort Myers, I recently visited the Salvation Army. The Salvation \nArmy in Fort Myers, as its counterparts across the country, performs a \nwide variety of valuable services. In southwest Florida, these services \ninclude feeding and housing the homeless, operating a minimum security \nprison, a small hospital, and offering drug and alcohol treatment \nprograms.\n  To provide these services, the Salvation Army in Fort Myers relies on \nthe Federal Government for up to 35 percent of its budget.\n  Let me give you one example of a problem Salvation Army officials are \nfacing in Fort Myers, FL.\n  In an ordinary year, the Salvation Army will receive emergency food \nand shelter funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in \nOctober. As you are aware, Mr. President, this October was no ordinary \nOctober. This has been no ordinary year.\n  As a result of the budget impasse, the emergency funds for food and \nshelter to the Salvation Army did not arrive in Fort Myers in October. \nThe funds did not arrive in November either. December came and passed; \nthere were no funds--and January. It was not until February that the \nSalvation Army received the first allotment of its funds which were \nsupposed to have arrived in October.\n  Now the Salvation Army is waiting once again to receive the remainder \nof its funds for a fiscal year that is now halfway over. Without this \nmoney, the services provided by the good people at the Salvation Army \nin Fort Myers will be severely hampered and the organization may \nexperience a major deficit.\n  In many instances, organizations have not only had to reduce \nservices, but they have had to suspend them altogether.\n  Let me give you another example. This situation was experienced by \nthe Florida Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. The division of \nvocational rehabilitation awards contracts to nonprofit organizations \nto provide rehabilitative services to the disabled. For many \nindividuals, these services offer the only chance to become skilled, \nproductive, independent citizens. Due to the Government shutdown, two \norganizations in Florida which provide these rehabilitative services \nfor disabled citizens, Goodwill and Easter Seals, had to close their \ndoors to the disabled.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. The shutdown caused Goodwill and \nEaster Seals to close their doors to people who are striving to better \nthemselves so that they can find gainful employment. These are the \npractical effects to human beings in the communities, consequences of \nthe Band-Aid budgeting in which we have been engaged.\n  Mr. President, I say enough is enough. Twelve times in six months is \nenough for us to limp along day to day, week to week. This process is \nhaving severe, embarrassing, and hurtful consequences on innocent \npeople. Twelve times we have resorted to these short-term extensions. \nEnough, Mr. President, is enough.\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n  Let us commit ourselves to the completion of the 1996 budget at the \nearliest possible date. Then let us recommit ourselves not to repeat \nanything like this in 1997 or ever again.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3200-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PROVIDING FOR AN ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE TWO HOUSES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment about the \nMedicare Program which our senior citizens are very concerned about and \nmost Americans are very concerned about.\n  Last year, the Medicare trustees told the President and the Congress \nthat the Medicare Program is in financial crisis. Specifically, they \nsaid, and I quote, ``The Federal hospital insurance trust fund which \npays inpatient hospital expenses will be able to pay benefits for only \nabout 7 years and is severely out of financial balance in the long \nrun.''\n  The Medicare trustees were even more blunt. ``The Medicare Program is \nclearly unsustainable in its present form,'' they said. ``The hospital \ninsurance trust fund continues to be severely out of financial balance \nand is projected to be exhausted in 7 years.''\n  That is what they said last year--7 years. In 1995, the trustees were \ntelling us we have 7 years before the part A trust fund ran out of \nmoney. Last year's report projected that this fund would be insolvent \nin the year 2002. Based on the same data, I made a more precise \nprediction that bankruptcy would occur in early February 2002.\n  Very soon, we are going to receive from the Medicare trustees an \nannual update to this report. I have looked at the data that the \ntrustees used to generate their report, and I can say now that last \nyear's projections were too optimistic. This year's report will show \nthat the hospital trust fund is going bankrupt in the year 2001--not \n2002. The projections were too optimistic last year.\n  A year ago my colleagues and I were urging the Senate and the \nPresident to follow the trustees' recommendation and address the \nMedicare financing crisis. This is why the reforms in Medicare were \nproposed last year. This Congress had a choice in 1995, and the choice \nwas to address the Medicare financing crisis, restructure Medicare for \nthe next century by providing seniors with more choices and containing \ncosts to providers, or to ignore the crisis and let the problem \nlanguish for another year.\n  This Congress chose to act to try to save Medicare from the pending \nbankruptcy. When we made the choice, we had a 7-year window available \nto us and to the American people--7 years before part A would be \nbankrupt, without sufficient money to pay its bills.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, that is now down to 5 years. We \nspent a year trying to reform Medicare, only to have the reform fail \nand to have the President veto the reform measures. And we will soon \nofficially hear from the trustees that we lost another year.\n  Last year we were told that we had until 2002. Now we will learn that \nwe have until 2001. The Medicare part A problem is now worse than it \nwas a year ago. Based on the data the trustees will be using in their \nannual report, which we have now had an opportunity to review, I can \npredict for the Senate and for those who are interested, the seniors \nacross America, that the Medicare part A trust fund will be without \nsufficient funds to pay its bills in late May of 2001. Essentially, it \nwill be bankrupt in May of 2001 instead of 2002. This is 5 years and 2 \nmonths from now--5 years and 2 months, not 7 years.\n  It is important to remember that while attention has focused on the \nimpending bankruptcy of part A, the hospital plan, the underlying \nproblem is the uncontrolled spending and the growth of the entire \nprogram.\n  Last year, the Congressional Budget Office projections showed that \nMedicare part A spending was growing at 8 percent a year, and it showed \nthat part B spending was growing at 14 percent a year. There is no \nquestion that if we can slow the growth by reform, if we can make both \npart A and part B more streamlined and in touch and in tune with the \nmodern delivery of health care, we can slow the growth. Our present \nspending is just not sustainable. Simply put, the trust fund will be \nbankrupt in 5 years and 2 months. The remainder is growing at 14 \npercent a year.\n\n  When we pursue that goal of making it sustainable, of slowing \nMedicare spending, one result will be that we will save the part A \ntrust fund, the hospital trust fund. The Balanced Budget Act passed \nthis year by Congress--that is last year, in this year's cycle--and \nvetoed by the President, would have extended the life of part A past \nthe year 2010. That same Medicare reform took the necessary steps \ntoward addressing our long-term entitlement problem. Unfortunately, it, \ntoo, was vetoed when the Balanced Budget Act was vetoed.\n  I do not relish being the bearer of bad news. No one likes to hear \nthat a program as valuable and as important as Medicare is in financial \ntrouble. But we cannot simply bury our heads and hope that the problem \nwill go away. It will not. We spent a year trying to address a problem \nhere in the Congress, and now it appears that that effort may fall \nvictim to a Presidential election. If we wait another year to address \nMedicare, we will be 4 years, if not shorter, from bankruptcy. I am \nconcerned that 1 year from now I will be standing here on the floor of \nthe Senate, reporting on the impending bankruptcy of the part A trust \nfund, and we will have spent a year doing nothing to address it.\n  I hope that is not the case. But I hope that more Senators and more \nleadership in this country will understand that if we do not change \nsome things about the program there will be no program--not for the \nyounger generation, but for seniors who are on the program right now. \nBecause there are many senior citizens who are on the program right now \nwho will still need hospitalization in the year 2001, 5 years from now. \nUnless we choose to do something now, it will not be available to them. \nWe will have spent the money in the trust fund and the bills will be \ncoming in faster than the revenue, and that equals bankruptcy.\n  So, I thought, today, after a careful study of the facts, that I \nwould share this news, bring it to the floor and share it right now. I \nthought, as soon as I had it, I ought to share it with everyone. I \nbelieve what I am saying is correct. I believe I am slightly ahead of \nthe trustees, but I know the information they have, and their experts, \nfor that is shared information. There is no question in my mind the \nfund is going bankrupt faster than was estimated last year, and we are \nnow 5 years and 2 months away from the fund not having money to pay the \nbills of senior citizens who are in hospitals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Are we in morning business at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent I might be able to proceed in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\n\n\n                         THE FDA REFORM MARKUP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today when Americans get up in the \nmorning and brush their teeth, they do not think about whether the \ntoothpaste they are using is safe. When they eat their breakfast they \ndo not think about the safety of the food they are eating. When they \ntake a pill to treat an illness they do not worry about whether the \ndrugs are safe. They do not worry about whether those drugs work. \nAmericans have confidence in all of these products because the Food and \nDrug Administration is an independent agency with enormous credibility.\n  Yesterday, the Senate labor and human resource committee approved a \nFDA reform bill, S. 1477, that will destroy that confidence. S. 1477 \nwill cripple the FDA, and turn many of its functions over to private \nindustry.\n  The history of food and drug legislation is that we have learned from \nthe tragedies of the past. The United States was fortunate to avoid the \nThalidomide tragedy in the 1950's. But in the 1950's and 1960's, we did \nnot avoid the tragedy of DES, Diethylstilbestrol, which causes cancer \nin the daughters of women who took it.\n\n  In the 1970's we did not avoid the tragedy of the Dalkon Shield, \nwhich caused thousands of cases of infertility in women who used it. In \nrecent years we did not avoid the tragedy of the Shiley Heart Valve \nwhich broke and caused many deaths.\n  As a result of the Thalidomide tragedy, we strengthened our drug laws \nin 1962. As a result of the Dalkon Shield tragedy we strengthened our \nmedical device laws in 1976 and we strengthened them again in 1990 \nafter the Shiley valve tragedy.\n  Most recently, we reduced the delays in approving prescription drugs \nwith user fees. As a result, we are now approving drugs faster than the \nUnited Kingdom. We have fixed the drug lag. In fact, the United States \napproves more important new drugs faster than any other country in the \nworld.\n  But equally important, we have the best record in the world of \nblocking the approval of unsafe or ineffective drugs that have to be \nwithdrawn after patients have been killed or injured.\n  The bill reported from the committee goes in the wrong direction. The \nlessons of the past have been turned on their heads, and those who have \nfailed to learn from the history of Thalidomide, Dalkon Shield and DES, \nwill condemn the American public to new device and drug tragedies. The \nbasic theme of the legislation the committee approved is privatization. \nIt says, ``let us return to the days when drug manufacturers decided \nwhat was safe and effective.'' It says, ``let device manufacturers pay \nprivate bodies to determine if their heart valves and pacemakers will \nhelp or harm patients, instead of relying on the scientists at the FDA, \nwho have no interest except the public interest.'' If this bill is \nenacted into law, the Food and Drug Administration will no longer have \nthe principle responsibility for making critical decisions about the \nsafety of the food supply and the safety and effectiveness of drugs and \nmedical devices. Instead, those decisions will be made by private \ncompanies.\n  In the cases of medical devices, those companies will be selected and \npaid by the medical device industry to decide the safety and \neffectiveness of the products. No company that is paid to do product \nreviews can be objective, if future business depends on whether it \ngrants a favorable decision. And to make the conflict of interest even \nmore blatant, it will be up to the regulated industry to determine how \nmuch compensation the regulator will receive for the review.\n  Do you get this? That the medical device company will make the \njudgment as to which individual will come and inspect their particular \nmedical device, and they, the inspector and the company, will work out \nthe terms of payments.\n  If you were one of those inspectors, how long do you think you will \nmake adverse judgments against those companies if you ever expect to \nget paid or hired again? You have a basic, fundamental conflict of \ninterest. Compare this with the current situation where an inspector \nhas no financial interest in making the judgment and bases decisions \nonly upon pure science. That is how we do it at the present time.\n  As I said, we do it very successfully with regard to drugs and \nbiologicals. It is slower with regard to medical devices, and various \nanimal vaccines. We grant the FDA has not done well enough. But over \nthe 30 years that our committee has been reviewing how to speed up the \nFDA, we have only been successful with one major change and that is \nwhen we put on the user fees, with the support of the pharmaceutical \nindustry, with the support of President Bush, and with the support of \nCongress. And we have seen a dramatic change in terms of performance, \nin the approvals; significant reductions in terms of the considerations \nof those items. It has been successful. Now we are about to tamper with \nthat particular effort, which has been reviewed by GAO, and by the \nTufts Medical School, which has been constantly critical of the FDA, \nbut all of them say that this is a program that is working.\n  It is not working as well in the device areas, as I mentioned, but \nwhat we are doing, I believe, is putting seriously at risk the \nsuccessful programs that have been enacted in recent times.\n  In Britain in the last few weeks, we have had a stark demonstration \nof what can happen when the regulatory body charged with protecting the \npublic interest has a conflict of interest.\n  Britain is in a food safety crisis over the meat from cattle with \nmad-cow disease because the Government paid too much attention to \ncommercial interests and not enough attention to the health of \nconsumers. Now, because there is growing concern that mad-cow disease \ncan be linked to a fatal disease in humans, British meat is being \nbanned in every country in the world.\n  In Britain, the public is demanding to know why there is no \nindependent body like America's Food and Drug Administration to protect \nthe public. That is the question on the minds of British consumers.\n  How ironic that just a few days after the mad-cow disease disaster \ncame to light, legislation was approved by our committee to dismantle \nthe regulatory agency that is universally recognized abroad as the gold \nstandard for the world. The FDA is our strongest defense against this \nkind of crisis in the United States. We have the safest food supply and \nthe safest medical products in the world. We should not take any steps \nthat jeopardize the confidence of American consumers in the safety of \nfood and medical products. Yet this bill would seriously weaken current \nprotections.\n  In addition to privatizing review of medical devices, this bill tells \nthe public to trust drug manufacturers to make changes in the \nmanufacturing process without FDA review to determine whether the \nchanges affect safety or effectiveness. Companies under pressure to \nincrease profits sometimes put profits first or simply sometimes make \nmistakes. In fact, most experts believe that mad-cow disease spread \nthroughout Britain by a change in the manufacturing process of animal \nfeed by some companies, the kind of change that S. 1477 leaves up to \nAmerican companies to decide on their own.\n  Under this legislation, no change in the manufacturing process would \nrequire prior approval from the FDA. Yet, a change in the manufacturing \nprocess can determine whether a polio vaccine prevents polio or causes \nit. A change in the manufacturing process can determine whether a blood \ntransfusion is life saving or whether it transmits AIDS or hepatitis to \nthe patient. An independent FDA is needed to protect the public against \nthese tragedies. Commercial interests should not prevail.\n  Further, the bill sets excessive time limits for review with no \nadditional resources. The FDA will be unable to meet these requirements \nand do its job.\n  Even worse, the bill sets the wrong priorities so that every ``me-\ntoo'' drug of little additional therapeutic value receives the same \npriority as urgently needed new cures, and if FDA cannot meet the \nunrealistic time limits in the bill, the agency is required to contract \nits responsibility out, leading to further unacceptable privatization.\n  What did we do in the earlier legislation? We said on the priority \ndrugs, we are going to make sure that these are going to be addressed \nwithin the first 6 months and then those that are of lesser \nsignificance and importance within 12 months. Therefore, the FDA is \nable to use some discretion in the areas of breakthrough drugs. The \nlast drug on\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nAIDS was only about 2\\1/2\\ months under review because FDA had worked \nwith the company further up the line to accelerate the consideration \nand the whole development time.\n  So FDA has been moving in the area of priority drugs. Now what does \nthe legislation say? The legislation says you have to examine all of \nthem, all of the drugs within the 6 months. The fact of the matter is, \nas anybody who understands what goes on out at the FDA knows, the vast \nmajority of those other drugs are ``me-too'' drugs, not the \nbreakthrough drugs.\n  So now instead of bringing focus and attention of the gifted and able \nscientists out at FDA on those drugs that could be breakthrough drugs \nin cancer, in AIDS, in hepatitis, in all kinds of diseases, we are \ngoing to divert their attention to looking after the ``me-too'' drugs \nthat can make extra bucks for the pharmaceutical companies. Is the \npublic interest served there? It is not.\n\n  This is a direct result of the pharmaceutical companies wanting to \nget some additional attention so that they can put on the market and \npromote and advertise and make additional profits from those ``me-too'' \ndrugs. This is unwise, ill-conceived, and bad health policy. Mr. \nPresident, we all know that when the Congress previously acted in a \nbipartisan way with the Executive together with the pharmaceutical \ncompanies, all of them working together, setting the goals, setting the \nstandards, setting the accountability on what the FDA should do--96 \npercent of the goals that were established were achieved, and now we \nare saying, ``Well, that isn't good enough. That isn't good enough even \nthough the GAO says we are the best in the world. That isn't good \nenough, and we are going to change that system,'' alter that system in \na way which I think diminishes the efficiency of the FDA and could very \nwell diminish the opportunities of moving the breakthrough drugs to the \nconsumer in a more orderly, effective, and rapid way.\n  Mr. President, I was talking about the changes in both time limits \nfor the consideration of priority drugs and also about the changes in \nthe manufacturing processes that do not have to have prior approval by \nthe FDA.\n  FDA is the most respected regulatory agency in the world. With too \nfew resources now, FDA still gives us the safest food supply in the \nworld and the best medical products. The FDA seal of approval is \naccepted with confidence and trusted worldwide. American companies \nbenefit immensely from that confidence. This bill will turn that seal \nof approval into a label that cannot pass the truth-in-advertising \ntest. Whether the product is heart valves or blood derivatives or \nvaccines or food, the American people will be at risk.\n  There are ways that FDA should improve. Some products do need to get \nto market faster. FDA should collaborate as much as possible with \ncompanies and researchers to reduce the time of bringing safe and \neffective products to market. They are doing a good job now; they ought \nto do a better one. But we should not gut FDA's independence or the \nlaws that give it that independence.\n  This legislation puts the commercial interests of companies ahead of \nthe best interest of consumers. I am hopeful, Mr. President, that the \nprovisions of S. 1477 that undermine health and safety can be revised \nbefore the bill comes to the floor. I know that Senator Kassebaum is \ncommitted to working with all interested Senators, and I pay tribute to \nSenator Kassebaum. She has spent an enormous amount of time herself on \nthis issue. She has listened to different positions taken by those who \nare committed to the public health interests. She has listened to \nMembers of the Senate.\n  I have the highest regard for her and the way that she has conducted \nthe hearings and the leadership she has provided in this area, but I do \nfind that I come out on a different side than she does with regard to \nthe bill itself.\n  The present bill would destroy the safeguards protecting the American \npeople that have been built up over the decades. It will cripple the \nworld's best regulatory agency. It would be tragic if it became law. \nWhen the American people understand what is in it, I believe they will \nreject it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3202-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3204-S3205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    READ AND SUCCEED--MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF ILLITERACY IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to share some thoughts on a \nsubject of growing concern to many Americans, particularly to parents \nwho seek a better and brighter future for their children through \neducation.\n  It is that we are failing to teach our children to read effectively. \nIn 1940, the literacy rate in the United States was 97 percent. It has \nnow plunged to 76 percent--a rate which is lower than that of over 100 \nother nations.\n  To me, this is intolerable. America's future depends on restoring the \nreading skills of its people.\n  If we value our responsibility for leadership; if we seek to stay \ncompetitive in the world economy, we must address the problem of \nilliteracy in America.\n  We cannot stand by and watch our children sentenced to a life of \nmediocrity and illiteracy.\n  This problem exists in spite of the good intentions of Government and \nthe expenditure of billions of taxpayer dollars over many years.\n  Reading is the most basic skill every child needs to achieve \nindividual success and happiness--both in work and in life. Yet in \nfailing to impart this skill effectively, we are directly undermining \nthe success our children seek and deserve.\n  The evidence of our failure is all around us. Teachers and \nadministrators see it in our schools, where 60 percent of entering \ncollege freshmen find themselves in need of remedial courses in reading \nor math.\n  Employers and businesspeople see it in the workplace, where industry \nspends exorbitant amounts on employee remedial training in basic verbal \nskills. Researchers and scholars detect it in their studies.\n  Hardly a week goes by that we do not see stories in the media about \ndeclining test scores or startling accounts of the growing problem of \nlagging reading skills in America. For example:\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education report known as the \nNational Assessment of Education Progress [NEAP], ``the average reading \nproficiency of 12th grade students declined significantly from 1992 to \n1994.''\n  This important study is widely considered to be one of the best \nbarometers of overall student achievement. It reported that ``70 \npercent of 4th graders, 30 percent of 8th graders, and 64 percent of \n12th graders did not attain a proficient level of reading.'' In other \nwords, these students did not reach a minimum skill level in reading \nwhich is considered necessary to do the work at that grade level.\n  According to a recent 5-year study, entitled ``Adult Literacy in \nAmerica,'' conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, \nsimilar startling results were found. It stated that: 42 million \nAmericans, 22 percent of the population cannot read; 50 million, 27 \npercent, can recognize so few printed words they are limited to a \nfourth or fifth grade reading level; 55 to 60 million, 30 percent, are \nlimited to sixth, seventh, or eighth grade reading levels; only 30 \nmillion, 16 percent, have ninth and tenth grade reading levels; only 6 \nto 7 million, 3.5 percent, demonstrated skills necessary to do college \nlevel work.\n\n  SAT scores have declined steadily for most of the last 35 years. \nVerbal achievement has declined by nearly 90 points since 1960.\n  A U.S. Department of Labor study found that 20 percent of U.S. high \nschool graduates could not even read their diplomas.\n  Mr. President, this is serious. All of this has consequences--in our \neconomy, in our standard of living, in our competitive position in the \nworld, and in our national security. For example:\n  The lower the literacy rate: the less productive our economy becomes, \nthe less hours are worked and the less money they make in the form of \nwages and income, the higher the incidence of crime and welfare and \ntheir costs to society, the less effectively we are able to compete in \nworld markets, the less capability we will have in our Armed Forces \nwhich are increasingly dependent on advanced technology and highly \ntrained personnel as opposed to just sheer numbers.\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\n  Clearly, our level of literacy is closely linked to our success in \nthe world. If we fix this problem, the benefits will spread through our \nentire society. I firmly believe that if we know how to read, we will \nknow how to succeed.\n  Secretary of Education Richard Riley recently confirmed the problem \nwhen he said:\n\n       Our Nation's reading scores are flat and have been flat for \n     far too long . . . Too many of our young people are groping \n     through school without having mastered the most essential and \n     basic skill.\n\n  Riley said that ``the most urgent task'' facing American schools is \nto improve reading instruction. So we know the problem exists. We can \nrejoice there is a solution.\n  Right now, we can take a giant step forward simply by doing what we \ncan to demonstrate and celebrate what works when it comes to basic \nreading instruction.\n  Mr. President, we know what works in teaching children and adults to \nread. We can point to evidence backed by more than 60 years of \neducational research and experience.\n  What works is when our teachers and administrators return their \nemphasis to the use of phonics as the basis of reading skills \ninstruction. Phonics refers to that body of knowledge which allows us \nto break down the letters of the alphabet into sounds so that words can \nbe deciphered and sounded out according to simple rules.\n  With phonics-based programs, students learn not by memorizing huge \nnumbers of whole words, but rather by mastering the very limited number \nof sounds and corresponding letter combinations which are the building \nblocks of all words. With this essential grounding, they are better \nequipped to move ahead to learn more advanced reading skills and \ntechniques.\n  I do not argue that phonics is the only answer to the many problems \nfaced by today's teachers in improving reading skills. The breakdown of \nthe family, the impact of television, the force of popular culture--all \nof these and more pose challenges which were unheard of a generation \nago. But clearly it is time for the pendulum in emphasis to swing back \ntoward phonics--and not away as we have been moving more and more in \nrecent years.\n  Phonics-based programs work. History and statistics have proven it. \nNow, similar grassroots evidence is sprouting up in more and more parts \nof the country.\n  For example, in one of the poorest districts in Houston, TX, there is \na success story from which all of us can learn. There at the Wesley \nElementary School, its principal, Dr. Thaddeus Lott, has encouraged \nteachers to use proven methods such as phonics in a concentrated effort \nto improve reading skills. The program is working.\n  Students are leaving this school reading at two or three levels above \ntheir grade. Many go on to private academies because their achievement \nlevels are so far beyond the public schools they would otherwise \nattend.\n  Now, Dr. Lott has been appointed to a blue ribbon committee in the \nHouston Independent School District to expand his quality education \ntechniques to other schools in this, the seventh largest school \ndistrict in the Nation. It worked in Houston and it is working \nelsewhere.\n  Near one of Chicago's low-income housing projects, Mrs. Marva Collins \nof the Westside Preparatory School is making a real difference. Her \nphonics-based methods are helping all her students learn to read by the \nend of first grade. By the time her students reach third grade, they \nare memorizing poetry, discussing Shakespeare, and talking about early \nAmerican history.\n  In Inglewood, CA, similar targeted programs have also proven highly \nsuccessful.\n  Now, as the Washington Post reported last week, the State of \nCalifornia is urging all of its 7,700 school district ``to place more \nemphasis on phonics'' in order to reverse the dismal results they have \nbeen seeing on their statewide reading exams.\n\n  These are just a few recent examples--out of many--which show that \nthe trend back to a renewed emphasis on phonics is growing. But much \nmore needs to be done.\n  To help foster similar successful programs and to help focus public \nattention on what can and should be done, I propose to take the \ninitiative in my home State of Oklahoma.\n  In the near future, I plan to help establish a limited in scope, \nprivately funded, reading foundation in Oklahoma City.\n  Its purpose, broadly stated, will be to identify children, as well as \nadults, in need of enhanced reading instruction and to help them take \nadvantage of a good phonics-based reading program that works.\n  If this limited demonstration project is successful, I would hope to \nexpand it to Tulsa and perhaps to other cities throughout Oklahoma.\n  The goal is to show through private voluntary efforts that we as \nconcerned citizens can address this one serious problem constructively, \nwithout resorting to Government mandates or vast infusions of Federal \ntax dollars which obviously have not worked.\n  Indeed, I want to make it very clear that I do not seek to establish \na new Federal program, nor do I seek any new expenditure of taxpayer \ndollars. I propose no new legislation or Government mandate.\n  At the same time, I seek no direct intrusion into the day-to-day \nbusiness of the public schools. I have long been opposed to Federal \ncontrol of local education and I am not about to change my position \nnow.\n  Rather, what I am talking about is fostering voluntary and \ncooperative efforts through the use of private funds, through \npersuasion, through example, and through a genuine concern for helping \nour young people and others achieve success in life.\n  This is a good cause. I intend to demonstrate that what works in Dr. \nLott's school in Houston and Mrs. Collins' school in Chicago can and \nwill work in Oklahoma City. When it does, we will offer it throughout \nthe State.\n  Mr. President, there is absolutely no excuse for us in the United \nStates of America to lag behind other industrialized nations in our \nreading skills--we are going to take the initiative and correct it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3204-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3205-S3206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AN ANNIVERSARY TO REMEMBER\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this past Saturday, March 23, marked the \n13th anniversary of President Ronald Reagan's address to the Nation in \nwhich he outlined a vision of the future based on the common sense \nwisdom of developing a national defense against missile attack.\n  To commemorate this occasion, I ask unanimous consent that a \ntranscript of President Reagan's remarks on missile defense from this \nhistoric speech be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on that day in 1983, President Reagan \nannounced his decision to begin the long march away from the suicidal \ndefense doctrine known as mutual assured destruction. In one bold \nstroke, he singlehandedly committed the Nation to an intense research \nand development program designed to harness our technology to the task \nof countering the threat posed by ballistic missiles, and to do it with \nmeasures that are defensive. Wouldn't it be better, he asked, ``to save \nlives rather than to avenge them?''\n  In retrospect, we can see that it was a speech that truly rocked the \nworld. In the context of the closing strategy of the cold war, it posed \nthe decisive final challenge to the Soviet Union. Three years later, at \nthe Reykjavik Summit, extraordinary Soviet efforts to deter Reagan from \nhis commitment to missile defense failed. As a result, the evil \nempire's days were numbered and Soviet leader Gorbachev knew it.\n\n  In the context of domestic politics, Reagan's 1983 speech ignited a \npassionate debate over defense policy which still continues today. \nWithin just hours after the speech, one of our distinguished colleagues \nin this body coined the term star wars. Opponents claimed Reagan's idea \nwas a fantasy, that he wanted a perfect astrodome defense which would \ncost trillions of dollars.\n  Despite such rhetoric, in the context of science and technology, the \nspeech helped focus inquiries on numerous fronts which led to \nremarkable breakthroughs. Is it technically feasible, at an affordable \ncost, to ``intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before \nthey reach our own soil or that of\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nour allies?'' In 1983, many critics answered ``no.'' Today, such \nquestions are themselves--as Reagan would say--largely ``impotent and \nobsolete.''\n  But still, 13 years later, America has not deployed, nor is it \ncommitted to deploy, any national missile defense system. Why? In a \nfundamental sense, the answer lies in the triumph of politics over \nscience. The real technological barriers have been broken. We have the \nknow-how. Even funding is no longer the real issue.\n  Rather, it is the many political barriers that remain, and they are \nformidable. The Soviet Union is gone, and with it, the perceived threat \nposed by its awesome missile arsenal. Proliferation of missiles to \nother countries continues, but we are told that any real concern about \nit is premature. Today's Democrat President, like the Democrat \nCongresses before him, argues strenuously that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty should remain as the ``cornerstone'' of U.S. strategic \ndefense policy. It prohibits the deployment of effective defenses on \nthe theory that deterrence should rest solely on threat of instant \nretaliation--the same theory President Reagan sought to transcend.\n  So the struggle for national missile defense continues. ``It will \ntake years, probably decades, of effort on many fronts,'' President \nReagan said, and he was right.\n  Today, I stand proudly with those who remain committed to the moral \nvision articulated by President Reagan: ``That the human spirit must be \ncapable of rising above dealing with other nations and human beings by \nthreatening their existence.''\n  We will continue the efforts President Reagan began. And I hope, that \nin marking this anniversary, we can take increased devotion to the \ncause of world peace and freedom--that we can learn from the wisdom, \nthe foresight, the courage and the example of President Reagan.\n  Like Ronald Reagan before us, we pursue this cause not because some \npublic opinion poll told us it was the popular thing to do. We act \nbecause we know it is the right thing to do for our country and for \nfuture generations.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nAddress to the Nation on National Security By President Ronald Reagan, \n                             March 23, 1983\n\n       The calls for cutting back the defense budget come in nice, \n     simple arithmetic. They're the same kind of talk that led the \n     democracies to neglect their defenses in the 1930's and \n     invited the tragedy of World War II. We must not let that \n     grim chapter of history repeat itself through apathy or \n     neglect.\n       This is why I'm speaking to you tonight--to urge you to \n     tell your Senators and Congressmen that you know we must \n     continue to restore our military strength. If we stop in \n     midstream, we will send a signal of decline, of lessened \n     will, to friends and adversaries alike. Free people must \n     voluntarily, through open debate and democratic means, meet \n     the challenge that totalitarians pose by compulsion. It's up \n     to us, in our time, to choose and choose wisely between the \n     hard but necessary task of preserving peace and freedom and \n     the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the \n     best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day.\n       The solution is well within our grasp. But to reach it, \n     there is simply no alternative but to continue this year, in \n     this budget, to provide the resources we need to preserve the \n     peace and guarantee our freedom.\n       Now, thus far tonight I've shared with you my thoughts on \n     the problems of national security we must face together. My \n     predecessors in the Oval Office have appeared before you on \n     other occasions to describe the threat posed by Soviet power \n     and have proposed steps to address that threat. But since the \n     advent of nuclear weapons, those steps have been increasingly \n     directed toward deterrence of aggression through the promise \n     of retaliation.\n       This approach to stability through offensive threat has \n     worked. We and our allies have succeeded in preventing \n     nuclear war for more than three decades. in recent months, \n     however, my advisers, including in particular the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, have underscored the necessity to break out \n     of a future that relies solely on offensive retaliation for \n     our security.\n       Over the course of these discussions, I've become more and \n     more deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable \n     of rising above dealing with other nations and human beings \n     by threatening their existence. Feeling this way, I believe \n     we must thoroughly examine every opportunity for reducing \n     tensions and for introducing greater stability into the \n     strategic calculus on both sides.\n       One of the most important contributions we can make is, of \n     course, to lower the level of all arms, and particularly \n     nuclear arms. We're engaged right now in several negotiations \n     with the Soviet Union to bring about a mutual reduction of \n     weapons. I will report to you a week from tomorrow my \n     thoughts on that score. But let me just say, I'm totally \n     committed to this course.\n       If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to \n     achieve major arms reduction, we will have succeeded in \n     stabilizing the nuclear balance. Nevertheless, it will still \n     be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation, on mutual \n     threat. And that's a sad commentary on the human condition. \n     Wouldn't it be better to save lives than to avenge them? Are \n     we not capable of demonstrating our peaceful intentions by \n     applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a \n     truly lasting stability? I think we are. Indeed, we must.\n       After careful consultation with my advisers, including the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, I believe there is a way. Let me share \n     with you a vision of the future which offers hope. It is that \n     we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile \n     threat with measures that are defensive. Let us turn to the \n     very strengths in technology that spawned our great \n     industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we \n     enjoy today.\n       What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that \n     their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. \n     retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept \n     and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached \n     our own soil or that of our allies?\n       I know this is a formidable, technical task, one that may \n     not be accomplished before the end of this century. Yet, \n     current technology has attained a level of sophistication \n     where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort. It will \n     take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts. There \n     will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be \n     successes and breakthroughs. And as we proceed, we must \n     remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and \n     maintaining a solid capability for flexible response. But \n     isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world \n     from the threat of nuclear war? We know it is.\n       In the meantime, we will continue to pursue real reductions \n     in nuclear arms, negotiating from a position of strength that \n     can be ensured only by modernizing our strategic forces. At \n     the same time, we must take steps to reduce the risk of a \n     conventional military conflict escalating to nuclear war by \n     improving our nonnuclear capabilities.\n       America does possess--now--the technologies to attain very \n     significant improvements in the effectiveness of our \n     conventional, nonnuclear forces. Proceeding boldly with these \n     new technologies, we can significantly reduce any incentive \n     that the Soviet Union may have to threaten attack against the \n     United States or its allies.\n       As we pursue our goal of defensive technologies, we \n     recognize that our allies rely upon our strategic offensive \n     power to deter attacks against them. Their vital interests \n     and ours are inextricably linked. Their safety and ours are \n     one. And no change in technology can or will alter that \n     reality. We must and shall continue to honor our commitments.\n       I clearly recognize that defensive systems have limitations \n     and raise certain problems and ambiguities. If paired with \n     offensive systems, they can be viewed as fostering an \n     aggressive policy, and no one wants that. But with these \n     considerations firmly in mind, I call upon the scientific \n     community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, \n     to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and \n     world peace, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear \n     weapons impotent and obsolete.\n       Tonight, consistent with our obligations of the ABM treaty \n     and recognizing the need for closer consultation with our \n     allies, I'm taking an important first step. I am directing a \n     comprehensive and intensive effort to define a long-term \n     research and development program to begin to achieve our \n     ultimate goal of eliminating the threat posed by strategic \n     nuclear missiles. This could pave the way for arms control \n     measures to eliminate the weapons themselves. We seek neither \n     military superiority nor political advantage. Our only \n     purpose--one all people share--is to search for ways to \n     reduce the danger of nuclear war.\n       My fellow Americans, tonight we're launching an effort \n     which holds the promise of changing the course of human \n     history. There will be risks, and results take time. But I \n     believe we can do it. As we cross this threshold, I ask for \n     your prayers and your support.\n       Thank you, good night, and God bless you.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I support the motion to go to conference on \nS. 1004, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996. Both the House and \nthe Senate have passed versions of this bill. The House called for a \nconference with the Senate to resolve differences in the bill and \nappointed conferees. The Senate must respond to this request. We need \nto do this before the recess so staff can meet and have issues ready \nfor the conferees to vote on in early April.\n  My colleague from South Carolina opposes going to conference on this \nbill. I do not understand why he is so opposed to going forward with \nthis basic process. Last time I checked, conference is the process to \nresolve differences between the House and the Senate. The House has its \nbill. We have the Senate bill. Conferees sit down together to iron out \nthe differences. Why should he object?\n  I know there is a provision in the House-passed Coast Guard bill that \nmy colleague opposes. Each year, hundreds of foreign crewmembers file \nsuit in U.S. courts against foreign ship owners in U.S. courts. Since \n1989, 724 of these cases have been filed in one Florida county alone. \nThe House bill includes a provision that would address this flood of \nnonresident crew cases against ship owners being brought in the United \nStates. The House passed this provision as part of the Coast Guard bill \ntwice.\n  Mr. President, I happen to agree with the House provision. There is \nno public or private policy reason to litigate these cases in the U.S. \nlegal system.\n  These cases: Contribute to the overcrowding of court dockets, \nfrustrate the ability of U.S. citizens to obtain timely resolution of \ntheir claims, and require citizens to serve as jurors on cases which do \nnot affect U.S. public or private interests.\n  In Dade County, FL, it costs about $3,000 a day to conduct a jury \ntrial. The U.S. taxpayer and consumer should not bear the cost of \nlitigating these cases in our courts.\n  Of course we know who opposes this provision--the trial lawyers. \nThere is no reason for these foreign cases to be heard in U.S. courts \nat the expense of the U.S. taxpayer, but a small handful of trial \nattorneys enriched by these cases resist any change. The trial lawyers \nas a group resist this tiny change because they see it as the camel's \nnose under the tent.\n  We have seen this from the trial lawyers before:\n  We saw it with reform of the general aviation liability laws. The \nlawyers nearly wrecked a whole industry before Congress was able to \nenact a very modest reform.\n  We saw it with modest efforts to reform securities laws. The \nPresident vetoed this measure at the urging of the trial lawyers and \nsustained his first veto override.\n  We saw it as recently as last week with efforts to oppose reasonable \nproduct liability laws. The trial lawyers may prevail on the President \nto veto this as well.\n  To take a quote from a former candidate, the trial lawyers will \noppose any legal reform until hell freezes over, and then they will \nfight on the ice. That is what is happening here.\n  The trial lawyers do not care what is good for the country, what \nmakes sense for consumers and businesses, what the burden is to the \ntaxpayer. They only care if it enhances their ability to rake in huge \ncontingency fees. If a change affects that ability, they will oppose it \nno matter how reasonable or meritorious.\n  A recent Florida Supreme Court case highlighted the problem created \nin Florida by lawyers using its courts for the whole world's \nlitigation. In Kinney System, Inc. versus The Continental Insurance \nCo., the Florida court noted that the growing trend of lawyers filing \nsuit in the United States for injuries occurring outside the United \nStates was growing to abusive levels. The court was concerned about the \nburden these cases impose on trial courts. The court concluded, \n``(n)othing in our law establishes a policy that Florida must be a \ncourthouse for the world, nor that the taxpayers of the State must pay \nto resolve disputes utterly unconnected with this State's interests.'' \nI agree.\n  Mr. President, the forum selection provision in the House Coast Guard \nbill is a reasonable legal reform that attempts to address part of the \nproblem described in the Kinney case.\n  The provision will: Help assure the U.S. courts are available for \nU.S. citizens, provide an alternative to devoting scarce judicial \nresources to cases utterly unconnected to the Nation's interests, and \nassure that nonresident alien seamen receive fair treatment.\n  It does not affect the ability of U.S. citizens or permanent resident \naliens to bring suit in U.S. courts.\n  It does not leave foreign crewmembers without a remedy. The provision \nwould honor forum selection provisions in foreign employment contracts \nwhere there is an adequate remedy available to the seaman. And these \nremedies are available in other countries. Contrary to what the trial \nlawyers may want to believe, the United States is not the only \ncivilized nation in the world. I have a whole stack of letters from \ndifferent countries outlining the remedies available to seamen: \nJamaica, Canada, Greece, Italy, Norway.\n  Mr. President, I could go on, but this issue should be resolved in \nconference. Its in the House bill--its not in the Senate bill. We need \nto resolve the differences between the House and the Senate on this \nimportant bill and go on and send it to the President. The only way we \nare going to do this is agree to the House request for a conference and \nappoint conferees. I urge my colleagues to do that and let the Senate \nget on about its business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3207-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3207-S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO SENATOR RUSSELL AND SENATOR NUNN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to comment on two very distinguished \nSenators from Georgia, Senator Richard Brevard Russell and his \nsuccessor, the very able Senator Samuel Augustus Nunn. On January 24, \n1996, I had the great pleasure of taking part in the dedication of a \nstatute of Senator Russell in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office \nbuilding. The unveiling of Senator Russell's statue last month occurred \n25 years after Senator Russell's death in 1971. I was very pleased to \nbe a part of this ceremony, because of my own high regard and esteem \nfor Senator Russell. Twenty-four years ago, in 1972, I offered the \nresolution to rename the ``Old Senate Office Building,'' as it was then \nknown, in honor of Senator Russell. The grandeur embodied in both the \nbuilding and the statue are fitting monuments to the very great legacy \nof statesmanship bequeathed to us by Senator Richard Brevard Russell.\n  The statue of Senator Russell stands in front of the entry to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, where Senator Russell served as \nchairman for fifteen years during his 38-year Senate career, and where \nSenator Nunn has served as chairman and ranking member for ten years. \nSenator Sam Nunn is a worthy successor to Senator Russell's great \nlegacy on national defense.\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\nHe was first elected to the Senate on November 7, 1972, to complete the \nunexpired term of Senator Russell, and has since won reelection three \ntimes. Together, Senator Russell and Senator Nunn have provided 62 \nyears of remarkable service to the Senate and the Nation, and 20 years \nof consummate leadership on national defense. If we add to that number \nthe leadership on national defense offered by Senator Nunn's \ngranduncle, Representative Carl Vinson, who for many years was chairman \nof the House Armed Services Committee, this record of leadership is \neven more remarkable. Senator Nunn's legacy on defense matters, and his \nservice to the State of Georgia, is equally distinguished.\n  Like Senator Russell and Representative Vinson before him, Senator \nNunn has devoted himself to sustaining and improving the military \nstrength of the United States. He was instrumental in crafting the 1986 \nDefense Reorganization Act that has shaped the forces that the United \nStates deploys today. He has dedicated himself to ensuring the quality \nof the all-volunteer force, and to seeing that these men and women are \nadequately compensated and cared for. He has also fought the Pentagon \nto preserve systems that DoD did not always want, but which ultimately \nproved their worth. One such system was the F-117 Stealth fighter, \nwhich was invaluable during Desert Storm. Since that fight, Senator \nNunn has pushed to spread the benefits of stealth technology to the \nnext generation of fighters, including the F-22. Finally, Senator Nunn \nhas demonstrated his leadership in strengthening and preserving the \nNATO alliance, complementing U.S. military strength with the seamless \nand coordinated combined strength of our European allies.\n\n  He has become, in the process, a leader in U.S. foreign policy as \nwell. Senator Nunn will be remembered for championing the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram to effectively reduce the Soviet nuclear threat to the United \nStates, for his efforts to address and counter the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, and for his role in shaping and defining \nthe use of U.S. military force. He has been an integral part of every \ndebate concerning the use of U.S. military forces, from Vietnam, to \nLebanon, to the Persian Gulf War, to Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia. I \nrespect the cogent and well thought out arguments that Senator Nunn \ninvariably brings to the discussion. He brings to these difficult \ndebates a mature understanding of the subtleties of each situation and \na clear vision of the strategic interests of the United States. To each \ndebate, his talents for achieving a compromise are tested and proven \nanew. This ability surely will be missed after his departure from the \nSenate.\n   Mr. President, the State of Georgia has offered to the Congress and \nthe nation statesmen and leaders of remarkable ability and durability \nduring this century. The Congress and the nation have been the better \nand the stronger for the service of these sons of Georgia, from Carl \nVinson, to Richard Brevard Russell, to Samuel Augustus Nunn. The legacy \nof these three men alone, and on national defense and security issues \nalone, is a remarkable testament. I am honored to have served with all \nthree. As I have said before, Senator Nunn stepped into big shoes when \nhe came to the Senate. With his retirement this fall, he will leave an \nequally large pair of shoes to fill.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from \nSenator Nunn, along with the transcript of the ceremony, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Please find enclosed a transcript of the \n     Richard B. Russell Statute Dedication Ceremony of January 24, \n     1996. Your active participation in planning and chairing the \n     dedication ceremony ensured its success.\n       I believe it would be a fitting tribute to Senator Russell \n     for these proceedings to be a part of the historical record \n     honoring his distinguished career. If you deem it \n     appropriate, I would be honored for you, in your role as \n     chairman of this special event, to insert the transcript into \n     the Congressional Record.\n       I know your heartfelt remarks at the dedication ceremony \n     meant a great deal to Senator Russell's family, friends, and \n     former colleagues. Your personal remarks about my own service \n     in the Senate at the ceremony and later, after my 10,000th \n     vote, will always be among the most meaningful memories of my \n     career in public service.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Sam Nunn.\n       Enclosure.\n\n Senator Richard Russell Statue Dedication, January 24, 1996, Russell \n                     Senate Office Building Rotunda\n\n\n                              PROCEEDINGS\n\n       Senator Nunn. Our beloved Senate Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd John \n     Ogilvie, will give the invocation.\n       Chaplain Ogilvie. Let us pray. Almighty God, sovereign of \n     our beloved nation and Lord of our lives, we praise you that \n     you call leaders to shape the course of history.\n       We have gathered here today to thank you for the impact on \n     history of Senator Richard Russell. Here in this building \n     that bears his name we place this statue of his likeness. May \n     this statue call all of us to the excellence that \n     distinguished his career, the nobility of his character that \n     made an indelible mark on history, and his faith in you that \n     gave him supernatural gifts of wisdom and discernment and \n     vision.\n       Thank you for the lasting impact of the rare blend of \n     humility and stature, patriotism and statesmanship, that made \n     him a legend in his own time--Georgia's pride, a lodestar \n     leader, a senator's senator for 38 years, and a truly great \n     American. May we measure our commitment by his indefatigable \n     faithfulness and set as a benchmark for our lives his \n     belief that work in the government is one of the highest \n     callings.\n       In this spirit of dedication to your best for America and \n     in affirmation of this giant of history, we renew our \n     commitment to serve you in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. \n     Amen.\n       Senator Nunn. Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.\n       Charlie Campbell, the president of the Russell Foundation, \n     will give more elaborate introductions, but let me begin by \n     welcoming the members of the Russell family here today. I \n     understand there are about 100 of you. We are very, very \n     proud to have each and every one of you here.\n       The Russell trustees and supporters, we welcome you, and we \n     thank you for all of your efforts in making this historic day \n     possible; past and present members of the United States \n     Senate who will be introduced later; and friends and admirers \n     of Richard B. Russell.\n       This is indeed an important event in the life of the United \n     States Senate. Every day since I have been serving in this \n     unique legislative body, I have considered it a great honor \n     to be the temporary holder of what I think of as the Russell \n     seat in the Senate.\n       I am also proud that I had the opportunity to follow \n     Senator Russell's footsteps as chairman of the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, which he chaired so ably for 15 years \n     during the Cold War, the Korean War, the Cuban Missile \n     Crisis, and the construction of the Berlin Wall.\n       I will never forget when I was a 23-year-old lawyer sitting \n     in the back of the Senate Armed Services Chamber right down \n     the hall as Congressman Carl Vinson of Georgia, the chairman \n     of the House Armed Services Committee, presented the House \n     position on a legislative matter to Senator Richard Russell \n     at the other end of the table, also of Georgia and chairman \n     of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Those were the days \n     for Georgia and for our nation.\n       Twenty-seven years later, as chairman of the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, I watched with the rest of the world as \n     the Berlin Wall was torn down, Eastern Europe regained its \n     freedom, and the Soviet empire disintegrated. I have often \n     thought that this occurred without a nuclear war and without \n     worldwide destruction in considerable part because of the \n     wise leadership of Richard Russell and Carl Vinson in \n     building a strong United States and a strong NATO alliance.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Nunn: When this historic building was named in \n     honor of Richard Brevard Russell in 1972, the powerful \n     imprint of his record of service was still very fresh in the \n     memory of the Senate and of our nation. Today, with the \n     dedication of this magnificent statue, we have occasion to \n     remember why Richard Russell made such an indelible imprint \n     on the history of Georgia, the U.S. Senate, and our nation.\n       Although our nation is very different today than it was at \n     the time of Senator Russell's election in 1932, or even at \n     the time of his death 25 years ago, his service and his \n     example are more instructive now than ever before.\n       In this context, no one is better suited to begin this \n     ceremony of remembrance, recognition and dedication than our \n     next speaker. Like Richard Russell, Vice President Al Gore \n     was molded by his southern heritage and by a loving family \n     that encouraged and supported his early and energetic and \n     total commitment to public service.\n       Like Richard Russell, Al Gore is the son of a prominent \n     political father. Indeed, Al Gore, Sr., served in the Senate \n     with Richard Russell and with many in attendance here today. \n     Richard Russell's own father was Chief Justice of the Georgia \n     Supreme Court, and in that capacity, administered the oath of \n     office when his son became Governor Russell of Georgia.\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\n       Just as our vice president was known as ``Young Al'' when \n     he began his political career, Richard Russell was known as \n     ``Young Dick.'' Like Richard Russell, Al Gore spent a lot of \n     time on the family farm, and as young boy these youthful \n     experiences gave both men a special understanding of \n     people who work with their hands, work in manual labor, as \n     well as an abiding appreciation of conservation and the \n     environment.\n       Like Richard Russell, Al Gore served on the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee and devoted a considerable portion of his \n     time to building a stronger America and a safer world. Like \n     Richard Russell, Al Gore was elected as a very young man to \n     Congress, and he has dedicated his life to the people of his \n     state and to the people of our nation.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, please help me welcome the Vice \n     President of the United States.\n       [Applause.]\n       Vice President Gore: Thank you.\n       [Continuing applause.]\n       Vice President Gore: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank \n     you very much, ladies and gentlemen.\n       And, Senator Nunn, thank you for your very kind words of \n     introduction. One of my greatest honors in the time I served \n     in the United States Senate was serving under your \n     chairmanship in the Armed Services Committee, and thank you \n     so much for your kind words.\n       Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, two close friends and \n     great leaders of this institution, other members of the \n     Senate who are present--forgive me for not even attempting to \n     single out individual senators because there is such a great \n     turnout and such a large presence here at this event--former \n     members of the Senate who are here, as well.\n       Governor Zell Miller, thank you for honoring us and this \n     occasion with your presence here, and thank you for your \n     leadership in Georgia and in our country.\n       To Charles Campbell, Chairman of the Richard B. Russell \n     Foundation; to Frederick Hart, the sculptor; and to Chaplain \n     Ogilvie--thank you for your invocation; to members of the \n     family of Senator Russell--Carolyn Nelson and Pat Peterson \n     especially, sisters of Senator Russell; to all of the other \n     family members who are here.\n       It is an honor to him that so many of you are present. This \n     really is a very, very special day, and to hear Sam Nunn \n     introduce me with even slight comparisons is beyond what I \n     can--that sets off my hubris alarm, Sam, because Senator \n     Russell is rightly regarded as a legend, and all who had the \n     privilege of serving with him understand that.\n       Incidentally, not too many days ago some tourists remarked \n     to an acquaintance of mine from Tennessee that they had seen \n     the Al Gore statue on the White House lawn, and I said, \n     ``What day was that?''\n       [Laughter.]\n       Vice President Gore: It's been so cold here recently people \n     who don't know me thought I was frozen stiff. But in any \n     event, ladies and gentleman, from this day forward, in the \n     Rotunda of this majestic building named in his honor, a \n     statue of Richard Brevard Russell will stand sentry. \n     Georgia's senator, America's senator, a legendary figure in \n     American politics will gaze over us--a fitting tribute to a \n     towering presence.\n       I knew Senator Russell when I was a young man. I did not \n     have the opportunity to serve in the Congress during his time \n     of service, but my father's service in the Congress \n     overlapped with his for 32 years. These two men had a great \n     deal in common. Eighteen of those years my father served in \n     the Senate with Senator Russell. Both were sons of the South \n     and both provided shoulders on which a new generation of \n     Democrats now stands.\n       Both believed that public service was an honorable calling \n     that demanded common courtesy and rewarded basic decency. \n     Both marched in the direction pointed by the compass of their \n     conscience, no matter the prevailing winds or the calls to \n     shift their course.\n       I remember often hearing my father say that whatever their \n     occasional disagreements--and they did have some; on occasion \n     they stood toe to toe, but when it came to certain core \n     ideals; love of country, devotion to duty, respect for \n     principles, they always saw eye to eye. But whatever the \n     occasional disagreements, on one matter my father was \n     resolute whenever he spoke about Senator Russell. Dick \n     Russell had a heart of gold and was one of the most \n     honorable individuals ever to serve in the United States \n     Senate throughout its more than 200-year history.\n       To six United States presidents, Richard Russell was a \n     mentor and an occasional menace. He stood up for Franklin \n     Roosevelt at the 1932 Democratic Convention, nominating him \n     for president when some people thought Roosevelt couldn't \n     win. And then he stood up to Roosevelt a few years later, \n     casting a deciding vote against his court-backing plan when \n     some people thought Roosevelt couldn't lose.\n       He challenged Harry Truman for the presidential nomination \n     in 1948, but he challenged the nation to honor Truman's \n     authority as Commander-in-Chief when he presided over the \n     Senate's Army MacArthur hearings three years later.\n       President Johnson knew him best among all the presidents \n     served by Richard Russell, and the relationship between \n     Richard Russell and Lyndon Johnson began as so many of his \n     relationships had. Johnson was the student, and Russell was \n     the teacher.\n       They became very, very close friends, even though they too \n     had occasional disagreements and feuded from time to time. \n     And Johnson owed much of his rise to the benevolence and \n     wisdom of the Georgia Giant.\n       Senator Russell, we all remember, was an austere man, and, \n     ironically, Johnson lavished him with gifts from time to \n     time-fancy neckties, glass bowls, one time a watch just like \n     the one that President Johnson wore. And, as the story goes, \n     one Christmas Johnson gave Senator Russell a beautiful \n     Christian Dior handkerchief. The Senator thanked him, and he \n     said, ``Now, Lyndon, I'm going to have to buy a new suit to \n     go with this.''\n       When Johnson was vice president, he hosted a dinner in \n     Senator Russell's honor, which was a grand affair swarming \n     with cabinet officers, elected officials and Washington's \n     elite. And at that dinner, Johnson told the assembled \n     gathering that if he were able to personally choose the \n     president of the United States, he would select Richard \n     Russell.\n       Richard Russell was indeed a president's senator and a \n     senator's senator. And if things had gone a little bit \n     differently, if the South had been a little bit different, if \n     other things had been just a little bit different, he might \n     have been a senator's president.\n       On some things Senator Russell was way ahead of his time, a \n     little bit like that great Barbara Mandell song ``I Was \n     Country Before Country Was Cool.'' For example. Richard \n     Russell was reinventing government before reinventing \n     government was cool.\n       We're still in that period before reinventing government is \n     cool.\n       [Laughter.]\n       Vice President Gore: As governor, he reduced the number of \n     state bureaus, commissions and agencies from 102 to 17. He \n     cut the cost of government 20 percent, saved the state the \n     then-astronomical sum of a million dollars. He knew that a \n     government that didn't spend money as wisely and carefully \n     as a family could never earn any family's respect.\n       On national security, of course, Senator Russell had no \n     peer. He championed a robust national defense, and he helped \n     build a Pentagon that was the envy of the world. He also \n     influenced all of those who came after him. Many members of \n     the United States Senate today owe something of their bearing \n     and approach to the job to their learning experience in \n     watching Senator Russell.\n       In fact, I have sometimes though--and I dare say I'm not \n     the only one--in watching the level of excellence brought to \n     the job of chairman of the Armed Services Committee and now \n     ranking member by Sam Nunn--that his experience, along with \n     others, in watching Senator Russell was an important factor \n     in giving our nation the degree of commitment to public \n     service that we find from so many who watched Senator Russell \n     carefully.\n       But perhaps his most lasting influence was on matters that \n     were less explosive and less immediately tied to life and \n     death, less immediately newsworthy--bringing electricity to \n     rural America, getting loans for Georgia's farmers, making \n     sure that poor children could eat a decent lunch at school. \n     And there was always that reverence to his life, his spartan \n     apartment, his utter devotion to the Senate as an \n     institution, his enduring selflessness that inspired even \n     those with whom he disagreed.\n       I do understand that more than 100 members of the Russell \n     family are here this afternoon, and we all thank you for \n     sharing your outstanding brother, uncle, cousin with the \n     United States of America.\n       I guess we all should have expected, however, that even at \n     the dedication of his statue, Senator Russell would make \n     certain he had the votes to come out on top in case any \n     question was put.\n       [Laughter.]\n       There's no need to worry about that this afternoon. Today \n     and forever, this leader, this patriot, this legend, remains \n     where he belongs--in the Senate standing tall.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Nunn. Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. \n     Richard Russell was an astute judge of the character and the \n     quality of his fellow senators. He made his judgment, not \n     only on the basis of their words, but also on the basis of \n     what he observed--their deeds. When Richard Russell \n     determined that you were a man or woman of honor, he was your \n     champion for life.\n       One young senator who met this Russell test was Robert \n     Byrd. The last vote Senator Russell cast before he died was \n     cast from his hospital bed in favor of Robert Byrd's bid to \n     become the majority whip of the Senate in 1971.\n       Senator Russell was an advisor and confidant to six \n     presidents. He served under seven, but only a brief time \n     under one. He had the deepest respect for the office of \n     President, so much so that he never called any sitting \n     president, even his old friend and protege Lyndon Johnson, \n     anything but Mr. President.\n       With a similar respect, Senator Byrd never called Senator \n     Russell anything but Senator Russell. Senator Russell \n     believed strongly in the independence and coequal role of the \n     Congress of the United States, and he insisted on more than \n     one occasion that he had not served under six presidents, Al, \n     but, rather, he served with six presidents--a real \n     difference.\n       Like Richard Russell, Robert Byrd reveres the Senate of the \n     United States, not just because he serves in it, but because \n     of his respect for its role in the history of our nation and \n     the world. Like Richard Russell in his day, Robert Byrd by \n     the power of his intellect, by the depth of his understanding \n     of\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n     history and the Senate rules, by the strength of his \n     character and by his faith in God, is today the custodian of \n     the Senate ideals that go back, not only to the founding \n     fathers but, indeed, to ancient Rome.\n       Like Richard Russell, Robert Byrd embodies the traditions, \n     the dignity, and, indeed, the honor of the United States \n     Senate. It is my great privilege to introduce the honored \n     friend of Richard B. Russell, Robert C. Byrd.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Byrd. Thank you.\n       Mr. Vice President, my colleagues, fellow Americans, ladies \n     and gentlemen.\n       If I appear today to wear a pained expression, that's \n     because I have some pain. If any of you have ever had the \n     shingles, you know what I'm talking about. Although a great \n     number of people think I wear that expression all the time.\n       [Laughter.]\n       And they're not far wrong.\n       I want to thank, first of all, the Senate Chaplain, Dr. \n     Ogilvie, who performed the most important part in the \n     program. I thank Mr. Campbell for inviting me to participate \n     in this program. And I thank Sam Nunn. He stepped into some \n     big shoes when he came to the Senate, and those shoes fit \n     today.\n       [Applause.]\n       The Duke of Wellington once said that the presence of \n     Napoleon on the field was worth 40,000 men in the balance. \n     And so it is when Sam Nunn speaks on the subject of our \n     national defense. He has no peer in the Senate, and everybody \n     listens.\n       Let me say that I'm very grateful for the presence of so \n     many of our colleagues here today. My eyes are growing dim, \n     but I had the pleasure of personally greeting some of my \n     colleagues before I came up here. So I want to thank John \n     Warner and Danny Inouye and former Senator and former Judge \n     Mr. Griffin; Thad Cochran and Jesse Helms, Mark Hatfield and \n     Paul Sarbanes; and the only man in the Senate who has served \n     longer in the Senate than I have. Strom Thurmond.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Byrd. That is in the Senate.\n       My tenure on the Hill is a little bit more than Strom's. \n     Claiborne Pell. And our old friend Russell Long.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Byrd. Our great friend Mac Mathias, Paul Coverdell. \n     I think I see Ted Moss and Wyche Fowler. There may be others. \n     You'll forgive me if I can't see you from here, but thank \n     you for coming.\n       When I first came to the Senate in January 1959, my office \n     was in Room 342 of this building, then known as the Old \n     Senate Office Building. That was still 13 years before the \n     Senate would adopt the resolution that I offered renaming the \n     building in honor of Senator Richard Brevard Russell.\n       Yet even though his name was not yet affixed to the wall of \n     the building, it might well have been because he was the \n     senator, the uncrowned king of the southern block, and he was \n     as truly a Senate man as was Henry Clay or Daniel Webster or \n     John C. Calhoun or Thomas Minton or any of the other giants \n     who had preceded him.\n       Back in January 1959, I was the other relatively young \n     senator of 41. Twenty years my senior, Senator Russell had \n     already served over a quarter of a century in the United \n     States Senate. He was a patrician in all aspects of the word, \n     and of all the senators with whom I have served over these \n     past 37 years, he was the only senator whom I never addressed \n     by his first name when speaking to him personally. That was \n     the measure of my respect and admiration for Senator Richard \n     Russell.\n       On many occasions I sought his opinion and advice, and I \n     always found him courteous and easy to talk with. He was \n     urbane and scholarly, courtly and polite, a statesman by \n     every definition.\n       His arrival in Washington in 1933 coincided with the start \n     of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal Administration. \n     Recognizing the severity of the Great Depression, Senator \n     Russell gave loyal support to President Roosevelt whom he \n     viewed as a great leader who sympathized with the problems of \n     ordinary citizens. Russell's colleagues quickly recognized \n     the talents and the abilities of this young senator. As a \n     freshman, he won an almost unheard of appointment to the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee.\n       Richard Russell never married. We used to say he was \n     married to the Senate. Governor Miller, he studied its \n     traditions and its customs, its rules, its history and its \n     practices assiduously. Ted Stevens, Senator Russell avoided \n     speaking often on the floor but preferred to do his work \n     quietly in the committee rooms.\n       Senator Russell's philosophy of government was rooted in \n     constitutionalism. His belief in the limits of federal power \n     and the separation of powers among the three equal branches \n     of government was the main force behind his opposition to \n     what were popularly known then as civil rights acts. His \n     attitude toward the role of government he summed up once by \n     saying, ``I am a reactionary when times are good; in a \n     Depression, I'm a liberal.''\n       He was always regarded as one of the most fair and \n     conscientious members of this body. The truth of this was \n     clearly demonstrated during the Senate inquiry of President \n     Truman's dissmissal of General Douglas MacArthur from his \n     command in Korea. Senator Russell presided over those \n     hearings from May 3 to June 27, 1951. During that time, he \n     was unfailingly courteous and was particularly solicitious of \n     the General's views. In hindsight, it has been claimed that \n     his judicious handling of this volatile event did much to \n     diffuse an explosive situation.\n       Through it all he served his nation well. Richard Russell \n     followed his own star. He did not pander. His confident was \n     his conscience. He was always the good and faithful servant \n     of the people. He was good for the Senate, and he loved it \n     dearly. I can say without any hesitation that he was a \n     remarkable senator, a remarkable American, a remarkable man \n     who enjoyed the respect and the affection of all who served \n     with him.\n       In the death of Senator Russell, I felt a great personal \n     loss. From my first days in the Senate, I looked upon him as \n     my mentor, and he was the man I most admired in Washington, a \n     man of great intellect, the finest of public servants, and \n     his patriotism of love, of country, will never be excelled.\n       ``I saw the sun sink in hte golden west. No angry cloud \n     obscured its latest view. Around the couch on which it sank \n     to rest shone all the splendor of a summer day and long the \n     lost of view its radiant light reflected from the skies \n     delayed the night. Thus, when a good man's life comes to a \n     close, no doubts arise to cloud his soul with gloom, but \n     faith triumphant on each feature glows, and benedictions fill \n     the sacred room. And long do men his virtues wide proclaim, \n     while generations rise to bless his name.''\n       And so to his kinspeople, to his kinspeople and his host of \n     friends, I say, I am honored indeed to have been invited to \n     participate in this ceremony in which we dedicate this \n     handiwork of the sculptor to the memory of Richard Brevard \n     Russell, late a senator from the state of Georgia. How poor \n     this world would be without the memories of its mighty dead. \n     Only the voiceless speak forever, the memory of this noble \n     man will ever be like a star which is not extinguished when \n     it sets upon the distant horizon. It but goes to shine in \n     other skies and then reappears in ours as fresh as when it \n     first arose.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Nunn. The distinguished senator we will hear from \n     next also served with Senator Russell, but from across the \n     table. Like Richard Russell, Ted Stevens' record of \n     supporting his state's concerns and his record on national \n     and international issues have made him a formidable force in \n     his own home state and throughout the nation. In his own \n     state of Alaska, his record discourages most potential \n     opposition and crushes those who are daring enough to run \n     against him.\n       Like Richard Russell, Ted Stevens has chaired the Defense \n     Appropriations Subcommittee and has been an effective \n     proponent of a strong national defense. Like Senator Russell, \n     Ted Stevens is a champion of both our veterans and our men \n     and women in uniform, and he fights to see that our troops \n     have the weapons and the equipment they need to prevail in \n     combat.\n       Like Richard Russell, Ted Stevens believes that when our \n     flag is committed, it is time to transcend partisan politics \n     and to support our troops. Richard Russell once described the \n     legislative process well when he said, quoting him, ``Only \n     through a meeting of the minds and by concessions can we \n     legislate.''\n       Like Richard Russell, Ted Stevens understands that the \n     legislation requires cooperation and coalition building in \n     both political parties, not only to pass but to last.\n       Ted, to you and to my good friend and colleague Paul \n     Coverdell, one message to majority leader Bob Dole who wanted \n     to be here today but had other pressing commitments. In \n     Georgia, we have a small town that might remind Bob Dole of \n     home in case he ever has any reason in the next few weeks or \n     months to wander into our territory, and it's called Russell, \n     Georgia. We'll be proud to have him there at any time.\n       I am proud to present to you the distinguished senator from \n     the state of Alaska, a friend of Richard Russell, the \n     Honorable Ted Stevens.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Stevens. Thank you very much, Senator Nunn. You \n     embarrassed me with that introduction. I am delighted to be \n     able to pinch-hit for Senator Dole and to be here with this \n     distinguished group.\n       After listening to my good friend--and he is my great \n     friend--Senator Byrd, I am reminded of a friend of mine that \n     told me when he was ready to make a speech he felt like Lady \n     Astor's seventh husband. He knew what he had to do, but he \n     didn't know how to make it interesting.\n       [Laughter.\n       Senator Stevens. After a speech such as Senator Byrd's and \n     the vice president's, I'm humbled to be here. But I am \n     delighted to be here, Sam, because as you said, Senator \n     Russell was the Chairman of the Subcommittee that I've been \n     chairman of twice now, and that's the Defense Subcommittee, \n     and I really feel greatly the responsibility of that \n     position.\n       Because he spent half of his lifetime in the Senate and \n     enjoyed relationships with every president from Franklin \n     Roosevelt to Richard Nixon, as you've heard, Senator Russell \n     had a deep understanding of the nation and a deeper \n     understanding of how our government works, more so than most \n     Americans.\n       He was very generous in sharing his wisdom and insight with \n     new senators regardless of their political affiliation. That \n     legacy lives on today, and I am one of the beneficiaries as \n     Senator Nunn mentioned. Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson and \n     Senator Mansfield, Senator Stennis are people who served with \n     him. They served as mentors for me and others, regardless of \n     politics.\n       When we came to the Senate, and I came to the Senate 28 \n     years ago, we were the recipients of the attention of Senator \n     Russell,\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\n     and we were guided by the senators that he had so well \n     instilled with the love of this institution. As they took us \n     under their wing, as Senator Russell had done to them, they \n     counseled us in our first years in the Senate. Those were \n     years when senators were seen and not heard for a few years, \n     but I was an appointed senator so they sort of made an \n     exception because they weren't sure I'd be back.\n       I think that there was no question that at that time we all \n     recognized that we were serving with the foremost \n     congressional authority on our nation's defense, and really \n     the architect of our nation's security. He was chairman of \n     the Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Defense \n     Appropriations Subcommittee at the same time as I recall. I \n     always remember that because I'm sorry that I can't enjoy \n     that same circumstance. Senator Hatfield will understand \n     that.\n       But it is something for all of us to remember that he \n     worked primarily to assure that this nation remained strong. \n     And he was very bipartisan in dealing with that, and I'm very \n     serious about saying he took time with young senators to \n     explain his understanding of defense and why it was so \n     necessary to keep such a firm foundation.\n       I think he played a greater role than any other senator in \n     shaping the defense establishment of our post-World War II \n     period here in America. President Nixon said this of Senator \n     Russell: When the security of the United States was at issue, \n     six American presidents leaned upon this great patriot, \n     Richard Russell. He never failed them.\n       By remaining bipartisan, Senator Russell kept our nation \n     from retreating into isolationism during a period that was \n     very essential to our history, the period right after World \n     War II.\n       Long before Dwight Eisenhower became president, Senator \n     Russell and Ike were great friends. Their friendship \n     continued and grew after Eisenhower was in the White House.\n       In testimony to America's spirit of democracy throughout \n     the world, Senator Russell showed our nation the importance \n     of rebuilding, rebuilding not only our nation but our \n     enemies'--Germany and Japan--after World War II.\n       Ensuring that the Marshall Plan became a reality was one of \n     Dick Russell's real goals, and he was most successful. And \n     while he was a tower of strength for our national defense, I \n     am sure you know, Sam and the senators here from Georgia, he \n     was a faithful representative of the people of Georgia. He \n     saw better than others the future of the burgeoning \n     discoveries in science and ensured that funds would be \n     available for research in new technologies in medicine, \n     agriculture and in conservation.\n       I feel truly honored to have been able to serve with \n     Richard Russell, and I am deeply honored to my friend Robert \n     Dole for being elsewhere so I could say it here today. \n     Twenty-five years ago, just a few years after his death, I \n     was a young senator, but I joined other senators in paying \n     tribute to our departed friend.\n       Let me just repeat now what I said then. He never sought \n     publicity nor attempted to impress his colleagues with flashy \n     rhetoric, but that is not to say he was not a forceful \n     advocate and a fierce adversary. I am confident that history \n     will mark him as a consummate statesman who transcended \n     regional boundaries to become a senator for all here in the \n     United States. He was a paragon worth emulating by those who \n     would pursue a life in public service.\n       Nothing has changed in the 25 years since I said those \n     words. Russell is still a great influence, his legacy is \n     alive today as it was then, his achievements and unique \n     abilities will never be forgotten as Senator Byrd has so ably \n     said, and I'm pleased to be here to be part of the dedication \n     of this statue and pleased even more, as I said, to have been \n     fortunate enough to have been able to serve with this great \n     man, Richard Russell.\n       Thank you very much.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Nunn. Like Richard Russell, our next speaker has \n     dedicated his life to public service, and has recognized that \n     political leadership is an honorable calling. Like Richard \n     Russell, Zell Miller comes from north of what we in Georgia \n     call ``The Gnat Line,'' the geological fall-line that \n     separates north Georgia from south Georgia, with 90 percent \n     of the gnats on the southern side of the line where I live.\n       Many north Georgia politicians never get elected because \n     they never master a vital skill; that is, to be able to blow \n     away the gnats and talk at the same time.\n       [Laughter and applause.]\n       Senator Nunn. Like Richard Russell, Zell Miller clearly \n     mastered this skill despite his geographic disadvantage.\n       Like Governor Richard Russell and Senator Richard Russell, \n     Governor Zell Miller has been a champion of job creation and \n     fiscal responsibility.\n       Like Richard Russell, Zell Miller has a powerful commitment \n     to the education of all of our children. As governor of \n     Georgia, Richard Russell recognized and reorganized higher \n     education. He established the Board of Regents and paved the \n     way for Georgia's top institutions to become leaders in our \n     nation.\n       In Washington, Senator Russell was the father of the school \n     lunch program, one of his proudest accomplishments.\n       As governor, Zell Miller established the HOPE Scholarship \n     Program which enables every student in Georgia who achieves a \n     B average in high school to receive free tuition in college \n     for as long as they maintain a B average. Currently, over \n     105,000 Georgia students are being helped by this program.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Nunn. As governor, Zell Miller is the father also \n     of Georgia's pre-kindergarten program, the most comprehensive \n     program for four-year-olds in the entire nation, one of his \n     proudest accomplishments.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to introduce the Governor \n     of Georgia, my good friend, the Honorable Zell Miller.\n       [Applause.]\n       Governor Miller. Thank you.\n       Thank you very much, Senator Nunn, for that introduction, \n     but, most importantly, thank you for all that you have \n     done for our state of Georgia and for this nation.\n       [Applause.]\n       Governor Miller. Mr. Vice President, Senator Byrd, Senator \n     Stevens, Senator Coverdell, other members of the U.S. Senate \n     present and past, members of the Georgia Congressional \n     Delegation past and present, Russell Foundation Chairman \n     Charles Campbell, former Georgia Governor Ernest Vandiver, \n     and Mrs. Betty Russell Vandiver and all the members of the \n     Russell family----\n       [Applause.]\n       Governor Miller [continuing]. Distinguished guests and \n     ladies and gentlemen.\n       It is certainly a great honor to be on this platform and to \n     have this opportunity to speak on behalf of the state of \n     Georgia at this ceremony. Although it has now been 25 years, \n     a quarter of a century, since his passing, many of us knew \n     and still vividly remember Richard Russell.\n       Some knew him as a senator's senator whose knowledge and \n     reverence of the United States Senate as an institution was \n     so deep that even his colleagues who opposed him on the \n     issues or bad conflicting philosophies of government had a \n     level of respect for him that bordered on reverence.\n       Others knew Richard Russell as a president's senator, \n     personal advisor, as we have known, to six Presidents \n     beginning with Franklin Roosevelt. It was often said that the \n     only power that the president had that Dick Russell didn't \n     have was the ability to push the button. And no president \n     would have thought of pushing that button without first \n     consulting with Senator Russell.\n       But back home in Georgia we knew him as our senator, and \n     when we sent him to Washington in 1933, it was because we \n     already knew what a remarkable leader this man was.\n       Dick Russell became the youngest member of the Georgia \n     Legislature when he was elected state representative at the \n     age of 23, and he became Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives in Georgia while he was still in his 20s. He \n     was elected the youngest governor in Georgia's history at the \n     age of 33. During those early years in state government, he \n     honed the leadership skills that served him so well in \n     Washington.\n       He was open, he was honest in his dealings, he was always \n     fair and civil to both sides in an argument, and once he had \n     given his word he stood by it without equivocation.\n       He was a genuine representative of the people who shunned \n     political labels and special interests, and he was scrupulous \n     about doing his homework on the issues, so that when he \n     spoke, it was from personal understanding.\n       The Dick Russell we Georgians knew regarded public service \n     as his life and his work and devoted himself unstintingly to \n     it. He worked 12-hour days, cooked his own meals, washed his \n     own socks in an austere bachelor apartment. He cared deeply \n     about his large family, and his only indulgence was frequent \n     visits with his kinfolk at the Russell family home in the \n     little town of Winder, Georgia.\n       Many of you, of course, remember him as Mr. Defense, the \n     powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. And \n     in Georgia, we still feel the positive economic impact of the \n     many federal facilities be brought to our state.\n       In Georgia, we also remember, however, that by his own \n     measure, as Senator Nunn mentioned awhile ago, in his own \n     mind the highest accomplishment of his career and the only \n     piece of legislation for which he jealously guarded his \n     authorship, was the school lunch program.\n       Here in Washington, his name lives on in this impressive \n     Senate Office Building. In Georgia, the infrastructure is a \n     little less imposing. The post office in Winder is named for \n     him, as is an elementary school in Cobb County, an \n     agriculture research center in Athens, the federal district \n     courthouse in Atlanta, an Army Corps of Engineers reservoir, \n     and a scenic stretch of north Georgia highway.\n       But we really remember him better through ideas and \n     intellect, the Russell Chair in American History at the \n     University of Georgia; the Russell All-State High School \n     Debate Championship; the Russell Teaching Awards; the Russell \n     Leadership Program for Outstanding College Students; the \n     Russell Public Policy Symposium; and the Russell Library for \n     Political Research and Studies.\n       These activities are supported by the Richard B. Russell \n     Foundation, which also commissioned this statue to bring a \n     remembrance of the man himself into this building that honors \n     him.\n       But at the same time that we always remember Richard \n     Russell as Georgia's senator, the unfailing champion in \n     Washington of our interests and our state, at the same\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\n     time we remember that, as another great Georgia Senator by \n     the name of Sam Nunn pointed out, Richard Russell was a \n     statesman.\n       And these are Sam Nunn's words: He understood the simple \n     and powerful truth that the best way to serve your state is \n     to do the best job you can in serving your nation.\n       And that is what made him a senator's senator and a \n     president's senator and a Georgia's senator, and a senator \n     for the ages.\n       [Applause.]\n       Senator Nunn. Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude our program \n     and acknowledge our special guests and, in particular, the \n     Russell family, I would like to call on Mr. Charles Campbell.\n       Charlie served on the staff of Senator Russell during the \n     last six years of his life and was his administrative \n     assistant at the time of Senator Russell's death. Senator \n     Byrd will recall that Charles was with Senator Russell when \n     he cast his last vote that I mentioned earlier and that \n     Senator Byrd mentioned--his vote by proxy from his hospital \n     bed in 1971 for Senator Byrd to be majority whip.\n       It is my pleasure to introduce the Chairman of the Richard \n     B. Russell Foundation and someone who must have been the \n     youngest administrative assistant in the history of the \n     United States Senate, Mr. Charlie Campbell.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. Thank you, Senator Nunn.\n       Vice President Gore, Senator Byrd, Senator Stevens, Senator \n     Nunn, Governor Miller, other distinguished guests, friends \n     and family of Senator Russell, ladies and gentlemen.\n       On behalf of the Russell Foundation, it is my pleasure to \n     welcome you to the dedication and unveiling of the Russell \n     statue and to thank you for your attendance.\n       There are so many distinguished guests present that we \n     cannot hope to recognize all of them, but I know Senator \n     Russell would be particularly pleased with the large number \n     of currently serving and former members of Congress in the \n     audience. And I would like to ask all of the currently \n     serving and former members of Congress, both House and Senate \n     in attendance, to please stand and let us recognize them.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. I want to recognize individually the senators \n     who are here and who served with Senator Russell. You have \n     already met Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens. The other \n     senators who served with Senator Russell and who are present \n     today and still serving in the Senate are:\n       Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon.\n       Senator William Roth of Delaware.\n       Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.\n       Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island.\n       And Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.\n       I'd like to ask them to please stand and be recognized.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. We are also delighted to have present certain \n     former members of the Senate who served with Senator Russell, \n     some for extended periods of time. I would now like to \n     recognize these senators:\n       Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana.\n       Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana.\n       Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland.\n       Senator Robert Griffin of Michigan.\n       Senator Russell Long of Louisiana.\n       Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana.\n       Senator George McGovern of South Dakota.\n       Senator Frank Moss of Utah.\n       Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin.\n       And Senator Harrison Williams of New Jersey.\n       I'd like to ask these senators to stand, please, and be \n     recognized.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. As many of you know, Senator Russell was one \n     of 13 brothers and sisters, and the Russell family is an \n     exceedingly large family. It is well-represented here today. \n     I would like to ask each member of the Russell family in \n     attendance to please stand.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. We also have with us a number of the members \n     of Senator Russell's staff or the staff of the committees \n     which he chaired or on which he served, and I would like to \n     ask the members of the Russell staff who are in attendance \n     to please stand.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. The Russell Foundation, of which I am honored \n     to serve as Chairman, is fortunate to have a dedicated Board \n     of Trustees, the names of whom are published in your program. \n     A number of the Russell trustees are in attendance today, and \n     I would like for them to stand and be recognized.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. Each of the donors who contributed $5,000 or \n     more to the Russell statue are listed in your program, and I \n     would like to ask the individual contributors or \n     representatives of corporate contributors who are in \n     attendance today to please stand and be recognized.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. A project such as the Russell statue could \n     not be accomplished without the assistance of a lot of \n     people. I particularly want to thank Senator Sam Nunn and his \n     staff for the many things they have done to bring this \n     project to fruition, and I also can't let the occasion pass \n     without saying, Senator, particularly in light of your \n     retirement now, how much we appreciate your 24 years of \n     Richard Russell-type service in the United States Senate.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. Senator Paul Coverdell and his staff have \n     been of immeasurable assistance to us in putting on this \n     program, and I want to ask Senator Coverdell to please stand \n     and be recognized.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. Senator Russell's close friend, Senator \n     Robert Byrd, has served as the official sponsor of the \n     dedication of the Russell statue and the reception that will \n     follow in the Caucus Room on the third floor of the Russell \n     Building, to which you are each invited. I would like to \n     thank Senator Byrd and his staff for all of the help they \n     have given us with the Russell statue dedication.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. With respect to the Russell statue itself, we \n     are indebted to the stone carver and the sculptor. As you \n     will see when the statue is unveiled in a few minutes, the \n     master stone-carver at the National Cathedral, Mr. Vincenzo \n     Palumbo, who carved the Russell statue from a large block of \n     white Italian marble using the model developed by the \n     sculptor, did an outstanding job. I would like to ask Mr. \n     Palumbo and his family to stand and be recognized.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. We were particularly blessed to have a \n     talented sculptor who had a special interest in this project. \n     The Russell Foundation selected Frederick Hart from a number \n     of sculptors who were interviewed. We were particularly \n     impressed by some of his public works, including the soldier \n     figures at the Vietnam Memorial, and the Creation sculptures \n     at the entrance to the National Cathedral here in Washington.\n       Frederick Hart is a native of Atlanta, Georgia, and he was \n     already well-acquainted with Richard Russell's career before \n     commencing his work on the Russell statue. In fact, his \n     father was in the television business and was active in the \n     1952 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on \n     behalf of the late Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee who \n     was a candidate for president that year.\n       Senator Russell was himself a candidate for president in \n     the 1952 Democratic Presidential Primaries.\n       Frederick Hart is not only an excellent sculptor, but was a \n     pleasure to work with on the Russell statue. I would like to \n     ask Rick and his wife and two sons who are in the audience to \n     please stand and be recognized at this time.\n       [Applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. And before we unveil the Russell statue, I \n     would like to make a request of three groups, if they would, \n     to, after the dedication is over, come down front so we can \n     have some photographs made of these groups with the statue.\n       The first ones are senators here who served with Senator \n     Russell, both currently serving senators and former senators.\n       Secondly, the Russell trustees.\n       Third, the Russell staff.\n       If you would come down after the dedication is over to the \n     front so we can have some photographs made with the statue.\n       Now, for the unveiling of the statue. I would like to ask \n     the sculptor, Frederick Hart, and Senator Russell's two \n     surviving sisters, Mrs. Pat Peterson and Mrs. Caroline \n     Nelson, who are seated over here, to come forward to unveil \n     the statue.\n       [The statue is unveiled.]\n       [Sustained applause.]\n       Mr. Campbell. Rick, I think that Senator Russell, who was \n     known to be quite a critic of portraits and likenesses, would \n     say that it's a great job, and thank you so much.\n       That concludes our program. Everyone is invited to the \n     reception up on the third floor in the Caucus Room, and thank \n     you very much for attending.\n       [Applause.]\n       [Whereupon, the ceremony was concluded.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3207-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3212-S3213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DR. VERNE CHANEY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, before entering the Senate I was closely \nassociated with the International Rescue Committee [IRC], serving as a \nvice president in charge of IRC's Washington office. During my time \nwith IRC, I had the privilege of knowing the legendary Dr. Tom Dooley, \nwho helped to found Medical International Cooperation [MEDICO] as a \ndivision of the IRC with the goal of providing medical assistance to \nthe underserved in Southeast Asia.\n  In 4 short years with MEDICO, Dr. Dooley established 17 medical \nprograms in 14 countries and raised millions of dollars for their \nsupport. Dr. Tom Dooley truly became a legend in his own time.\n  Tragically, Dr. Dooley died of cancer in January 1961, one day after \nhis 34th birthday. However, Mr. President, Dr. Dooley's magnificent \nwork did not cease with his death. A dedicated colleague, Verne Chaney, \nM.D., gave up a lucrative private practice of thoracic surgery in \nMonterey, CA, to establish the Dooley Foundation. This year marks the \n35th anniversary of the Dooley Foundation and Dr. Chaney has served as \nits president throughout the 35 year of its existence.\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\n  I want to take the occasion of this anniversary to recognize and pay \npersonal tribute to the outstanding contribution which Verne Chaney has \nmade in fighting disease, ignorance, and suffering in so many \nunderserved areas of the world.\n  Dr. Chaney, a native of Kansas City, MO, and an honor graduate of the \nVirginia Military Institute, developed an interest in medical \nassistance work very early in his career. Even before graduating from \nthe Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1948, he spent two summers in \nNewfoundland and Labrador as a volunteer assisting local doctors in \nsmall cottage hospitals. One day after the Korean war broke out on June \n25, 1950, Dr. Chaney resigned his position as resident in surgery at \nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital to volunteer with the Army Medical Corps.\n  He was assigned to a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital [MASH] in Korea. \nHe then volunteered for assignment to a battalion aid station with the \n23d Regiment of the 2d Infantry Division where he served for 13 months. \nCaptain Chaney was highly decorated, receiving the Silver Star, Bronze \nStar (V), Purple Heart, and the French Croix de Guerre.\n\n  After an honorable discharge, he continued his residency in thoracic \nsurgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of North \nCarolina. Soon after completing his residency, Dr. Chaney volunteered \nto work at the Hospital Albert Schweitzer in Haiti as chief of surgery. \nAfter 15 months, Dr. Chaney returned from Haiti and entered into the \nprivate practice of thoracic surgery in Monterey, CA.\n  A defining moment in Dr. Chaney's life occurred in the summer of \n1960, when he met Dr. Tom Dooley. Dr. Dooley was recruiting for MEDICO \nand asked Dr. Chaney to volunteer for 3 months in Cambodia and Vietnam \nto perform surgical procedures and to train host country health \npersonnel. Dr. Chaney quickly agreed and was assigned to work in a \nhospital in Kratie, Cambodia, and at a tuberculosis hospital in Quang \nNgai, South Vietnam. He was also asked to provide clinical services at \nthe An-Lac Orphanage in Saigon.\n  After finishing his first assignment with MEDICO, Dr. Chaney returned \nto private practice in Monterey, CA. On the night of Tom Dooley's death \nhe was asked by Tom's brother, Malcolm, to accept the position of \nmedical director for MEDICO's projects in Asia. Taking a leave of \nabsence from his practice, Verne Chaney spent the next year overseeing \nmedical programs in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia, \nand Vietnam.\n  In the fall of 1961, MEDICO had a severe financial problem; and was \nforced to cut back its overseas projects, later becoming a division of \nCARE. However, Dr. Chaney was determined to continue independently the \noverseas projects started by Tom Dooley and in September 1961, he \nestablished the Dooley Foundation in San Francisco, CA. Under the aegis \nof the Dooley Foundation, medical assistance projects were continued in \nCambodia, Hong Kong, Laos, Vietnam, and with Tibetan refugees in \nnorthern India. In spite of his heavy responsibilities with the Dooley \nFoundation, Dr. Chaney, in 1965, volunteered to work for several months \nwith Dr. Albert Schweitzer in Lambarene, Gabon, to provide medical and \nsurgical services.\n  With the end of the Indochina war in December 1975, and the takeover \nby the Communists, the Dooley Foundation was forced to leave the \nregion. However, the foundation found new opportunities for service.\n  Over the years, project activities have included the training of \nnurses and physical therapists in Nepal; assistance to refugees from \nLaos and Cambodia in Thailand; medical and educational assistance to \nTibetan refugee children in India; medical assistance to a clinic for \nnomads in Niger; and medical assistance to refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons in El Salvador, Honduras--partially financed by a \ncontract with USAID--Nicaragua and Afghan refugees in Pakistan. New \nmedical assistance projects are pending in Laos, Cambodia, and \nMongolia.\n  Mr. President, as Dr. Chaney looks back on his 35 years of service \nwith the Dooley Foundation, he can indeed take great satisfaction in \nthe accomplishments of the foundation. However, it is also appropriate \nto note that the need to serve the world's underprivileged continues. \nSo long as there are children and villagers in the developing nations \nof the world who are without adequate nutrition, sanitation, and clean \nwater; so long as immunizations against preventable diseases are \nlacking; so long as mothers are ignorant of proper hygiene and \nnutrition, there is need for the person-to-person humanitarian care \nwhich has been provided by the Dooley Foundation and for the inspiring \nleadership and service of physicians like Verne Chaney.\n  In closing Mr. President I want to quote Dr. Chaney directly: ``but \nthe task is never done--though battles are won--the war against hunger, \ndisease, and ignorance is unending and must be fought by men and women \nunited by a consciousness of the brotherhood of man.'' As Edmund Burke \nsaid, ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good \nmen to do nothing.''\n  Mr. President, our country has always been very proud of the American \ntradition of selfless humanitarian service to the less fortunate of the \nworld--which dedicated Americans like Tom Dooley and Verne Chaney so \nbeautifully exemplify. Their devotion to serving others is an \ninspiration for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3212-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING THE FORT HAYS STATE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, once again, the 1995-96 basketball season \nhas shown the Nation that when it comes to basketball, the State of \nKansas is head and shoulders above the rest. I would like to \ncongratulate the University of Kansas men's and women's basketball \nteams for once again making it to the NCAA tournament, and I would like \nto congratulate Kansas State University on their season and entry into \nthe NCAA tournament. While both of these schools had great seasons, the \nyear belongs to Coach Gary Garner and the Fort Hays State Men's \nBasketball Team for their outstanding 1995-96 season, which they capped \noff by winning the NCAA II Men's National Basketball Championship. \nTheir effort is certainly one that all Kansans can be proud of.\n  The Tigers of Fort Hays State completed a 34 to 0 season this year by \ndefeating Northern Kentucky University 70 to 63 in the championship \ngame. En route to their championship victory and outstanding season, \nthe Tigers entered elite company, by becoming the third unbeaten team \nto win the tournament in NCAA II History. Fort Hays State finished the \nseason ranked No. 1 and currently holds the Nation's longest winning \nstreak.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David \nPackard, whose death on March 26 ended the distinguished career of one \nof America's\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nmost innovative, visionary, and generous business leaders.\n  David Packard was an outstanding public servant as well. He was \nDeputy Secretary of Defense under Secretary Melvin Laird, 1969-71, in \nwhat many consider one of the strongest teams ever to head the \nDepartment of Defense. His understanding of both broad issues and nuts \nand bolts of management was the ideal complement to Laird's knowledge \nof the Pentagon and Washington.\n  More recently, Packard chaired the President's Blue Ribbon Commission \non Defense Management under President Reagan--generally known as the \nPackard Commission. The Commission's study of the Department's \nprocurement process led to the establishment of the position of \nUndersecretary for Acquisition and to the streamlining of military \nbuying practices. He testified on a number of occasions before the \nArmed Services Committee and provided valuable advice on organization \nand buying procedures. He was always extremely helpful to the committee \nand to me whenever we called on him.\n  A few years after their graduation from Stanford during the Great \nDepression, David Packard and William Hewlett borrowed $538 from a \nformer professor and launched Hewlett-Packard in the garage of \nPackard's rented house. It is one of the great American success \nstories.\n  ``We weren't interested in the idea of making money. Our idea was if \nyou couldn't find a job, you'd make one for yourself. Our first several \nyears we made 25 cents an hour.'' Today his company is our Nation's \nsecond largest computer company and Silicon Valley's biggest employer, \nwith 100,000 employees around the world and $31 billion in sales last \nyear.\n  Packard became one of the richest men in America, but he lived \nmodestly to the end, using his great wealth to follow, on a broader \nscale, the principles that guided him in managing the company--\nencouraging individual creativity, providing opportunity for \ndevelopment of knowledge and skills, fostering mutual respect and \ntrust.\n  The key to his business success was the key to his character as well. \nThe important thing was to make or do something useful. He had no \npatience with ostentation in corporate executives, nor with those who \nmade short-term profits made by cutting long-term investment in \nresearch, new product development, customer services, or facilities and \nequipment.\n  David Packard's management philosophy and methods became models for \nother companies. He viewed his employees as colleagues with ideas, \nskills, loyalty, and understanding he valued. He practiced management \nby walking the factory floor and insisted on an open-door policy in \nexecutive offices. Workers called him Dave and he encouraged them to \ncome to him with their gripes as well as their ideas for improving \nproducts and operations. In return, they gave him undying loyalty and \nthe benefit of their best efforts and creative ideas.\n  He was semiretired through the 1980's, but he and William Hewlett \nreturned to the company in 1991 when it experienced a financial slump. \nPackard was the driving force behind the reorganization that \nrevitalized the company.\n  When Packard retired as chairman for a second time in 1993, someone \nasked him what was his proudest moment. Instead of pointing to one of \nhis many accomplishments, David Packard said simply, ``Do something \nuseful, then forget about it and go on to the next thing. Don't gloat \nabout it.''\n  That accurately described his own approach throughout a long and \nimminently successful life. Whenever he finished doing something \nuseful, he looked for something else useful to do.\n  A Phi Beta Kappa, football and basketball player at Stanford, he was \na dedicated outdoorsman all his life, and a staunch Republican. He made \nmajor gifts over the years to Stanford, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and \nthe Wolf Trap Foundation.\n  One of his last acts, not long before he died, was to give a generous \ndonation to the Paralympics that will be held in Atlanta this summer, \nthe week after the Centennial Olympic games. It was typical of David \nPackard that, at 83, he was thinking about ways to encourage individual \nexcellence, helping to provide talented athletes from disabled \ncommunity the opportunity to participate in international competition.\n  Our Nation is a better place because of his innovations, his \nphilosophy, his example, and his dedication to both making and doing \nsomething useful. David Packard's character matched his physique--he \nwas a giant of a man.\n  His beloved wife, Lucille Laura Salter Packard, died in 1987. I know \nthe Senate joins me in expressing our deepest sympathy to his children, \nwho were at his side when he died: David Woodley Packard, Nancy Ann \nPackard Burnett, Susan Packard Orr, and Julie Elizabeth Packard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3213-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3214-S3215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO EDMUND S. MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise to join with my fellow Senators in \nmourning the death of former Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, and in \npaying tribute to one of the most distinguished and influential Members \nof this body during a turbulent period in our history.\n  Ed Muskie worked his way through Bates College, where he was a Phi \nBeta Kappa, and earned a scholarship to Cornell's law school. After \nserving in the Navy on destroyer escorts during World War II, he was \nelected to the Maine House, where he served as minority leader. He won \nthe Governorship of Maine during the Eisenhower years when no Democrat \nhad held the office in 20 years, and was easily re-elected. He \nrevitalized the State party and was elected and re-elected to the U.S. \nSenate until his resignation to become Secretary of State in 1980 \nduring the last difficult months of the Iran hostage crisis. It was a \ntime of great tension following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, \nduring which the United States boycotted the Olympic games in Moscow.\n  Ed Muskie was Hubert Humphrey's Vice-Presidential running mate in \n1968. Few people remember how close that election was, and one reason \nit was so close was the strength Ed Muskie brought to the ticket. He \nstarted out the frontrunner, but his own campaign for the Presidential \nnomination in 1972 was unsuccessful, damaged by the dirty tricks the \nNation would only learn about only later. It is ironic, but a tribute \nto the man, that the most damaging thing his enemies could point to in \nhis conduct was that he loved his wife enough to lose his usual control \nwhen they attempted to slander her.\n  Senator Muskie returned to the Senate and in 1974 became the first \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I had the privilege of serving with \nhim on the committee during my formative early years in the Senate. He \nwas a strong voice for budget stability. The processes he established \nfor monitoring Federal spending, and his insistence on holding down \nspending across a broad range, including the areas of his own major \nconcerns. This is the same process being used today in our attempt to \nachieve a balanced budget by 2007.\n  Senator Muskie deserves major credit for most of the important early \nenvironmental legislation. He held together fragile coalitions of \nliberals and conservatives in budget battles, challenged Presidential \npolicies and his own wing of the Democratic party for its failure to \nchange. Through it all, he earned the respect of both allies and foes.\n  After his stint as Secretary of State, he retired to private law \npractice. He returned briefly to public service in 1987 on the Special \nReview Board on the Iran-Contra Scandal, also known as the Tower \nCommission.\n  Ed Muskie was a big man, big enough to still the voices of hecklers \nby inviting them up on the platform with him, big enough early in his \nSenate career to stand up to majority leader Lyndon Johnson at the \nheight of his power, and big enough to gain the respect of his fellow \nSenators, and of Johnson himself. He believe in what he called a \npolitics of trust, not of fear.\n  Ed Muskie was often described as ``Lincolnesque.'' His middle name, \nSixtus, was the name of five Popes during the 15th and 16th centuries. \nHis last name had been shortened by immigration officials from what \nthey considered the unpronounceable Polish name of his forefathers when \nhis father arrived at Ellis Island. But whatever people called him, \nwherever his names came from, Ed Muskie was his own man.\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\n  What we remember is not the occasional flash of temper but his \nmodesty, moderation, and self-deprecating humor, and his capacity for \nbridging differences. He was a man of great humanity who stood for \nreason and reconciliation in a time of division and disunity.\n  Ed Muskie graced this body with his healing and imposing presence, \nhis self-deprecating humor, and his personal integrity for 21 years. He \nserved his State and country courageously for more than three decades. \nI am honored to have served with him, and want to express my deepest \nsympathy, and that of this body, to Jane, his wonderful wife of 48 \nyears, and to their children Stephen, Ellen, Melinda, Martha, and \nEdmund, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3214-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WEEK\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, every morning, millions of parents kiss \ntheir children goodbye as they trade the hat of parent for the hat of \nteacher, police officer, waitress or doctor. When they leave home to \nwork, they must leave their precious young ones in the care of someone \nelse. Sometimes, parents find a relative. More often, they rely on \nstrangers. As a parent myself, I know how difficult it can be to trust \nsomeone else with the well being of your child. Fortunately, most \nparents have reliable child care providers to depend on. We hear \noccasional horror stories of abuse and mistreatment by child care \nproviders, but the majority of child care workers always have the best \ninterests of the child at heart. April 21-28 will be the Week of the \nYoung Child. During this important week, South Dakota will recognize \nChild Care Provider's Day on April 22. I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize these hard working child care providers who \nsupport millions of American families each day.\n  My State has a claim to fame that most Americans would not guess. \nAccording to the most recent census data, 71 percent of mothers with \nchildren under the age of six are working moms. The national average is \nless than 60 percent. This means that reliable, quality child care is \nan issue not just for parents in urban areas. Families in rural States \nmust search for adequate child care, too. For families who live in \nremote areas of South Dakota, this may mean driving to the next town to \nfind day care services.\n  Child care providers do not have an easy task. A child's formative \nyears are crucial. Caretakers must provide a stimulating environment \nfor growth and learning. They do not merely babysit. Each child must be \nreached individually to develop language, reasoning and motor skills. \nOnly a secure and nurturing environment can allow this to happen. In \ncreating a home away from home, child care workers are providing \nAmerican families with a very valuable service. For most families, \nsuccess at work and stable home relationships hinge on professional \nchild care.\n  Congress has been working hard over the last year to reform the \nFederal child care system. I wholeheartedly support efforts to end \noverlap of programs and needless bureaucracy. Child care should be \naffordable, accessible, and reliable. I will continue working in \nWashington to ensure quality child care for all American families.\n  Many thanks to the child care workers who daily provide for our \nchildren. They keep our families and workplaces on track. They should \nreceive special recognition during the Week of the Young Child.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3215-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, yesterday I spoke briefly about our failure \nto correct a loophole in the GATT legislation which gives a handful of \ncompanies unprecedented and unintended special treatment. Our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Hatch, raised a few points which my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Chafee and I feel deserve \nclarification.\n  For several months, we have sought an opportunity to remedy the \nmistake made by Congress and the administration when the GATT \nimplementing legislation was enacted. The legislation's grandfather \nprovisions were meant to apply to every person, product, company, and \nindustry in the country. But the final GATT legislation accidentally \nexcluded the prescription drug industry because it lacked a conforming \namendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. As a result, the \nprescription drug industry is the only industry in the country which \nreceived the patent extension but is unfairly exempted and shielded \nfrom competition. Because of this mistake, consumers and taxpayers are \npaying billions of dollars far too much for a handful of drugs, \nincluding Zantac, the world's best-selling drug.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I agree entirely with my colleague, \nSenator Pryor, and wish to raise one simple but important point. It \nshould be noted clearly and conclusively that there is an extensive \nrecord of evidence from the U.S. Trade Representative, the Patent and \nTrademark Office, and the Food and Drug Administration that a mistake \nwas made by both the Congress and the administration. There is \nabsolutely no question as to this fact. To dispel any doubts, I would \nlike to submit for the Record an excerpt from Ambassador Mickey \nKantor's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 27:\n\n       The Congress and the Administration did not, however, take \n     into account the technical interrelationship between the \n     Patent Act and the regulation of pharmaceutical products by \n     the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. In fact, no one--\n     including those in the private sector who watched these \n     developments closely--took this interrelationship into \n     account. This [Senate Judiciary] Committee and the House \n     Judiciary Committee held a joint hearing on August 12, 1994, \n     to review the intellectual property provisions of the URAA \n     and not a single reference was made to this system. In all \n     this time, not a single reference was made to the fact that \n     pharmaceuticals may be treated differently than other forms \n     of technology, not even by Gerald Mossinghoff of the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, who \n     testified in support of this legislation without referring to \n     this provision . . . We did not intend for this to happen and \n     we support the correction of this oversight through the \n     appropriate amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and \n     the Patent Act.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I concur wholeheartedly with Senator \nChafee. Let me add that for a number of months, we have sought an \nopportunity to vote on the missing conforming amendment. In December, a \nprimary argument against acting on the amendment was the alleged need \nfor a committee hearing. The February 27 hearing was never sought by us \nand, in fact, it did not add a single additional fact to the public \nrecord on this issue. The hearing simply reinforced the substantial \nbody of evidence which proves a costly and inequitable mistake was made \nand is in urgent need of correction.\n  Nor has a markup in any committee ever been an objective of those \nseeking to correct this congressional mistake.

A bill to permit individuals to continue health plan \ncoverage of services while participating in approved clinical studies; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                       BREAST CANCER LEGISLATION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I introduce two important pieces of \nlegislation which promise to be of great significance to women with \nbreast cancer: the Consumer Involvement in Breast Cancer Research Act \nof 1996, and the Improved Patient Access to Clinical Studies Act of \n1996.\n  Breast cancer is a national health crisis of enormous proportions. \nEach year, breast cancer strikes approximately 182,000 women, resulting \nin 46,000 deaths. It has become the most common form of cancer and the \nsecond leading cause of death among American women. An estimated 2.6 \nmillion women in the United States are living with breast cancer, 1.6 \nmillion have been diagnosed with the disease, and an estimated 1 \nmillion women do not yet know they have breast cancer.\n  Some 1 out of 8 women in our country will develop breast cancer in \nher lifetime, up from one out of 14 in 1960. In fact, this year, a new \ncase of breast cancer will be diagnosed every 3 minutes, and a woman \nwill die from breast cancer every 11 minutes.\n  Breast cancer is a crisis that has tragically claimed the lives of \nalmost 1\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\nmillion women of all ages and backgrounds since 1960. It has become the \nleading cause of death for women age 40 to 44, and the leading cause of \ncancer death in women age 25 to 54.\n  In 1994, 900 Maine women were diagnosed with breast cancer. This is \nthe most commonly diagnosed form of cancer among Maine women, and \nrepresents more than 30 percent of all new cancer among women in Maine.\n  Over the past few years, we have made significant gains in funding \nfor breast cancer research. In fiscal year 1991, Congress spent $92.7 \nmillion on breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health. \nBy fiscal year 1995, spending had increased to $308.7 million. \nMoreover, the Department of Defense has received $460 million over the \npast 3 years to undertake breast cancer research.\n  However, funding alone is not enough. We must work to ensure that the \nmost worthy and innovative projects are pursued and funded. This means \nfunding projects which victims of breast cancer believe are important \nand meaningful to them in their fight to live with this disease.\n  Over the past 3 years, the Department of Defense has included lay \nbreast cancer advocates in breast cancer research decision making. The \ninvolvement of these breast cancer advocates has helped foster new and \ninnovative breast cancer research funding designs and research \nprojects. While maintaining the highest level of quality assurance \nthrough peer review, breast cancer advocates have helped to ensure that \nall breast cancer research reflects the experiences and wisdom of the \nindividuals who have lived with the disease. In addition, breast cancer \nadvocates provide a vital educational link between the scientific and \nlay communities.\n  My bill, the Consumer Involvement in Breast Cancer Research Act of \n1996, urges the National Institutes of Health to follow the DOD's lead. \nIt urges NIH to include breast cancer advocates in breast cancer \nresearch decision making, and to report on progress that the Institute \nis making next year.\n  I believe that this legislation provides the critical next step in \nmaking breast cancer research more responsive to the needs of millions \nof American women living with breast cancer.\n  But it is not the only step we need to take. People suffering from \ndiseases with no known cure often have access to the latest, most-\ninnovative therapies only through clinical trials. This is often the \ncase for women with breast cancer. Yet insurance companies regularly \ndeny coverage for such treatments on the basis that they are \nexperimental or investigational.\n  As a result, many patients who could benefit from these potentially \nlife-saving investigational treatments do not have access to them \nbecause their insurance will not cover the costs. Denying reimbursement \nfor these services also impedes the ability of scientists to conduct \nimportant research, by reducing the number of patients who are eligible \nto participate in clinical trials.\n  The second bill I am introducing today, the Improved Patient Access \nto Clinical Studies Act of 1996, addresses this problem. This bill \nwould prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage for services \nprovided to individuals participating in clinical trials, if those \nservices would otherwise be covered by the plan. This bill would also \nprevent health plans from discriminating against enrollees who choose \nto participate in clinical trials.\n  Mr. President, March is Women's History Month. We should take this \nopportunity to celebrate the important gains we have made over the past \nfew years in the area of women's health research. At the same time, we \nmust also recognize how far we still have to go. I believe that the \nbills I have introduced today represent continued progress in the fight \nagainst breast cancer, and I urge my colleagues to support them.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1658. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nimproved access to quality long-term care services and to provide \nincentives for the purchases of long-term care insurance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the family choice in long-term care act\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the graying of America means \nsignificant changes for our Nation's families. Traditionally, a family \nmember, most likely a wife or daughter, has cared for an ailing spouse \nor parent at home. However, today's pressures of work, child-rearing, \nand family mobility greatly restrict the ability of adult children to \nadminister to the day-to-day needs of a chronically ill parent. In \naddition, the rigors of home-based care can have a debilitating impact \non the health and well-being of a caring spouse.\n  Few families are fully prepared for the physical, emotional, or \nfinancial demands of long-term care. For too many, this difficult \njourney begins with a unexpected jolt from a sudden accident, the death \nof a spouse or parent, or the diagnosis of a debilitating, long-term \nillness.\n  As America's population ages, the need for long-term care increases. \nIn 1993, almost 33 million Americans were over the age of 65, and by \n2011, the elderly population is estimated to number close to 40 \nmillion. While the opportunity for a happy and healthy retirement is \nbetter than ever, an October 1995 long-term care survey by Harvard/\nHarris revealed that 1 in 5 Americans over age 50 is at high risk of \nneeding long-term care during the next 12 months.\n  Today, a variety of long-term care services are available, from help \nin cleaning one's home and getting groceries to skilled nursing care \nwith 24-hour supervision. However, the means to pay for long-term care \nare still very limited and the expense can be overwhelming. For \nexample, $59 billion was spent on nursing home care for the elderly in \n1993, and 90 percent was covered by out-of-pocket payments and \nMedicaid.\n  The cost of paying out-of-pocket for 1 year in a nursing home is more \nthan triple a senior's average annual income. Long-term care expenses \nput a lifetime of work and investment at risk. To gain Medicaid \ncoverage, seniors must spend down their assets in order to meet State \neligibility requirements. While Medicare takes care of hospital costs \nand home care, it provides only limited coverage for short-term stays \nin skilled nursing facilities.\n  The medical side of long-term care has seen enormous advances over \nthe years in new technologies, facilities, treatment methods, and even \npsychological studies of the effects of long-term care on patients. But \nthe financing side of long-term care has simply failed to keep up, and \nas a result it is ill-prepared for seniors' future needs. Today, \nprivate insurance pays for less than 2 percent of long-term care costs. \nAs Federal mandates for Medicaid coverage have increased, States have \nattempted to contain costs by restricting services for the elderly. \nState-imposed caps on the number of Medicaid-sponsored nursing home \nbeds has separated families from their loved ones because the only \nMedicaid beds available were hundreds of miles away from their \ncommunity. Most disturbingly, the remaining assets of a deceased \nelderly couple can be tapped through an estate recovery action to \ncompensate the State for the couple's Medicaid expenses.\n  Since 1990, Medicaid expenditures for long-term care have been \nincreasing by almost 15 percent annually, causing costs to double every \n5 years. Medicaid's service as the sole long-term care safety net for \nmiddle class seniors may seriously impair the program's ability to \nserve the underprivileged. While low-income families accounted for 73 \npercent of Medicaid's beneficiaries in 1993, nearly 60 percent of \nexpenditures went to nursing home care and other long-term care \nservices. For example, in 1993, Kentucky's Medicaid spending per \nenrollee for children was $964; while the cost for elderly \nbeneficiaries was $6,540. Without relief, a harsh battle between \ngenerations may emerge.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family Choice in Long-\nTerm Care Act, a bill that would alleviate dependence on Medicaid by \nenabling families and seniors to plan ahead for their long-term care \nneeds. Currently, our tax code does not define long-term care as a \nmedical expense. My proposal would end this discrimination and allow \nlong-term care expenses and policy premiums to be tax deductible.\n  Like health care insurance, payments under long-term care insurance \nwould not be taxable when received. Children would be able to purchase \npolicies on behalf of their parents. In\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\naddition, employer-based plans would be treated like accident or health \npolicies. Individuals could convert a life insurance contract in favor \nof a long-term care policy without suffering a tax penalty. Under my \nbill, terminally or chronically ill patients could receive accelerated \ndeath benefits to pay for their long-term care needs. And my \nlegislation would also permit qualified withdrawals from individual \nretirement accounts of 401(k) plans for the purchase of a long-term \ncare policy.\n  Interest in long-term care insurance is growing. According to the \nAmerican Health Care Association, the average growth rate in long-term \ncare policy sales has averaged 27 percent annually since 1987. In 1993 \nalone, a total of 3.4 million insurance policies were sold. A study \nconducted by the research firm of Cohen, Kumar & Wallack found that it \nis not just higher-income seniors who are interested in long-term care \ninsurance. The study showed that 30 percent of surveyed long-term care \npolicy-holders earned less than $20,000 annually.\n  While tax clarifications will make long-term care plans more \naffordable to seniors and families, attention must be paid to assure \ninvestment quality and security. My proposal would establish the \nNational Long-Term Care Insurance Advisory Council to advise Congress \non the market's development and promote public education on the \nnecessity of long-term care planning and the options available. The \nbill also outlines consumer protection standards for policies as \nrecommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n  Finally, my proposal would require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to develop and distribute a summary of recommended health care \npractices to Medicare beneficiaries. As always, prevention is the first \nstep in curtailing the demand for high-cost medical care.\n  While there has been a great deal of rhetoric about tax cuts lately, \nlong-term care tax clarification benefits everyone. Seniors can invest \nin a quality long-term care plan without fear of losing everything they \nown, and families will have access to the support they feel is most \nappropriate for their loved ones.\n  In addition, Medicaid will continue to provide long-term care \nservices for seniors in need. A 1994 study published in Health Affairs \nestimates that Medicaid would save $8,000 to $15,500 on each nursing \nhome entrant who held a long-term care policy. Also, the probability of \na senior's spending down to Medicaid eligibility would be reduced by 40 \npercent. Private long-term care insurance would preserve the medical \nsafety net for seniors and benefit other Medicaid recipients, \nparticularly low-income children and the disabled.\n  Mr. President, in sum, private long-term care insurance translates \ninto quality, flexible care for seniors, more Medicaid funds for low-\nincome families and the disabled, and essential support for families \nwho want their loved ones to be safe and secure. These are priorities \nthat all Members of Congress share. We should not miss this opportunity \nto help America's families prepare for the challenges of long-term \ncare.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1659. A bill to declare a portion of Queens County, New York, to \nbe nonnavigable waters of the United States, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           the queens-west waterfront development act of 1996\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, with my esteemed \ncolleague Senator D'Amato, a bill to eliminate an impediment to an \nimportant economic development project in Queens. The Queens West \ndevelopment is 12 years in the making. Construction of the first \napartment tower should create 1,000 construction jobs, and the entire \nproject should ultimately create 14,000 construction jobs and 10,000 \npermanent jobs. This in a county with unemployment two points higher \nthan the State average.\n  With the financial parties ready to go to closing this month, the \ntitle search turned up an impediment that threatens to make the entire \nproject uninsurable, and therefore untenable. A portion of the \ndevelopment would be built on an area that in the last century was on \nthe watery side of the historical high water mark of the East River. \nSince then it has been filled, bulkheaded, or otherwise developed. The \nFederal Government, however, retains the right of navigational \nservitude, which means the Government can condemn the area because it \nis still navigable in law, if not in fact.\n  The only solution is for Congress to declare the area nonnavigable. \nThis bill does so. The declaration of nonnavigability would apply only \nto areas that ``will be bulkheaded, filled, or otherwise occupied by \npermanent structures or other physical improvements''--including \nparklands. The declaration would expire in 20 years if the area is not \noccupied by permanent structures.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a commonsense effort to allow an \nimportant project to go forward. We will not need to resume navigating \nthis portion of the East River. We do need the economic development \nthat the Queens West project will bring. Senator D'Amato and I ask for \nthe support of our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1659\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DECLARATION OF NONNAVIGABILITY FOR PORTION OF \n                   QUEENS COUNTY, NEW YORK.\n\n       (a) Description of Nonnavigable Area.--Subject to \n     subsections (b) and (c), that portion of Long Island City, \n     Queens County, New York, which is not submerged and lies \n     between the existing southerly high water line of Anable \n     Basin (also known as the 11th Street Basin) and the existing \n     northerly high water line of Newtown Creek and extends from \n     the existing high water line of the East River to the \n     original high water line of the East River is declared to be \n     nonnavigable waters of the United States.\n       (b) Requirement That Areas Be Improved.--\n       (1) In general.--The declaration of nonnavigability under \n     subsection (a) shall apply only to those portions of the \n     areas described in subsection (a) that are or will be \n     bulkhead, filled, or otherwise occupied by permanent \n     structures or other permanent physical improvements \n     (including parklands).\n       (2) Applicability of federal law.--The work to meet the \n     requirements of paragraph (1) shall be subject to applicable \n     Federal laws, including--\n       (A) sections 9 and 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899, commonly \n     known as the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (33 \n     U.S.C. 401 and 403);\n       (B) section 404 of the Federal Water pollution Control Act \n     (33 U.S.C. 1344); and\n       (C) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (43 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n       (c) Expiration Date.--The declaration of nonnavigability \n     under subsection (a) shall expire with respect to a portion \n     of an area described in subsection (b), if that portion--\n       (1) is not filled or otherwise occupied by a permanent \n     structure or other permanent physical improvement (including \n     parkland) in accordance with subsection (b) by the date that \n     is 20 years after the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (2) requires work described in subsection (b)(2) that is \n     subject to a permit under an applicable Federal law, and that \n     work is not commenced by the date that is 5 years after the \n     date of issuance of that permit.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, in introducing legislation that will allow \nfor the commencement of a project of immense economic significance in \nthe city of New York and the Borough of Queens. This project, which has \nbeen named Queens West, will produce a myriad of waterfront apartment \nbuildings, parkland, hotel, and commercial space and will create 14,000 \nconstruction jobs as well as 10,000 permanent jobs. This ambitious \nproject will rejuvenate this section of New York and add to its \nvitality for countless generations to come.\n  As I am sure many of my colleagues can understand, there is a great \ndeal of excitement about the Queens West project. However, with the \nparties ready to close, a single issue has emerged that could delay the \nfinancing and disrupt the timing of this project. Some of the land upon \nwhich Queens West is to be built falls within the historic, \nunobstructed high water mark of the East River that was established in \nthe 1800's. However, a bulkhead has since been established in this \nparticular area and industrial development has occurred there for many \nyears.\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\n Nevertheless, this area still remains defined as ``navigable in law'' \nwhich allows the Federal Government to retain a right to navigational \nservitude. Because of this glitch, the project may not be insurable and \nmay not therefore commence in a timely fashion.\n  The legislation that Senator Moynihan and I are introducing will \nrectify this situation. Simply, it will declare this portion of the \nland nonnavigable and thus take the property out of navigational \nservitude. Should no permanent structure be built on this site within \n20 years, the area reverts to its current status. Once this bill is \npassed, the Borough of Queens and indeed all of New York will receive a \nvital economic boost. This legislation is identical to H.R. 2987, which \nCongressman Tom Manton introduced in the House of Representatives, and \nenjoys support from State and city officials.\n  Mr. President, the thousands of jobs, the housing, the recreational \nopportunities, and the commercial benefits created by the Queens West \nproject are urgently needed. I urge my colleagues to join Senator \nMoynihan and I in supporting speedy passage of this legislation.\n                                       \n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Moynihan, \n        Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        D'Amato, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1660. A bill to provide for ballast water management to prevent \nthe introduction and spread of nonindigenous species into the waters of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n               the national invasive species act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the National \nInvasive Species Act of 1996 with my colleagues Senators Leahy, \nJeffords, Moynihan, Sarbanes, Johnston, Inouye, Mikulski, and Levin. \nThis act is a reauthorization and expansion of the Nonindigenous \nAquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. I am pleased that \nmy Ohio colleague, Congressman LaTourette and 18 of his colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives also are introducing this act today.\n\n  Picture a pollution spill in the waters of your region that simply \nwill not go away. Government and industry teams work to disperse it \nwith chemicals and mechanical barriers, but as soon as the treatments \nstop, the pollution resurges. Worse yet, the spill spreads and \nconcentrates in connecting water ways, and is further seeded by \nunintentional transport overland. Municipalities, manufacturers, and \nagriculture experience degraded water supplies and higher operating \ncosts. Shell fisheries and fin fisheries permanently decline.\n  This scenario seems like a nightmare, yet it closely approximates the \nresult of unintentional releases of nonindigenous species, or \nbiological pollution, into U.S. waters. As a Senator from the Great \nLakes region, where we spend many millions of dollars annually to \nbattle sea lamprey and zebra mussel infestations, I can attest that \nsuch biological spills can and do happen, their impacts on the \nreceiving system are additive, and the resource degradation is \npermanent.\n  As shown in the display map, the zebra mussel, a native species of \neastern Europe, has spread throughout the United States from the Great \nLakes where it was unintentionally introduced in ballast water of \ncommercial vessels around 1986. Wherever it becomes established, the \nzebra mussel threatens both economic and environmental well-being. It \nclogs intake pipes, fouls drinking water, and covers swimming beaches \nwith sharp shells. The zebra mussel also has led to the loss of many \nhighly valued native species of freshwater mussel in both the Great \nLakes and the Mississippi River.\n  I remember when Allegra Cangelosi, who is with me on the floor today, \nfirst came into my office and talked about zebra mussels in the 1980's. \nShe had a bottle of these critters and set them on my desk and said, \n``Here is what they are.'' And they multiply--each zebra mussel lays \nabout 30,000 eggs a year. Eggs that are laid early in the season mature \ninto adult zebra mussels by the end of the season.\n  Zebra mussels and other nonindigenous species can survive in ballast \nwater transported into our nations waters largely because we now have \nfaster sea transportation. Ironically, some of our own waters in this \ncountry are cleaner, allowing the species to become established.\n  The Great Lakes are not the only entryway for invasive species into \nU.S. waters. Last week, I hosted a National Forum on Nonindigenous \nSpecies Invasions of U.S. and Fresh Waters in cooperation with the \nNortheast-Midwest Institute. At the day long event, experts and natural \nresource stakeholders from around the country cited invasion impacts in \njust about all of America's fresh and marine waters. Biodiversity and \neconomic well-being are suffering due to invasions of nonindigenous \nspecies in San Francisco Bay, the Pacific Islands, the Gulf of Mexico, \nthe Mississippi River, the Northeast and Southeast Atlantic coasts, the \nGreat Lakes, and Lake Champlain.\n  In 1990, I authored and gained enactment of the Nonindigenous Aquatic \nNuisance Prevention and Control Act to begin to address the tremendous \nproblem of unintentional invasions of aquatic species into the Great \nLakes and other U.S. waters. The 1990 act consisted of two basic parts: \nOne which focused on prevention of new introductions of species into \nthe Great Lakes by the ballast water of vessels; and the other which \nestablished a national program of prevention, monitoring, management, \nand control of invasive species already established in U.S. waters. \nAll of the many vectors of aquatic species transfers fell under the \npurview of this portion of the act. Most of the revisions contained in \nthe bill which I am introducing today with my Senate and House \ncolleagues pertain to the prevention portion of the program.\n\n  With respect to prevention, the 1990 act focused on ballast water of \nvessels. This water is the leading vector for unintentional transfers \nof nonindigenous species into United States waters. Ships carry ballast \nwater to maintain trim when they are empty or partially empty of cargo. \nThey discharge this water at their ports of call. Currently, there is \npractically nothing to prevent the uptake, transfer, and discharge of \norganisms along with that water.\n  An estimated 21 billion gallons of ballast water from vessels from \nforeign ports is discharged into U.S. waters each year. That's 58 \nmillion gallons per day, and 2.4 million gallons per hour. This ballast \nwater contains just about everything and anything that was in the \nharbor from which the water was drawn. It is estimated that 3,000 \nspecies of aquatic organisms are in transit in ballast tanks around the \nworld in any given 24-hour period. Most of these organisms will come to \nnothing in the receiving ports, but any one of them could cause \nbillions of dollars of damage. It's a huge gamble. Even human cholera \nis transported unintentionally in ballast water and has been detected \nin ships visiting Mobile Bay and the Chesapeake, among other regions.\n  Fortunately, a ballast management practice known as high seas ballast \nexchange greatly reduces the transfers of dangerous organisms through \nballast water. This technique is not applicable in all circumstances; \nit cannot be employed in stormy weather and with some types of vessels. \nHowever, where it can be employed safely, it results in a substantial \nreduction in the risk of invasive species transfers. It is for this \nreason that the Australian Government among other nations, and the \nInternational Maritime Organization, already encourage ballast \nmanagement practices for commercial vessels.\n  The 1990 law included a voluntary ballast management program for the \nGreat Lakes which automatically became regulatory in 1992. The act \nassigned the Coast Guard the task of consulting with the maritime \nindustry and Canada to develop voluntary guidelines, conducting \neducation and outreach, and, after 2 years, promulgating regulations to \nhelp reduce the probability of new introductions of alien species by \ncommercial vessels into the Great Lakes.\n  The 1990 act also included several studies to help build information \non the threat and impacts of ballast discharge on other U.S. waters. \nThese studies, now complete, provide strong evidence that unmitigated \nballast water exchange is a serious economic and environmental threat \nin regions\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\noutside the Great Lakes. In particular, the biological study conducted \npursuant to the act found that a new species of aquatic organism \ninvades San Francisco Bay every 12 weeks. Serious risks of invasion to \nthe Chesapeake Bay and Florida coasts have also been documented. A crab \nwhich is the host of a dangerous human parasite has been found in \nUnited States waters within the Gulf of Mexico, fortunately not yet \nestablished.\n  In light of this information, and based on the successful experience \nwith the Great Lakes voluntary ballast management program, my 1996 \nproposal establishes a national voluntary ballast management program to \nbegin to address concerns of other United States coastal regions. The \nCoast Guard is directed to issue voluntary ballast management \nguidelines for all vessels visiting U.S. ports after operating outside \nthe exclusive economic zone. Consistent with the Great Lakes program, I \nwant to stress, Mr. President, that this program puts safety first. The \nguidelines will protect the safety of vessel and crew, whatever that \nmay entail, including waiving the requirement where necessary.\n  While there will be no penalty against vessels which do not \nparticipate in the national program, record keeping by vessels \nto document participation is required. In the interest of maintaining a \nlevel playing field, the Coast Guard has authority to issue the same \nguidelines as regulations in regions where a review of ship records \nreveals poor cooperation with the voluntary approach. Importantly, the \nmaritime industry would see only one set of rules nationally. However, \nover time, there may be enforcement mechanisms associated with the \nguidelines in certain regions. Of great interest to the Great Lakes \ncommunity, the successful Great Lakes regulatory program remains in \nplace. For better prevention of invasions in the future, a ballast \nwater management demonstration program is established in the Act. This \nproject will demonstrate promising ballast technologies and practices \nto prevent the introduction and spread of nonindigenous species through \nballast water.\n\n  Other changes to the 1990 program which are contained in our National \nInvasive Species Act of 1996 include: First, the authorization of \nresearch in several coastal regions--including the Chesapeake Bay, Lake \nChamplain, the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico--which are at \nparticular risk of degradation by species invasions; second, voluntary \nguidelines to help recreational boaters to prevent unintentional \ntransfer of zebra mussels; and third, provisions to encourage more \nregions to set up coordinating panels and develop State management \nplans for invasive species prevention and control. Though now much \nbroader in scope, I am proud to announce that the overall cost of the \nNational Invasive Species Act of 1996 does not exceed that of the 1990 \nlaw.\n  I would like to close by pointing out that species invasions that \noriginate anywhere on the continent have the potential to affect all of \nus. Once established on the North American continent nonindigenous \ninvasive organisms will make their way to the far reaches of their \npotential range. Just as the zebra mussel has expanded its range from \nthe Great Lakes to the entire Mississippi River and has been found on \nrecreational vessels entering California, the east coast marine \nresources could be harmed by invasions on the west coast and vice-\nversa. Moreover, biological pollution of U.S. waters, so far, has not \nhad serious public health implications. But the 1992 transfer of human \ncholera from South American ports to the shellfish beds of Mobile Bay \nvia ballast water of commercial vessels reminds us that our luck may \nnot hold forever. It is in everyone's interest to improve our Nation's \nprecautions against invasions of aquatic nuisance species. Mr. \nPresident, I will ask unanimous consent that an updated version of a \nNortheast-Midwest Economic Review article be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks. This article provides further background on the \ncontext, history, and content of the National Invasive Species Act.\n  I am personally quite excited about the progress that we can make in \nprotecting the economy, the environment, and the biodiversity of our \ncoasts through passing the National Invasive Species Act this year. \nUnusual in the environmental arena, this issue offers us low-hanging \nfruit and bipartisan enthusiasm. I am grateful to my colleagues, \nSenators Leahy and Sarbanes for authoring legislation last year which \nhelped draw attention to the national scope of the invasive species \nproblem, and to my other colleagues for joining us in support of the \nNational Invasive Species Act. I look forward to working closely with \nthem to gain its enactment. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record, along with the article \npreviously mentioned.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Biological Invasions: Congress Takes a Second Look\n\n (By Allegra Cangelosi, Senior Policy Analyst of the Northeast-Midwest \n                              Institute,)\n\n [From an Updated Version of an Article That Appeared in the Northwest-\n                Midwest Economic Review, September 1995]\n\n       Five years into implementation of the Nonindigenous Aquatic \n     Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (NANPCA), there \n     is new awareness of the magnitude of the exotic species \n     problem and the difficulty of the management task. As \n     Congress prepares to reauthorize the Act, it faces pressure \n     to broaden the prevention program to include coastal areas in \n     addition to the Great Lakes, while keeping the burdens of \n     regulation to a minimum.\n\n\n                    The Life and Times of NANPCA '90\n\n       In 1989 and 1990, the zebra mussel infestation of the lower \n     Great Lakes exploded before the startled eyes of the region's \n     natural resource managers and industrial water users. Mussel \n     encrustation of intake pipes shut-down the Monroe, MI city \n     water supply for two-days, bringing the impact of the zebra \n     mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) directly to the homes of basin \n     residents. Meanwhile, a population of Eurasian ruffe \n     (Gymnocephalus cernuus), a small forage fish native to \n     Eastern Europe, staged in Duluth/Superior Harbor, preparing \n     for an all but inevitable migration from the cold waters of \n     Lake Superior to the more habitable lower Great Lakes.\n       For fishery and biodiversity experts, the appearance of \n     both the zebra mussel and the ruffe implied permanent \n     degradation of the Great Lakes ecosystem. Over time, the two \n     alien species were expected to spread to all five Great Lakes \n     and most of the U.S. freshwater system. Irreversible loss in \n     biological diversity was inevitable; the only question was \n     whether the degradation would be cataclysmic, or gradual and \n     insidious.\n       These concerns arose from hard experience. The sea lamprey \n     (Petromyzon marinus), native to the Atlantic, caused a near \n     collapse of the Great Lakes fishery in the 1950s. A \n     fortuitous discovery of a chemical lampricide is the only \n     reason the fishery is once again abundant. But lampricide \n     treatments, even coupled with vigorous fish stocking efforts \n     by the States, have been effective only at restoring the \n     rough appearance of the pre-lamprey fishery. They cannot \n     restore the system's previous structure, composition or self-\n     sustainability. Moreover, without annual treatments with the \n     lampricide, the populations of lampreys would quickly \n     rebound. The annual battle to continue funding for the \n     lamprey control program provides Great Lakes fishery experts \n     constant incentive to avert the costly and enduring impacts \n     of further exotic species invasions.\n       The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control \n     Act of 1990 (NANPCA) originated in draft in 1989 in response \n     to concern over the potential impact of the Eurasian ruffe on \n     the Great Lakes fishery. But the zebra mussel infestation \n     ultimately filled its political sails, to reach final \n     enactment in just a year.\n       The Act, championed by Senator John Glenn of Ohio, enjoyed \n     enthusiastic support of the bipartisan Great Lakes delegation \n     in both chambers, and several federal agencies, especially \n     the Fish and Wildlife Service. It also benefitted from the \n     commitment of environment committee leadership from outside \n     the basin.\n       NANPCA set forth a national program for preventing, \n     researching, monitoring and controlling infestations in U.S. \n     waters of alien aquatic species. It set up a standing multi-\n     agency task force (the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force), \n     chaired by NOAA and the Fish and Wildlife Service, to develop \n     and oversee the program, a policy review of the impacts of \n     intentional introductions of exotic species (such as for \n     sport fishing or biological pest control), a zebra mussel \n     demonstration project, and state aquatic nuisance management \n     planning. It created a Great Lakes Aquatic Nuisance Species \n     Panel to help coordinate federal, state, local and private \n     sector activities to prevent and control exotic species \n     within the Great Lakes basin. Other provisions addressed the \n     brown tree snake, research protocols to prevent the spread of \n     exotics by research and risk assessment.\n       Most importantly, the Act assigned the Coast Guard the task \n     of promulgating voluntary guidelines and, after two-years, \n     regulations to help reduce the probability of new \n     introductions of alien species by commercial\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\n     vessels. The ballast water of commercial vessels is a leading \n     vector by which alien aquatic species enter U.S. waters. The \n     zebra mussel and the ruffe, along with the spiny water flea \n     (Bythotrephes cederstroemi), and many of the hundred-plus \n     other alien organisms that currently complicate the Great \n     Lakes ecosystem were transported to the Great Lakes in the \n     ballast holds of transoceanic vessels. Red tide, human \n     cholera, and the brown clam (Perna perna), are examples of \n     ballast stow-aways that have been discharged into U.S. marine \n     coastal environments.\n       The 1990 Act underwent many changes as it moved through the \n     Congressional process to enactment. Perhaps the most \n     significant such change was the decision by the Senate \n     Commerce Committee to reduce the scope of the Coast Guard \n     prevention program from national to Great Lakes-only. Besides \n     fiscal concerns of the Coast Guard, the political rationale \n     for such a change was clear. The maritime community had no \n     choice but to acknowledge the obvious though unintended \n     impacts of its ballasting practices on the Great Lakes \n     environment. Moreover, as residents of the basin, Great Lakes \n     port operators and the laker association members shared \n     concern over the condition of the Great Lakes ecosystem. But \n     in areas other than the Great Lakes, there was less awareness \n     of exotic species impacts and the broader maritime community \n     was under less pressure to change its ballasting practices.\n\n\n                            Today's Context\n\n       Today, six years after initial passage of the Act, there is \n     growing interest in reforming the measure to better address \n     other U.S. waters. The zebra mussel has become established in \n     much of the freshwater systems of the eastern United States, \n     including the upper Mississippi River, where it has degraded \n     an economically valuable commercial mollusk fishery. \n     Similarly, there is new awareness of the threat of \n     nonindigenous species to marine coastal areas. Perna perna, \n     native to the Indo-Pacific region, invaded South America via \n     ballast discharge years ago, and was transported to the Gulf \n     of Mexico near Galveston, Texas, more recently. The non-\n     native mussel threatens Mangrove communities, coats hard \n     surfaces and could compete with native oysters.\n       In some cases, concern over the impact of exotic species on \n     aquatic systems beyond the Great Lakes has been elevated to \n     the Congressional level. In 1995, Senator Sarbanes (MD) \n     introduced the Chesapeake Bay Ballast Water Management Act of \n     1995, S. 938, to assure that the reauthorization of NANPCA \n     broadens the Coast Guard's ballast management program to \n     include saltwater coasts. In response the mussel's spread to \n     Vermont, Senator Leahy introduced a measure, the Lake \n     Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act, S. 1089, to focus the \n     reauthorization on the needs of Lake Champlain.\n       Both legislative measures are firmly rooted in the \n     expressed interests of local constituencies. For example, the \n     Sarbanes bill is a response to resolutions passed by the \n     Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania general assemblies urging \n     action to prevent future introductions of nonindigenous \n     aquatic species into the Chesapeake Bay through ballast \n     management. A report developed by a wide range of \n     stakeholders and endorsed by the Chesapeake Bay Commission \n     further spells out the recommendations of the States. While \n     the Sarbanes bill proposes national voluntary guidelines for \n     ballast management, the Chesapeake Bay proposal urges a \n     follow-on regulatory system nationally within 24 months if \n     participation or effectiveness of the voluntary system is \n     inadequate.\n\n\n                 National Invasive Species Act of 1996\n\n       Senator Glenn, author of the 1990 NANPCA, is the lead \n     sponsor of the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (NISA) \n     which reauthorizes and expands the 1990 Act. A bipartisan \n     group of Senators from in and outside the Great Lakes region \n     has joined him in sponsoring the measure. Congressman \n     LaTourette and his colleagues are the sponsors of a companion \n     bill in the House of Representatives. As in 1990, the Senate \n     Commerce Committee is expected to have jurisdiction over the \n     prevention portion of the measure, while the Environment and \n     Public Works Committee will consider the remainder of the \n     bill. Both the Resources Committee and the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure will likely have \n     jurisdiction over part or all of the House measure.\n       In the stark light of 1995-1996 budget fights, a national \n     regulatory ballast management program such as the one \n     proposed in the original 1990 bill appears impractical and \n     unaffordable. To implement such a scheme, the Coast Guard \n     would have to monitor compliance with regulations at each \n     harbor, stretching human and monetary resources beyond their \n     limits. On the other hand, if the Coast Guard were to simply \n     issue national voluntary guidelines, the effort would lack \n     accountability, providing little additional protection for \n     regions eager for change such as the Chesapeake Bay.\n       NISA 1996 finds a middle ground. It emphasizes a voluntary \n     approach in light of the positive response of the shipping \n     community to the voluntary phase of the Great Lakes program. \n     But it reserves authority for the Coast Guard to promulgate \n     the same voluntary guidelines as regulations in coastal \n     regions where recordkeeping or compliance with the voluntary \n     system seem to be lacking. Such an approach gives shippers \n     and ports both the opportunity and incentive to cooperate \n     with voluntary guidelines, while conserving Coast Guard \n     resources for regions with special needs.\n       Whether voluntary or not, a national ballast management \n     program which employs existing port inspection infrastructure \n     will hold the additional hassle for ports, shippers and the \n     Coast Guard to a minimum. NISA 1996 urges a cooperative \n     approach between the Coast Guard and the Animal and Plant \n     Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which already boards \n     vessels to inspect for crop pests. The addition of just a few \n     items on the questionnaire that APHIS routinely distributes \n     to vessel masters could meet new ballast-related reporting \n     needs.\n       Among other changes that are included in NISA 1996 are: \n     Ballast technology demonstrations: A bill introduced in the \n     103rd Congress (and passed in the House) to create a \n     demonstration program for ballast technologies that can be \n     installed or designed into commercial vessels to prevent the \n     unintentional transfers of exotic species is incorporated \n     into NISA 1996.\n       Naval ballast management: A provision from the Sarbanes \n     bill (S. 938) to incorporate ballast management procedures \n     into naval operations is included.\n       Ecological surveys, ballast discharge surveys: The package \n     authorizes the National Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force \n     to undertake ecological and ballast discharge surveys for \n     selected harbor areas to assess the risks and impacts of \n     invasions by exotic species.\n       Voluntary guidelines for recreational boaters: The recent \n     discovery of live zebra mussels on the hull of a recreational \n     vessel ready to enter California waters underscores the role \n     of recreational boating in spreading exotic species \n     infestations. A provision of Senator Leahy's legislation (S. \n     1089) to create national voluntary guidelines for \n     recreational boaters to prevent the spread of zebra mussels \n     is included in NISA 1996.\n       Regional coordination: The reauthorization package includes \n     a provision to encourage the establishment of regional \n     coordinating panels for other regions of the country in \n     addition to the Great Lakes.\n       While the U.S. government invests over $100 million \n     annually to prevent new invasions of exotic agricultural \n     pests, less than $1 million is being invested to prevent new \n     introductions of nonindigenous aquatic organisms as \n     devastation as the sea lamprey. NISA 1996 offers Congress an \n     important opportunity to better protect the nation's valuable \n     marine and freshwater resources from exotic pests. But only \n     support from a broad political spectrum and diverse \n     geographic regions can assure enactment.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an original \ncosponsor of the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, to address the \nserious threat posed by nonindigenous aquatic species entering the U.S. \nwaters from the exchange of ballast water. I want to thank and commend \nmy colleague, Senator Glenn, for his leadership in crafting this very \nimportant legislation.\n  The introduction of nonindigenous species through the exchange of \nballast water is a serious national and international problem with \npotentially profound economic and environmental consequences. These \ninvasive species, such as the zebra mussel, have already caused \nmillions of dollars in damage to municipal and industrial water intake \npipes, and valuable fisheries throughout the United States and Canada. \nBy the turn of the century, damage to aquatic ecosystems and public and \nprivate infrastructure is expected to be in the billions of dollars \nfrom the zebra mussel alone.\n  In the Chesapeake Bay, our Nation's largest estuary, the threat of \nthese invading species is particularly acute due to the extensive \nrelease of ballast water from foreign ports. Over 3 billion gallons of \nballast water a year--more than any other east or west coast port--is \nreleased into the bay from ships calling at the ports of Baltimore and \nNorfolk. This water originates from 48 different foreign ports. An on-\ngoing study by the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, one of \nforemost authorities on this issue, found that nearly 90 percent of the \nvessels sampled arriving at Chesapeake Bay ports had living organisms \nin their ballast water, placing the bay at very high risk from these \npotentially harmful species. Indeed, some scientists speculate that the \ndiseases that devastated oyster stocks in the bay were introduced \nthrough the exchange of ballast water. It is estimated that there more \nthan 100 exotic species now established in the bay, some of which are \nrecent arrivals via ballast water discharge.\n  The interstate and international nature of ballast-mediated invasions \nmake it impractical for the individual States of the Chesapeake region \nto address this risk alone. Various interests\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\nin the Chesapeake Bay community, as well as the State legislatures of \nMaryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, are, in fact, seeking increased \nFederal action to address this important concern. I want to \nparticularly commend the Chesapeake Bay Commission for focussing \nattention on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, this measure is an important step forward in \nunderstanding and managing the risks of ballast-mediated invasions. It \nincorporates provisions of legislation I introduced last year, S. 938, \nto study and manage ballast water releases in the Chesapeake Bay. It \nestablishes national voluntary guidelines for vessels entering U.S. \nwaters to reduce the probability of ballast transfers of these exotic \nspecies. It authorizes research, demonstration, and education programs \nto help prevent the introduction and spread of these species into our \nlakes, rivers, and bays. I urge my colleagues to join with us in \nsupport of this important legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. This \ncomprehensive bill includes the provisions of my Lake Champlain Zebra \nMussel Control Act and is the vehicle which can help Vermont and other \nStates wage war on exotic nuisance species like the zebra mussel.\n  Mr. President, a tiny mussel the size of my thumbnail threatens to \nchoke off 25 percent of Vermont's drinking water, clog our hatcheries, \nand unravel the Lake Champlain ecosystem. It was only three summers ago \nwhen the mussel was first discovered in the South Lake near Orwell, VT, \nby a young boy. Two years later, zebra mussel densities has reached \n134,000 larvae per cubit meter. The end is not in sight.\n  We did not ask for them, but we got them. Now Vermont has to face the \nconsequences of a problem that Vermont has been powerless to stop. The \nzebra mussel problem in Lake Champlain deserves immediate and swift \naction. This exotic pest poses a serious risk to the water resources \nthroughout Vermont, economic opportunities along the lake, and the \nhealth and safety of the people of Vermont.\n  This bill we are introducing today addresses a number of issues that \ncan only be resolved through Federal coordination and cooperation. \nMillions of gallons of water are imported each day from foreign ports \nthroughout the globe. One gallon can contain the seeds of an invasive \nspecies epidemic that can wipe out domestic species, ecosystems, and \neconomic resources. Vermonters know this well through our experience \nwith lampreys on trophy sportfish, millfoil throughout our lakes, and \nzebra mussels in Lake Champlain.\n  The United States needs this bill now. Our inland and marine seaports \nare a ticking time bomb. The heart of this bill is a nationwide effort \nto control the transportation and discharge of ballast water from \ninternational cargo ships. One seaport cannot tackle this problem alone \nwithout risking their economic base. However, if every port works \ntogether, we can protect fisheries, marine resources, and ultimately \ntaxpayers from the enormous cost of fighting an exotic nuisance \nspecies.\n  The other major theme in this bill is a concerted effort to control \nexotic species once they have arrived and multiplied. This second theme \nis based largely on my bill, the Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control \nAct. In addition to highlighting the specific needs of Lake Champlain, \nmy bill--and this bill--includes a three point plan for tackling exotic \nspecies.\n  First, establishes national voluntary guidelines for recreational \nboaters who are a major mechanism for the spread of zebra mussels and \nother exotics within the United States freshwater bodies.\n  Second, allows states to work cooperatively on watershed approaches \nto attack this problem. If Vermont devotes millions of dollars to this \neffort and our neighbors do nothing, the effort will be futile.\n  Third, reauthorizes and enhances the Federal authority for agencies \nto fight exotics. The nuisance species problem crosses many \njurisdictions. Therefore, the comprehensive strategy set forth in this \nbill includes the Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the \nCoast Guard, the Smithsonian, and other Federal efforts. As our Federal \nfoot soldiers in this war against the zebra mussel and other species, \nall of these departments and agencies need the authority, resources, \nand flexibility to win the battle.\n  Mr. President, every minute that we delay an effort to stop the zebra \nmussels, the mussels multiply exponentially and risk the physical and \neconomic health of Vermont. While my colleagues may not know first hand \nthe scourge of zebra mussels or other exotic species, let me assure \nthem that the ounce of prevention in my bill will save them pounds of \ncure. To turn our backs on this problem of national significance only \nguarantees that it gets much worse. Mr. President, I hope we can move \nthis bill quickly.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Daschle, \n        and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1661. A bill to specify that States may waive certain requirements \nrelating to commercial motor vehicle operators under chapter 313 of \ntitle 49, United States Code, with respect to the operators of certain \nfarm vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    CUSTOMER HARVESTERS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, earlier this year the U.S. Custom \nHarvesters held their annual meeting in Sioux Falls, SD. South Dakotans \nput out the welcome mat for custom harvesters throughout the country, \nand the annual meeting was a resounding success.\n\n  During that meeting it was brought to my attention that custom \nharvesters were not granted equal treatment as farmers and farm workers \nunder Federal laws requiring commercial driving licenses [CDL]. \nPresently, States can grant waivers to the Federal CDL requirement to \nfarmers and farm workers. Those same waiver requirements are not \nafforded to custom harvesters.\n  In many parts of the country, including South Dakota, custom \nharvesters are a crucial component in agricultural production. The bill \nI am introducing today simply grants States the right to waive CDL \nrequirements for custom harvesters similar to those waivers currently \nafforded farmers and farm-related businesses. Joining me in this effort \nare Senators Burns, Inhofe, Daschle, and Baucus.\n  Mr. President, customer harvesters normally drive less than 5,000 \nmiles per year. They drive mostly on roads leading to and from farms \nand to the local grain elevator. Little time is spent on highways. \nGenerally, custom harvesters drive less that 500 miles annually on \ninterstate highways. It is a simple matter of fairness that they be \ntreated equally.\n  My bill would provide relief to custom harvesters from onerous and \ncostly CDL requirements. Under the waivers, family members can take an \nactive role in custom harvesting and drivers with experience and trust \ncan be hired to drive custom harvesting vehicles.\n  Custom harvesting involves many small, family owned companies. Custom \noperators account for nearly 40 percent of the total wheat acreage \nharvested annually. Their equipment must be utilized properly, kept in \ntip-top working conditions and safe in order to provide quality \nservices. These harvesters go the extra mile to maintain equipment, \ntrain employees, and operate in the safest way possible.\n  In 1988, States were provided the authority to waive CDL requirements \nfor farmers. In 1991, the Senate passed a bill to provide the authority \nto individual States to provide the same exemption to custom \nharvesters. Unfortunately, that bill never passed and custom harvesters \nare still burdened with CDL requirements. My bill is similar to the \nmeasure passed in 1991. Given past Senate support for this measure, I \nam hopeful adoption of this bill will occur soon. I thank those \nSenators who have joined me in this effort and urge the Senate to adopt \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 1662. A bill to establish areas of wilderness and recreation in \nthe State of Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\nthe opal creek wilderness and opal creek scenic recreation area act of \n                                  1996\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the natural resources of my State are \nindisputably among the most significant and spectacular in the world. \nIt has been almost 30 years since the enactment of the Oregon \nwilderness bill--the massive, 100,000-acre Mt. Jefferson Wilderness in \ncentral Oregon. I sponsored that bill and two other comprehensive \npieces of legislation in 1978 and 1984, which increased Oregon's \nwilderness system fourfold, from 500,000 acres to 2.1 million acres.\n  Throughout my years in the Senate I have attempted to protect \nOregon's resources by following the philosophy of the one of our \nNation's first and foremost conservationists, the original U.S. Forest \nService Chief, Gifford Pinchot. Gifford Pinchot said:\n\n       The conservation of natural resources [in this country] is \n     the key to the future. It is the key to the safety and \n     prosperity of the American people. Conservation is the \n     greatest material question of all.\n\n  This principle of conservation has led me to sponsor numerous land \nprotection bills over the years.\n  Let me say, as I list this record of legislation, I want it clearly \nunderstood that, like anything else that happens in this Senate and in \nthe legislative body, it was a team effort. It was a group effort. We \nhad the advocates in the population and communities, we had the \norganizations sponsoring such issues in the public, and I had \ncolleagues, colleagues not only in the Senate but colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives, who were all part of this record that I am \nreciting today. In addition to that is the staff, the staff that serves \nthese committees with such dedication, such expertise. None of it could \nhave happened solely on the energy or effort of any one Member.\n  I have also sponsored legislation enacting the Columbia River Gorge \nNational Scenic Area, the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, the \nHells Canyon National Recreation Area, Yaquina Head and Cascade Head on \nthe Oregon coast, the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, the \nNewberry Crater National Monument, and the Oregon Wild and Scenic \nRivers Act, which includes protection of 42 Oregon rivers, more than \nany other State in the Union.\n  In fact, the next highest State is California with 11.\n  To put Oregon's 42 wild and scenic rivers into context, having just \nmade that statement about California, Alaska has displaced California. \nAlaska now has 25 rivers. Next comes Michigan, with 16. California now \nhas 13 and Arkansas 8. I am proud that Oregon has led the way in \nprotecting our wild and scenic rivers. Again, having stated the figures \nof those other States, Oregon is 42.\n  Each time I have labored to protect these special areas, I have been \nforcefully reminded that I represent a State that is often sharply \ndivided on natural resource issues. These divides generally reflect the \ndifference between the urban and the rural way of life. During the \ndecades I have devoted to public service, I have sought to bridge the \nchasm that has formed between the urban and rural citizens of my State \nand bring some order and balance to natural resource conflicts by \naddressing both sides of the debate.\n  Today, in a sense, I am coming full circle to where I started with \nthe 1968 Mt. Jefferson Wilderness Act. Today, I am introducing \nlegislation to, once again, increase Oregon's wilderness system and \nprotect one of Oregon's most important low-elevation old growth \nforests, Opal Creek. This legislation, called the Oregon Resources \nConservation Act, also includes solutions to two other natural resource \nissues in my State on which I have been working for many years: \nprotection of the Mt. Hood corridor; and promotion of consensus-based \nworking groups in the Klamath and Deschutes River Basins. I am also \nincluding a so-called placeholder title for the Coquille Forest \nproposal, which will require a significant amount of public input prior \nto the introduction of any legislation.\n  Title I of the Oregon Resources Conservation Act creates a 25,800-\nacre Opal Creek Wilderness and National Scenic-Recreation Area. Opal \nCreek is truly one of Oregon's ecological crown jewels. It is one of \nthe last remaining intact, low-elevation old-growth forest areas in \nwestern Oregon. Portions of Opal Creek are literally blanketed with \nmajestic old-growth forests and crystal clear, stair-stepping waters.\n\n  I have always felt this area should be protected in perpetuity from \ncommercial timber harvesting and mining. In fact, I included it in the \noriginal versions of both my 1984 Oregon Wilderness Act and my 1988 \nOregon Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Each time, however, the area was \nremoved from these bills at the request of the State's Governor.\n  In 1991, I sponsored additional Opal Creek protection legislation \nwhen I included a provision which was enacted as part of the fiscal \nyear 1992 Department of Defense appropriations bill to to facilitate \nthe issuance of a patent on the key access property to Opal Creek. This \nprovision was necessary to facilitate a large charitable donation of \nland and mineral interests by a mining company to the Nature \nConservancy for the protection of the area. Unfortunately, the Nature \nConservancy was forced to reject this donation due to its concerns \nabout potential liability for an existing contaminated abandoned mining \nsite in the Opal Creek area. Subsequently the Friends of Opal Creek, a \nlocal conservation group, stepped forward to accept this large \ncharitable donation.\n  In 1994, there was another Opal Creek protection bill before the \nCongress. The bill, sponsored by my good friend, then-Representative \nMike Kopetski of Oregon, passed the House of Representatives under his \nfine leadership and was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources in the final days of the 103d Congress.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I invited my former colleague, Congressman \nMike Kopetski, to be here today on this very historic occasion to share \nin the results of many of his long years of commitment and his \ndedicated effort.\n  The Senate was unable to take final action on this legislation in the \nfew remaining weeks prior to sine die. These difficulties were enhanced \nby the administration's initial opposition and ambivalence toward the \nproposal.\n  I called for and chaired a hearing before the the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources on October 5, 1994, which examined the \nconcerns with the bill and sought to build momentum for a working group \nprocess at the local level which would attempt to build consensus and \nbring divergent parties together on this controversial issue.\n  This hearing did, indeed, create the momentum necessary for the \nformation of an Opal Creek working group, and on September 1, 1995, the \nfirst meeting of the group was held in Salem, OR. The Willamette \nUniversity Dispute Resolution Center agreed to facilitate the meeting \nand attempt to build a consensus on the issue. The group, with the \nbenefit of the outstanding facilitation skills of Prof. Richard Birke, \nmet from September 1995 to March of this year and has developed a \nseveral-hundred page report summarizing its deliberations. I believe \nthe group has done an excellent job discussing difficult issues and \nworking together to find a solution. Mind you, this was a very broadly \nbased group representing industry, local officials, environmental \norganizations, user groups and so forth. While no clear-cut consensus \nemerged from the group, their report has given me a strong \nunderstanding of the existing natural values of the area, the issues \ninvolved in protection of the area and the positions of all groups \ninvolved in the debate. Indeed, this report has greatly assisted me in \ndeveloping the legislation I am introducing today.\n  As many of my colleagues know, we have a political environment in \nOregon and the Pacific Northwest that is as splintered as any I have \nseen in my political career. This environment is characterized by a \nlack of trust on all sides of the political spectrum and extreme \npolarization. The Opal Creek working group, therefore, is a great \nsuccess in bringing parties together in an attempt to heal old wounds \nand build new partnerships. The group also represents in my mind a \ngreat success in addressing one of my major concerns with the House's \nlegislation from 1994, which was the general lack of agreements and \nlimited dialog regarding protection of this forested area. I thank each \nand every member of the group of their dedication to this 6-month \nprocess and to resolving this difficult issue.\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\n  Again, I want to say, parenthetically, that one of the outstanding \nmembers of that group is former Congressman Mike Kopetski who, again, \nwas able to give leadership from some of his experience in giving his \nlife effort to the development of Opal Creek.\n  The legislation I am introducing today also addresses another major \nconcern I had with the 1994 Opal Creek bill, its lack of ecosystem \nwatershed management principles. The 1994 bill would have protected \napproximately 22,000 acres in the Opal Creek area. My bill protects \n25,800 acres, including the creation of approximately 12,800 acres of \nnew wilderness. Each and every one of the sub watersheds--we took a \nmap, and we looked at that map as an ecosystem. We looked at that map \nas a great basin, a watershed. So we took from that map, with concern \nfor protection of the entire ecosystem. Each and every one of those sub \nwatersheds in the Little North Fork Santiam River drainage are \naddressed in some way in my legislation, either through a wilderness or \na national scenic recreation area designation.\n  By doing this, we have attempted to protect the outstanding resource \nvalues in each of these sub drainages, while at the same time \naddressing the area comprehensively as an intact ecosystem.\n  In addition to addressing the protection of the entire watershed, the \nOpal Creek title of this bill maintains recreation at existing levels \nand allows for growth in uses where appropriate. The bill also calls \nfor historical, cultural and ecological interpretation in the newly-\ncreated area to be conducted in a balanced and factually accurate \nmanner. Motorized recreation will be prohibited except on the existing \nroad system and nonmotorized use will be permitted throughout the area, \nexcept, of course, in the wilderness. The existing road system will be \nanalyzed and evaluated through a management planning process, which \nwill decide which roads to close and which to leave open. No new water \nimpoundments will be allowed in this area. No new mining claims will be \nallowed to be filed under the 1872 mining law, and no existing claims \nwill be allowed to be patented. In addition, the bill calls for the \ncreation of an advisory council composed of members of the local \ncommunity, industry, environmental groups, locally elected officials, \nthe Forest Service and an appointee by the Governor. Finally, the bill \nwill not allow commercial timber harvesting of any kind in the Opal \nCreek area except to prevent the spread of a forest fire or to to \nprotect public health and safety. It is important to note that the \nlands covered by my legislation are not included--not included--in the \ntimber base and are not open to commercial harvest today.\n  The final element of the Opal Creek package, Mr. President, was an \nimportant part of the working group's discussions. I am referring to an \neconomic development package for the Santiam Canyon, which includes the \ncommunities immediately adjacent to the Opal Creek area. This package \nis based, primarily, on a set of infrastructure improvements developed \nby these communities in conjunction with the State Economic Development \nOffice, which are designed to improve the water quality and delivery \nsystems of the communities in the area.\n  I have made the first downpayment on this economic commitment package \nby including a $300,000 appropriation in the fiscal year 1996 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act to help begin the clean up of the contaminated \nAmalgamated Mill site at Jawbone Flats in Opal Creek.\n  Throughout the coming fiscal year 1997 appropriations cycle, I will \nwork closely with Oregon's Gov. John Kitzhaber, and my colleague on the \nHouse Appropriations Committee from Oregon, Jim Bunn, to further refine \nthis package and provide additional funding, as needed, for the \nAmalgamated Mill cleanup and for the critical community infrastructure \nprojects designed to allow these former timber communities to diversify \ntheir economic bases and improve their water systems.\n  In short, the Opal Creek title of this bill attempts to address every \nissue raised both in the 1994 hearings on Opal Creek and in the working \ngroup process conducted out in Oregon. This is an issue I have worked \non for almost 20 years. I am extremely pleased that, with this \nlegislation and accompanying infrastructure development package, we \nwill finally be able to address the protection of Opal Creek and the \nadjacent portions of the Little North Fork Santiam Watershed, as well \nas improvements to the water quality and delivery systems of nearby, \ntimber-dependent communities.\n  Mr. President, the Oregon Resources Conservation Act also contains \ntwo other titles. The first is a relatively noncontroversial provision \nwhich promulgates a land exchange in the Mt. Hood Corridor between the \nBureau of Land Management and the Longview Fibre timber company in the \nState of Washington. Both parties are willing participants in this \nprocess, which seeks to protect the viewshed along the Highway 26 \ncorridor on the way to Mt. Hood, the highest mountain peak in my State.\n  Longview Fibre owns approximately 3,500 acres of timber land in the \nscenic Mt. Hood corridor, which are interspersed with BLM lands in a \ncheckerboard fashion. Longview would like to harvest these lands within \nthe next 5 years, but is sensitive about the public perception \nregarding these clearcuts along such a heavily traveled route. I agree \nwith Longview Fibre and feel harvesting these trees along Highway 26 \nwould be a disaster both for the ecological and visual characteristics \nof the resource. Longview, to their credit, has been extremely \ninterested in working with local planning and environmental groups to \nidentify BLM parcels elsewhere in western Oregon that could be traded \nfor the Longview Fibre lands in the corridor.\n\n  This proposal is a unique opportunity to forge ahead with a plan that \nhas been built at the local level over the past 5 years and which has \nvirtually unanimous support, including the local county government, \nlocal businesses, the timber industry, and local environmental groups.\n  The third, and final, title of the Oregon Resource Conservation Act \nincludes the establishment of a 5-year pilot project for two, \nconsensus-based natural resource planning bodies now working in \nOregon's Klamath and Deschutes Basins. Both of these bodies are already \nin place and have been working to provide the Federal agencies with \nrecommendations about how best to prioritize spending for ecological \nrestoration, economic health, and reducing drought impacts.\n  I called for the creation of the Upper Klamath Basin working group in \n1995. This group is citizen-led and includes environmentalists, \nirrigators, local business leaders, locally elected officials, \neducators, the Klamath Tribes, and Federal land management agencies in \nan advisory capacity. This group was charged with developing both \nshort- and long-term recommendations for restoring ecological health in \nthe Klamath Basin. They were successful in developing short-term \nfunding recommendations ranging from riparian and wetland restoration, \nto fish passage and the coordination of geological information systems \nin the basin. I followed through on these recommendations and was able \nto obtain either funding or direction to the pertinent agencies in the \nfiscal year 1996 appropriations process.\n  The group has also developed a long-term recommendation which \nincludes a formal registration of the group as a State-sanctioned \nfoundation and congressional legislation enabling them to help land \nmanagement agencies set priorities for how money is spent in the basin \non various ecological restoration and economic stabilization projects.\n  The legislation I am introducing today addresses their long-term \nrecommendation by creating a 5-year pilot project to allow the Upper \nKlamath Basin Working Group-Foundation, in conjunction with the Federal \nland management agencies in the basin, to develop funding priorities \nfor ecological restoration in the basin. It will provide $1 million per \nyear to be spent consistent with these priorities. This money will be \nadministered by the agencies and matched by an equal amount of non-\nFederal dollars.\n\n  The Deschutes Basin in central Oregon would also be allowed to \ndevelop a similar regime using, as its base, a group formed by the Warm \nSprings Tribes, the Environmental Defense Fund, local irrigators, and \nlocally elected officials. This group has been meeting and \ncollaborating on projects in the basin for several years.\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\n  Recently, both of these working groups have been able to make \nsignificant progress in building coalitions and consensus on natural \nresource management challenges that, not too long ago, many felt were \ninsurmountable. By given them more authority to temporarily assist \nFederal agencies with setting policy priorities using a finite amount \nof money, I hope we can begin to enter a new era of more local control \nand greater public input regarding resource management decisions. I \nalso hope these groups, and others that may follow, will continue to \nuse the consensus-based management approach to return resource \nmanagement decisions to a collaborative, inclusive process rather than \ndivisive, litigious morass in which we find ourselves today.\n  Mr. President, today I had also planned on introducing a bill to \ncreate a 59,000-acre Coquille Forest as part of the federally-\nrecognized Coquille Tribes' economic self-sufficiency plan. However, \nbecause of a number of unresolved issues, including the apparent lack \nof agreement, understanding or consensus at the local level, I am \nwithholding my introduction of this bill until after I have had an \nopportunity to gather more public input through the congressional \nhearing process. And also there is a local election that is being held \nin May concerning this issue.\n  I am extremely pleased with this bill. It protects two of Oregon's \nmost important natural resource areas, Opal Creek and the Mt. Hood \nCorridor, and it promotes consensus-based, watershed planning at the \nlocal level in the Klamath and Deschutes Basins. I have worked many \nyears to protect Oregon's magnificent natural resources. I am pleased \nthat in this, my last year in the Senate, I will be able to continue \nthis legacy of protecting Oregon's beauty for the enjoyment and use of \nfuture generations.\n  I look forward to speedy hearings on the Oregon Resources \nConservation Act, of which I have been promised by the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Murkowski of Alaska. We will have that hearing later \nin the month of April.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record. This bill is ready to be sent to the House.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1662\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nrevenue collection and to provide that a taxpayer conscientiously \nopposed to participation in war may elect to have such taxpayer's \nincome, estate, or gift tax payments spent for nomilitary purposes, to \ncreate the U.S. Peace Tax Fund to receive such tax payments, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE U.S. PEACE TAX FUND ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, As tax day approaches, I once again \ncome before the Senate to introduce the United States Peace Tax Fund. I \nam joined in this effort by the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who \nhas been a longtime original cosponsor of this bill.\n  I first introduced the Peace Tax Fund during the 95th Congress, \nnearly 20 years ago. I have reintroduced the Peace Tax Fund in every \nCongress since then because I believe it is important legislation.\n  Since 1945 eligible conscientious objectors have been excused from \ncombat. Although our Nation long has recognized moral and religious \nopposition to war, it has failed to address the depth and scope of such \nobjections. Our tax laws do not recognize that conscience not only \nprohibits participation on the battlefield, but also in the preparation \nfor war through payments to the military. CO's may withhold their \nbodies but not their money.\n  The Peace Tax Fund Act, if enacted, would allow complete \nparticipation in our Federal Government by all citizens without many \nbeing forced to compromise deeply held beliefs of any citizen.\n  Over the years I have received many letters from constituents \ndescribing their disapproval of military taxes and their desire to have \nthe Federal Government respect such objections. Some citizens write of \ntheir decision to set aside their beliefs and pay their taxes in full, \ndespite the anguish such payment causes. Others, perhaps following \nAlbert Einstein's advice, ``Never do anything against conscience even \nif the State demands it,'' refuse to pay a portion of their taxes. Some \nAmericans purposefully keep their income below the taxable level, so \nthat they can avoid the decision altogether.\n  It is important to point out what the Peace Tax Fund legislation is \nnot. The Peace tax Fund is not a method by which a citizen may lodge \nprotest over wasteful defense programs. Nor is it a tool to circumvent \nforeign policy initiatives. Tax liabilities cannot be reduced through \nparticipation in the Peace Tax Fund. The Peace Tax Fund Act was \ndeveloped not for those individuals seeking to alter national policy, \nbut rather to allow certain individuals to fully uphold Federal law \nwithout violating their consciences.\n  The Peace Tax Fund would allow these sincere conscientious objectors \nthe opportunity to pay their Federal taxes in full. Those who qualify \nmay choose to have that portion of their taxes which would go to \nmilitary activities instead be diverted to a special trust fund--the \nPeace Tax Fund--and then disbursed to two Federal programs: Head Start \nand WIC. The bill would not reduce the amount of funding for military \nactivities. Nor would it result in any significant loss of revenue, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  As defined by the Peace Tax Fund Act, an eligible conscientious \nobjector is anyone who has obtained this status under the Military \nSelective Service Act. Others may submit a questionnaire to the \nSecretary of the Treasury certifying his or her beliefs and how those \nbeliefs affect that individual's life.\n  In the 20-plus years that this issue has been debated, only two \nhearings have been held. The last hearing was held by the House Ways \nand Means Committee in 1992. The Senate has never held hearings on the \nPeace Tax Fund. It is my hope that before I leave the Senate the \nFinance Committee will hold a hearing on this issue.\n  The Peace Tax Fund has had the support of many committed religious \nand peace organizations throughout the years. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a partial listing of the organizations endorsing the Peace Tax \nFund be included in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation so \nimportant to the protection of personal and religious beliefs of many \ncitizens who find themselves each tax season torn between the law and \nconscience.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Partial Listing of Organizations Endorsing the Peace Tax Fund\n\n       1. American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n       2. American Friends Service Committee.\n       3. Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America.\n       4. Buddhist Peace Fellowship.\n       5.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill require the Treasury Secretary to prepare a report for Congress on \nrecommendations to reduce the national debt. Further, Mr. President, I \nam submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that if we enact a \nbalanced budget plan this year, such legislation should also contain a \nstrategy for reducing the national debt.\n  Yesterday, the Congress raised the national debt to $5.5 trillion, a \nfigure beyond the comprehension of most people. By most estimates, we \nwill not even begin to balance a budget until the year 2002, at which \npoint the national debt will, of course, be even larger--$6.5 trillion.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about this debt burden that we have \nplaced on our children, grandchildren, and children yet born. We \ncontinue to spend money we do not have on day-to-\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nday needs--not investments--just simply for day-to-day needs--we spend \nmoney we do not have. However, if we continue this irresponsible \npattern, we will bring great harm to future generations. We talk about \ndoing something for our children, and, yet, we could do them few \ngreater services than to leave them a debt-free country.\n\n  It took this country nearly 200 years to accumulate a debt of $1 \ntrillion. In the last 16 years, however, the debt has increased \nfivefold. This Republican Congress has attempted to move the budget \ntoward balance. This Congress has tried to stop the flow of red ink. \nThe President has, regrettably, vetoed our Balanced Budget Act.\n  Indeed, most of our time has been spent just trying to stop deficit \nspending, and we have worked to move toward a balanced budget in the \nyear 2002. We still have not succeeded in doing this.\n  Beyond the plan to put this country on the track toward a balanced \nbudget, however, we have no plan--no plan whatsoever--and no thought \nhas been given to how we will reduce the national debt. We merely have \nbeen trying to slow the train. Even if we balance the budget 7 years \nfrom now, Mr. President, we have no plans to reduce the $6.5 trillion \ndebt that we will have accumulated.\n  This $6.5 trillion debt represents a tremendous amount of money--an \nincomprehensible amount of money to practically all of us--but what \ndoes it mean in real terms to the average working person? Six-point-\nfive trillion dollars would build 50 million houses and finance 187 \nmillion college educations. It would buy 310 million tractors. It would \nbuy 433 million automobiles.\n  Permit me to put that in perspective. Fifty million new homes--built \nat the average price of $130,000 each--would mean a new house for every \nmarried couple in America. If housing is an important goal, we could \nhave bought everyone a new house. Six-point-five trillion dollars would \npay the full 4-year college tuition of every American over the age of \n18. If education is an important goal, we could have sent every \nAmerican adult to college.\n  Six-point-five trillion dollars would buy 310 million farm tractors. \nIt would buy 433 million automobiles. We started producing automobiles \nin this country around 1900 or immediately thereafter. Since then, we \nhave not come close to producing 433 million cars. Mr. President, our \ndebt would buy every automobile ever produced in this country, and it \nprobably would still carry us through another couple years.\n  These illustrations underscore the massive spending spree that we \nhave been on for the last 20 years. Mr. President, it is important to \nremember that 80 percent of this debt has been accumulated since 1980, \nso a great part of these examples could have been accomplished in just \nthe last 20 years.\n  Perhaps the most startling fact is how interest costs are consuming \nus. Over 40 percent of the personal income taxes paid this year--40 \npercent of the personal income taxes collected in this country this \nyear--will be used to pay the interest on the debt.\n  In terms of spending per person, the numbers are astonishing, and \nthey are shocking. Interest on the national debt is the third most \nexpensive budgetary category per person behind Social Security and \ndefense. We spend more on interest than on Medicare, other health \nexpenditures, education, housing, environment, and agriculture--all \nthese eclipsed by just interest.\n  These are things that are important to the American people, and, yet, \nthere is less to spend because we insist on spending more than we have. \nAnd we are adding to this debt every day. Every day we add to this debt \nsomewhere close to $350 million.\n  Mr. President, the average 21-year-old will face a lifetime tax \nburden of $115,000 just to pay the interest on the national debt. As \ngraduation season approaches, every college graduate looks forward to \nreceiving a diploma, but that diploma will be accompanied by a bill \nfrom the U.S. Government for $115,000 as his or her part of the \ninterest on the debt. So inside each diploma should be a bill from the \nFederal Government for $115,000.\n\n  If we had been responsible here in Washington and were really \nconcerned about the future of the young people of this country--rather \nthan just making platitudes about being nice to them--their future \nwould look different. The $115,000 that the IRS will demand from our \nchildren could have been better spent. Four years of college, a new \ncar, the down payment on a house, and, Mr. President, each would still \nhave $60,000 left over. But, no, they are going to receive a $115,000 \ninterest bill on the day we hand them a diploma.\n  Further, their future would be brighter because we would have reduced \ninterest rates significantly, without the Government taking $350 \nmillion a day from the lending pool in this world. Interest rates would \nbe down, and down considerably.\n  President Clinton likes to make much of the fact that he is young, \nthat he appeals to young voters, and that his wife is active in the \nChildren's Defense Fund. But how concerned is he really about America's \nyoung people? How concerned, really, is he? When he leaves office in \n1997, America will be another $1 trillion deeper in debt than we were \nwhen he came. It took him 3 years into his Presidency to submit a \nbalanced budget, and it was really not a balanced budget. It did not \nbalance the budget, in fact, and it was just a pretense of a balanced \nbudget. It took him 3 years of ``amateur night'' before he came up with \na proposal that he could even pretend was a balanced budget, and, \nreally, he did it after he was driven to do it by a Republican \nCongress.\n  If they are interested in doing something for the children, it is my \nbelief that the best Children's Defense Fund is a national debt with a \nzero balance.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that the two bills I am \nintroducing are a small step in a long journey to reduce our debt. We \nmust develop a plan to bring down the debt. One idea is to establish a \nnational debt reduction fund much like the Presidential campaign fund. \nPerhaps there are other ways we can use incentives to reduce the debt.\n  It is important to consider methods to reduce the debt, and this is a \ncritical issue, but, Mr. President, this Congress must muster the \nfortitude to stop spending. And, so far, we have not managed to do \nthat.\n  If we do not begin now, if we do not start now, when will we? If we \ndo not do it in this Congress, if the people now here do not do it, who \nwill do it?\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. I thank you.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized to speak as if in morning business for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I did not come to speak on this particular subject \nthat was just addressed by Senator Faircloth, but I wanted to set some \nfacts straight in the interest of fairness.\n  The facts are that when President Reagan took office, the national \ndebt was at $1 trillion--the result of a buildup through all of the \nPresidents since George Washington through Jimmy Carter. During the \nReagan-Bush years, we added $3.9 trillion. Currently, the national debt \nis about $5 trillion.\n  In the summer of 1993, President Clinton announced the reconciliation \nbill that he put forward with his economic policies. We passed the bill \nin the U.S. Senate without a single Republican vote--not one. It \nresulted in the first 3 years of budget deficit reduction since Harry \nTruman was in office. We went from a budget deficit of $292 billion in \nthe year we passed the reconciliation bill in 1993, down to \napproximately $240 billion in 1994 and $163 billion in 1995. This year \nthe budget deficit is estimated to be $142 billion. There are several \nestimates on that amount, including CBO. For the first time since Harry \nTruman, we have had a steady reduction of the Federal deficit over a 3-\nyear period. We worked for a balanced budget, and we are on the road to \nattaining it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3229-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3230-S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 238--RELATIVE TO BUDGET OR TAX LEGISLATION AND \n           EXPANDED ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Roth, Mr. Lott, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Nickles, \nMrs. Hutchison, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Bennett, and \nMr. Santorum) submitted a resolution which was referred to the \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\non the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, \npursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one \ncommittee reports, the other committee have 30 days to report or be \ndischarged:\n\n                              S. Res. 238\n\n       Whereas the Congress recognizes that an increased saving \n     rate would be beneficial for the American economy, providing \n     much needed capital for investment which leads to economic \n     growth and increases in jobs and wages;\n       Whereas the personal saving rate in America averaged \n     between 6 percent and 8 percent from 1950 through 1980, but \n     dropped below 5 percent in the late 1980's, where it remains \n     today;\n       Whereas the United States now has the lowest saving rate of \n     all other industrialized nations in the world and this \n     results in deficit financing and foreign borrowing to finance \n     our consumption and investment;\n       Whereas when the deductibility of contributions to \n     individual retirement accounts (``IRAs'') was significantly \n     curbed in 1986, deductible contributions to IRAs dropped from \n     almost $40,000,000,000 in 1985 to a low of about \n     $7,000,000,000 in 1993;\n       Whereas millions of people are currently precluded from \n     making fully deductible IRA contributions, and they are \n     relying on Congress to increase the current income limit on \n     individuals eligible to contribute to IRAs and to create a \n     new nondeductible IRA so all Americans can utilize IRAs to \n     save for their futures;\n       Whereas the time has come to allow spouses working at home \n     to have an equal opportunity to invest in an IRA since out of \n     the 53,000,000 households with married couples, at least 35 \n     percent have only one wage earner in the household, thereby \n     illustrating the need for IRAs for spouses working at home;\n       Whereas because of the current restrictions on IRAs, only \n     around 8 percent of American workers invest in them;\n       Whereas unless remedial action is quickly taken to increase \n     the saving rate, millions of American will be lacking in \n     sufficient resources to fund their retirement needs;\n       Whereas 50 years ago 42 workers contributed Social Security \n     taxes for every beneficiary, today there are fewer than 4 \n     workers per beneficiary, and by 2025 the ratio will have \n     dropped to only 2.2 workers per beneficiary;\n       Whereas if an expanded individual retirement package is \n     included in any budget agreement or appropriate to measure, \n     it will give millions of American the opportunity to use IRA \n     funds to provide for retirement, buy a first home, pay for \n     children's college education, or protect themselves in the \n     event of extended unemployment--all without incurring any \n     penalty; and\n       Whereas if an expanded individual retirement accounted \n     package is included in any budget agreement or appropriate \n     tax measure, millions of Americans can immediately begin \n     using IRAs to save for their futures, reducing dependence on \n     government, and millions of unemployed or underemployed \n     Americans can pursue the American Dream: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that any \n     budget agreement or appropriate tax measure coming before \n     Congress this year shall include expanded access to \n     individual retirement accounts so that the saving crisis in \n     America can be reverse, new jobs can be created, economic \n     growth can be increased, and the American Dream can be \n     restored.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in 1981 President Reagan proposed that \nindividual retirement accounts be expanded to allow all workers to \nsupplement their employer pensions with individual, tax-deferred \nsavings. You see, Mr. President, Ronald Reagan understood the \nimportance of increased national savings; he correctly perceived that \nthe expanded use of IRA's would result in additional savings by \nfamilies and individual citizens.\n  The year President Reagan proposed the IRA expansion, citizens across \nAmerica invested $4.8 billion in tax-deferred IRA accounts. Three years \nlater, in 1984, the amount of contributions to IRA's had increased to \nmore than $35 billion.\n  And this past year, Mr. President, IRA contributions dwindled to \nabout $7 billion--due in large part to the ramifications of the Tax \nReform Act of 1986, which limited tax-deferred IRA contributions only \nto workers having no employer-sponsored retirement plans in which to \ninvest and save--and to those citizens meeting an income test. Not \nsurprisingly, these unwise restrictions diminished IRAs as an effective \nway to save for broad segments of society.\n  It's high time that the Federal Government's tax policy again \nencourage the American people to save through tax-deferred IRA's. So, \nMr. President, I'm introducing a resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate that, if a budget agreement is reached this year, it should \ninclude expanded access to IRAs.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, \nalong with the Senator from Louisiana. Mr. Breaux, have introduced an \neffective bill (S.12) to encourage savings and investment through IRAs. \nThis legislation gradually restores the universal availability of the \ntax-deductible IRA. It also establishes the back-end IRA, a new \ninvestment instrument in which contributions are not tax deductible, \nbut earnings are not taxed at withdrawal.\n  The Congress should make certain that all Americans, including those \nwho choose to work at home, have the opportunity to participate fully \nin IRA savings. Moreover, the tax system should allow investors to \nwithdraw savings for a limited number of contingencies For example, \nfamilies should be allowed to make penalty-free withdrawals for certain \neducation expenses, first-time home purchases, catastrophic illness and \nlong-term unemployment. These commonsense proposals must be included in \nany budget agreement struck this year, or any appropriate tax measure \nconsidered by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the saving rate in America has declined significantly \nin the past two decades. In the 1970's, Americans saved 8 percent of \naverage disposable income. By 1994, that figure had dropped to 4 \npercent. The saving rate in Japan, for example, is three times that in \nAmerica; Canadians save twice as much as Americans. According to the \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, reversing the low \nsaving rate is one of the most important long-term economic challenges \nin America.\n  If the availability of IRAs is expanded, savings will increase, and \nthat will benefit the entire economy. A boost in savings will fuel \nadded investment spending, which in turn drives the engine of economic \ngrowth and job creation. Likewise, it will reduce our reliance on \nforeign investment.\n  The importance of individual savings has never been greater, Mr. \nPresident, as the current demographic situation makes clear. The \npopulation as a whole is aging and the ratio of retirees to workers is \nincreasing in the 1940's, for example, approximately 40 workers \ncontributed to Social Security for every beneficiary of Social \nSecurity. Today, there are fewer than four workers per beneficiary, and \nby 2025 the ration will have dropped to only 2.2 American workers per \nretiree. This is certain to place enormous stress on the public pension \nsystem in America.\n  Younger workers, especially, should be encouraged to save for their \nretirement needs. Personal responsibility and personal savings are the \nwave of the future, Mr. President. The Senate should, therefore, \ninclude expanded savings opportunities in any future budget agreement, \nor in any appropriate tax measure to come before the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of \nSenator Helms' sense of the Senate resolution that an expanded IRA \nshould be included in any budget agreement we are able to reach.\n  I am still hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement this \nyear. Some say I am the eternal optimist. But, I truly believe it is in \nthe best interest of our country to enact the changes necessary to put \nus on the path to a balanced budget. And, I hope that, in the end, this \nwill prevail.\n  I also believe that tax relief should be included in any final \nagreement. It is critical that we provide incentives for economic \ngrowth and relief to families.\n  The tax cuts in the 1980's led to significant increases in real \nsavings and real net worth of U.S. households; they also attracted huge \ninfluxes of foreign capital. All of this helped finance vigorous \neconomic growth.\n  To the contrary, the increase in marginal taxes in 1990 and 1993 have \nsuppressed private-sector savings and led to stagnation in investment \nin the United States by foreign investors. To increase the U.S. \neconomy's capacity to expand, we must reverse the tax rate increases of \nthe past 4 years.\n  There are two aspects to our national savings problem:\n  First, public dissaving in the form of large Federal deficits, and\n  Second, a decline in private savings, especially for retirement.\n  We addressed both of these in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which \nthe President vetoed last December.\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\n  Our national savings rate is alarmingly low: It has fallen 50 percent \nsince 1970. Americans are saving less today than at almost any time \nsince World War II.\n  From 1993 to 2020, the percentage of Americans over 65 years old will \nincrease by 64 percent. The Baby Boom generation is aging, and people \nare spending more years in retirement than ever before. Yet, studies \nshow that Baby Boomers are only saving one-third of what they need for \nan adequate retirement.\n  The ratio of those paying into Social Security versus those drawing \nit is shrinking. People must realize this trend and acknowledge that \ntheir Social Security benefits should only be the foundation for their \nretirement: They must also take personal responsibility.\n  The personal savings rate has plummeted from 8 percent of disposable \nincome in 1970 to only 4 percent in 1994. This represents a loss of \nroughly $200 billion in capital that could have been put to work in our \neconomy.\n  Our savings rate is lower than any industrialized country. For \nexample, Japan's savings rate was 14.8 percent in 1994, compared to \nours of just over 4 percent.\n  Low rates of savings and investment have limited productivity growth \nand employment opportunities for more than two decades. This has held \nback investments and kept the United States at sub-par growth levels.\n  We must address this long-term problem, realizing the importance of \nsavings to the economy and the well-being of current and future \ngenerations.\n  If we do not take steps now to increase private savings, our deficits \nwill preempt all projected private savings early in the next century.\n  Expanded IRA's will provide the incentive people need to save.\n  I have always been an advocate of IRA's. Contributions to IRA's grew \nfrom $5 billion in 1981 to about $38 billion in 1986, accounting for 30 \npercent of the total saving by individuals that year. IRA's were \nworking as they were supposed to.\n  I thought it was wrong in 1986 to limit the deductibility of \ncontributions. As a result, by 1990 annual contributions to IRA's fell \nto less than $10 billion, and participation fell from more than 15 \npercent of income tax filers in 1986 to only 4 percent in 1990.\n  We have made several efforts since then to restore the deduction, but \nto date have not been able to accomplish this. We were close this year. \nThe Balanced Budget Act would have allowed penalty-free withdrawals \nfrom IRA's for first-time home purchases, medical expenses, education \nexpenses and unemployment. Individuals would have been allowed to \nwithdraw for themselves and members of their families.\n  In addition, the bill would have allowed for a super IRA and spousal \nIRA's. It blows my mind that women who work in the home are not allowed \nto contribute but $250 to an IRA; this is just basically unfair.\n  I believe expanded IRA's will serve as an incentive to Americans to \nsave for their own retirement. Studies show that approximately one-\nthird of Americans have put away almost nothing for their retirement. \nWhile saving for retirement is important for social reasons, there is \nan added benefit: Increased IRA savings will allow capital investment \nwhich will, in turn, spur economic growth.\n  So, in conclusion, I would urge my colleagues to support this sense \nof the Senate resolution. And, I would urge them to continue to support \nlegislation to make investment in IRA's possible for all Americans.\n  Let's give people the opportunity to take control of their own lives \nand retirements and restore the American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3230-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 239--RELATIVE TO THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted a resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I wanted to take just a minute to \ncomment on the amendment offered by Senators Kerry and Kennedy to raise \nthe minimum wage from $4.35 an hour to $5.15 an hour over the next 2 \nyears and why I oppose closing debate on this amendment at this time.\n  In my mind, few issues better define the differences between \nRepublicans and Democrats than efforts to raise this starting wage. On \nthe one hand, members of the Democratic Party seek to increase living \nstandards through a Government mandate. On the other, Republicans are \nseeking to increase family incomes by cutting Federal taxes, reducing \nregulatory burdens, and increasing job opportunities. Democrats believe \nin Government while Republicans place their faith in families and \nindividuals.\n  The case for the minimum wage has been refuted time and again. Far \nfrom raising living standards, studies show the minimum wage actually \nhurts the very workers its supposed to help. Harvard economist Robert \nBarro argues that ``the minimum wage misses the mark because it worsens \nthe status of most disadvantaged youths.''\n  Economist David Neumark of my alma mater, Michigan State University, \nand William Wascher of the Federal Reserve have concluded that raising \nthe minimum wage to $5.15 an hour would result in over 500,000 lost job \nopportunities for teenagers and young adults. Fully 77 percent of the \nmembers of the American Economic Association believe an increase in the \nminimum wage eliminates entry-level jobs.\n   Mr. President, under President Clinton's tenure, American families \nhave seen their incomes stagnate while their tax burden have gone up. \nThis Clinton crunch is forcing millions of families to get by with \nless. That's why the Republican Congress offered hard-working American \nfamilies tax cuts like the $500 per child family tax credit, marriage \npenalty relief, and expanded individual retirement accounts. We wanted \nto let families keep more of what they earn, so they could finance \ntheir own priorities, not the Government's. These efforts were cut \nshort when President Clinton vetoed the bill.\n  Now, the President and his party are pressing forward to mandate \nhigher standards of living through Government action. This effort is \nmisdirected and destructive. Furthermore, its timing is suspect. I am \ntroubled that the same week this issue is raised on the Senate floor, \nthe AFL-CIO has pledged to raise and spend $35 million through November \nto defeat Republican candidates.\n  If this issue is so pressing, why did President Clinton and \ncongressional Democrats fail to bring it up in 1993 and 1994, when they \ncontrolled both the White House and the Congress? They joined hands to \nraise taxes on American families in 1993, but at no time during the \nlast Congress did they ever consider raising the minimum wage. Now, \nwith a Republican majority in Congress and the labor unions pledging \nthem record financial support, raising the minimum wage becomes a \npriority.\n   Mr. President, I am unwilling to turn my back on low-skilled workers \nor to sacrifice their interests for an ideological and political \nagenda. Nor am I willing to impose another unfunded mandate on small \nbusiness men and women across the country. For that reason, I oppose \nclosing debate on this amendment at this time, and I call on my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to assist all working families \nby reducing the real barriers to higher wages and living standards--\nexcessive taxes and regulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3233-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3233-S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GREEK INDEPENDENCE\n\n-Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the Greek \npeople, who on March 25 commemorated the l75th Anniversary of the \nbeginning of their\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nstruggle for independence from nearly four centuries of Ottoman Turkish \nrule. Against great odds, Greek patriots reestablished freedom and \nself-government in the country that gave birth to democracy.\n  This decade-long struggle attracted the attention of freedom-loving \npeoples throughout the world but enjoyed particularly strong support \nfrom the young American Republic. Americans held rallies in support of \nthe Greek cause and sent both supplies and volunteers to aid the \nindependence effort.\n  From that time, the American and Greek peoples forged an alliance for \ndemocracy which has stood the test of time and political change. In \nboth World Wars and through the cold war period, America and Greece \nremained steadfast in their commitment to freedom and together fought \nsuccessfully against the forces of modern tyranny and totalitarianism. \nIn all of these struggles, the Greek people fought valiantly and at \ngreat sacrifice to their land and lives. It can be rightly said that no \nland so small gave so much to the modern cause of freedom.\n  As the challenges and opportunities of the post-cold-war world begin \nto emerge, the resourceful people of Greece are poised to join with \nAmerica and other democracies in encouraging new hopes for freedom and \ndemocracy in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Greece, as one \nof the oldest continuing democracies of the modern period, has the \nexperience in self-government to be of enormous assistance to nations \nstruggling to develop open societies.\n  Greece is also the only country in the Balkans and Eastern \nMediterranean region with membership in the European Union. This fact \nequips Greece to play a special role in the economic and political \nreconstruction of those regions. From the dawn of history, Greek \ntravelers and traders have lived and worked in these areas developing \nrelationships that can promote peace and prosperity in this new era.\n  Mr. President, the significance of the longstanding and close \npartnership between the United States and Greece is being reinforced by \nthe exchange of official visits and by representatives of our two \ncountries. As I speak, Hillary Clinton, our First Lady, is in Greece \nparticipating in the lighting of the Olympic Torch, which will \neventually make its way to Atlanta, GA, for the centennial of the \nmodern Olympics. Mrs. Clinton's presence at this important event \nreflects America's respect for and recognition of Greece's historic \nrole in establishing these games and promoting friendly competition and \ncooperation among nations.\n  Within days, the Honorable Costas Simitis, newly installed Prime \nMinister of Greece, will visit Washington for a series of meetings with \nPresident Clinton and other administration officials. Prime Minister \nSimitis represents a new generation of Greek political leadership which \npromises to build on the strength of the existing United States-Greek \nrelationship while seeking new areas of cooperation. In early May, \nGreek President Costas Stephanopoulos will also visit Washington for an \nofficial state visit. This again will offer an opportunity for renewing \nand reinforcing the ties between the citizens of these two democratic \ncountries. We look forward to these visits and express warm \nappreciation to President Clinton for extending these invitations.\n  These are occasions also for the leaders of both America and Greece \nto recognize the impressive contributions that Greek-Americans have \nmade to the strength and progress of democracy in both nations. The \nties between our two countries have been tangibly strengthened by the \nconstructive involvement of Greek-Americans in virtually every sphere \nof American life.\n  As we celebrate the bravery of the heroes and heroines of March 25, \nl82l, we recall with pride their unshakeable devotion to freedom. It is \na commitment they have honored with their blood and tears over two \ncenturies and an undertaking which has always found them in alliance \nwith the American people and all those who value democracy and the rule \nof law. As we enter this new post-war period, I am confident that \nAmerica and Greece will work together in the great effort to build and \nexpand democracy. That will be the highest tribute to the spirit of \nGreek Independence first proclaimed on March 25, 1821.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3233-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BREAST CANCER\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise before you today to plea for \nthe support of the world's wives, daughters, mother, and loved ones who \nprevail under a merciless dark shadow we've come to know as breast \ncancer. Over the past two decades, the risk of acquiring breast cancer \nhas nearly tripled; from 1 in 20, to 1 in 8. Breast cancer alone is \npredicted to murder over 184,300 American women this year. To date, \nresearchers have not been able to locate its cause or find a technique \nto eradicate it.\n  Paramount in our struggle to save our loved ones is the frequent \ninspection to detect possible irregularities. Caught early, measures \ncan be undertaken to lower the risk of a further contamination of the \nbody. However, the postponing of medical attention could result in the \ncancer expanding into the bloodstream, carrying tumor cells to the \nliver, lungs, and bones. Once diagnosed, the style of treatment is \ndecided between the patient and the physician after considering the \nstage and type of cancer in question. Most often, a modified \nmastectomy--the removal of only the breast tissue--or a lumpectomy--the \nlocal removal of the tumor--followed by radiotherapy is the standard \nmethod. Unfortunately, the pain and suffering do not end after surgery. \nOnce involved in therapy, the real struggle to return to a life lost \nbegins.\n  What is commonly overlooked in the rehabilitation of a breast cancer \nvictim is the unrestrictive support by loved ones as a means of \ntherapy, and in most cases, this is vital to their recovery. Families \nfacing cancer are severally challenged as their lives become \nincreasingly complex. Psychosocial research has shown that the stress \nof adopting new roles, relating to and communicating with others, self-\ncare responsibilities, and the over all nature of the cancer experience \ncan cause unrest in the family unit. This in turn, greatly influences \nand in most cases, hinders the complete healing process. On the other \nhand, families that have stood by and supported relatives by educating \nthemselves and responding properly tot he needs of the victim were able \nto significantly add to the recovery process. Therefore, I believe that \nas we work toward advancements in treatment, cure, and diagnosis of \nbreast cancer, our programs must also stress involvement by family \nmembers in the care and support of loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3234-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DAVID PACKARD\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn of \nthe death of David Packard yesterday. My heartfelt thoughts and prayers \ngo out to his family as people around the Nation pay tribute to his \nremarkable life and mourn his passing.\n  Untold numbers of people's lives were touched by David Packard or \nchanged by the advent of his innovations. Not only will he be \nremembered for his pioneering work in the area of electronic and \ncomputer technology, but also his progressive management philosophy \npromises to remain fundamental in the high-tech industry in particular \nand American business in general.\n  Although his work at Hewlett-Packard was best known to the public, he \nfound time to donate his valuable energy and resources to his country \nand many organizations and causes which are now an integral part of \nCalifornia's communities and elsewhere. The Monterey Bay Aquarium and \nthe Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University \nare just two of his most visible contributions. His generosity, as most \nclearly manifest by the continuing work of the David and Lucile Packard \nFoundation, will long be remembered as the living legacy of a departed \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3234-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3234-S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO LOUISVILLE MALE HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

These young scholars have worked diligently to \nreach the national finals by winning local competitions in our home \nState.\n  The distinguished member of the team representing Kentucky are: Abby \nAlster, Jil Beyerle, Lori Buchter, Adam Burns, Melissa Chandler, Sienna \nGreenwell, Patrick Hallahan, Nicole Hardin, Tony Heun, Michelle Hill, \nPatricia Holloway, Cammie Kramer, Kevin Laugherty, Anne-Marie Lucchese, \nAstrud Masterson, Kimberly Merritt, Tiffany Miller, Matthew Parish, \nAngela Rankin, Dana Smith, Danielle Vereen, Maleka Williams, Jamie \nZeller.\n\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Sandra Hoover, who \ndeserves a lot of credit for the success of the team. The district \ncoordinator, Diane Meredith, and the State coordinators, Deborah \nWilliamson and Jennifer Van Hoose, also contributed a significant \namount of time and effort to help the team reach the national finals.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The 3-day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing in which students' oral presentations are judged \non the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their \nability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People . . \n. program, now in its 9th academic year, has reached more than 70,400 \nteachers and 22,600,000 students nationwide at the upper elementary, \nmiddle, and high school levels. Members of Congress and their staff \nenhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with \nstudents and teachers.\n  The We the People . . . program provides an excellent opportunity for \nstudents to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the \nU.S. Constitution and its place in our history and our lives. I wish \nthese students the best of luck in the national finals and look forward \nto their continued success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3234-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3235-S3236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF FEDERAL JUDGES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I take our advice and consent function very \nseriously and especially so when it comes to the confirmation of \nFederal judges who are given lifetime appointments. In our system of \nGovernment, with coordinate branches and separation of powers, that is \nour responsibility in the Senate. But once a Federal judge is \nconfirmed, our role is concluded.\n  I have voted to confirm some judges who rendered decisions with which \nI strongly disagreed and have voted against a few who have surprised me \nby turning out to be better judges than I predicted. Whenever I \ndisagreed with a particular ruling in a particular case, after a \nFederal judge was nominated, examined and confirmed, I have not \nattacked that judge or tried to influence that judge's consideration of \nan ongoing matter.\n  If we disagree with the result in a case, we can determine whether \nthe law needs to be amended or new law needs to be enacted. If a judge \ndecides a case incorrectly, the remedy in our system is through \njudicial appeal. Indeed, the reason the Founders included the \nprotections of a lifetime appointment for Federal judges was to \ninsulate them from politics and political influence.\n  I ask that a statement from a group of distinguished judges from the \nU.S. Court of Appeals from the Second Circuit and an editorial from the \nWashington Post on this subject be made part of the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                            Joint Statement\n\n       The following is a joint statement of Jon O. Newman, J. \n     Edward Lumbard, Wilfred Feinberg, and James L. Oakes, who are \n     respectively, the current and former chief judges of the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:\n       The recent attacks on a trial judge of our Circuit have \n     gone too far. They threaten to weaken the constitutional \n     structure of this Nation, which has well served our citizens \n     for more than 200 years.\n       Last Friday, the White House press secretary announced that \n     the President would await the judge's decision on a pending \n     motion to reconsider a prior ruling before deciding whether \n     to call for the judge's resignation. The plain implication is \n     that the judge should resign if his decision is contrary to \n     the President's preference. That attack is an extraordinary \n     intimidation.\n       Last Saturday, the Senator Majority leader escalated the \n     attack by stating that if the judge does not resign, he \n     should be impeached. The Constitution limits impeachment to \n     those who have committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' A \n     ruling in a contested case cannot remotely be considered a \n     ground for impeachment.\n       These attacks do a grave disservice to the principle of an \n     independent judiciary, and, more significantly, mislead the \n     public as to the role of judges in a constitutional \n     democracy.\n       The Framers of our Constitution gave federal judges life \n     tenure, after nomination by the President and confirmation by \n     the Senate. They did not provide for resignation or \n     impeachment whenever a judge makes a decision with which \n     elected officials disagree.\n       Judges are called upon to make hundreds of decisions \n     each year. These decisions are made after consideration of \n     opposing contentions, both of which are often based on \n     reasonable interpretations of the laws of the United \n     States and the Constitution. Most rulings are subject to \n     appeal, as is the one that has occasioned these attacks.\n       When a judge is threatened with a call for resignation or \n     impeachment because of disagreement with a ruling, the entire \n     process of orderly resolution of legal disputes is \n     undermined.\n       We have no quarrel with criticism of any decision rendered \n     by any judge. Informed comment and disagreement from lawyers, \n     academics, and public officials have been hallmarks of the \n     American legal tradition.\n       But there is an important line between legitimate criticism \n     of a decision and illegitimate attack upon a judge. Criticism \n     of a decision can illuminate issues and sometimes point the \n     way toward better decisions. Attacks on a judge risk \n     inhibition of all judges as they conscientiously endeavor to \n     discharge their constitutional responsibilities.\n       In most circumstances, we would be constrained from making \n     this statement by the Code of Conduct for United States \n     Judges, which precludes public comment about a pending case. \n     However, the Code also places on judges an affirmative duty \n     to uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary. In \n     this instance, we believe our duty under this latter \n     provision overrides whatever indirect comment on a pending \n     case might be inferred from this statement (and we intend \n     none).\n       We urge reconsideration of this rhetoric. We do so not \n     because we doubt the courage of the federal judges of this \n     Circuit, or of this Nation. They have endured attacks, both \n     verbal and physical, and they have established a tradition of \n     judicial independence and faithful regard for the \n     Constitution that is the envy of the world. We are confident \n     they will remain steadfast to that tradition.\n       Rather, we urge that attacks on a judge of our Circuit \n     cease because of the disservice they do to the Constitution \n     and the danger they create of seriously misleading the \n     American public as to the proper functioning of the federal \n     judiciary.\n       Each of us has important responsibilities in a \n     constitutional democracy. All of the judges of this Circuit \n     will continue to discharge theirs. We implore the leaders of \n     the Executive and Legislative Branches to abide by theirs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 26, 1996]\n\n                        Life Tenure for a Reason\n\n       In an angry and misguided response to an unpopular judicial \n     ruling in New York last month, the White House let it be \n     known that it was considering asking for the resignation of \n     the federal judge in question. Within days of this thinly \n     veiled and constitutionally empty threat, however, cooler \n     heads prevailed. In a letter to a member of Congress who had \n     called for resignation, the president's counsel, Jack Quinn, \n     took the right tack, declaring that ``the proper way for the \n     executive branch to contest judicial decisions with which it \n     disagrees is to challenge them in the courts, exactly as the \n     Clinton administration is doing in this case.''\n       At issue is a decision by Judge Harold Baer, a Clinton \n     appointee, to suppress evidence in a multimillion-dollar drug \n     case because the police did not, in his opinion, have \n     probable cause to stop and search the car being used to \n     transport the drugs. Such a ruling is always unpopular, \n     especially in a case like this, in which a defendant at risk \n     of a life sentence will go free if the evidence is \n     inadmissible. But Judge Baer unfortunately used this \n     opportunity to take a gratuitous swipe at the police. It was \n     reasonable, he wrote, for the men involved in this crime to \n     run from the police, because in their neighborhood officers \n     have a reputation for corruption and violence.\n       The public uproar has caused Judge Baer to reconsider his \n     ruling. But whether he is correct on the law is of secondary \n     interest. Because this evidence is crucial to the case, the \n     government can appeal an adverse decision and get a ruling \n     from a higher court before the trial proceeds.\n       What is notable about the case is the eagerness of elected \n     officials to demand the ouster of the judge, not because of \n     corruption but because they did not agree with his ruling in \n     one case. It is exactly this kind of situation that the \n     Framers of the Constitution sought to avoid by providing life \n     tenure\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\n     for judges. Because of their wisdom, a judge acting in good \n     faith who makes an unpopular call--protecting the free speech \n     of political dissenters, for example--cannot be removed from \n     office. The president, members of Congress and the public in \n     general can demand his resignation until they are blue in the \n     face, but a judge cannot be personally punished for taking an \n     unpopular position. He can be removed only by impeachment.\n       An election-year assault on the judiciary is already in \n     full swing. There will be the expected claims that one side \n     will pack the courts with turn-'em-loose liberals and the \n     other will nominate only right-to-life stalwarts. Fortunately \n     for the country, judicial officers are sufficiently insulated \n     from the political process that they are able to do the right \n     thing even when the majority objects. Their mistakes can be \n     reversed. Their independence from political pressure must be \n     preserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3235-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RESTRICTION OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN LEBANON\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to address some of the human \nrights violations that the Lebanese government is guilty of committing. \nIn testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a \nrepresentative of the Independent Communications Network (ICN) explains \nthe repeated limitations that the Lebanese Government places on the \nfreedoms of speech and press. While I disagree with ICN's \nrecommendation concerning the lifting of the State Department's travel \nban to the country, I believe that ICN raises some valid points.\n  ICN's testimony details some of the measures taken by the government \nto repress any political opposition. They are unwilling to allow any \nform of free and open political debate, and they are vigilant about \nensuring that radio and TV airwaves are strictly limited and under \ntheir control. The example of the hardships that ICN has had to endure \nshow the oppressive policies of the Lebanese government.\n  As a country that firmly believes in the freedoms of speech and \npress, we can not sit idly by and tolerate these gross injustices. We \nmust do what is possible to restore a sense of freedom to the country. \nIt is in this spirit that I ask that ICN's testimony to the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee be entered into the Congressional Record in \nits entirety. The testimony follows:\n\n Testimony Submitted for the Record by the Independent Communications \n                       Network, February 27, 1996\n\n       Mr. Chairman. Thank you for this opportunity to testify to \n     this distinguished committee. The Independent Communications \n     Network [ICN] is an independent television broadcaster in \n     Beirut committed to an independent Lebanon.\n       We are philosophically as well as professionally committed \n     to freedom of speech and freedom of the press, two \n     fundamental rights which we believe are threatened in our \n     country.\n       We know you have no jurisdiction in Lebanon, but what you \n     say and do here in Washington and in this respected and \n     influential committee has an impact in Beirut and beyond.\n       The immediate issue before you today is United States ban \n     on travel to Lebanon. We understand the Department of State \n     will announce its decision tomorrow. Such decisions are not \n     and cannot be made in a vacuum. It is with that in mind that \n     we urge you to replace the lifting the travel ban with a \n     strong advisory that not only warns travelers but also makes \n     it clear to the Lebanese government that the United States \n     government expects it to make a concerted effort to improve \n     its efforts to assure the personal security of visitors to \n     Lebanon as well as to secure human rights and freedom of \n     speech for all Lebanese.\n       Lebanon is a unique country in the Middle East, and it has \n     historically chosen a unique mission: spreading the liberty \n     and freedom of speech in our part of the world. This mission, \n     which we share with America, is threatened by a government \n     which seems intent on turning Lebanon into a police state.\n       Before 1990, the Muslims in Lebanon were demanding a fair \n     share of power. Lebanon has been governed since 1943 by a \n     National Pact dividing power between Christians and Muslims \n     on a six-to-five basis in favor of Christians. In 1990, \n     Lebanese parliamentarians met in the Saudi summer resort town \n     of Taif, and under American, Saudi and Syrian auspices \n     developed a ``peace plan'' that shifted the imbalance to the \n     favor of the Muslims this time.\n       This situation has led to an unbalanced government. General \n     elections were boycotted by most Lebanese, leading to a \n     parliament representing no more than 13 percent of the \n     country. We are sliding more and more towards dictatorship \n     and a ``savage ownership'' of the country and the media by \n     the multi-billionaire who is currently prime minister, \n     Sheikh Rafiq Hariri.\n       Today the fundamentalists are gaining influence in our \n     country, taking advantage of a collapsing economy and the \n     government's efforts to gag the media.\n       The government is seeking to stifle dissent by limiting the \n     number of radio and television stations permitted to operate \n     in Lebanon. Those that remain are becoming little more than \n     political booty for the prime minister and his friends and a \n     club to silence the opposition. The government already has \n     approved legislation permitting only six television and 12 \n     radio stations for the entire country.\n       Of those six permitted television stations, one belongs to \n     the Speaker of the Parliament, Nabih Berri; another to the \n     Minister of the Interior, Michel Murr and a third to Prime \n     Minister Hariri.\n       ICN, as its name implies, is an independent voice not \n     beholden to the government or any political party. It is no \n     coincidence that it is not among the six stations sanctioned \n     by Mr. Hariri and his government.\n       The government has ignored the petition of more than 40 \n     members of Parliament asking to review and restudy this \n     unjust law. It also has ignored demonstrations in the streets \n     of Beirut protesting the law and more are scheduled later \n     this week.\n       Mr. Chairman, we wish to share with you an example of the \n     current state of freedom and democracy and respect for human \n     rights in a country that is slaughtering freedom.\n       Earlier this month, ICN was broadcasting live a roundtable \n     discussion with several parliamentary deputies from the \n     opposition who were critical of the government's attempt to \n     parcel out television channels to its supporters. State \n     security forces sealed off the ICN building in Beirut, and \n     the host of the show and some participants were threatened by \n     plainclothes security men about what they were doing and \n     saying.\n       The State Department Report on Human Rights, the Middle \n     East Watch report on human rights and other groups have been \n     critical of the policies of the Lebanese government regarding \n     human rights and freedom of speech.\n       In 1993 the government banned ICN for nine months until a \n     resolution passed by the United States Congress urged that it \n     be allowed to reopen. But the government did not cease its \n     efforts to silence INC, even after the courts found ICN \n     innocent of the trumped up charges made by the government. \n     The Hariri government continues attempting to promulgate what \n     can only be called unconscionable efforts to silence all \n     opposition and criticism.\n       This unbearable political and economic situation has led \n     the Lebanese Workers Union to call for a national strike and \n     demonstrations on February 29. It is no coincidence that \n     threat came from Interior Minister Murr, the owner of one of \n     the six sanctioned television puppet stations.\n       It is important to note that the basis of the Lebanese \n     government's demand that the United States lift the travel \n     ban is its repeated claim that it is in full control of \n     national security. It is also asking the United State and the \n     United Nations to force Israel to withdraw from South \n     Lebanon; President Elias Hraoui contends that the Lebanese \n     Army is ready to deploy and maintain security there.\n       If the government is as strong as it claims, how can it \n     turn around and say it is banning the constitutional right of \n     demonstration to the workers because security is still \n     fragile and that such demonstrations could jeopardize the \n     national security.\n       They can't have it both ways.\n       We urge the Congress to see for itself by dispatching a \n     fact finding mission to Lebanon to look into what the \n     government is doing to protect human rights and freedom of \n     speech.\n       The first stop for that delegation should be the U.S. \n     Embassy, where you and your colleagues can ask America's new \n     ambassador, Mr. Richard Jones, why, if the government has the \n     security control it contends, he had to secretly land in \n     Beirut and clandestinely head to the Embassy earler this \n     month to take up his new post. And ask why it is American \n     officials can only use the ``helicopter bridge'' into Beirut, \n     not their automobiles.\n       In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, we support replacing the \n     travel ban with an advisory, but its continuation should be \n     linked not only to the government's ability to protect public \n     safety and the security of American visitors but also to the \n     government respect for the fundamental rights of its \n     citizens.\n       Mr. Chairman, we appreciate this opportunity to testify \n     before you and this distinguished committee. Thank \n     you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3236-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3236-S3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this morning, the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, was on the floor speaking about \na provision in the State Department Authorization conference report \nthat was voted out last night.\n  The provision was section 1601, which declares that the provisions of \nthe Taiwan Relations Act supersede provisions of the United States-\nChina Joint Communique of August 17, 1992.\n  His basic point was that the provision was written not to be a \nwholesale repudiation of the 1982 Joint Communique, but rather to say \nthat where the two conflict, specifically with respect\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\nto arms sales to Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act, as the law of the \nland, must override the communique. He referred to an April 22, 1994 \nletter he received from Secretary Christopher saying that the \nAdministration agrees that the Taiwan Relations Act takes legal \nprecedence over the communique.\n  Indeed, it is true that the Taiwan Relations Act takes legal \nprecedence over the 1982 Joint Communique. One is the law of the land, \nand the other is a diplomatic agreement not ratified by Congress.\n  But that is precisely what makes this provision superfluous. If the \nintent is to say that the law of the land takes legal precedence over \nother documents, it is absolutely unnecessary. If we add this language \nto the Taiwan Relations Act, we may as well add it to every other law \nwe pass: ``The provisions of this act supersede the speech made by the \nPresident on a similar topic on such-and-such a date.''\n  The Senator from Alaska says the meaning of the word ``supersede'' is \nthat the Taiwan Relations Act overrides the Communique only if their \nprovisions conflict. He cites the Oxford English Dictionary's \ndefinition of ``supersede.'' But, according to Webster's Third New \nInternational Dictionary, the word ``supersede'' also means ``to make \nobsolete,'' ``to make void,'' `` to annul,'' ``to make superfluous or \nunnecessary,'' and ``to take the place of and outmode by superiority.''\n  Therefore, regardless of the provision's intent, it has the \nappearance of Congress issuing a wholesale repudiation of the 1982 \nJoint Communique.\n  This Joint Communique includes not just a paragraph on arms sales, \nbut a reaffirmation of the One-China policy and the principles of \nsovereignty and territorial integrity as espoused in the two previous \nJoint Communiques of 1972 and 1979. By saying we supersede the 1982 \nJoint Communique, we give the impression that we might be repudiating \nit outright. To do this would shake United States-China relations to \ntheir very core. The fundamental basis of the relationship would be \ncalled into question.\n  Under any circumstances, this would be a dangerous course of action, \nbut it is especially so at this extremely sensitive time in relations \nbetween the United States, China, and Taiwan.\n  Congress needs to be exceedingly careful not to take actions that \nwill have farther-reaching effects than we intend. We should not \nunderestimate how seriously this provision--which may seem harmless to \nus--would be viewed not just in Beijing, but also in Taipei.\n  It seems particularly foolhardy to take such a risk over an \nunnecessary provision, which essentially says nothing more than that \nthe law of the land is the law of the land, which of course it \nis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3236-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SOCIAL SECURITY EARNINGS TEST\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed the \n``Contract With America Advancement Act.'' I rise to speak to one \nprovision of that legislation, which I believe is a significant \nachievement for senior citizens. That is the ``Senior Citizens' Right \nto Work Act of 1996.'' This legislation raises the Social Security \nearnings limit to $30,000 by the year 2002, more than double what it \nwould be under current law.\n  Every year, the earnings limitation test takes $1 of every $3 that \nSocial Security beneficiaries 65 to 69 years old earn above $11,280. I \nhear from hundreds of senior citizens every year complaining that this \ntest is unfair. And they are correct. In fact, the earnings test \naffects an estimated 1.4 million beneficiaries each year.\n  More importantly, Mr. President, the earnings test flies right smack \nin the fact of the most basic principles we teach our kids in grade \nschool economics. Specifically: no work, no pay. Can you imagine trying \nto explain a system that pays people not to work? Well, that is what \nour Social Security system does with the earnings test.\n  You might argue that our welfare system has similar disincentives, \nand you would be absolutely right. The Republican Congress is trying to \nfix that. If only we could overcome the little obstacle of President \nClinton's veto pen, we would be well on our way to real welfare reform.\n  But, the earnings test takes this perverse concept one step further. \nAnd this is where we really get into the fairness issue. It says that \nif you are wealthy and you get your income through interest or \ndividends, you get full benefits. But, if you are poor and need to work \nto supplement your income, you get penalized. Seniors have been waiting \na long time for this reform. It was in the Contract With America, and \nit is a part of the Republican Party Platform. I am pleased that we are \nabout to make good on our promise to America's seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3237-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JUDGE KING OF FLORIDA\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. The State of Florida has produced some of the \nfinest legal minds in America's judicial system. The personification of \nthat standard of excellence is U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King \nof Miami.\n  As a native of the Miami community, I am honored to be part of the \neffort to name the Federal justice building in Miami, FL, for Judge \nKing.\n  Judge King's distinguished tenure on the bench has spanned four \ndecades, during which our judicial system has faced some of the most \nchallenging disputes in the history of our Nation.\n  In 1964 Mr. King was appointed circuit judge for the 11th Judicial \nCircuit of Florida. In 1970, President Nixon appointed Judge King as a \nU.S. district judge for the Southern District of Florida. In 1984, he \nbecame chief judge of the U.S. district court for the Southern District \nof Florida. During his outstanding career, Judge King has had more than \n200 published opinions.\n  In addition to his contributions to our judicial system from the \nbench, Judge King has been an effective advocate for improved judicial \nadministration. Judge King served as 1 of 23 members on the Judicial \nConference of the United States. He was also a member of the Judicial \nCounsel of the 11th Circuit Administrative Conference, the Judicial \nEthics Committee and the Long Range Planning Committee for the Federal \nJudiciary, serving all with distinction.\n  While fulfilling his duties, Judge King foresaw the need for new \ncourtroom and administrative facilities to accommodate the growing \nneeds of the district and the law enforcement community. He began \ncontacting community leaders to share his vision. After years of \ntireless effort, Judge King's vision became a reality.\n  The Federal justice building was built by the city of Miami with city \nbonds backed by a long-term lease from the General Services \nAdministration. Today, this state-of-the-art facility houses the U.S. \nattorneys' office and will be home to six district judges, an 11th \ncircuit judge and complete trial and appellate courts.\n  While many community leaders worked to complete the Federal justice \nbuilding, Judge King was the guiding force behind its creation. This \nbuilding should be named as a tribute to Judge King for his vision, \nleadership and effective stewardship of justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3237-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3237-S3238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING KIEREN P.

While the \nbalance of trade is only one measure of economic health, in this \nincreasingly global economy, I believe that it is a measure that should \nbe given great weight in deciding whether we are doing enough to \npromote healthy economic growth. The reports today should prompt \nFederal policy makers to renew their commitments to promoting American \nbusiness and products overseas, and making our trading partners play \nfair by living up to the trading agreements they have entered into \nwillingly with us.\n  The bright side of this picture is that the U.S. continues to be the \nmost dynamic economy in the world. We are the most productive and we \nmake the best products.\n  In my own State of California, there is one industry which I wish to \nsingle out today that is one of the key reasons for American economic \ndominance--the entertainment industry.\n  The movie and television industry in California has a payroll of $7.4 \nbillion. Motion picture production alone counts for more than 133,500 \njobs in California. American made entertainment products are the most \npopular and broadly distributed on the globe, and they constitute a \nlarge part of America's balance of trade. Foreign sales of copyrighted \nproducts amounted to $45.8 billion in 1995.\n  Unfortunately, the entertainment industry is a victim of one of the \nmost egregious foreign trade practices--illegal duplication of \ncopyrighted material--or ``piracy.''\n  The United States has signed agreements with many other countries \nwhich obligate their governments to take steps necessary to protect \nU.S. copyrighted material from piracy. In the case of the People's \nRepublic of China, however, despite the fact that they have willingly \nsigned several such agreements, rampant piracy of American \nentertainment products by Chinese factories has continued. It is \nestimated that U.S. companies lose approximately 1 billion dollars a \nyear in sales because of China's failure to protect U.S. intellectual \nproperty.\n  In February, 1995, the United States and the People's Republic of \nChina signed an agreement that obligated China to strengthen its \npatent, copyright and trade secret laws, and to improve the protection \nof U.S. intellectual property. Since that time, however, according to \nreports by the U.S. trade representative, only one of the 27 piracy \nplants in China has closed.\n\n  I know that trade representative Mickey Kantor has been very, very \nsupportive of the U.S. entertainment industry in pressing the Chinese \nto live up to the agreement they signed. I applaud his decision to send \nhis deputy Charlene Barshevsky to China on April 5 to raise the profile \nof the problem directly with Chinese officials.\n  I hope that in their meetings, our U.S. officials will emphasize that \nChina is legally obligated to comply with the terms of the agreement \nthey signed last year. It's not just a policy; it's the law.\n  Our delegation should make it clear to the Chinese that the terms of \nthe agreement must be met by a date certain. Whether that's May 1, June \n1, or after--doesn't matter. But it should be made clear to them that \nwe will hold them to their promises. If they don't fulfill them, the \nU.S. Government will take all appropriate and legal steps.\n  In addition, I strongly urge other members of the Clinton \nadministration in the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce and \nothers, to support the trade representative's efforts wholeheartedly. \nThey should know that it's not just a question of one industry and one \ntrading partner; if we allow the agreement we signed just a year ago to \nbe ignored, what kind of signal will that send to our other nations \nabout the will and strength of the United States in international \nrelations?\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity in speaking \nabout our extraordinary entertainment industry to praise the leaders of \nthat community for their historic actions with respect to the \ntelevision violence issue.\n  They have shown real leadership and responsibility in responding to \nthis important social concern by announcing that they will institute a \nvoluntary rating system for all television programs. In my view, this \nwill give parents the information they need in order to make \nappropriate decisions about the programs their children watch.\n  In light of the forthrightness of the industry in coming forward with \nplans to voluntarily rate its programs, I believe that now is not the \ntime to bring up other content-related measures. I have, in fact, \ninformed the Democratic leader and others that I would oppose any \nattempt to bring up such measures for debate in the Senate.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to talk about another issue of \ngreat importance to California's entertainment industry--copyright term \nextension. Legislation is pending in both the House and Senate to \nextend the current copyright in the U.S. to ``life plus 70 years''. \nThis change would harmonize our laws with those of the European union \nwhich extended terms to life plus 70 last July. Without the change, our \ncopyright holders--including California's movie, television, video, and \naudio producers--would be unable to take advantage of the longer term \nof protection in Europe. American copyright owners and their heirs will \nsuffer economic hardship and the U.S. balance of trade will be further \nexacerbated.\n  Congress should pass this bill now. It has no opposition that I am \naware of. I strongly urge the parties involved in negotiations on this \nmeasure to move quickly on it and send it to the President so that it \ncan be signed into law. Copyright extension can pass quickly and be \nsigned into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3238-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3238-S3239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SULLIVAN COLLEGE\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to join the citizens \nof Maryland in honoring a distinguished public servant, an accomplished \ntrial lawyer, and, above all, a courageous man, Victor Crawford, who \ndied earlier this month after a long battle with cancer.\n  I first met Vic in January 1967 as a newly elected member of the \nMaryland House of Delegates. He was an articulate and skilled master of \nthe legislative process who, throughout his years in the Maryland \nLegislature, enjoyed a deserved reputation as a dazzling orator and \ntenacious advocate for the people of Maryland.\n  But Vic's crowning achievement came not in the legislative arena, but \nin his nationally acclaimed battle for stronger antismoking laws. After \nyears as a heavy smoker and a period spent as a lobbyist for the \ntobacco industry, Vic became a staunch and vocal advocate for \nantismoking legislation and education and prevention efforts. Vic \ndedicated himself wholeheartedly to this important mission which he \nconducted with the same skill and determination that characterized his \nlegislative career.\n  Vic's indomitable efforts in this area brought him to the attention \nof President Clinton who believed Vic's strong antismoking message \nshould be shared, not just with Marylanders, but with all Americans, \nand invited him to address the Nation on his weekly radio broadcast. It \nwas among his finest hours and Vic's words inspired citizens throughout \nthe Nation to work for stronger antismoking laws.\n  His last years were not easy, but with humor and determination Vic \nlived out his life in dignity and exhibited the same courage and \nstrength we had all come to expect from this remarkable man. Vic \nCrawford was a good friend and a valued counselor. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to extend my deepest and heartfelt sympathies to his \nwife, Linda, and to his children, Charlene and Victor Junior.\n  Mr. President, in testimony to Vic's exceptional service on behalf of \nall Americans, I request that obituaries from the Baltimore Sun, the \nNew York Times, and the Washington Post which pay tribute to this \nrespected and honorable man, be printed in the Record.\n  The obituaries follow:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 12, 1996]\n\n    Former Lawmaker, Lobbyist Is Remembered by Friends; Glendening \n                     Eulogizes Antismoking Activist\n\n       Victor L. Crawford, the former Maryland legislator and \n     tobacco lobbyist who turned into a national voice against \n     smoking after he was found to have throat and lung cancer, \n     was honored yesterday at a memorial service in College Park \n     attended by nearly 1,000 mourners.\n       Crawford, who died March 2 at age 63 after a two-year bout \n     with cancer, was remembered fondly by people who had contact \n     with him at various points of his life, from Maryland Gov. \n     Parris N. Glendening to Carl Nuzman, 23, a student at the \n     University of Maryland who is attending classes on a \n     scholarship Crawford helped establish during his years in \n     Annapolis.\n       The service at the nondemoninational University of Maryland \n     Chapel drew a host of state legislators and politicians from \n     Montgomery County, which Crawford represented in the House of \n     Delegates and Senate for 16 years. Even the pastor, the Rev. \n     Charles W. Gilchrist, was a former Montgomery County \n     executive. Crawford also was remembered as a skillful lawyer \n     who could charm juries with his smile and affable nature.\n       ``Vic's legacy was that he had the boldness to do something \n     that many of us find difficult,'' Glendening said during his \n     eulogy. ``That is, he came out and he said that he had made a \n     mistake in his life. He took personal responsibility for \n     that.''\n       But it was his unyielding crusade against smoking that \n     everyone recalled with the greatest admiration. After \n     spending several years of his post-legislative career working \n     as a lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute, Crawford, a longtime \n     smoker, was found to have terminal cancer two years ago.\n       Knowing death was coming, he spent those two years using \n     his skills as a politician and a lawyer to fight the very \n     people he once represented, even though he had been severely \n     weakened by the disease.\n       ``I got the sense that he'd never felt so close to his own \n     mortality before,'' said Gail Ewing (D-At Large), president \n     of the Montgomery County Council, recalling the day Crawford \n     told her about his cancer. ``He really wanted to do \n     something that mattered.''\n       County Executive Douglas M. Duncan said: ``He was a great \n     senator for Montgomery County. He was one of the few who \n     could influence the state on important issues. If you wanted \n     something done in Annapolis, he was the one you called.''\n       And although his political career never left Maryland, he \n     took his last battle across the country by lobbying in many \n     states and appearing on network television.\n       Despite the sadness of the occasion, the service had an air \n     of Crawford's good-natured spirit about it. As the gathering \n     assembled, Dixieland music filled the vaulted chapel, and \n     sunlight streamed through the windows.\n       ``I walked up the steps, and I heard music. I walked to the \n     door, and I said, `This must be the place,' '' said \n     Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, who became friends \n     with Crawford during his campaign against the tobacco \n     industry. ``Every time I saw Vic Crawford, I felt good about \n     myself. Today I was feeling kind of down, but I felt better \n     when I walked in the door.''\n       It was that same ability to make people feel good about \n     themselves that Wendy Satin, a Rockville lawyer who began her \n     career under Crawford's tutelage, remarked upon in her \n     recollection of a law career that grew to fabled dimensions \n     within Rockville's legal circles.\n       She remembered how Crawford's good nature would win juries \n     over to his side. ``The jurors felt that they knew him \n     because, by the end of the trial, they did. They were charmed \n     by him, and they wanted to be on his side. The lesson,'' she \n     said, ``is to always be yourself.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 10, 1996]\n\n                  Victor Crawford, 63; Opposed Smoking\n\n       Baltimore.--Victor Crawford, a former tobacco lobbyist who \n     became a crusader against smoking after his throat cancer was \n     diagnosed, died on March 2, 1996 at Johns Hopkins Hospital \n     here.

Johnson was convicted, but he later was \n     pardoned by the governor after it was shown that prosecutors \n     had withheld evidence.\n       In 1992, he summarized a career of 1,000 trials by \n     describing himself as ``the court of last resort,'' the only \n     barrier between a defendant and the power of the state.\n       ``Whenever I see a guy getting a raw deal, particularly if \n     racism has permeated the\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\n     trial, no matter whether it's one side or the other, it gets \n     my Irish dander up.''\n       Mr. Crawford was elected to the state House of Delegates in \n     1966 to represent Silver Spring, went on to the state Senate \n     16 years later and decided against seeking reelection in \n     1982.\n       Offering a swashbuckling image to statehouse colleagues \n     that led some to liken him in dress and demeanor to a \n     riverboat gambler, Mr. Crawford was remembered for the fine \n     clothes, unpredictable floor antics, a large mustache and \n     cigars.\n       Survivors include his wife, Linda, of Chevy Chase, and a \n     daughter, Charlene, and a son, Victor Jr., both of Berwyn \n     Heights.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, Mar. 4, 1996]\n\n Victor Crawford, Crusader Against Smoking, Dies at 63; Cancer Victim \n                       Once Was Tobacco Lobbyist\n\n       Victor L.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to some \nunsung heroes of the United States: the employees of Raytheon \nElectronic Systems Division in Andover, MA.\n  Each year, the Congress evaluates the military requirements of our \nNation and the pros and cons of various weapons systems. We routinely \nmake decisions that affect the livelihoods of literally thousands of \nAmerican workers. While we strive to be objective and to make sound \njudgments, this human component does not always get the attention it \ndeserves.\n  Today I want to take this opportunity to honor the men and women of \nRaytheon who devote their lives to the defense of this Nation. They do \nnot often get a lot of publicity or see their names in the paper, but \nthey are a collection of true American heroes. They deserve our respect \nand admiration.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have the unique \nresponsibility of overseeing the development and acquisition of the \nsystems needed to defend our Nation. I see first hand the contribution \nthese employees make to our national security. It is enormous.\n  Whether building key components for the Patriot missile system, or \nthe AMRAAM, or the ground based radar, these workers are constantly \nstriving to expand the state-of-the-art, and to deliver the best \npossible product at the most efficient cost. They are a family, these \nworkers from New Hampshire and Massachusetts, committed to a noble \ncalling. And the fruits of their labors are the freedoms and security \nthat we hold so dear.\n  As we prepare for the upcoming authorization and appropriations \nprocesses, I ask my colleagues to reflect for a moment upon these great \npatriots. They were the backbone of our military in the cold war and \nDesert Storm. They are the ones whose innovations and dedication are \nhelping to preserve our prosperity in the future. Their service is an \ninspiration for those of us who are privileged to represent them here \nin Washington.\n  In an uncertain and dangerous world, we can take much comfort in the \nknowledge that the men and women of Raytheon Electronic Systems \nDivision are on the job, each and every day, tirelessly striving to \nproduce the technologies and systems to defend this great \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3240-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3240-S3241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RESTORATION OF THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES\n\n Mr. LEAHY.

One of these provides for the spending of up to $300 \nmillion by the Secretary of the Interior to help restore the Florida \nEverglades. This rapid and significant infusion of funds--$200 million \nof which will be available in less than 100 days--is a critical first \nstep to implement the administration's ambitious $1.5 billion proposal \nto save one of the world's most unique ecosystems. The farm bill \nconferees intend that this national treasure receive immediate \nattention.\n  Prior to the 1940's the Everglades ecosystem covered most of south \nFlorida, from its headwaters in the Kissimmee River basin to the coral \nreefs of Florida Bay. Because of man's alterations, the once ``river of \ngrass'' is now fragmented and deteriorating, threatening not only the \nwildlife of the ecosystem, but also the water supply, economy, and \nquality of life for the people who live in Florida.\n  Throughout the system, clean, fresh water has been replaced by murky, \nnutrient-laden water that does not support native plant and animal \nspecies. Years of water diversion and pollutants have degraded not only \nthe Everglades, but also Florida Bay, one of the most important \nestuaries and fisheries in America. The bay is suffering from a lack of \nfresh water that had led to algal blooms and contributed to the \nextinction of North America's only native coral reef. As a consequence, \nthis once teeming estuary now is closed to commercial fishing, and the \ntourism industry of the region is threatened.\n  We must not let the Everglades die. Although the decline of the \necosystem continues, it is reversible.\n  To speed the Everglades restoration, the farm bill conferees created \na $200 million entitlement, to be available in less than 100 days, for \nthis important project. The conferees also approved an additional $100 \nmillion of spending for Everglades restoration which will come from the \nsale of surplus Federal lands in Florida that have not been set aside \nfor conservation purposes or are not environmentally sensitive.\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\n  To have the maximum impact on Everglades restoration, the conferees \nintend that funds provided for in this legislation be used in priority \nareas. Prior to acceptance of the Everglades provisions, discussions \namong conferees focused on the importance of acquiring and restoring \nland in the Everglades Agricultural Area. The conferees expected that \nthe Secretary of the Interior would give priority to acquiring and \nrestoring lands within the Everglades Agricultural Area, including the \nTalisman tract, in order to make those lands available for water \nstorage and delivery. Both the House and Senate bills used identical \nlanguage to make this point as well:\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior * * * shall use the funds to \n     conduct restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem \n     which may include acquiring private acreage in the Everglades \n     Agricultural Area including approximately 52,000 acres that \n     is commonly known as the Talisman tract.\n\n  At the meeting of conferees, I pointed out that the greatest need for \nrestoration is in the over 130,000 acres of the Everglades Agricultural \nArea which includes much of the land that makes up the Talisman tract. \nI intend to monitor this issue closely to make certain that the funds \nare properly spent.\n  This small down payment will be insufficient for total restoration. \nIt is only part of the Federal Government's share of this coordinated \nrestoration effort. More important, it in no way relieves others--\nparticularly the sugarcane industry that has benefited from the \nalteration of the system and continues to pollute it--of its obligation \nto contribute to restoration costs.\n  Senator Lugar and I have proposed that Florida sugar producers \ncontribute for restoration purposes a 2-cent per pound assessment on \nsugar grown in the Everglades. The administration supports a 1-cent \nassessment. These proposals have widespread support in Florida.\n  On March 25, Mary Barley, chair of the citizens group, Save Our \nEverglades, announced the launching of a ballot initiative to protect \nand restore the Everglades. She said that ``we are facing a crisis and \ntime is running out.'' In proposing a ``Penny for the Everglades,'' \nMrs. Barley spoke eloquently about her late husband, George, who \ndevoted the last years of his life to restoring this national treasure.\n  At that announcement, Mary quoted George who had said:\n\n       Long after we are gone, the Everglades ecosystem will be \n     our legacy--to our children and the rest of the nation.\n\n  George Barley was right then and Mary Barley is right today. Congress \nand the administration must follow their lead and require sugar growers \nin the region to pay their fair share to restore the \nEverglades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3240-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3241-S3242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RELEASE OF THE REPORT BY THE TASK FORCE ON NATIONAL DRUG POLICY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this bicameral task force was \nestablished for one reason: To closely examine the current state of \naffairs of our national drug policy. Along with my Senate and House \ncolleagues, I am distressed that the problem has escalated to this \npresent level.\n  The one startling and depressing fact revealed by the report released \nyesterday is that drug use among teenagers is actually on the rise, \nafter years of decline.\n  There is no disputing the rise in illicit drug use by adolescents. \nStudies have shown that 2.9 million teenagers used marijuana in 1994, \nan increase of 1.3 million just from 1992. This alarming trend shows \nthat one in three high school seniors smoke marijuana. Since 1992, drug \nuse by 10th graders has risen nearly two-thirds. Drug use by eighth \ngraders has nearly doubled since 1991. Of a class of 30 students in a \nNew York City high school or junior high, approximately 5 use marijuana \nor other illicit drugs heavily.\n  The rise in marijuana use has serious implications. The Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse indicates that teenagers who use \nmarijuana are 85 times more likely to use other dangerous drugs in the \nfuture, such as cocaine. Obviously, the use of drugs cannot be pushed \naside but must be placed on the national agenda and confronted. Real \nefforts must be made to reverse this trend.\n  Ignoring these numbers is destructive to our children. A report by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee notes that, ``If such increases are \nallowed to continue for just 2 more years, America will be at risk of \nreturning to the epidemic drug use of the 1970's.''\n  The impact on our Nation's cities will be just as detrimental. The \nCenter on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University in New \nYork released a report showing the costs related to substance abuse \nwere $20 billion in the city of New York. These costs take into account \nall types of substance abuses and reflect the amount spent in terms of \ncrime, violence, health care, emergency services, abuse, social \nprograms, and business costs. If drug use is rising among teenagers, \nthe cost to New York City will skyrocket as they get older.\n  Even more frightening is the fact that the authors of the study state \nthat ``Among 15- to 24-year-olds, substance abuse, in the form of AIDS, \nhomicides, and drug and alcohol overdoses, accounts for 64 percent of \ndeaths.'' Those deaths could have been prevented.\n  Our law enforcement agencies are feeling the rise in drug use. The \nMarch issue of Police Chief, which is dedicated to the war on drugs, \ndescribes the growing presence of illegal drugs and the ever-increasing \nrise in violence that accompanies it. The result is a scared populous \nand an overextended law enforcement, including local law enforcement. \nAn article coauthored by Chief Bob Warshaw of the Rochester Police \nDepartment in New York and DEA Assistant Administrator Paul Daly \ndescribes the feeling across the Nation: ``The distribution and abuse \nof powder and crack cocaine have resulted in an unprecedented wave of \nviolence across our country, the debiliating effect of which has been \nseen in cities and towns, large and small, throughout the United \nStates.''\n  It is our obligation, and the responsibility of the administration, \nto find the reason for the increase in teenage drug use and to tackle \nit forcefully. We must start taking an aggressive action against this \ndrug epidemic.\n  The Clinton administration, however, has become complacent and that \nis reflected in their lack of attention to the illicit drug trade. The \nnumber of Federal prosecutions dropped by 12 percent within 2 years. \nOverall, transit zone seizures, or disruptions, decreased more than 50 \npercent, from 1993 to mid-1995. Budget priorities were shifted in the \nCustoms Service, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Coast Guard \naway from counternarcotics.\n  With drug use on rise with teenagers, the administration has to start \nallocating adequate resources in order to reduce the presence of \nnarcotics in the United States. But instead, when President Clinton \ntook office, he cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 \nto 25, an indication of the President's priorities. When faced with \ncriticism of a failed drug strategy, President Clinton has found the \nneed to restaff the drug czar's office.\n  While the administration prefers to ignore the statistics, the task \nforce has taken matters into its own hands and compiled a list of \nrecommendations that will help to reverse the disturbing trend of \nteenage drug use.\n  By using state-of-the-art technology at U.S. ports of entry, \nnarcotics can be intercepted at the border, before it ever reaches \nchildren. This also means a shift in focus for agencies at our borders \nand airports that are primarily responsible for drug interdiction.\n  In addition, the United States must do all it can to convince foreign \ncountries to cooperate on the counternarcotics effort. Certification \nmust be strictly applied, and sanctions imposed. When a country fails \nto cooperate with the United States to combat drug trafficking, the \nPresident who has the obligation to accurately report on the \ncertification status of a targeted country, must apply those sanctions \naccordingly. Unfortunately, this certification process has not been \ntaken seriously.\n  Despite the administration's awareness that 60 to 70 percent of the \nillegal drugs flowed from Mexico into the United States, and that 75 \npercent of the cocaine in the United States comes from our neighbor to \nthe South, the administration certified Mexico as fully\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\ncooperating in the counternarcotics efforts. Sanctions must be applied, \nwe can no longer pay lipservice to the certification process.\n  And efforts must be stringent in the United States. Drug traffickers \nand drug-related violent criminals must serve their full sentence. Drug \nawareness programs must be accountable. Throwing money at the problem \ndoes not solve it.\n  All aspects of drug control strategy must be defined: ``public \ndisapproval, information, law enforcement, interdiction, and \ntreatment.'' While treatment is merely one component of the effort to \ncombat the drug epidemic, it cannot be the sole solution. Alone, it \nwill not work. One clear indication of the failure of treatment alone \nis the emergency room rate for cocaine and heroin-related cases, as \nstudied by the Drug Abuse Warning Network. Heroin episodes in emergency \nrooms rose 66 percent in 1993. Evaluations should be conducted so that \nonly effective programs will be maintained.\n  Ninety percent of the American public sees the drug problem as a top \npriority. It is time the administration does the same. This is our \nclear, undeniable message: If the administration refuses to be a leader \non this issue, then we will. This report was our first step to put a \ntough drug strategy on the national agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3241-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CALIFORNIA YEAR OF THE ALUMNI\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on April 11, 1996, graduates of the \nCalifornia State University will gather in Washington, DC, to celebrate \n1996 as ``California Year of the Alumni''. Today I wish to recognize \nthe achievements and contributions of the more than 2.1 million alumni \nof that great institution.\n  The California State University is a vibrant, important part of \nCalifornia's public university system. Its graduates are an integral \npart of the many communities which comprise our great State. An \nestimated 10 percent of the workforce in the State of California are \nalumni of the California State University. Their contributions, both \nseparate and collective, are evident in all aspects of life in my \nState.\n  CSU graduates are active in the arts, commerce, the professions, \ngovernment, and elsewhere. Proud of an educational experience made \npossible by the foresight of Californians who came before them, CSU \nalumni are committed to maintaining first-rate educational institutions \nin California.\n  The alumni of the California State University promote and support \ncampus environments where today the values of scholarship, citizenship, \nand self-development are shared and nurtured by more than 300,000 \nstudents and faculty on 21 campuses. Additionally, thousands of \ngraduates volunteer their time, energy, and resources to myriad other \ncauses, providing themselves daily as ambassadors and stewards of \npositive change.\n  It is my great pleasure to honor the alumni of the California State \nUniversity on the floor of the U.S. Senate today as they celebrate the \n``California Year of the Alumni.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3242-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3242-S3246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on March 19th by a vote of 100 to 0, \nthe Senate passed S. 942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act, legislation to implement some of the most important \nrecommendations of the White House Conference on Small Business. \nYesterday, the House passed H.R. 3136, the Contract With America \nAdvancement Act of 1996 which incorporates the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act as amended in the House by the Hyde \namendment. The Senate has now approved H.R. 3136 by unanimous consent \nand Senator Bumpers and I would like to take this opportunity to \nfurther explain the purpose of the act. On March 15, we gave a detailed \nexplanation of the managers amendment adopted by the Senate prior to \npassage of S. 942. The amendment offered by Representative Hyde is \nsubstantially similar to S. 942 as passed by the Senate.\n  Three changes are worth noting. First, the amendments to the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act were revised by the House to take into account \nsome of the concerns raised by the administration in the Statement of \nAdministration Position. The new language embodies the intent of our \nmanagers amendment but clarifies that attorneys fees would be awarded \nwhen there is an unreasonably large difference between an agency demand \nand the final outcome of the case. Second, the House dropped the second \nphase of the Small Business Advocacy Review Panels. Thus the panels now \nonly apply at the proposal stage of EPA and OSHA rulemakings. Finally \nthe time period for the congressional review of regulations, adopted as \npart of the Nickles-Reid amendment, was extended from 45 to 60 days. We \nexpect the authors of the Nickles-Reid amendment will have a detailed \nexplanation of the Congressional Review Subtitle.\n  In order to provide additional guidance for agencies to comply with \nthe requirements of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct, I ask to have printed in the Record a section-by-section analysis \nof the subtitles A through D of act as modified by the Hyde amendment. \nSince there will not be a conference report on the act, this statement \nand a companion statement in the House should serve as the best \nlegislative history of the legislation as finally enacted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act--Joint Managers \n       Statement of Legislative History and Congressional Intent\n\n\n                     i. summary of the legislation\n\n       The Hyde amendment to H.R. 3136 replaces Title III of the \n     Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 to incorporate \n     a revised version of the Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (the ``Act''). This \n     legislation was originally passed by the Senate as S. 942. \n     The Hyde amendment makes a number of changes to the Senate \n     bill to better implement certain recommendations of the 1995 \n     White House Conference on Small Business regarding the \n     development and enforcement of Federal regulations, including \n     judicial review of agency actions under the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act (RFA). The amendment also provides for \n     expedited procedures for Congress to review agency rules and \n     to enact Resolutions of Disapproval voiding agency rules.\n       The goal of the legislation is to foster a more \n     cooperative, less threatening regulatory environment among \n     agencies, small businesses and other small entities. The \n     legislation provides a framework to make federal regulators \n     more accountable for their enforcement actions by providing \n     small entities with an opportunity for redress of arbitrary \n     enforcement actions. The centerpiece of the legislation is \n     the RFA which requires a regulatory flexibility analysis of \n     all rules that have a ``significant economic impact on a \n     substantial number'' of small entities. Under the RFA, this \n     term ``small entities'' includes small businesses, small non-\n     profit organizations, and small governmental units.\n\n\n                    ii. section-by-section analysis\n\n                              Section 301\n\n       This section entitles the Act the ``Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.''\n\n                              Section 302\n\n       The Act makes findings as to the need for a strong small \n     business sector, the disproportionate impact of regulations \n     on small businesses, the recommendations of the 1995 White \n     House Conference on Small Business, and the need for judicial \n     review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\n                              Section 303\n\n       The purpose of the Act is to address some of the key \n     federal regulatory recommendations of the 1995 White House \n     Conference on Small Business. The White House Conference \n     produced a consensus that small businesses should be included \n     earlier and more effectively in the regulatory process. The \n     Act seeks to create a more cooperative and less threatening \n     regulatory environment to help small businesses in their \n     compliance efforts. The Act also provides small businesses \n     with legal redress from arbitrary enforcement actions by \n     making federal regulators accountable for their actions.\n\n            Subtitle A--Regulatory Compliance Simplification\n\n                              Section 311\n\n       This section defines certain terms as used in the subtitle. \n     The term ``small entity'' is currently defined in the RFA to \n     include small business concerns, as defined by the Small \n     Business Act, small nonprofit organizations and small \n     governmental jurisdictions. The process of determining \n     whether a given business qualifies as a small entity is \n     straightforward, using thresholds established by the SBA for \n     Standard Industrial Classification codes. The RFA also \n     defines small organization and small governmental \n     jurisdiction. Any definition established by an agency for \n     purposes of implementing the RFA would also apply to this \n     Act.\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\n                              Section 312\n\n       The Act requires agencies to publish ``small entity \n     compliance guides'' to assist small entities in complying \n     with regulations which are the subject of a required Reg Flex \n     analysis. The bill does not allow judicial review of the \n     guide itself. However, the agency's claim that the guide \n     provides ``plain English'' assistance would be a matter of \n     public record. In addition, the small business compliance \n     guide would be available as evidence of the reasonableness of \n     any proposed fine on the small entity.\n       Agencies should endeavor to make these ``plain English'' \n     guides available to small entities through a coordinated \n     distribution system for regulatory compliance information \n     utilizing means such as the SBA's U.S. Business Advisor, the \n     Small Business Ombudsman at the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, state-run compliance assistance programs established \n     under section 507 of the Clean Air Act, Manufacturing \n     Technology Centers or Small Business Development Centers \n     established under the Small Business Act.\n\n                              Section 313\n\n       The Act directs agencies that regulate small entities to \n     answer inquiries of small entities seeking information on and \n     advice about regulatory compliance. Some agencies already \n     have established successful programs to provide compliance \n     assistance and the amendment intends to encourage these \n     efforts. For example, the IRS, SEC and the Customs Service \n     have an established practice of issuing private letter \n     rulings applying the laws to a particular set of facts. This \n     legislation does not require other agencies to establish \n     programs with the same level of formality as found in the \n     current practice of issuing private letter rulings. The use \n     of toll free telephone numbers and other informal means of \n     responding to small entities is encouraged. This legislation \n     does not mandate changes in current programs at the IRS, SEC \n     and Customs Service, but these agencies should consider \n     establishing less formal means of providing small entities \n     with informal guidance in accordance with this section.\n       The Act gives agencies discretion to establish procedures \n     and conditions under which they would provide advice to small \n     entities. There is no requirement that the agency's advice to \n     small businesses be binding as to the legal effects of the \n     actions of other entities. Any guidance provided by the \n     agency applying statutory or regulatory provisions to facts \n     supplied by the small entity would be available as relevant \n     evidence of the reasonableness of any subsequently proposed \n     fine on the small entity.\n\n                              Section 314\n\n       The Act creates permissive authority for Small Business \n     Development Centers (SBDC) to provide information to small \n     entities regarding compliance with regulatory requirements. \n     SBDC's would not become the single-point source of regulatory \n     information, but would supplement agency efforts to make this \n     information widely available. This section is not intended to \n     grant an exclusive franchise to SBDC's for providing \n     information on regulatory compliance.\n       There are small business information and technical \n     assistance programs, both federal and state, in various forms \n     in different states. Some of the manufacturing technology \n     centers and other similar extension programs administered by \n     the National Institute of Standards and Technology are \n     providing environmental compliance assistance in addition to \n     general technology assistance. The small business stationary \n     source technical and environmental compliance assistance \n     programs established under section 507 of the Clean Air Act \n     Amendments of 1990 is also providing compliance assistance to \n     small businesses. This section is designed to add to the \n     currently available resources to small businesses.\n       Compliance assistance programs can save small businesses \n     money, improve their environmental performance and increase \n     their competitiveness. They can help small businesses learn \n     about cost-saving pollution prevention programs and new \n     environmental technologies. Most importantly, they can help \n     small business owners avoid potentially costly regulatory \n     citations and adjudications. Comments from small business \n     representatives in a variety of fora support the need for \n     expansion of technical assistance programs.\n\n                              Section 315\n\n       This section directs agencies to cooperate with states to \n     create guides that fully integrate federal and state \n     requirements on small businesses. Separate guides may be \n     created for each state, or states may modify or supplement a \n     guide to federal requirements. Since different types of small \n     businesses are affected by different agency regulations, or \n     are affected in different ways, agencies should consider \n     preparing separate guides for the various sectors of the \n     small business community subject to their jurisdiction. \n     Priority in producing these guides should be given to areas \n     of law where rules are complex and where businesses tend to \n     be small. Agencies may contract with outside entities to \n     produce these guides and, to the extent practicable, agencies \n     should utilize entities with the greatest experience in \n     developing similar guides.\n\n                              Section 316\n\n       This section provides that the effective date for the \n     subtitle is 90 days after the date of enactment. The \n     requirement for agencies to publish compliance guides applies \n     to final rules published after the effective date. Agencies \n     have one year from the date of enactment to develop their \n     programs for informal small entity guidance, but these \n     programs should assist small entities with regulatory \n     questions regardless of the date of publication of the \n     regulation at issue.\n\n               Subtitle B--Regulatory Enforcement Reforms\n\n                              Section 321\n\n       This section provides definitions for the terms as used in \n     the subtitle.\n\n                              Section 322\n\n       The Act creates a Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory \n     Enforcement Ombudsman at the SBA to give small businesses a \n     confidential means to comment on the enforcement activity of \n     agency enforcement activities. This might include providing \n     toll-free telephone numbers, computer access points, or mail-\n     in forms allowing businesses to comment on the enforcement \n     activities of inspectors, auditors and other enforcement \n     personnel. As used in this section of the bill, the term \n     ``audit'' is not intended to refer to audits conducted by \n     Inspectors General. This Ombudsman would not replace or \n     diminish any similar ombudsman programs in other agencies.\n       Concerns have arisen in the Inspector General community \n     that those Ombudsmen might have new enforcement powers that \n     would conflict with those currently held by the Inspector \n     Generals. Nothing in the Act is intended to supersede or \n     conflict with the provisions of the Inspector General Act of \n     1978, as amended, or to otherwise restrict or interfere with \n     the activities of any Office of the Inspector General.\n       The Ombudsman will compile the comments of small businesses \n     and provide an annual evaluation similar to a ``customer \n     satisfaction'' rating for different agencies, regions, or \n     offices. The goal of this rating system is to see whether \n     agencies and their personnel are in fact treating small \n     businesses more like customers than potential criminals. \n     Agencies will be provided an opportunity to comment on the \n     Ombudsman's draft report, is currently the practice with \n     reports by the General Accounting Office. The final report \n     may include a section in which an agency can address any \n     concerns that the Ombudsman does not choose to address.\n       The Act states that the Ombudsman shall ``work with each \n     agency with regulatory authority over small businesses to \n     ensure that small business concerns that receive or are \n     subject to an audit, on-site inspection, compliance \n     assistance effort, or other enforcement related communication \n     or contact by agency personnel are provided with a means to \n     comment on the enforcement activity conducted by such \n     personnel.'' The SBA shall publicize the existence of the \n     Ombudsman generally to the small business community and also \n     work cooperatively with enforcement agencies to make small \n     businesses aware of the program at the time of agency \n     enforcement activity. The Ombudsman shall report annually to \n     Congress based on substantiated comments received from small \n     business concerns and the Boards, evaluating the enforcement \n     activities of agency personnel including a rating of the \n     responsiveness to small business of the various regional and \n     program offices of each agency. The report to Congress shall \n     in part be based on the findings and recommendation of the \n     Boards as reported by the Ombudsman to affected agencies. \n     While this language allows for comment on the enforcement \n     activities of agency personnel in order to identify potential \n     abuses of the regulatory process, it does not provide a \n     mandate for the boards and the Ombudsman to create a public \n     performance rating of individual agency employees.\n       The goal of this section is to reduce the instances of \n     excessive and abusive enforcement actions. Those actions \n     clearly originate in the acts of individual enforcement \n     personnel. Sometimes the problem is with the policies of an \n     agency, and the goal of this section is also to change the \n     culture and policies of Federal regulatory agencies. At other \n     times, the problem is not agency policy, but individuals who \n     violate the agency's enforcement policy. To address this \n     issue, the legislation includes a provision to allow the \n     Ombudsman, where appropriate, to refer serious problems with \n     individuals to the agency's Inspector General for proper \n     action.\n       The intent of the Act is to give small businesses a voice \n     in evaluating the overall performances of agencies and agency \n     offices in their dealings with the small business community. \n     The purpose of the Ombudsman's reports is not to rate \n     individual agency personnel, but to assess each program's or \n     agency's performance as a whole. The Ombudsman's report to \n     Congress should not single out individual agency employees \n     by name or assign an individual evaluation or rating that \n     might interfere with agency management and personnel \n     policies.\n       The Act also creates Regional Small Business Regulatory \n     Fairness Boards at the SBA to coordinate with the Ombudsman \n     and to provide small businesses a greater opportunity to \n     track and comment on agency enforcement policies and \n     practices. These boards provide an opportunity for \n     representatives of small businesses to come together on a \n     regional basis to assess the enforcement activities of the \n     various federal regulatory agencies. The boards may meet to \n     collect information about these activities, and report\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\n     and make recommendations to the Ombudsman about the impact of \n     agency enforcement policies or practices on small businesses. \n     The boards will consist of owners, operators or officers of \n     small entities who are appointed by the Administrator of the \n     Small Business Administration. Prior to appointing any board \n     members, the Administrator must consult with the leadership \n     of the Congressional Small Business Committees. There is \n     nothing in the bill that would exempt the boards from the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act, which would apply according \n     to its terms. The Boards may accept donations of services \n     such as the use of a regional SBA office for conducting their \n     meetings.\n\n                              Section 323\n\n       The Act directs all federal agencies that regulate small \n     businesses to develop policies or programs providing for \n     waivers or reductions of civil penalties for violations by \n     small businesses in certain circumstances. This section \n     builds on the current Executive Order on small business \n     enforcement practices and is intended to allow agencies \n     flexibility to tailor their specific programs to their \n     missions and charters. Agencies should also consider the \n     ability of a small entity to pay in determining penalty \n     assessments under appropriate circumstances. Each agency \n     would have discretion to condition and limit the policy or \n     program on appropriate conditions. For purposes of \n     illustration, these could include requiring the small \n     business to act in good faith, requiring that violations be \n     discovered through participation in agency supported \n     compliance assistance programs, or requiring that violations \n     be corrected within a reasonable time.\n       An agency's policy or program could also provide for \n     suitable exclusions. Again, for purposes of illustration, \n     these could include circumstances where the small entity has \n     been subject to multiple enforcement actions, the violation \n     involves criminal conduct, or poses a grave threat to worker \n     safety, public health, safety or the environment.\n       In establishing their programs, it is up to each agency to \n     develop the boundaries of their program and the specific \n     circumstances for providing for a waiver or reduction of \n     penalties, but once establish, an agency must implement its \n     program in an evenhanded fashion. Agencies may distinguish \n     among types of small entities and among classes of civil \n     penalties. Some agencies have already established formal or \n     informal policies or programs that would meet the \n     requirements of this section. For example, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency has adopted a small business enforcement \n     policy that satisfies this section. While this legislation \n     sets out a general requirement to establish penalty waiver \n     and reduction programs, some agencies may be subject to other \n     statutory requirements or limitations applicable to the \n     agency or to a particular program. For example, this section \n     is not intended to override, amend or affect provisions of \n     the Occupational Health and Safety Act or the Mine Safety and \n     Health Act that may impose specific limitations on the \n     operation of penalty reduction or waiver programs.\n\n                              Section 324\n\n       This section provides that the subtitle takes effect 90 \n     days after the date of enactment.\n\n           Subtitle C--Equal Access to Justice Act Amendments\n\n                           Sections 331 & 332\n\n       The Act amends the Equal Access to Justice Act to assist \n     eligible small businesses in recovering their attorneys fees \n     and expenses in certain instances when unreasonable agency \n     demands for fines or civil penalties in enforcement actions \n     are not sustained by the court or by an administrative law \n     judge. While this is a significant change from current law, \n     the legislation is not intended to result in the awarding of \n     attorneys fees as a matter of course. Rather, the legislation \n     is intended to assist in changing the culture among \n     government regulators to increase the reasonableness and \n     fairness of their enforcement practices. Past agency practice \n     too often has been to treat small businesses like suspects. \n     One goal of this bill is to encourage government regulatory \n     agencies to treat small businesses as partners sharing in a \n     common goal of informed regulatory compliance. Government \n     enforcement attorneys often take the position that they must \n     zealously advocate for their client, in this case a \n     regulatory agency, to the maximum extent permitted by law, as \n     if they were representing an individual or other private \n     party. But in the new regulatory climate for small businesses \n     under this legislation, government attorneys with the \n     advantages and resources of the federal government behind \n     them in dealing with small entities must adjust their actions \n     accordingly and not routinely issue original penalties or \n     other demands at the high end of the scale merely as a way of \n     pressuring small entities to agree to quick settlements.\n       The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) provides a means for \n     prevailing parties to recover their attorneys fees in a wide \n     variety of civil and administrative actions between eligible \n     parties and the government. This bill amends the EAJA to \n     create a new avenue for small entities to recover their \n     attorneys fees where the government makes excessive demands \n     in enforcing compliance with a statutory or regulatory \n     requirement, either in an adversary adjudication or judicial \n     review of the agency's enforcement action, or in a civil \n     enforcement action. In these situations, the test for \n     recovering attorneys fees is whether the agency or government \n     demand that led to the administrative or civil action is \n     substantially in excess of the final outcome of the case so \n     as to be unreasonable when compared to the final outcome \n     (whether a fine, injunctive relief or damages) under the \n     facts and circumstances of the case.\n       The comparison called for in the Act is always between a \n     ``demand'' by the government for injunctive and monetary \n     relief taken as a whole and the final outcome of the case in \n     terms of injunctive and monetary relief taken as a whole. As \n     used in these amendments, the term ``demand'' means an \n     express written demand that leads to an adversary \n     adjudication or civil action. A written demand by the \n     government for performance or payment qualifies under this \n     section regardless of form, including an original fine, \n     penalty notice, demand letter, citation or otherwise. In the \n     case of an adversary adjudication, the demand would often be \n     a statement of the ``Definitive Penalty Amount.'' In the case \n     of a civil action brought by the United States, the demand \n     could be in the form of a demand for settlement issued prior \n     to commencement to the litigation. In a civil action to \n     review the determination of an administrative proceeding, the \n     demand could be the demand that led to such proceeding. \n     However, the term ``demand'' should not be read to extend to \n     a mere recitation of facts and law in a complaint. The bill's \n     definition of the term ``demand'' expressly excludes a \n     recitation of the maximum statutory penalty in the complaint \n     or elsewhere when accompanied by an express demand for a \n     lesser amount. This definition is not intended to suggest \n     that a statement of the maximum statutory penalty somewhere \n     other than the complaint, which is not accompanied by an \n     express demand for a lesser amount, is per se a demand, \n     but would depend on the circumstances.\n       This test should not be a simple mathematical comparison. \n     The Committee intends for it to be applied in such a way that \n     it identifies and corrects situations where the agency's \n     demand is so far in excess of the true value of the case, as \n     demonstrated by the final outcome, that it appears the \n     agency's assessment or enforcement action did not represent a \n     reasonable effort to match the penalty to the actual facts \n     and circumstances of the case.\n       In addition, the bill excludes attorneys fee awards in \n     connection with willful violations, bad faith actions and in \n     special circumstances that would make such an award unjust. \n     These additional factors are intended to provide a ``safety \n     valve'' to ensure that the government is not unduly deterred \n     from advancing its case in good faith. Special circumstances \n     are intended to include both legal and factual considerations \n     which may make it unjust to require the public to pay \n     attorneys fees, even in situations where the ultimate award \n     is significantly less than the amount demanded. Special \n     circumstances could include instances where the party seeking \n     fees engaged in a flagrant violation of the law, endangered \n     the lives of others, or engaged in some other type of conduct \n     that would make the award of the fees unjust. The actions \n     covered by ``bad faith'' include the conduct of the party \n     seeking fees both at the time of the underlying violation, \n     and during the enforcement action. For example, if the party \n     seeking fees attempted to elude government officials, cover \n     up its conduct, or otherwise impede the Government's law \n     enforcement activities, then attorney's fees should not be \n     awarded.\n       The bill also increases the maximum hourly rate for \n     attorneys fees under the EAJA from $75 to $125. Agencies \n     could avoid the possibility of paying attorneys fees by \n     settling with the small entity prior to final judgement. The \n     Committee anticipates that if a settlement is reached, all \n     further claims of either party, including claims for \n     attorneys fees, could be included as part of the settlement. \n     The government may obtain a release specifically including \n     attorneys fees under EAJA.\n       Additional language is included in the Act to ensure that \n     the legislation did not violate of the PAYGO requirements of \n     the Budget Act. This language requires agencies to satisfy \n     any award of attorneys fees or expenses arising from an \n     agency enforcement action from their discretionary \n     appropriated funds, but does not require that an agency seek \n     or obtain an individual line item or earmarked appropriation \n     for these amounts.\n\n                              Section 333\n\n       The new provisions of the EAJA apply to civil actions and \n     adversary adjudications commenced on or after the date 14 \n     days after the date of enactment.\n\n           Subtitle D--Regulatory Flexibility Act Amendments\n\n                              Section 341\n\n       The bill expands the coverage of the RFA to include IRS \n     interpretive rules that provide for a ``collection of \n     information'' from small entities. Many IRS rulemakings \n     involve ``interpretative rules'' that IRS contends need not \n     be promulgated pursuant to section 553 of the Administrative \n     Procedures Act. However, these interpretative rules may have \n     significant economic effects on small entities and should be \n     covered by the RFA. The amendment applies to those IRS \n     interpretative rulemakings that are published in the Federal \n     Register for notice and comment and that will be codified in \n     the Code of Federal Regulations. This limitation is intended\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n     to exclude from the RFA other, less formal IRS publications \n     such as revenue rulings, revenue procedures, \n     announcements, publications or private letter rulings.\n       The requirement that IRS interpretative rules comply with \n     the RFA is further limited to those involving a ``collection \n     of information.'' The term ``collection of information'' is \n     defined in the Act to include the obtaining, causing to be \n     obtained, soliciting of facts or opinions by an agency \n     through a variety of means that would include the use of \n     written report forms, schedules, or reporting or other record \n     keeping requirements. It would also include any requirements \n     that require the disclosure to third parties of any \n     information. The intent of this phrase ``collection of \n     information'' in the context of the RFA is to include all IRS \n     interpretive rules of general applicability that lead to or \n     result in small entities making calculations, keeping \n     records, filing reports or otherwise providing information to \n     IRS or third parties.\n       While the term ``collection of information'' also is used \n     in the Paperwork Reduction Act (Title 44 U.S.C. Section \n     3502(4)(``PRA''), the purpose of the term in the context of \n     the RFA is different that the purpose of the term in the PRA. \n     Thus, while some courts have interpreted the PRA to exempt \n     from its requirements certain recordkeeping requirements that \n     are explicitly required by statute, such an interpretation \n     would be inappropriate in the context of the RFA. If a \n     collection of information is explicitly required by the Code, \n     the effect might be to limit the possible regulatory \n     alternatives available to the IRS in the proposed rulemaking, \n     but would not exempt the IRS from conducting a regulatory \n     flexibility analysis.\n       Some IRS interpretative rules merely reiterate or restate \n     the statutorily required tax liability. While a small \n     entity's tax liability may be a burden, the RFA cannot act to \n     supersede the statutorily required tax rate. However, most \n     IRS interpretative rules involve some aspect of defining or \n     establishing requirements for compliance with the Code, or \n     otherwise require small entities to maintain records to \n     comply with the Code, and would now be covered by the RFA. \n     One of the primary purposes of the RFA is to reduce the \n     compliance burdens on small entities whenever possible under \n     the statute. To accomplish this purpose, the IRS should take \n     an expansive approach in interpreting the phrase ``collection \n     of information'' when considering whether to conduct a \n     regulatory flexibility analysis.\n       The Act provides for judicial review of the RFA, and the \n     courts generally are given broad discretion to formulate \n     appropriate remedies under the facts and circumstances of \n     each individual case. The rights of judicial review and \n     remedial authority of the courts provided in the Act as to \n     IRS interpretative rules should be applied in a manner \n     consistent with the purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act (26 \n     U.S.C. 7421), which may limit remedies available in \n     particular circumstances. The RFA, as amended by the Act, \n     permits the court to remand a rule to an Agency for further \n     consideration of the rule's impact on small entities. The \n     amendment also directs the court to consider the public \n     interest in determining whether or not to delay enforcement \n     of a rule against small entities pending agency compliance \n     with the court's findings. In the context of IRS \n     interpretative rulemakings, this language should be read to \n     require the court to give appropriate deference to the \n     legitimate public interest in the assessment and collection \n     of taxes reflected by the Anti-Junction Act. The court should \n     not exercise its discretion more broadly than necessary under \n     the circumstances or in a way that might encourage excessive \n     litigation.\n       If an agency is required to publish an initial regulatory \n     flexibility analysis, the agency also must publish a final \n     regulatory flexibility analysis. In the final regulatory \n     flexibility analysis, agencies will be required to describe \n     the impacts of the rule on small entities and to specify the \n     actions taken by the agency to modify the proposed rule to \n     minimize the regulatory impact on small entities. Nothing in \n     the bill directs the agency to choose to regulatory \n     alternative that is not authorized by the statute granting \n     regulatory authority. The goal of the final regulatory \n     flexibility analysis is to demonstrate how the agency has \n     minimized the impact on small entities consistent with the \n     underlying statute and other applicable legal \n     requirements.\n\n                              Section 342\n\n       The bill removes the current prohibition on judicial review \n     of agency compliance with the RFA and allows adversely \n     affected small entities to seek judicial review of agency \n     compliance with the Act within one year after final agency \n     action, except where a provision of law requires a shorter \n     period for challenging a final agency action. The prohibition \n     on judicial enforcement of the RFA is contrary to the general \n     principle of administrative law, and it has long been \n     criticized by small business owners. Many small business \n     owners believe that agencies have given lip service at best \n     to RFA, and small entities have been denied legal recourse to \n     enforce the Act's requirements.\n       The amendment is not intended to encourage or allow \n     spurious lawsuits which might hinder important governmental \n     functions. The one-year limitation on seeking judicial review \n     ensures that this legislation will not permit indefinite, \n     retroactive application of judicial review. The bill does not \n     subject all regulations issued since the enactment of the RFA \n     to judicial review. After the effective date, if the court \n     finds that a final agency action was arbitrary, capricious, \n     an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with \n     the law, the court may set aside the rule or order the agency \n     to take other corrective action. The court may also decide \n     that the failure to comply with the RFA warrants remanding \n     the rule to the agency or delaying the application of the \n     rule to small entities pending completion of the court \n     ordered corrective action. However, in some circumstances, \n     the court may find that there is good cause to allow the rule \n     to be enforced and to remain in effect pending the corrective \n     action.\n\n                              Section 343\n\n       The bill requires agencies to publish their factual, policy \n     and legal reasons when making a certification under section \n     605 of the RFA that the regulations will not impose a \n     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \n     entities.\n\n                              Section 344\n\n       The bill amends the existing requirements of RFA section \n     609 for small business participation in the rulemaking \n     process by incorporating a modified version of S. 917, the \n     Small Business Advocacy Act, introduced by Senator Domenici, \n     to provide early input from small business into the \n     regulatory process. For proposed rules with a significant \n     economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, \n     EPA and OSHA would have to collect advice and recommendations \n     from small businesses to better inform the agency's \n     regulatory flexibility analysis on the potential impacts of \n     the rule. The House version drops the provision of the Senate \n     bill that would have required the panels to re-convene prior \n     to publication of the final rule.\n       The agency promulgating the rule would consult with the \n     SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy to identify individuals who \n     are representative of affected small businesses. The Agency \n     would designate a senior level official to be responsible for \n     implementing this section and chairing an interagency review \n     panel for the rule. Before the publication of an initial \n     regulatory flexibility analysis for a proposed EPA or OSHA \n     rule, the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy will gather \n     information from individual representatives of small \n     businesses and other small entities, such as small local \n     governments, about the potential impacts of that proposed \n     rule. This information will then be reviewed by a panel \n     composed of members from EPA or OSHA, OIRA, and the \n     Chief Counsel. The panel will then issue a report on those \n     individuals' comments, which will become part of the \n     rulemaking record. The review panel's report and related \n     rulemaking information will be placed in the rulemaking \n     record in a timely fashion so that others who are \n     interested in the proposed rule may have an opportunity to \n     review that information and submit their own responses for \n     the record before the close of the agency's public comment \n     period for the proposed rule. The legislation includes \n     limits on the period during which the review panel \n     conducts its review. It also creates a limited process \n     allowing the Chief Counsel to waive certain requirements \n     of the section after consultation with the Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs and small businesses.\n\n                              Section 345\n\n       This section provides that the effective date of the RFA \n     amendment is 90 days after enactment. Proposed rules \n     published after the effective date must be accompanied by an \n     initial regulatory flexibility analysis or a certification \n     under section 605 of the RFA. Final rules published after the \n     effective date must be accompanied by a final regulatory \n     flexibility analysis or a certification under section 605 of \n     the RFA, regardless of when the rule was first proposed. Thus \n     judicial review shall apply to any final regulation published \n     after the effective date regardless of when the rule was \n     proposed. However, IRS interpretive rules proposed prior to \n     enactment will not be subject to the amendments made in this \n     subchapter expanding the scope of the RFA to include IRS \n     interpretive rules. Thus, the IRS could finalize previously \n     proposed interpretive rules according to the terms of \n     currently applicable law, regardless of when the final \n     interpretive rule is published.\n\n\n           small business regulatory enforcement fairness act\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with \nthe remarks of the distinguished chairman of our committee and the \nprinciple author of S. 942. He and I, as well as our staffs, worked \ntogether on this bill in a true spirit of bipartisanship. The shortness \nof time between the markup of S. 942 and consideration on the floor did \nnot permit the staff to prepare a full-blown report, as we usually do. \nInstead, we have offered this section-by-section analysis as a joint \nexplanatory statement by the managers, even though there was not a \nformal conference on this bill. The House chose to amend S. 942 in \nseveral respects. The chairman and I were consulted about these \nchanges, and we agree that they are helpful. It is our hope that anyone \nreading this statement will treat it exactly as they would a formal \nSenate committee report since it reflects the consensus views of many \nSenators on\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle who have participated in completion of S. 942, \nwhich is now title III, in H.R. 3136.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3242-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3246-S3247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE SWISS BANKS, THE NAZIS, AND HOLOCAUST ASSETS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue \nthat I spoke about yesterday, namely that of the return, by Swiss \nbanks, of assets deposited by European Jews and others in the years \npreceding the Holocaust.\n  Today, I would like to discuss the revelations disclosed in newly \ndiscovered documents by my staff. These documents explain the \nconnections of certain wartime Swiss bankers with Nazi Germany. The \ndocuments are disturbing to read, especially when one considers the \nhistory of the times and the horrors that took place because of the \nmurderous actions of the Nazi regime with which these men dealt.\n  One such declassified document, dated August 2, 1945, from the \nAmerican Embassy in London, from which made up the American \nOccupational project, ``Operation Safe Haven,'' details the membership \nof the board of directors of the I.G. Farben Co. I.G. Farben was, at \nthe time, the largest chemical company in the world, and is known, \nquite infamously for the fact that one of its subsidiaries produced \n``Zyklon B,'' the poison gas used in the gas chambers in the Nazi \nextermination camps in Europe. While voluminous, the document provides \nshort biographies of the directors.\n  At this time, I would like to ask unanimous consent that a portion of \nthis document be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  It is in this document that several Swiss nationals are listed and \nsome are listed as owners or directors of Swiss banks. Following are \nthe names of the bankers:\n  August Germann: Described as the ``Director of the Bank Fuer \nUnternehmungen, Zurich.''\n  Carlo Mollwo: Described as ``A cover man for I.G. Farben formally \nholding 100 percent of the shares of the Swiss bank, Ed. Greutert & \nCie. (Now H.

Known as a member of the I.G. clique.''\n  Mr. President, I know that this is the stuff of history, but it \nserves to point out one vital factor in understanding how this \ncontroversy in Switzerland today, came about. Here we have Swiss \nowners, or directors of banks in Switzerland, which might well have \nbeen the place of deposit for funds of European Jews, and they are \nsitting on the board of I.G. Farben, clearly a notorious company, by \nany standard. These men, as you will see by the document, also headed \ncompanies which acted as fronts for the Nazis, and later perhaps helped \nget assets looted by the Nazis, out of Europe. My question is, if they \nwould do all this for the Nazis, what would they do with the assets of \nEurope's Jews?\n  Mr. President, this is a disturbing question, and to one that I truly \ndo not know the answer. Nevertheless, I fear the worst. Yet, when \nconsidering this question, it inevitably begs a further question. What \nrole did the Swiss Government play in this regard?\n  To provide a possible answer to this question, I would like to \nintroduce the now declassified report of Daniel J. Reagan, then \nCounselor of Legation for Economic Affairs at the U.S. legation in \nBern, who wrote to the Secretary of State on October 4, 1945 concerning \nthe lack of cooperation of the Swiss Government.\n  I would ask that the text of this report be inserted in the Record at \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, this is a devastating indictment of the Swiss \nGovernment and it illustrates how the Swiss went out of their way to \navoid cooperating with the Allies in breaking up the German war effort \nand its vast economic structure.\n  This is only the beginning of our inquiry. We are finding documents \ndaily, and with each search, we find more evidence which, I hope will \nplace us closer to the truth, namely the authoritative, accurate and \nfinal accounting of all assets that numerous Swiss banks continue to \nhold from this time period and to which the survivors and rightful \nheirs are entitled.\n  The report follows:\n\n                           Secret Attachment\n\n     Sponsor Agency: External Security Intelligence Coordinating \n         Committee, Washington, D.C.\n       11.

As evidence of this statement there is transmitted, \n     in the original and in translation, a memorandum presented to \n     the\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\n     Economic Counselor by Mr. Kohli on behalf of the Federal \n     Political Department, embracing what the Swiss describe as \n     their interim report on the census of German assets as \n     promised two months ago (Par. 4, Legation's telegram No. \n     3667, July 24). As it may be seen, this statement presents a \n     mere description of the mode of operation of the Swiss \n     Compensation office, the number of cases blocked without any \n     indication of the results of the census. Mr. Kohli refused to \n     indicate, moreover, when, if at all, any results of the \n     census would be made available to the Allies. He did not \n     contest the joint understanding of the British, French, and \n     ourselves that the Swiss would make available at least the \n     approximate value of interim blocked assets, but they have \n     now failed to do so.\n       Early in August Mr. Schwab, Chief of the Swiss Compensation \n     Office, informed the Economic Counselor that he had in the \n     course of preparation what he intimated was a complete report \n     which he was preparing for the Federal Political Department. \n     Mr. Schwab stated at the time that he understood this report \n     was intended for the Allies. Shortly afterwards Mr. Kohli, of \n     the Federal Political Department, informed the Economic \n     Counselor that he had received this report but that it was \n     being translated from German into French for us. The Economic \n     Counselor indicated that the German text would be \n     satisfactory. Mr. Kohli stated he thought it more polite to \n     transmit it in French. On August 23 Mr. Kohli was again \n     reminded that we had not received this document. He stated \n     that the translation had not yet been completed but that we \n     would obtain it in the near future.\n       At a meeting on September 12 the Economic Counselor stated \n     that he could not understand why this report, which had been \n     in Mr. Kohli's hands for approximately a month, had not yet \n     been transmitted. Mr. Kohli replied that after the \n     translation had been made from German into French, the latter \n     text had been submitted to Mr. Schwab of the Swiss \n     Compensation Office for the latter's approval, but that Mr. \n     Schwab had been on vacation for two weeks. The Economic \n     Counselor informed Mr. Kohli that this statement was most \n     remarkable, for members of his office had been in \n     communication with Mr. Schwab by telephone several times \n     during the preceding week. The Economic Counselor added that \n     he had advised the Department of State of the promise to \n     supply a report giving the pertinent information so far \n     obtained on the census, but that it now appeared that this \n     report, although completed a month ago by the Swiss \n     Compensation Office, had been held up by the Federal \n     Political Department. He expressed the fear that its \n     transmission to us was, for reasons unknown, no longer \n     intended. Mr. Kohli thereupon gave instructions to his \n     assistant to assure that the French text of the report be \n     delivered to us on the following day, which it was. It should \n     be observed that the Aide-Memoire enclosed herewith bears the \n     date of August 27, although it was not delivered until \n     September 13.\n       The foregoing incident has been recited in detail because \n     it suggests that the report prepared by the Swiss \n     Compensation Office and intended for this and the British \n     Legation and the French Embassy was censored and a \n     perfunctory resume substituted therefor. The enclosed report, \n     it is hardly necessary to state, represents a failure on the \n     part of the Swiss to carry out their promise to acquaint us \n     with the interim results of the census and was delivered two \n     weeks after the census was technically closed on August 31.\n       This failure of the Swiss to respect their promises is of \n     especial significance at this time. It would appear to be \n     related to the neglect the Swiss have shown inter alia for \n     those provisions of the March 8 agreement which related to \n     the prompt adoption of legislating necessary to facilitate \n     the restoration of looted property and to the attempt made by \n     the Swiss in the Viscose Suisse case, as reported in \n     Legation's telegram 4211, September 25, to negate the \n     influence of the Allied Proclaimed Lists. Reference must also \n     be made by the belated response offered by the Swiss on \n     September 25 (reported in Legation's telegram 4236 of \n     September 28) to Legation's note of August 3 asserting title \n     to German assets and to the Swiss failure to make any \n     response to the Legation's note of July 12. The latter, as \n     reported in Legation's dispatch 12188 of July 27, 1947, \n     requested the Swiss to take steps, in accordance with the \n     March 8 agreement, to assure that no disposition of German or \n     German-controlled property in Switzerland would occur. As \n     reported in Legation's telegram No. 4201 of September 24, \n     1945, despite this note and despite adequate notice from the \n     Economic Counselor of this Legation that one such disposition \n     was about to occur, the Swiss Government took no steps to \n     intervene in the proposed sale of a German school at Davos.\n       From these incidents one inference is difficult to avoid: \n     the Swiss Government is pursuing dilatory tactics designed to \n     test the sincerity, firmness, and unity of the Allies with \n     respect to the German assets in Switzerland and with respect \n     to the commercial future of those Swiss enterprises and \n     individuals whose pro-German activities were sufficiently \n     notorious to merit inclusion on the Allied black lists. These \n     tactics are being employed, it would appear, in the belief \n     that, in the interim, the Allies will become so preoccupied \n     with other affairs as to neglect to press for further \n     execution of the March 8, agreement. If they are successful, \n     the Swiss will thereby have escaped the proper and legitimate \n     obligations which the majority of other neutrals have \n     assumed, vis-a-vis the Allies, to put an end to the more \n     important potentials for the continuation of Nazi activities.\n       In this connection, attention must be directed to recent \n     discussions in the Swiss Parliament and the Swiss press. As \n     reported in Legation's telegrams 4176, September 20 and 4186, \n     September 21, 1945, Federal Councilor Stampfli, Chief of the \n     Department of Public Economy, and Mr. Dutweiler, influential \n     Swiss political leader, have violently attacked the Allies' \n     listing policy. They have chosen deliberately to misrepresent \n     the purposes and objectives of the Allies with respect to \n     German and Japanese assets and the Proclaimed List. They \n     have categorized these purposes and objectives as \n     ``economic warfare'' directed against the Swiss economy, a \n     statement so palpably false as to require no comment here. \n     The significant point is that these responsible officials \n     and influential spokesmen, supported by large sections of \n     the Swiss press, choose this time to launch an offensive \n     against our lists and the policy behind the lists. This \n     campaign is mounting in scope and intensity. The \n     conclusion here too is difficult to avoid: the Swiss \n     officials are endeavoring to create a public opinion which \n     will accept as proper and in the interests of Switzerland \n     the failures of the Swiss Government to perform wholly in \n     accordance with the provisions and spirit of the \n     agreements made with the Allies.\n       Meanwhile, the concealment of German assets is facilitated \n     by inadequate enforcement of existing inadequate legislation \n     and Swiss nationals, in direct contravention of the March 8 \n     agreement, are taking title to important German enterprises \n     located here, steps which further complicate the detection of \n     enemy property and the restoration of looted property.\n           Respectfully yours, For the Charge d'Affaires a.i.\n                                                 Daniel J.

United States Senate, et al.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the plaintiff in Barrett versus United \nStates Senate is a Federal prisoner in Michigan. He has brought a civil \naction in Federal district court in the District of Columbia, seeking, \namong other things, a declaration from the court that the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit is unable to adjudicate his claims \nimpartially because of its bias against prisoners.\n  The plaintiff has named the U.S. Senate, among others, as a defendant \nin his lawsuit. The Senate is not, however, a proper party to this \nsuit. In fact, the plaintiff asserts no claim against the Senate. This \nresolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Senate \nin this action.\n\n                              S. Res. 240\n\n       Whereas, in the case of United States v.

Byron \n     C. Dale, et al.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the legal action United States versus \nDale, currently pending in the U.S. District Court in South Dakota, was \nbrought by the United States to foreclose two mortgages executed by the \nFarmers Home Administration of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on \nreal estate in Corson County, SD, belonging to the defendants.\n  The defendants in that action have filed a counterclaim against the \nUnited States, naming as codefendants Speaker of the House Newt \nGingrich, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary \nRobert Rubin, Secretary of Agricultural Dan Glickman, and the Senator \nmajority leader. The counterclaim seeks a court order compelling \ntelevised congressional hearings regarding Federal farm and monetary \npolicy and the enactment of legislation favored by the defendant.\n  Lawsuits alleging that citizens have been aggrieved by a Member's \nfailure to act in accordance with the citizens' views have been filed \nagainst Members of Congress from time to time. As the Senate has noted \npreviously in response to such lawsuits, every citizen has a \nconstitutionally protected right to petition the Government for the \nredress of grievances. However, elected officials have the discretion \nto agree or disagree with communications they receive, and to decide \nhow best to respond to the many points of view which are presented to \nthem. This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent \nthe majority leader in this action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3247-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 1296\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nnomination of Stuart Eizenstat to be the Under Secretary of Commerce \nfor International Trade. In Stu Eizenstat, President Clinton has chosen \na real winner. Ambassador Eizenstat brings a wealth of experience and \ntalent to the administration's economic policy team. In Ron Brown we \nhave had the most energetic and effective Secretary of Commerce that \nhas ever held office at the Hoover Building. And, with the selection of \nStu Eizenstat, we finally will have an Under Secretary of Commerce for \ntrade who will serve as an aggressive advocate for U.S. business \noverseas, and an individual who will help defend American business \nagainst unfair competition.\n  Ambassador Eizenstat is a native of Georgia and, in this period of \nMarch madness, I should also note that he developed quite a reputation \nas an exception basketball player. He is a graduate of the University \nof North Carolina and Harvard Law School.\n  As a young man Stu served in the White House under President Lyndon \nJohnson. And, from 1977-80 he served as President Carter's domestic \npolicy advisor. Since leaving the White House, he has served as a \nlecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and as \na guest scholar at the Brookings Institute. He is an expert in trade \nlaw and he made a name for himself in private practice in Atlanta and \nWashington. President Clinton named him to serve in Brussels as the \nUnited States Ambassador to the European Union. And, in that role he \nhas championed the cause of U.S. business regarding tariff and \nnontariff barriers to work toward a level playing field for American \nbusiness.\n  Stu Eizenstat is outstanding member of our Jewish American community. \nThroughout his life he has been very active in the Jewish community in \nAtlanta. While in Brussels, he also served as Special U.S. Envoy for \nProperty Claims in Central Europe, seeking restitution of Jewish \ncommunal and private property confiscated by the Nazis during the \nSecond World War.\n  Mr. President, the International Trade Administration is the \ncornerstone in our U.S. trade programs. It is the principal agency \nresponsible for promoting U.S. business and exports overseas. It staffs \nthe U.S. Trade Representative, conducts trade missions, and provides \npolicy makers with necessary information on industry and trading \npartners. And, through the Import Administration and the Office of \nTextiles and Apparel, ITA is responsible for protecting our markets \nfrom unfair competition, like dumping. ITA has typically been the \nCommerce Secretary's right hand; it has been the most important bureau \nin Commerce, regardless of who holds office, whether Mac Baldridge or \nBill Verity or Pete Peterson or Elliot Richardson. I have no doubt that \nStuart Eizenstat will make ITA even more effective as he assumes \ncommand.\n  I have no doubt that Ambassador Eizenstat will hit the ground running \nwhen he gets over to the Commerce Department. I know his first \nobjective will be to strengthen our trade enforcement activities. He \nintends to create a new center to monitor foreign countries compliance \nwith trade agreements. Another principal goal of his is to get Asian \nnations to open their markets to U.S. products. During this recess, I \nwill be reviewing his efforts to build a new American business center \nin Shanghai, China.\n  Mr. President, Stu Eizenstat is a man of superb intellect and high \nintegrity. I can tell you that he knows how to get the job done. I know \nthat he will be an effective leader at ITA and Commerce and I urge my \ncolleagues to support his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3248-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. 969, the \nNewborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, be star printed to \nreflect the changes I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Nancy Kassebaum and Senator Bill Frist, in announcing a revised \nand improved version of S. 969, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health \nProtection Act of 1996.\n  This bill requires insurers to allow mothers and their newborns to \nremain in the hospital for a minimum of 48 hours after a normal vaginal \ndelivery and 96 hours after a caesarean section. Shorter hospital stays \nare permitted, provided that the attending health care provider, in \nconsultation with the mother, determines that is the best course of \naction.\n  S. 969 has garnered wide support and endorsements. Currently, 34 of \nour Senate colleagues, 21 Democrats and 13 Republicans are cosponsors. \nMajor medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the \nAmerican Academy\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nof Pediatrics have endorsed this legislation.\n  More than 83,000 Americans from every State in this Nation have \ncommunicated their support to my office.\n  Today, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the clarifications \nand changes to S. 969 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996\n\n       The following comments detail the clarifications and \n     technical changes made to S. 969.:\n       1. The original bill did not comment on whether or not an \n     attending health care provider would need to obtain \n     authorization in order to keep a mother and newborn in the \n     hospital for the 48/96 hours that are guaranteed for \n     insurance coverage.\n       The re-introduced bill states that attending health care \n     providers do not need to obtain authorization in order to \n     keep mothers and newborns in the hospital for this period of \n     time.\n       2. The original bill stated that a decision for early \n     discharge (eg prior to the 48/96 hours) could be made by \n     either the attending health care provider OR mother.\n       The re-introduced bill states that a decision for early \n     discharge can be made by the attending health care provider \n     in consultation with the mother.\n       3. The original bill did not address time parameters with \n     regard to follow-up care.\n       The re-introduced bill states that follow-up care must be \n     timely and must be provided within 24-27 hours following \n     discharge.\n       4. The original bill did not specify a full range of health \n     care providers.\n       The re-introduced bill specifies: physicians \n     (obstetricians-gynecologists, pediatricians, family \n     physicians, other physicians), nurse practitioners, nurses, \n     nurse midwives, and physician assistants (where appropriate).\n       5. The original bill was ambiguous regarding preemption.\n       The re-introduced bill states that state laws that provide \n     for a guarantee of insurance coverage for 48/96 hours OR have \n     laws that guarantee care based on guidelines from the \n     American College of Obstetricians--Gynecologist and the \n     American Academy of Pediatrics AND have followed-up care \n     consistent with federal law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/29/senate-section/article/S3248-5", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAUTHORITY FOR SUBMISSION OF STATEMENTS REGARDING THE DEATH OF EDMUND S. \n                                 MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
