Mr. President, I want to compliment the President of the \nUnited States on his State of the Union Message last night. I think the \nreaction today is certainly an indication of the degree to which the \nPresident succeeded in articulating his message last night. He \ndiscussed, as he can so ably, his record for the last 3 years, \nreminding us that the economy is much stronger than it was when he took \noffice, reminding us that we have reduced the Federal work force by \n200,000 personnel, reminding us that the growth in the economy itself \nis as strong as it has been in the past 30 years, and recognizing that \nwe have made substantial progress in reducing the deficit.\n  So, indeed, from the perspective of the Government, as well as from \nthe point of view of the economy, America is strong and the State of \nthe Union reflects that strength, as he reminded us last night.\n  He also sought to challenge us in seven very specific ways. I think \nhis challenge was appropriate. Indeed, our country expects us to meet \nthe challenges of education, a stronger economy, the need for health \ncare reform, and a whole range of issues that the President addressed \nso ably and articulately last night.\n  Most importantly perhaps, he reminded us that the effort over the \nlast several weeks to achieve meaningful deficit reduction has indeed, \nto at least a certain extent, succeeded. The fact is, as the President \nindicated last night, if you take the lesser of the amounts agreed to \non either side in the most recent offers by both the Republicans and \nthe Democrats, we could achieve deficit reduction totaling more than \n$700 billion.\n  Mr. President, that is a very significant achievement. He challenged \nus last night, to continue the effort to find common ground, to reach \nout across the aisle to establish a meaningful dialog, to continue to \nbuild on what we have already achieved, and to continue to find ways in \nwhich to make the common ground more meaningful. In so doing we can \nrealize a balanced Federal budget in 7 years using the Congressional \nBudget Office figures.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, I was extremely pleased with the \nannouncement this morning by the Speaker that he, too, felt that common \nground efforts ought to be sought, and that we ought to continue to \nfind ways in which to build upon the common agreement that we have \nreached thus far in achieving a meaningful balanced budget.\n  In my view, that is a breakthrough. When you have the President of \nthe United States and the Speaker of the House, the most prominent \nDemocrat and one of the most prominent Republicans, agreeing in public \nthat indeed \n\n[[Page S332]]\nthere is a real possibility of achieving meaningful progress in this \neffort to reach common agreement on a balanced budget, that is a \nbreakthrough.\n  This is no time to abolish or to abandon our goal of attempting to \nreach a balanced budget. A piecemeal approach, Mr. President, is \nunnecessary. We can do it now. We can take that $711 billion in \nmutually agreed to savings and find the kind of long-term resolution to \nthis balanced budget challenge that we have now faced for many months.\n  So it is our opportunity. Apparently the Speaker now agrees that \nachieving that in a meaningful way is possible, using the common ground \napproach. Let us not abandon that goal. Let us not take anything less \nthan a balanced budget over that 7-year period. Let us do it now.\n  I think it is very important that we also recognize that to do it in \nthe context of either a debt limit or a continuing resolution is not \npractical. We recognize that by encumbering and perhaps endangering \neither the continuing resolution or the debt limit resolution we may \nagain find ourselves in a complex series of difficulties and crises \nthat neither side wants.\n  We need a clean continuing resolution. We need a clean resolution on \nthe debt limit. And we can work simultaneously in continuing our \nnegotiations to find a clean budget agreement that achieves the \nmeaningful deficit reduction that we want using the common ground \nproposals that both the Speaker and the President have now accepted.\n  Mr. President, I think the last critical issue to recognize is the \nimportance of the next several weeks. It is very important that we not \nlet this opportunity slip, that we not wait until the last moment to \nresolve these issues. We cannot afford to wait until the 27th or 28th \nor 29th of February. We cannot wait until that very crisis moment to \nresolve all these issues relating to the debt limit.\n  Let us use the 28th and 29th and 30th of January. Let us use the \nfirst few weeks of February to resolve these issues. Let us, in other \nwords, stay here and do our work. Let us not take the chance that we \nwill not be able to solve these problems at the end of February when \nthe crisis truly looms.\n  So let us stay here, let us do what we must, let us recognize the \nopportunity that is before us, let us accept the challenges the \nPresident has now laid out so articulately and so clearly last night. \nLet us do that, recognizing that there are common goals and much common \nground upon which to base our progress. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

First, Mr. President, if I might expand just a bit on the \nopening announcement. I understand now that we are in the process of \nreceiving the House-passed Department of Defense authorization \nconference report that passed overwhelmingly, I believe something like \n287 to 129, something of that magnitude. So we hope that we will be \nable to get an agreement to get the Defense Department authorization \nconference report up shortly, tomorrow or Friday.\n  I know the chairman is very anxious for us to get that done tomorrow \nif at all possible. We will be working to see if we can come to an \nagreement on that. We have worked across the aisle with the \ndistinguished chairman from South Carolina and the distinguished \nranking member from Georgia, Senator Nunn. I believe he would like to \nsee us get that done as soon as possible, and we will continue to work \nin that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S332-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BALANCED BUDGET AND DEBT CEILING LIMIT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in response to the comments from the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, certainly we should continue to find a \nway to move toward a balanced budget agreement. The President said last \nnight he wanted to do that, and even though he vetoed the balanced \nbudget when we sent it to him, that should not deter our efforts.\n  I believe from what I saw last night that the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, indicated we are, in fact, going to continue to pursue \nthis, and he intends for us to send balanced budget legislation to the \nPresident.\n  So we need to think about how we do that. The Senator from South \nDakota mentioned, even though we want to avoid, if we can, a \nprotracted, cumbersome process, perhaps we can have an agreement that \nwould allow us to avoid that. But we will continue to have that as our \ngoal. We are going to work to give the President an opportunity to, in \nfact, sign bills along the lines of what he said he wanted to sign last \nnight.\n  I know that the House, where continuing resolutions must begin, is in \nthe process of developing a continuing resolution, or a balanced budget \ndownpayment is the way I think it should be appropriately described. \nThey will be acting on that, I believe, on Thursday, and then we will \nhave that legislation before us. I certainly hope and expect it is \ngoing to be legislation that the Senate will be able to pass and that \nwill go to the President.\n  With regard to the debt ceiling extension, there, again, I believe \nthe history of that has been the House will act first. I know the House \nis thinking about that and is working on it.\n  With regard to it being a clean debt ceiling, I went back and checked \nthe record in 1990 and 1989 and 1987, back to 1984, and found that in \nmost years debt ceilings did, in fact, have riders on them. Those were \nput on by a Democratic-controlled Congress when we had a Republican \nPresident, so it would not be anything out of the ordinary if it worked \nthe other way this time.\n  I must say, as a Senator who has voted in the Senate and in the House \nboth ways on debt ceiling--sometimes for them, sometimes against them, \nand not just when there was a Republican President, sometimes \nDemocratic Presidents--sometimes my vote has been influenced by the \nriders. Quite often, they are agreed-to things, things that need to be \ndone. I hope that we will wait and see exactly what will be the best \nway to proceed on that, keeping in mind the House will act on it, and \nwe will certainly be communicating with them.\n  I have said publicly that I think we should do that, and I fully \nexpect that we will. The timing, of course, will be determined by a \nwhole series of meetings that will be underway. I assure the Senator \nfrom South Dakota that we are going to be very busy during the next few \ndays and weeks, and we have a lot of work to do. We have to begin on \nthe next fiscal year. Hearings must begin soon on budgets and \nappropriations bills and even authorizations. We certainly intend to \nbegin that process.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor for others who might have \ncomments.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I feel like we ought to start negotiations \nagain in regard to the budget. I think there is an opportunity to get a \nbalanced budget now and in the immediate future. I think if we have a \nlong recess that we will stand a chance of losing what momentum there \nis, and it may well be that in the near future, we can narrow the \nissues by adopting some of the various issues that have been agreed \nupon.\n  Mr. President, for the first time in over 40 years, farm programs \nhave been allowed to expire. As of December 31, with a few exceptions, \nthe authority for farm programs has run out.\n  It is the responsibility of this Congress, to pass a farm bill every \n5 years or so, and create stability and certainty in rural America. \nInstead, with the failure of passing a farm bill, there is uncertainty, \nfrustration and confusion in the agriculture producing areas of the \ncountry. Congress has failed in its responsibility to rural America and \nwe must, therefore, act now to resolve this situation.\n  What can be done at this late date, what are our options? As I see \nit, we have three options: First, we can do nothing and allow the \nSecretary of Agriculture to implement the Agriculture \n\n[[Page S333]]\nAct of 1949, second, we can pass a stand-alone farm bill, as we should \nhave done in the first session, or third, we can pass an extension of \nthe 1990 farm bill, thus providing rural America with much needed \ncertainty and allow Congress more time to write a farm bill this year.\n  If Congress does not act, then the Secretary of Agriculture will have \nto exercise his responsibility to implement the Agriculture Act of \n1949. Currently, market prices for wheat, corn, feed grains, and cotton \nare at all-time highs. However, under the 1949 act, the Secretary will \nbe forced to implement parity prices for wheat, corn, and feed grains. \nFor instance, wheat prices which are currently trading at $4.92 per \nbushel, the support price would jump to $7.82 a bushel. For corn, which \nis trading at $3.60 per bushel, the parity price could go as high as \n$5.30 per bushel.\n  Alabama's primary crops do not include wheat or corn. However, if \nparity prices are implemented, Alabama and the whole Nation will also \nbe greatly effected. Alabama is one of the leading States in poultry \nand catfish production. With corn and feed grain prices potentially \nrising as high as they are projected, it will have the effect of \nsending livestock feed prices through the roof. Also at stake in \nAlabama are dairy, beef cattle, and hog producers who will be forced to \npay higher prices for their feed. This increasing cost of production \ndoes not stop with the producers. Consumers will shortly feel the \neffect of the failure to pass a farm bill in the form of much higher \nbeef, poultry, pork, and fish prices at the supermarket. These examples \ndo not even address the effects that the 1949 act and parity prices \nwill have on the Federal Treasury. As a result, I do not support this \ncourse of action, despite its very real possibility given Secretary of \nAgriculture hands being tied.\n  The second option that we have before us, is to pass a stand-alone \nfarm bill. I am still puzzled as to why we did not pursue this course \nof action this time last year, rather than allowing farm policy to \nbecome embroiled in the budget reconciliation bill. I, along with my \nDemocratic colleagues have sent a letter to the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, requesting that farm policy come to the floor and be \ndebated on its own merits so that we can pass a farm bill without \ngetting caught in the web of budget politics. I have long stated that I \nbelieve that the current structure of farm programs have served rural \nAmerica, and consumers everywhere, extremely well. Therefore, it is my \nbelief that farm programs should only be fined tuned. I do recognize \nthat some of my less fortunate regional colleagues feel that farm \nprograms that effect their States need greater changes than those that \neffect the South. The ability to resolve these differences is the \npurpose of debate on farm programs, which to this point there has been \nvery little in committee, and virtually none by the full Senate. \nTherefore, I recommend that we return to committee and discuss the farm \nbill as we always have in the past. We would then be able to bring a \nbill to the floor that addresses all of our needs and concerns, and \npass a bill that serves our agricultural producers, rural America, and \nconsumers alike.\n  The budget reconciliation bill contained agriculture provisions. \nHowever, the provisions contained in the reconciliation bill were never \ndebated in committee, were not passed as part of the Senate \nreconciliation bill, but instead were approved in conference. \nFurthermore, the provisions known as freedom to farm, that ultimately \nended up in the reconciliation bill, were defeated in the House \nAgriculture Committee.\n  I believe that the provisions of the so-called freedom to farm bill \nare seriously flawed. The freedom to farm bill makes guaranteed \npayments to farmers whether they produce a crop or not. The freedom to \nfarm bill offers producers a bonus check in times of high market \nprices, and then is not sufficient in times of low market prices. It is \nunconscionable to make payments to producers in times of high market \nprices, such as we are currently experiencing, when at the same time, \nwe are reducing school lunches and other essential nutrition programs. \nEssentially, the freedom to farm bill as a phase-out of farm programs. \nBy repealing the permanent authority for farm programs, the freedom to \nfarm bill ends all farm programs after 7 years.\n  I strongly believe that the core component of sound farm policy \nshould be an adequate and certain safety net, one that provides support \nwhen market prices are low, and one that does not need to make payments \nwhen the market is up. This is how current farm programs are \nstructured, and they work. For evidence of this, we need look no \nfurther than the recent CBO adjustment of its agriculture baseline. The \nCBO, after analyzing what they believe to be the future trend in \nagriculture prices, has determined that they expect commodity prices to \nremain high for at the least the next few years. As a result, the CBO \nhas adjusted its baseline downward by $8 billion. I believe that this \nis evidence that farm programs work as they are designed to: provide \nsupport at times of need, and no support when it is not warranted.\n  Therefore, while there may be an effort to resurrect the freedom to \nfarm bill, I believe the policy contained within is inherently flawed. \nHowever, a full and open debate on farm policy will allow us to debate, \nconsider and resolve these outstanding issues pertaining to the farm \nbill. This is the course of action that I strongly support.\n  To this point in time, however, we have not been allowed to debate \nfarm policy. Yet, farmers do not stop when the Government shuts down; \nthey rely more heavily on Mother Nature's timetables than they do \nCongress' continuing resolutions. However, despite the failure to pass \na farm bill, farmers must continue to prepare for the upcoming planting \nseason. Farmers, bankers, and other support industry such as fertilizer \nand seed suppliers, farm implement dealers, and processors must have \nsome certainty as to the laws that they will be farming under.\n  In the event that we are not allowed to consider and implement a farm \nbill this year, and time is quickly running out, I then support the \nthird course of action that Congress has before it: a 1-year extension \nof current farm policy. Extending farm programs for a period of 1 year \nwill give rural America the much needed certainty that it deserves and \nallow time for Congress to act responsibly and write a farm bill this \nyear. It is the responsibility of this Congress to let America's \nagriculture producers know what the program is for 1996, and we must \nnot delay action.\n  Cotton and peanut producers in my State of Alabama can take comfort \nin knowing that they will not be held hostage to the ongoing budget \nnegotiations and Government shutdowns. The cotton and peanut programs \nwere extended for the 1996 and 1997 crops. While I support some fine-\ntuning of these programs, these commodity programs will work \nessentially the same as they have over the past 5 years. This is \ncertainty that producers can take to the bank. Now, all producers \nshould quickly be given the same measure of certainty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S332-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S333-S334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to visit about the agricultural \nissue, but I have two friends from agricultural States and members of \nthe Agriculture Committee on the other side of the aisle. I am not here \nto counteract anything they have said. I want to make that very clear. \nI want to make it clear, though, that while there is from the other \nside of the aisle admonitions of what we ought to do to solve the \nagricultural bill problem that we have before us, there are other \napproaches that ought to be used.\n  I am here to advocate a position that is not favored on the other \nside of the aisle. I will also bring to the attention of the \nagricultural community, who is concerned about this issue, that \nyesterday the majority party of the U.S. Senate offered a unanimous-\nconsent motion to bring up the very provisions that were in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995, which the President vetoed, and if he had \nnot vetoed that, we would not have any commodity policy problems for \nthis Congress to settle for the next 7 years. We would not be here \ntoday talking about what ought to be done for the 1996 crop year as we \nget up to the very planting deadlines that are so close and are \nprobably already in place in the State of Alabama and other areas of \nthe South. \n\n[[Page S334]]\n\n\n  Every farmer of the United States would know what the policy for the \nnext 7 years would be if the President had not vetoed that bill. Every \nfarmer would know the amount of money that would be spent on \nagriculture from the U.S. Treasury over the next 7 years--that would be \n$43.5 billion--with $6 billion being spent in 1996. Without this \nlegislation this money will not be spent and if the proposals from the \nother side of the aisle were adopted, there would not be $6 million \ngoing into agriculture in 1996. So the certainty of the money going \nthere, it seems to me, ought to be pretty enticing to everybody on the \nother side of the aisle to back our proposal, plus the fact that there \nwould be certainty in agriculture policy for the next 7 years.\n  Somewhat unrelated to the immediate problem we have before us but \ndirectly related to the fact that the other side is, in a sense, \nrejecting $6 billion going into agriculture in 1996 and rejecting the \nproposal of this side of the certainty of $43.5 billion going into \nagriculture over the next 7 years is the fact that--this may not apply \nto my three friends who are sitting over there from agriculture states, \nthere are some prominent people on the other side of the aisle who have \nvoted against past farm bills because they did not put enough money \ninto agriculture. I am speaking specifically of the 1990 farm bill and \nthe 1985 farm bill.\n  How ironic that those very same people are going to oppose what we \nare trying to do because somehow it puts too much money into \nagriculture this crop year. Is that not ironic. People on the other \nside of the aisle who voted against the 1990 farm bill, the 1985 farm \nbill because it did not put enough money into agriculture, are \nobjecting to Republican efforts that has a farm bill that would put $6 \nbillion into agriculture and a certainty of $43.5 billion over the next \n7 years. And $43.5 billion might sound like a lot of money. But it is \nless than half what has been spent on agriculture in recent years. The \nfarm bill is about the only program in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 \nthat actually was cut. Most of the other programs in that Balanced \nBudget Act were slowing the rate of growth.\n  I want to move on and say it would have also given--what we proposed \nto do yesterday, and the very same thing that the President vetoed in \nDecember would have set a policy that every farmer in America would \nhave the opportunity to plant according to the marketplace, not \naccording to policy decisions made in Washington. Furthermore, every \nacre would be planted. I think that is a sound agricultural policy, and \nit was rejected by the other side yesterday.\n  When we are up to these planting deadlines you may not get exactly \nwhat you want, I may not get exactly what I want, but let me say this: \nEvery major farm organization in the United States supports the Freedom \nTo Farm Act. Every major commodity group in the United States supports \nwhat was in that bill. Yet there are some who would take the view that \nat this last minute that is not good enough for them. Or in some cases, \nironically, it might be too much. But what is ironic about that, some \nof the very same people said in past years we were not doing enough for \nagriculture.\n  I will yield the floor, although I hope we can have some more \ndiscussion on this if the people want to discuss it. I think it is such \nan important issue that we have to proceed and we have to reach an \nagreement on this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S333-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S334-S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SUMMARY OF EVENTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

The Senator from Idaho brought a \nbill to the floor by unanimous consent to take the so-called Freedom To \nFarm Act out of the budget reconciliation bill and deem it passed by \nitself on the floor. I objected to that.\n  I then offered a unanimous-consent request on the floor to take the \npiece of legislation I had introduced extending the current farm \nprogram for 1 year. It would also provide enormous planting flexibility \nso farmers can plant any crop within their base acres, and provide some \nforgiveness of the advance deficiency agreement. And, the majority \nparty objected to that.\n  Then the majority party, by the Senator from Idaho, offered a \nunanimous-consent request to abolish the 1949 Permanent Farm Act. I do \nnot understand why the majority party would put itself in a position of \ncoming to the floor of the Senate to say ``We would like to go on \nrecord saying we want no farm policy.'' I puzzled over that last \nevening, wondering why would the majority party be out here with that \nmessage? Why would they say, ``If we cannot get the Freedom To Farm \nAct, we want nothing. We want to abolish the 1949 act.''\n  Then I offered a second unanimous-consent request in which I said, \n``Well, if you do not agree with extending the program for one year \nwith the other provisions I included, then would you at least agree \nwith forgiving the advance deficiency payments, because you said you \nagreed with that. I will make a unanimous-consent request that we bring \nthat up and deem that to have passed.'' The majority party objected to \nthat. So that is what happened yesterday.\n  This is not just a chapter. This is a novel. One has to read all the \nchapters to understand the story line of this novel. This is not, \nhowever, entertainment reading for farmers in our country.\n  We are at the end of January. Congress has a responsibility to have a \nfarm program and we do not have one. Some might say, ``Well, you do not \nhave one because you would not swallow what we tried to shove down \nsomebody's throat.'' I heard from others yesterday, ``Well, gee, nobody \ntried to shove anything down anybody's throat.''\n  The Senator from Alabama is on the committee. There was not a markup \nin which there was full discussion. We should have all reasoned \ntogether in a bipartisan way the way we have always done it on a 5-year \nfarm bill. There was none of that.\n  There was not a bipartisan approach to a farm bill. It was, ``Here it \nis, swallow it or leave it. And, by the way, we will put it into the \nbudget reconciliation bill for the first time in history.'' We have \nnever done that before. The strategy was, ``That is where we will put \nit and we know the President will veto the bill. Then after he vetoes \nit we will feign surprise that we do not have a farm policy.''\n  I am puzzled. We must on every day in every way decide to give \nfarmers an answer. What will the policy be? We must find a way to agree \non common elements. I think there are areas where we have common \nagreement. We agree with substantial flexibility. We agree on that. \nThere are a number of areas we agree. Forgiveness on some of the \nadvance deficiencies.\n  Farmers do not have the luxury of saying, ``It is spring. The sun is \nshining. We have just had some rain but I decided to defer my planting \nuntil July.''\n  Congress ought not have the luxury of deciding it can wait until \nFriday, the next Friday, or the next spring to decide what the farm \npolicy ought to be. If farmers do not have the luxury not to plant or \nharvest, we ought not have the luxury to decide not to give farmers an \nanswer of what the farm policy ought to be in this country.\n  We have a responsibility to pass a 5-year farm plan. It has not been \ndone. Somebody said, ``Well, but we did it.'' Yes, it was stuck into a \nreconciliation bill. But, the fact is it did not get passed. Everybody \nknew it would not get signed by the President and so we are left with \nnothing.\n  It seems to me we have a responsibility now to make something out of \nthis mess. All of us from farm country need to come together here. This \nis not a joke or a laughing matter or amusing to any farmer in this \ncountry. They want to know under what conditions will they plant this \nspring.\n  Farmers face twin risks of planting a seed, not knowing whether it \nwill grow, and then, if it grows, not knowing whether there will be a \nprice at the marketplace. Family size farms wash away when \ninternational prices go down and stay down. That is why we have a \nsafety net. That safety net is what we should be debating here in this \nCongress. Farmers deserve an answer, and we are going to keep pushing \nday after day to give them an answer. \n\n[[Page S335]]\n\n  Let me comment on the $6 billion my colleague mentioned. It is simply \nnot the case that people over here say we do not want to spend enough \non agriculture. That is not the case. My colleague knows that is not \nthe case. The fact is, we are not debating the baseline for the 7-year \nperiod on agriculture. If we were debating that, the debate on the \nbaseline is that the majority party's budget cut far more than twice as \nmuch from the baseline than the budget cuts that we had offered. If we \nare going to debate baselines, that is what we ought to debate. And I \nwould be glad to do that, but I also want to go on to another brief \nsubject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S334-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A WAY TO BALANCE THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was very heartened a few minutes ago by \nthe discussion of the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott, in which \nhe talked about something that a number of us had advocated and the \nPresident advocated last evening.\n  In fact, Senator Exon and I were in a press conference about a week \nor so ago. At that time we said one idea about resolving the budget \nissue is to package up each side's offer, take the lower spending cut \non each of the offers. When you add all that up you reach $711 billion \nin spending cuts and you reach savings sufficient so you can balance \nthe budget. Why do we not do that?\n  The President came to the floor of the Chamber of the House last \nevening and said let us do that. Let us at least do that. We can just \ntake the lower of the two offers from the Republicans and the \nDemocrats. We can take the lower in each spending category of the two \noffers of saving money in every category. Then you have $711 billion, \nwhich is sufficient to balance the budget.\n  What I heard this morning is that the Speaker of the House suggested \nthat might be a good thing. Senator Lott indicated that makes a lot of \nsense. If we are moving in that direction, I am enormously heartened by \nthat. It is a way to move towards a balanced budget, do it with the \nright priorities and do it in the right way.\n  If we can do that, we can solve the problems of the CR, the debt \nlimit. We can have a clean appropriations extension, pass a clean debt \nlimit and agree on taking $711 billion of savings. As a result we can \nbalance this Federal budget. Then we will have done something, I think, \nof substantial good for this country.\n  So I would just say that I feel heartened by at least the little \nsnippets I have heard today, first on television this morning by the \nSpeaker, and next in a discussion by Senator Lott. Maybe there is a \nformula here for breaking this gridlock and actually reaching results \nwith respect to a 7-year balanced budget plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are in morning business as I understand \nit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business expired at 5:30, but the \nSenator may request to proceed under morning business.\n  Mr. EXON. Has time been limited for Senators in morning business when \nwe were in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We had been under a 5-minute guideline.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask I may be allowed to proceed under the \nsame rules for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S335-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, there are two things I want to talk about. \nFirst, I have heard some of the discussion with regard to farm policy \nby some of my closest friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle \ntoday. It is a pretty sad situation when I see that the usual farm \ncoalition between Democrats and Republicans is obviously breaking down. \nI think it is a tragedy of major proportions.\n  I would simply say, there are those of us who feel we should stay in \nsession for lots of reasons, not the least of which is to pass a farm \nbill. If we cannot come to some kind of an agreement, I hope the \nmajority leader will simply call up the farm bill for discussion, \ndebate it on the floor of the U.S. Senate, pass something, and send it \nto the President and see if he will sign it.\n  The President, I might add, has been very supportive of the position \nfor funding of agriculture that this Senator, as the lead Democrat on \nthe Budget Committee, has been for a long, long time. We have a profarm \nadvocate sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the President of the \nUnited States of America. We should continue to build and work with \nhim.\n  The various moves that have been made with regard to the Freedom To \nFarm Act that I do not agree with I will not vote for. I will simply \ncorrect something I thought I heard, that all major farm organizations \nhave supported the Freedom To Farm Act. The Farmers Union is a major \nfarm organization in the State of Nebraska. The Farmers Union is not \nonly against the Freedom To Farm Act, it thinks it is folly.\n  I would say to all of my colleagues, this Senator yesterday had \nprinted in the Record some true facts with regard to how far down the \nwelfare road we are going under the Freedom To Farm Act. In summarizing \nwhat I put in the Record yesterday on page S 321 under Exhibit 1, for a \n500-acre farm, 120 bushels to the acre in corn yield, the present cash \nprice is in the vicinity of $3.10. That would be $186,000 gross--not \nnet, gross--that the farmer would receive.\n  On top of that, under the Freedom To Farm Act, there is a welfare \npayment that goes to corn farmers. I think, when all the corn farmers \nfound out about this, and especially when the public found out about \nit, there would be a revolution, and the Freedom To Farm Act would fall \nby the wayside, because, in the example that I have just given, a \nfarmer would receive a check from the Federal Government for 1996 of \n$16,200 on top of the $186,000 gross that he got from his crop.\n  That might not be so bad. You might argue that is still a good thing, \nat $3.10 a bushel for corn. But most people in and outside the business \nrecognize that $3.10 a bushel for corn is a pretty good price and one \nwe can be satisfied with. The point is, if it were $5 a bushel or $7 a \nbushel, which I do not think it will ever go to, but whatever the price \nof corn would be under the Freedom To Farm Act, this typical farmer, \nand every farmer who is in a similar situation, which is typical, would \nreceive a check from the Government regardless of the price of corn in \nthe marketplace. That is welfare. That is an excessive amount of money.\n  I am for freedom-to-farm principles, giving them the decisions they \ncan make out there on the farm. I am for simplifying. But I simply say \nthere is a fault here in the Freedom To Farm Act that is a giveaway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S335-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DO NOT RECESS THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I wanted to make just a few comments, if I \nmight, with regard to what I consider to be a very ill-advised move, \nand that is the consideration that maybe, after Friday, we are going to \nrecess the U.S. Senate, right in the middle of very important \nnegotiations. I would simply say, Mr. President, we should stay here, \nwork on the farm bill, work on the debt ceiling, work on the budget, \nand come up with a compromise. Certainly I, too, was pleased with the \nPresident's address last night and the acceptance, generally, as I \nunderstand it, of Speaker Gingrich and leading Republicans in the U.S. \nSenate that says to take this $711 billion and balance the budget in 7 \nyears, with CBO scoring, which we have all been for.\n  We cannot do those things, we cannot solve the crisis in the debt \nceiling, by leaving here and not coming back until 2 or 3 days before \nwe would have default. I hope, and I appeal, for both the House and the \nSenate to remain in session and do our work, especially at this \ncritical time with regard to the farm bill and the other important \nmatters that we have on our plate.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S335-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S335-S338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BODY ON NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last November, the British and Irish \nGovernments acted jointly to create an innovative three-member \ncommittee, \n\n[[Page S336]]\ncalled the International Body, to assess an extremely difficult issue \nthat had become a serious obstacle to the peace process in Northern \nIreland--how to remove all arms from Irish politics.\n  Our former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, agreed to serve as \nchairman of the International Body, and he was joined by two other \ndistinguished international leaders, Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada \nand former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri of Finland.\n  The International Body issued its report earlier today, and I welcome \nit as a reasonable way forward for all sides in Northern Ireland. I \nhope all sides will make the fair and modest concessions needed to \nenable the peace process to move ahead.\n  I commend Senator Mitchell, General de Chastelain, and Prime Minister \nHolkeri for their sensible approach to the difficult problem of \ndecommissioning weapons. The International Body did its work well. \nReasonable people who genuinely want peace have a priceless opportunity \nnow to make the kind of progress needed to end the current impasse. It \nis time for all-party talks to begin.\n  I believe that all of us in Congress concerned about Northern Ireland \nwill find this report of great interest, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           Report of the International Body, January 22, 1996\n\n    (By George J. Mitchell, Chairman, John de Chastelain, and Harri \n                                Holkeri)\n\n\n                            i. introduction\n\n       1. On 28 November 1995, the British and Irish Governments \n     issued a Communique which announced the launching in Northern \n     Ireland of a `` `twin track' process to make progress in \n     parallel on the decommissioning issue and on all-party \n     negotiations.''\n       2. One track was ``to invite the parties to intensive \n     preparatory talks with a remit to reach widespread agreement \n     on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda to \n     bring all parties together for substantive negotiations aimed \n     at a political settlement based on consent.'' This has become \n     known as the political track.\n       3. The other track concerned the decommissioning of arms \n     and was set forth as follows in the Communique:\n       ``5. In parallel, the two Governments have agreed to \n     establish an International Body to provide an independent \n     assessment of the decommissioning issue.\n       ``6. Recognising the widely expressed desire to see all \n     arms removed from Irish politics, the two Governments will \n     ask the International Body to report on the arrangements \n     necessary for the removal from the political equation of arms \n     silenced by virtue of the welcome decisions taken last Summer \n     and Autumn by those organisations that previously supported \n     the use of arms for political purposes.\n       ``7. In particular, the two Governments will ask the Body \n     to:\n       --identify and advise on a suitable and acceptable method \n     for full and verifiable decommissioning; and\n       --report whether there is a clear commitment on the part of \n     those in possession of such arms to work constructively to \n     achieve that.\n       ``8. It will be for the International Body to determine its \n     own procedures. The two Governments expect it to consult \n     widely, to invite relevant parties to submit their analysis \n     of matters relevant to the decommissioning issue and, in \n     reaching its conclusions within its remit, to consider such \n     evidence on its merits.''\n       4. We are that Body. This is our report. We have no stake \n     in Northern Ireland other than an interest in seeing an end \n     of the conflict and in the ability of its people to live in \n     peace. Our role is to bring an independent perspective to the \n     issue. We are motivated solely by our wish to help. This \n     assessment represents our best and our independent judgement. \n     We are unanimous in our views. There are no differences of \n     opinion among us.\n       5. To provide us with sufficient information to meet our \n     remit, we held two series of meetings in Belfast, Dublin and \n     London: the first, 15 through 18 December 1995; the second, \n     11 through 22 January 1996. In addition, we held an \n     organisational meeting in New York on 9 December 1995.\n       6. In the course of our meetings we heard orally and in \n     writing from dozens of government officials, political \n     leaders, church officials and representatives of other \n     organizations and institutions. We received hundreds of \n     letters and telephone calls from members of the public and \n     met with many others. We thank all for their submissions. \n     Contributions from those who suffered losses during the time \n     of troubles but are strongly committed to the peace process \n     were especially moving. All the submissions have been \n     carefully reviewed and considered.\n\n\n                             II. DISCUSSION\n\n       7. Our examination of the issues and of the facts, and the \n     perspectives brought to us by those who briefed us or who \n     made written representations to us, convince us that while \n     there is no simple solution to the conflict in Northern \n     Ireland, the factors on which a process for peace must be \n     based are already known. We can indicate the way we believe \n     these factors should be addressed so that decommissioning of \n     arms and all-party negotiations can proceed, but only \n     resolute action by the parties themselves will produce \n     progress.\n       8. That noted, we are aware of the enormous contribution \n     already made by individuals and groups in advancing the \n     process of peace in Northern Ireland to its current stage. \n     The tireless and courageous efforts of Prime Minister John \n     Major and Taoiseach John Bruton (and before him Albert \n     Reynolds) have been essential to the peace process. They have \n     been joined by other political leaders, institutions, \n     organisations and individuals in the promotion of peace.\n       9. We consider our task in the light of our responsibility \n     to all of the people of Northern Ireland; the need for the \n     people to be reassured that their democratic and moral \n     expectations can be realised; and in the spirit of serious \n     efforts made by the British and Irish Governments to advance \n     the peace process.\n       10. For nearly a year and a half, the guns have been silent \n     in Northern Ireland. The people want that silence to \n     continue. They want lasting peace in a just society in which \n     paramilitary violence plays no part. That was the dominant \n     theme expressed in the many letters and calls we received \n     from those in the North and South, Unionist and Nationalist, \n     Catholic and Protestant, Loyalist and Republican.\n       11. Notwithstanding reprehensible ``punishment'' killings \n     and beatings, the sustained observance of the cease-fires \n     should not be devalued. It is a significant factor which must \n     be given due weight in assessing the commitment of the \n     paramilitaries to ``work constructively to achieve'' full and \n     verifiable decommissioning.\n       12. Since the cease-fires, the political debate has focused \n     largely on the differences that have prevented the \n     commencement of all-party negotiations intended to achieve an \n     agreed political settlement. This circumstance has obscured \n     the widespread agreement that exists--so widespread that it \n     tends to be taken for granted. In fact, members of both \n     traditions may be less far apart on the resolution of their \n     differences than they believe.\n       13. No one should underestimate the value of the consensus \n     for peace, and the fact that no significant group is actively \n     seeking to end it.\n       14. In paragraph five of the Communique we were asked ``to \n     provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning \n     issue.'' It is a serious issue. It is also a symptom of a \n     larger problem; the absence of trust. Common to many of our \n     meetings were arguments, steeped in history, as to why the \n     other side cannot be trusted. As a consequence, even well-\n     intentioned acts are often viewed with suspicion and \n     hostility.\n       15. But a resolution of the decommissioning issue--or any \n     other issue--will not be found if the parties resort to their \n     vast inventories of historical recrimination. Or, as it was \n     put to us several times, what is really needed is the \n     decommissioning of mind-sets in Northern Ireland.\n       16. We have asked ourselves how those who have suffered \n     during the many years of internal strife can accept the fact \n     that the establishment of a lasting peace will call for \n     reconciliation with those they hold responsible for their \n     loss and pain. Surely the continued suffering and bereavement \n     of individuals and of families should never be forgotten. But \n     if the focus remains on the past, the past will become the \n     future, and that is something no one can desire.\n       17. Everyone with whom we spoke agrees in principle with \n     the need to decommission. There are differences on the timing \n     and context--indeed, those differences led to the creation of \n     this Body--but they should not obscure the nearly universal \n     support which exists for the total and verifiable disarmament \n     of all paramilitary organizations. That must continue to be a \n     principal objective.\n       18. However the issue of decommissioning is resolved, that \n     alone will not lead directly to all-party negotiations. Much \n     work remains on the many issues involved in the political \n     track. The parties should address those issues with urgency.\n\n\n     iii. recommendations: principles of democracy and non-violence\n\n       19. To reach an agreed political settlement and to take the \n     gun out of Irish politics, there must be commitment and \n     adherence to fundamental principles of democracy and non-\n     violence. Participants in all-party negotiations should \n     affirm their commitment to such principles.\n       20. Accordingly, we recommend that the parties to such \n     negotiations affirm their total and absolute commitment:\n       a. To democratic and exclusively peaceful means of \n     resolving political issues;\n       b. To the total disarmament of all paramilitary \n     organizations;\n       c. To agree that such disarmament must be verifiable to the \n     satisfaction of an independent commission;\n       d. To renounce for themselves, and to oppose any effort by \n     others, to use force, or threaten to use force, to influence \n     the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations;\n       e. To agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached \n     in all-party negotiations \n\n[[Page S337]]\n     and to resort to democratic and exclusively peaceful methods in trying \n     to alter any aspect of that outcome with which they may \n     disagree; and\n       f. To urge that ``punishment'' killings and beatings stop \n     and to take effective steps to prevent such actions.\n       21. We join the Governments, religious leaders and many \n     others in condemning ``punishment'' killings and beatings. \n     They contribute to the fear that those who have used violence \n     to pursue political objectives in the past will do so again \n     in the future. Such actions have no place in a lawful \n     society.\n       22. Those who demand decommissioning prior to all-party \n     negotiations do so out of concern that the paramilitaries \n     will use force, or threaten to use force, to influence the \n     negotiations, or to change any aspect of the outcome of \n     negotiations with which they disagree. Given the history of \n     Northern Ireland, this is not an unreasonable concern. The \n     principles we recommend address those concerns directly.\n       23. These commitments, when made and honoured, would remove \n     the threat of force before, during and after all-party \n     negotiations. They would focus all concerned on what is \n     ultimately essential if the gun is to be taken out of Irish \n     politics: an agreed political settlement and the total and \n     verifiable disarmament of all paramilitary organisations. \n     That should encourage the belief that the peace process will \n     truly be an exercise in democracy, not one influenced by the \n     threat of violence.\n\n\n                   iv. commitment to decommissioning\n\n       24. The second of the specific questions in paragraph seven \n     of the Communique asks us ``to report whether there is a \n     clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such \n     arms to work constructively to achieve'' full and verifiable \n     decommissioning.\n       25. We have concluded that there is a clear commitment on \n     the part of those in possession of such arms to work \n     constructively to achieve full and verifiable decommissioning \n     as part of the process of all-party negotiations; but that \n     commitment does not include decommissioning prior to such \n     negotiations.\n       26. After careful consideration, on the basis of intensive \n     discussions with the Governments, the political parties, \n     religious leaders, the security forces, and many others, we \n     have concluded that the paramilitary organisations will not \n     decommission any arms prior to all-party negotiations. That \n     was the unanimous and emphatically expressed view of the \n     representatives of the political parties close to \n     paramilitary organisations on both sides. It was also the \n     view of the vast majority of the organisations and \n     individuals who made oral and written submissions. It is not \n     that they are all opposed to prior decommissioning. To the \n     contrary, many favour it. But they are convinced that it will \n     not happen. That is the reality with which all concerned must \n     deal.\n       27. Competing views were advanced on prior decommissioning. \n     One was that decommissioning of arms must occur prior to all-\n     party negotiations. We were told that the clearest \n     demonstration of adherence to democratic principles, and of a \n     permanent end to the use of violence, is the safe removal and \n     disposal of paramilitary arms, and that at this time only a \n     start to decommissioning will provide the confidence \n     necessary for all-party negotiations to commence. In this \n     view, all parties were aware of the need for prior \n     decommissioning before the cease-fires were announced and \n     should not now be able to avoid that requirement.\n       28. In the competing view we were told that decommissioning \n     of arms prior to all-party negotiations was not requested \n     before the announcement of the cease-fires, and that had it \n     been, there would have been no cease-fires; that those who \n     entered into cease-fires did so in the belief they would lead \n     immediately to all-party negotiations; and that the request \n     for prior decommissioning, seriously pursued for the first \n     time months after the cease-fires were declared, is merely a \n     tactic to delay or deny such negotiations. In this view, the \n     cease-fires having been maintained for nearly a year and a \n     half, all-party negotiations should begin immediately with no \n     further requirements.\n       29. We believe that each side of this argument reflects a \n     core of reasonable concern which deserves to be understood \n     and addressed by the other side.\n       30. Those who insist on prior decommissioning need to be \n     reassured that the commitment to peaceful and democratic \n     means by those formerly supportive of politically motivated \n     violence is genuine and irreversible, and that the threat or \n     use of such violence will not be invoked to influence the \n     process of negotiations or to change any agreed settlement.\n       31. Those who have been persuaded to abandon violence for \n     the peaceful political path need to be reassured that a \n     meaningful and inclusive process of negotiation is genuinely \n     being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their \n     traditions and the need for new political arrangements with \n     which all can identify.\n       32. Clearly, new approaches must be explored to overcome \n     this impasse. That is the purpose of the six principles we \n     recommend. They invoke a comprehensive commitment to \n     democracy and non-violence that is intended to reassure all \n     parties to the negotiations.\n\n\n            v. decommissioning during all-party negotiations\n\n       33. One side has insisted that some decommissioning of arms \n     must take place before all-party negotiations can begin. The \n     other side has insisted that no decommissioning can take \n     place until the end of the process, after an agreed \n     settlement has been reached. This has resulted in the current \n     impasse.\n       34. The parties should consider an approach under which \n     some decommissioning would take place during the process of \n     all-party negotiations, rather than before or after as the \n     parties now urge. Such an approach represents a compromise. \n     If the peace process is to move forward, the current impasse \n     must be overcome. While both sides have been adamant in their \n     positions, both have repeatedly expressed the desire to \n     move forward. This approach provides them that \n     opportunity.\n       35. In addition, it offers the parties an opportunity to \n     use the process of decommissioning to build confidence one \n     step at a time during negotiations. As progress is made on \n     political issues, even modest mutual steps on decommissioning \n     could help create the atmosphere needed for further steps in \n     a progressive pattern of mounting trust and confidence.\n\n\n  VI. RECOMMENDATIONS: GUIDELINES ON THE MODALITIES OF DECOMMISSIONING\n\n       36. The first of the specific questions in paragraph seven \n     of the Communique asks us ``to identify and advise on a \n     suitable and acceptable method for full and verifiable \n     decommissioning.''\n       37. We recommend the following guidelines on the modalities \n     of decommissioning. These recommendations are realistic in \n     light of the nature and scale of the arsenals in question, \n     estimates of which were provided to us by the Governments and \n     their security forces. We believe these estimates to be \n     accurate.\n       38. Decommissioning should receive a high priority in all-\n     party negotiations. The details of decommissioning, including \n     supporting confidence-building measures, timing and \n     sequencing, have to be determined by the parties themselves.\n       The decommissioning process should suggest neither victory \n     nor defeat.\n       39. The cease-fires and the peace process are products not \n     of surrender but rather of a willingness to address \n     differences through political means. This essential fact \n     should be reflected clearly in the modalities of the \n     decommissioning process, which should not require that any \n     party be seen to surrender.\n       The decommissioning process should take place to the \n     satisfaction of an independent commission.\n       40. The decommissioning process should take place to the \n     satisfaction of an independent commission acceptable to all \n     parties. The commission would be appointed by the British and \n     Irish Governments on the basis of consultations with the \n     other parties to the negotiating process.\n       41. The commission should be able to operate independently \n     in both jurisdictions, and should enjoy appropriate legal \n     status and immunity.\n       42. In addition to having available to it independent \n     sources of legal and technical advice and adequate field \n     resources to receive and audit armaments and to observe and \n     verify the decommissioning process, the commission should be \n     able to call upon the resources and the relevant technical \n     expertise of the British and Irish Armies, when it is \n     appropriate.\n       The decommissioning process should result in the complete \n     destruction of armaments in a manner that contributes to \n     public safety.\n       43. The decommissioning process should result in the \n     complete destruction of the armaments. Procedures for \n     destruction would include the cutting up or chipping of small \n     arms and other weapons, the controlled explosion of \n     ammunition and explosives, and other forms of conventional \n     munitions disposal.\n       44. The decommissioning process could encompass a variety \n     of methods, subject to negotiation, including:\n       The transfer of armaments to the commission or to the \n     designated representatives of either Government, for \n     subsequent destruction;\n       The provision of information to the commission or to \n     designated representatives of either Government, leading to \n     the discovery of armaments for subsequent destruction; and,\n       The depositing of armaments for collection and subsequent \n     destruction, by the commission or by representatives of \n     either Government.\n       Parties should also have the option of destroying their \n     weapons themselves.\n       45. Priority should be accorded throughout to ensuring that \n     armaments are safely handled and stored, and are not \n     misappropriated.\n       The decommissioning process should be fully verifiable.\n       46. Whatever the options chosen for the destruction of \n     armaments, including the destruction of weapons by the \n     parties themselves, verification must occur to the \n     satisfaction of the commission.\n       47. The commission would record information required to \n     monitor the process effectively. The commission should have \n     available to it the relevant data of the Garda Siochana and \n     the Royal Ulster Constabulary. It would report periodically \n     to relevant parties on progress achieved in the \n     decommissioning process.\n       The decommissioning process should not expose individuals \n     to prosecution.\n       48. Individuals involved in the decommissioning process \n     should not be prosecuted for \n\n[[Page S338]]\n     the possession of those armaments; amnesties should be established in \n     law in both jurisdictions. Armaments made available for \n     decommissioning, whether directly or indirectly, should be \n     exempt under law from forensic examination, and information \n     obtained as a result of the decommissioning process should be \n     inadmissible as evidence in courts of law in either \n     jurisdiction.\n       49. Groups in possession of illegal armaments should be \n     free to organise their participation in the decommissioning \n     process as they judge appropriate, e.g. groups may designate \n     particular individuals to deposit armaments on their behalf.\n       The decommissioning process should be mutual.\n       50. Decommissioning would take place on the basis of the \n     mutual commitment and participation of the paramilitary \n     organisations. This offers the parties another opportunity to \n     use the process of decommissioning to build confidence one \n     step at a time during negotiations.\n\n\n                    vii. further confidence-building\n\n       51. It is important for all participants to take steps to \n     build confidence throughout the peace process. In the course \n     of our discussions, many urged that certain actions other \n     than decommissioning be taken to build confidence. We make no \n     recommendations on them since they are outside our remit, but \n     we believe it appropriate to comment on some since success in \n     the peace process cannot be achieved solely by reference to \n     the decommissioning of arms.\n       52. Support for the use of violence is incompatible with \n     participation in the democratic process. The early \n     termination of paramilitary activities, including \n     surveillance and targeting, would demonstrate a commitment to \n     peaceful methods and so build trust among other parties and \n     alleviate the fears and anxieties of the general population. \n     So, too, would the provision of information on the status of \n     missing persons, and the return of those who have been forced \n     to leave their communities under threat.\n       53. Continued action by the Governments on prisoners would \n     bolster trust. So would early implementation of the proposed \n     review of emergency legislation, consistent with the evolving \n     security situation.\n       54. Different views were expressed as to the weapons to be \n     decommissioned. In the Communique, the Governments made clear \n     their view that our remit is limited to those weapons held by \n     paramilitary organisations. We accept and share that view. \n     There is no equivalence between such weapons and those held \n     by security forces. However, in the context of building \n     mutual confidence, we welcome the commitment of the \n     Governments, as stated in paragraph nine of the Communique, \n     ``to continue to take responsive measures, advised by their \n     respective security authorities, as the threat reduces.''\n       55. We share the hope, expressed by many on all sides, that \n     policing in Northern Ireland can be normalised as soon as the \n     security situation permits. A review of the situation with \n     respect to legally registered weapons and the use of plastic \n     bullets, and continued progress toward more balanced \n     representation in the police force would contribute to the \n     building of trust.\n       56. Several oral and written submissions raised the idea of \n     an elected body. We note the reference in paragraph three of \n     the Communique to ``whether and how an elected body could \n     play a part.'' Elections held in accordance with democratic \n     principles express and reflect the popular will. If it were \n     broadly acceptable, with an appropriate mandate, and within \n     the three-strand structure, an elective process could \n     contribute to the building of confidence.\n       57. Finally, the importance of further progress in the \n     social and economic development of Northern Ireland and its \n     communities was emphasised time and again in our meetings, in \n     the context of building confidence and establishing a lasting \n     peace.\n\n\n                        viii. concluding remarks\n\n       58. Last week we stood in Belfast and looked at a thirty \n     foot high wall and at barriers topped with iron and barbed \n     wire. The wall, which has ironically come to be known as the \n     ``peace line,'' is a tangible symbol of the division of the \n     people of Northern Ireland into two hostile communities. To \n     the outsider both are warm and generous. Between themselves \n     they are fearful and antagonistic.\n       59. Yet, it is now clear beyond doubt that the vast \n     majority of the people of both traditions want to turn away \n     from the bitter past. There is a powerful desire for peace in \n     Northern Ireland. It is that desire which creates the present \n     opportunity.\n       60. This is critical time in the history of Northern \n     Ireland. The peace process will move forward or this society \n     could slip back to the horror of the past quarter century.\n       61. Rigid adherence by the parties to their past positions \n     will simply continue the stalemate which has already lasted \n     too long. In a society as deeply divided as Northern Ireland, \n     reaching across the ``peace line'' requires a willingness to \n     take risks for peace.\n       62. The risk may seem high but the reward is great: a \n     future of peace, equality and prosperity for all the people \n     of Northern Ireland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S335-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S338-S340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHINA--TAIWAN DEVELOPMENTS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a moment to \nread a story in today's New York Times on proposed military actions by \nthe People's Republic of China [PRC] against the Republic of China on \nTaiwan. I ask unanimous consent that this article appear in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. According to the story, the People's Republic of China \nhas finished plans for a limited missile attack on Taiwan--an attack \nthat could come following Taiwan's first Presidential election, which \nis scheduled for March 23.\n  This revelation is the latest in a series of intimidating tactics \nthat work to threaten Taiwan and destabilize East Asia. Between July 21 \nand July 26, the PRC conducted a series of ballistic missile test \nfirings 85 miles off the coast of Taiwan. All the missiles were modern, \nmobile and nuclear capable. No country ever has held this level of \nfield tests for nuclear capable missiles before.\n  The results of that action were predictable--the stock market and the \nlocal currency in Taiwan plunged. These ballistic missile exercises \nresumed on August 15, and continued through the fall leading up to last \nDecember's elections in Taiwan for the 164-seat Legislature.\n  Now comes word that the PRC has done more than just test its military \ncapability. It has matched its hardware testing with military \nplanning--a plan that calls for one ballistic missile to be launched \neach day for 30 days.\n  As was the case with the missile tests, this recent report can be \nseen as a blatant attempt to influence the outcome of the upcoming \nPresidential elections in Taiwan. There could be more to this story. I \nbelieve this is an attempt to intimidate the Clinton administration and \ntest our Nation's resolve in the Taiwan Straits. The fact that the PRC \nhas advanced a limited but sustained missile attack plan indicates that \nit believes the Clinton administration may do nothing to strengthen \nTaiwan's defenses or come to its aid in the event of an attack.\n  It is not hard to understand why the PRC has come to this conclusion. \nThe Clinton administration's policy with respect to the Taiwan-Mainland \nChina issue is nothing short of confusing. The administration claims to \nbe advancing a policy of deliberate ambiguity. For example, high level \nadministration officials recently have been asked if the United States \nwould come to Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack from the PRC. \nTheir responses were consistently and ominously vague.\n  The administration seems to believe that this ambiguity will be \nenough to deter Beijing. Today's report indicates that the exact \nopposite has occurred. I believe this policy of strategic ambiguity is \nwrong and has failed. It is not just dangerous for the people of \nTaiwan, it is potentially destabilizing for the entire East Asia \nregion. It is an approach that clearly advances the PRC's interests and \nnot our own. The administration's ambiguity policy has fueled the \nbelief within the PRC that the United States will look the other way if \nPRC missiles are launched. Because of our ambiguity, the PRC believes \nthat it can achieve its policy goals at the very least through \nintimidation and military posturing. Even if the PRC privately has no \nintention for a direct military confrontation against Taiwan, our \nambiguity gives the PRC's military maneuvers greater credibility. It \nsends a signal of weakness. It fosters a belief that we can be pushed \naround by the PRC. It is a belief shared by many in Taiwan as well. \nIndeed, this ambiguity has troubled other Asian democracies in the \nregion, compelling many--from Japan to the Philippines--to increase \ntheir defense budgets.\n  Mr. President, as I said last August, in response to the PRC's first \nballistic missile exercise, the United States is faced with three \nchoices: First, we can do nothing, which appears to be the present \ncourse. I believe that is not in the national security interest of the \nUnited States. We must not allow Asia--a region of many thriving free \nmarket, democratic societies--to be dominated by an aggressive, \nnondemocratic power.\n\n  Second, at the other extreme, we could intervene should the moment of \nconflict become imminent by interposing the United States Pacific fleet \nin the Taiwan straits. President Truman did so in 1950. This, again, is \nan extreme course and thus, should only be \n\n[[Page S339]]\nconsidered as a last resort. It is a course that could result in a \ndirect military confrontation with the People's Republic of China.\n  Finally, we can take what I believe is the wisest course, which is a \nclear and unambiguous demonstration of political and military support \nso that Asian democracies, including Taiwan can resist aggression. In \nshort, a clear statement of U.S. policy goals and conditions in the \nregion will promote peace and stability far better than the \nadministration's deliberate vagueness. Both houses of Congress have \ncome to this conclusion as well. Both the House and Senate versions of \nthe State Department authorization bill contain identical language that \nwould amend the Taiwan Relations Act [TRA] to supersede restrictions on \nUnited States arm sales to Taiwan. These restrictions were imposed in a \nAugust 1982 communique between the People's Republic of China and the \nUnited States. The amendments to the TRA represent a clear statement by \nCongress that the TRA requires the United States to provide Taiwan with \nthe appropriate means to defend itself.\n  This latter course achieves a number of important policy goals. \nFirst, it demonstrates to all democracies in Asia that the United \nStates intends to work with them to ensure peace and stability in the \nregion. Second, it demonstrates support for the continued political \nliberalization in Taiwan. Third, it sends a clear signal to the \nPeople's Republic of China that the United States will not accept the \nreunification of Taiwan with the mainland by force.\n  This latter point is important. Since President Nixon's overtures to \nCommunist China, this Nation has taken a one China policy. The advent \nof that policy, coupled with the passage of the TRA, was designed to \nfoster a strong diplomatic and economic relationship with the People's \nRepublic of China, while sending a clear signal that our Nation would \ndefend against any forced reunification of Taiwan by the People's \nRepublic of China. Reunification, if it is to occur, must be done \nthrough diplomatic means.\n  I have said before on the Senate floor that our relationship with \nTaiwan is one of the ironies of history. Taiwan is a democracy and a \ngrowing economic power. The United States is Taiwan's primary foreign \ninvestor and trader. About 25 percent of Taiwan's exports go to United \nStates markets. Many of Taiwan's business, academic and cultural \nleaders have studied in the United States. Yet, we do not have \ndiplomatic ties with Taipei.\n  We must not add tragedy to this irony. In the midst of all its \nposturing, the People's Republic of China's real intentions are not \nclear. Most experts are divided on the question of whether or not the \nPeople's Republic of China actually will put its military plans into \naction. We must leave nothing to chance. Regardless of the People's \nRepublic of China's intentions or its goals, the Clinton Administration \nhas to recognize that its current policy of strategic ambiguity has \nfailed. The United States needs to maintain a positive, constructive \nrelationship with both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. It is \ntime we recognize that this triangular relationship can only be \nfurthered if all sides of this triangle understood United States policy \ngoals in the region.\n  It is time this Nation make very clear that we will not ignore direct \nor indirect intimidation against an Asian democracy. It is time that \nthe administration not engage in any sales of advanced \ntelecommunications technology that could be used to further the \nPeople's Republic of China's military capability. It is time that the \nadministration came to the conclusion that any military attack by the \nPeople's Republic of China against any Asian democracy directly \nthreatens the crucial regional and national security interests of the \nUnited States. It is time that we reassert that any reunification of \nTaiwan with the mainland must not be done through military aggression.\n  Mr. President, when Congress returns next month, it is my hope that \nCongress will take the opportunity to take a step toward a clear \ndefinition of United States policy in the region, and demonstrate its \nclear support for the democratic process underway in Taiwan. Given the \nstrong support for amending the Taiwan Relations Act, we may want to \nconsider making these changes through legislation independent of the \nState Department authorization bill, and to pass this legislation \nbefore the upcoming March 23 elections. That's one possible option. \nWherever democracy may emerge, the United States should demonstrate its \nsupport for such efforts. I believe we should do so, hopefully with the \nadministration's cooperation, but if necessary, without it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 24, 1996]\n\n         As China Threatens Taiwan, It Makes Sure U.S. Listens\n\n                         (By Patrick E. Tyler)\n\n       Beijing, January 23.--The Chinese leadership has sent \n     unusually explicit warnings to the Clinton Administration \n     that China has completed plans for a limited attack on Taiwan \n     that could be mounted in the weeks after Taiwan's President, \n     Lee Tenghui, wins the first democratic balloting for the \n     presidency in March.\n       The purpose of this saber-rattling is apparently to prod \n     the United States to rein in Taiwan and President Lee, whose \n     push for greater international recognition for the island of \n     21 million people, has been condemned here as a drive for \n     independence.\n       While no one familiar with the threats thinks China is on \n     the verge of risking a catastrophic war against Taiwan, some \n     China experts fear that the Taiwan issue has become such a \n     test of national pride for Chinese leaders that the danger of \n     war should be taken seriously.\n       A senior American official said the Administration has ``no \n     independent confirmation or even credible evidence'' that the \n     Chinese are contemplating an attack, and spoke almost \n     dismissively of the prospect.\n       ``They can fire missiles, but Taiwan has some teeth of its \n     own,'' the official said. ``And does China want to risk that \n     and the international effects?''\n       The most pointed of the Chinese warnings was conveyed \n     recently through a former Assistant Secretary of Defense, \n     Chas. W. Freeman Jr., who traveled to China this winter for \n     discussions with senior Chinese officials. On Jan. 4, after \n     returning to Washington, Mr. Freeman informed President \n     Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, that the \n     People's Liberation Army had prepared plans for a missile \n     attack against Taiwan consisting of one conventional missile \n     strike a day for 30 days.\n       This warning followed similar statements relayed to \n     Administration officials by John W. Lewis, a Stanford \n     University political scientist who meets frequently with \n     senior Chinese military figures here.\n       These warnings do not mean that an attack on Taiwan is \n     certain or imminent. Instead, a number of China specialists \n     say that China, through ``credible preparations'' for an \n     attack, hopes to intimidate the Taiwanese and to influence \n     American policy toward Taiwan. The goal, these experts say, \n     is to force Taiwan to abandon the campaign initiated by \n     President Lee, including his effort to have Taiwan seated at \n     the United Nations, and to end high-profile visits by \n     President Lee to the United States and to other countries.\n       If the threats fail to rein in Mr. Lee, however, a number \n     of experts now express the view that China could resort to \n     force, despite the enormous consequences for its economy and \n     for political stability in Asia.\n       Since last summer, when the White House allowed Mr. Lee to \n     visit the United States, the Chinese leadership has escalated \n     its attacks on the Taiwan leader, accusing him of seeking to \n     ``split the motherland'' and undermine the ``one China'' \n     policy that had been the bedrock of relations between Beijing \n     and its estranged province since 1949.\n       A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeman, asked to comment on \n     reports that the Chinese military has prepared plans for \n     military action against Taiwan, said he was awaiting a \n     response from his superiors. Last month, a senior ministry \n     official said privately that China's obvious preparations for \n     military action have been intended to head off an unwanted \n     conflict.\n       ``We have been trying to do all we can to avoid a scenario \n     in which we are confronted in the end with no other option \n     but a military one,'' the official said. He said that if \n     China does not succeed in changing Taiwan's course, ``then I \n     am afraid there is going to be a war.''\n       Mr. Freeman described the most recent warning during a \n     meeting Mr. Lake had called with nongovernmental China \n     specialists.\n       Participants said that Mr. Freeman's presentation was \n     arresting as he described being told by a Chinese official of \n     the advanced state of military planning. Preparations for a \n     missile attack on Taiwan, he said, and the target selection \n     to carry it out, have been completed and await a final \n     decision by the Politburo in Beijing.\n       One of the most dramatic moments came when Mr. Freeman \n     quoted a Chinese official as asserting that China could act \n     militarily against Taiwan without fear of intervention by the \n     United States because American leaders ``care more about Los \n     Angeles than they do about Taiwan,'' a statement that Mr. \n     Freeman characterized as an indirect threat by China to use \n     nuclear weapons against the United States.\n       An account of the White House meeting was provided by some \n     of the participants. Mr. Freeman, reached by telephone, \n     confirmed the gist of his remarks, reiterating \n\n[[Page S340]]\n     that he believes that while ``Beijing clearly prefers negotiation to \n     combat,'' there is a new sense of urgency in Beijing to end \n     Taiwan's quest for ``independent international status.''\n       Mr. Freeman said that President's Lee's behavior ``in the \n     weeks following his re-election will determine'' whether \n     Beijing's Communist Party leaders feel they must act ``by \n     direct military means'' to change his behavior.\n       In recent months, Mr. Freeman said he has relayed a number \n     of warnings to United States Government officials. ``I have \n     quoted senior Chinese who told me'' that China ``would \n     sacrifice `millions of men' and `entire cities' to assure the \n     unity of China and who opined that the United States would \n     not make comparable sacrifices.''\n       He also asserted that ``some in Beijing may be prepared to \n     engage in nuclear blackmail against the U.S. to insure that \n     Americans do not obstruct'' efforts by the People's \n     Liberation Army ``to defend the principles of Chinese \n     sovereignty over Taiwan and Chinese national unity.''\n       Some specialists at the meeting wondered if Mr. Freeman's \n     presentation was too alarmist and suggested that \n     parliamentary elections on Taiwan in December had resulted in \n     losses for the ruling Nationalist Party and that President \n     Lee appeared to be moderating his behavior to avoid a crisis.\n       ``I am not alarmist at this point,'' said one specialist, \n     who would not comment on the substance of the White House \n     meeting. ``I don't think the evidence is developing in that \n     direction.''\n       Other participants in the White House meeting, who said \n     they would not violate the confidentiality pledge of the \n     private session, separately expressed their concern that a \n     potential military crisis is building in the Taiwan Strait.\n       ``I think there is evidence to suggest that the Chinese are \n     creating at least the option to apply military pressure to \n     Taiwan if they feel that Taiwan is effectively moving out of \n     China's orbit politically,'' said Kenneth Lieberthal, a China \n     scholar at the University of Michigan and an informal adviser \n     to the Administration.\n       Mr. Lieberthal, who also has traveled to China in recent \n     months, said Beijing has redeployed forces from other parts \n     of the country to the coastal areas facing Taiwan and set up \n     new command structures ``for various kinds of military action \n     against Taiwan.''\n       ``They have done all this in a fashion they know Taiwan can \n     monitor,'' he said, ``so as to become credible on the use of \n     force.''\n       ``I believe there has been no decision to use military \n     force'' he continued, ``and they recognize that it would be a \n     policy failure for them to have to resort to force; but they \n     have set up the option, they have communicated that in the \n     most credible fashion and, I believe, the danger is that they \n     would exercise it in certain circumstances.''\n       Several experts cited their concern that actions by \n     Congress in the aftermath of President Lee's expected \n     election could be a critical factor contributing to a \n     military confrontation. If President Lee perceives that he \n     has a strong base of support in the United States Congress \n     and presses forward with his campaign to raise Taiwan's \n     status, the risk of a military crisis is greater, they said. \n     A chief concern is that Congress would seek to invite the \n     Taiwan leader back to the United States as a gesture of \n     American support. A Chinese military leader warned in \n     November that such a step could have ``explosive'' results.\n       In recent months, American statements on whether United \n     States forces would come to the defense of Taiwan if it came \n     under attack have been deliberately vague so as to deter \n     Beijing through a posture of what the Pentagon calls \n     ``strategic ambiguity.''\n       Some members of Congress assert that the Taiwan Relations \n     Act of 1979 includes an implicit pledge to defend Taiwan if \n     attacked, but Administration officials say that, in the end, \n     the decision would depend on the timing, pretext and nature \n     of Chinese aggression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S338-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the \nwonderful example of Mary P. Brennan, an extraordinary woman who \ncombined the best qualities of politics and public service.\n  Mary Brennan, who retired last month as marketing director for Green \nState Airport after an extraordinary career in politics and public \nservice, lost her battle with breast cancer earlier this month.\n  In a time when politicians and public servants are the targets of \nunusually harsh criticism, Mary was a sterling example of how some \npeople were created to ennoble both politics and public service.\n  If you knew Mary, you felt special. It did not matter if your station \nwere high or low, you received the warmth of her charm, the depth of \nher compassion and the inspiration of her ``can do'' spirit.\n  When she retired after 11 years as marketing director at Green State \nAirport, it was noted that often she would take 30 minutes to make her \nway across the airport terminal because she would bump into so many \npeople she knew.\n  All who knew her, whether in her earlier job as executive aide to \nformer Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy or her most recent job as marketing \ndirector, knew that she would put in 150 percent effort.\n  When asked why she worked so hard for so many people, Mary replied: \n``If you care about people, you want to service them to the utmost. You \nstart something right, you finish it right.''\n  She was loyal to public service and she valued loyalty above all \nother virtues. ``When you make a commitment to someone,'' she said, \n``you keep it.''\n  Mr. President, we will miss Mary tremendously in Rhode Island. I will \nthink of her when I fly into Rhode Island. It also is easy to hark back \nto an earlier decade and picture her hard at work in the Rhode Island \nState House.\n  Governor Garrahy delivered a heart-felt eulogy that I would like to \nshare with my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that his remarks and \nobituaries from the Providence, RI, Journal and the Woonsocket, RI, \nCall be printed in the Record as if read.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Remarks by Former Rhode Island Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy\n\n       Mary Brennan--say her name and you are guaranteed to smile. \n     That's because her warmth, her care, her enthusiastic \n     approach to life was contagious. She touched us all.\n       I can think of no higher honor than to have been asked to \n     speak about my friend, our friend, Mary. My single regret is \n     that I have to do this so soon, so early.\n       Like all of you, I have a special place in my heart \n     reserved for Mary. She caught my attention 30 years ago and \n     will forever hold it.\n       To know Mary was to know all the Brennans an the \n     Partingtons, because special above everyone was her family. \n     She came from such solid stock--Bumpsie and Mumsie. At the \n     wonderful age of 91, it was Mumsie who cared for the daughter \n     who loved her so. And boy if there were ever two peas in a \n     pod, it was Mary and Mumsy. We admire your strength Mumsy and \n     your faith. A faith that Mary carried with her throughout her \n     life.\n       And Mary had a special sisterly bond with her brothers Bill \n     and John. She would defend and care for them and they for \n     her.\n       Her pride and joy were her two sons--Brian and Sean. She \n     used to say how much like John, Brian was. And boy was she \n     beaming last April at his and Sally's wedding. Sean was with \n     her every step of the way--she was so proud of his work in \n     Alaska and Hawaii and encouraged him to follow his dream. \n     Typical Mary--always selfless.\n       They were blessed to have her. And, we were all blessed \n     because Mary made us part of her extended family. She adopted \n     each of us and we were better for it. A special thanks to \n     Little Lynne who adopted Mary and was a great comfort in her \n     final days.\n       All of us could easily be overwhelmed by grief of our great \n     loss. Or we can proceed as Mary would have us--remembering \n     our special times together and understanding what a special \n     woman she was.\n       Mary has affected more lives than any newspaper report can \n     ever catalogue. Each of us carries memories and stories of \n     how Mary affected us. Every one of my days as Governor could \n     be footnoted with a Mary Brennan story. Whether is was the \n     difficult days of the oil crisis or celebrating RI's true \n     ethnic diversity at one heritage celebration or another, or \n     planning a President's visit, welcoming the most needy \n     citizen in the State Room or working hour after hour during \n     the Blizzard to get food and heat to the stranded, Mary was \n     always there. She could even convince a group of angry voters \n     that I was good, even if I wasn't right!\n       And I am convinced that were it not for Mary's wise counsel \n     to Lynne Ryan--she and Michael would not be raising a family \n     today. I can hear her words of advice, ``Lynne, be patient. \n     He's Irish!''\n       Service to others was Mary's hallmark. An honorable \n     devoted, and selfless public servant. From her early days \n     running her own travel agency to the Heritage years and \n     nearly a decade in the Governor's Office to her airport, \n     travel and tourism time, Mary continuously served others. She \n     would say ``if you care about people, you want to service \n     them to the utmost.'' We all have a story of how Mary \n     extended herself to each of us.\n     \n[[Page S341]]\n\n       It didn't matter who you were, if you needed help, she was \n     there. Her generosity knew no bounds.\n       All of us here today are a testimony to her life. Mary was \n     as at ease with Governors, Bishops and Generals as she was \n     with the regular folk. Individually, each of us represents a \n     part of her life.\n       Well Mary, you have made our lives richer--serving as a \n     teacher of how to treat people and have a passion for life. \n     You made the world better because you have passed through it.\n       Although most didn't have a chance to say goodbye, every \n     time you left Mary, your heart was a little warmer because \n     you left with a piece of her heart.\n       As we help Mary to her rest today--close your eyes and \n     think of how good Mary always made you feel about yourself.\n       Think of how Mary made you feel as if no one else in the \n     world mattered but you.\n       Think of how Mary helped to make us work harder and be \n     better than we ever thought we could be.\n       Close your eyes and think of how many times Mary got you to \n     do the right thing--even when you didn't want to do it--and \n     then made you believe it was your idea all along.\n       How fortunate are we, each one of us, to have been a part \n     of Mary Brennan's life. We always felt safe with Mary. We \n     knew that if anything went wrong Mary was there to fix it--to \n     insure that things worked smoothly.\n       Now we are on our own. Sadness fills us today. But we are \n     better because of Mary. We have smiled more because of Mary. \n     And we will carry forward because that's what Mary would \n     want.\n       And we can be happy for Mary that she is reunited with her \n     Johnny. John Brennan who Mary so cherished.\n       Mike Ryan and I visited with Mary last Friday and she \n     recalled the last book that John was working on before he \n     passed away. She said she had to finish it to make the \n     collection complete. Some of you may know that during my \n     years as Governor, John Brennan painstakingly cut and \n     catalogued a newspaper history of my terms of office.\n       Well John's been hard at work; cutting and cataloguing \n     Mary's good deeds, her kindness, her courage and her love for \n     her family. And John will make certain that St. Peter reads \n     every single volume.\n       We love you Mary and we thank God for giving you to us.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, Jan. 12, 1996]\n\n   Mary P.

Mr. President, our attention should be drawn to a \nhorrifying report issued this month by the respected human rights \norganization, Human Rights Watch/Asia, titled ``Death by Default: A \nPolicy of Fatal Neglect in China's State Orphanages.'' The allegations \nraised in ``Death by Default'' are more than a little disturbing; they \nare shocking. Mr. President, I ask that the report's ``Summary and \nRecommendations'' be submitted for the Record.\n  The report paints a grim picture of the lives of China's youngest, \nleast fortunate citizens. With well-documented details from one \ninstitution--the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute--and publicly \navailable statistics for orphanages nationwide provided by China's \nMinistry of Civil Affairs, the report indicates that orphans in most of \nChina's state-run institutions are living in horrible conditions with \nlittle hope for survival. Statistics provided by the Ministry allow \nHuman Rights Watch to conservatively estimate a national death rate in \nChina's orphanages of 25 percent. Critics of the report charge that \nterrible conditions and high death rates are to be expected in a \ndeveloping country because of a lack of adequate funding, but ``Death \nby Default'' again uses official documents to show otherwise. The \nreport shows, for example, that from 1989 to 1992 employees' salaries \nat state-run orphanages nationally increased at close to twice the rate \nof expenditures for the children. The question does not seem to be \n\n[[Page S342]]\none of having funding, but one of how that funding is used.\n  This report relies heavily on documents and pictures taken by a \nformer doctor and a former inmate at the Shanghai Children's Welfare \nInstitute for its most harrowing sections. It provides pictures of \nemaciated children and children tied to their beds, and stories of \nmedical neglect, dying rooms, beatings and rapes by orphanage \nofficials, and children carrying the corpses of other children to the \norphanage's morgue. These nightmarish allegations are made worse by \ndocumented accounts of how the doctor and others tried in vain to raise \nthe issue of conditions at the orphanage with city government \nofficials. An investigation into the situation was apparently \nstonewalled and later stopped completely by senior officials. The \nreport notes that conditions at the Shanghai Children's Welfare \nInstitute have since improved remarkably and it is now open to \nvisitors, even foreigners. But the report strongly indicates that the \nShanghai No. 2 Social Welfare Institute, which is not open to the \npublic, may be carrying on many of these same abuses.\n  Mr. President, I have not visited either of these institutes in China \nand cannot personally vouch for the accuracy of ``Death by Default.'' \nBut I can say that the evidence it presents to support its allegations \nis compelling enough for me to join Human Rights Watch/Asia in calling \non government officials in Beijing to reopen the investigation into the \nShanghai Children's Welfare Institute and to review conditions at \nstate-run institutions nationally. I also urge the U.S. Embassy in \nBeijing to raise the issue of child welfare with Chinese Government \nofficials at the highest levels. The U.S. Government cannot credibly \nclaim to champion human rights issues globally if it ignores the brutal \ntreatment of young children documented by this report.\n  This is not the first public report on the state of China's \norphanages. The British Broadcasting Corporation and other media \norganizations have looked at conditions in them before. But I want to \ncommend Human Rights Watch/Asia for again bringing this serious matter \nto public attention with such a carefully researched document. I hope \nit is widely read and its recommendations taken in Beijing.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nDeath by Default: A Policy of Fatal Neglect in China's State Orphanages\n\n\n                     I. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n                    China's Orphans and Human Rights\n\n       In response to widespread criticism of its human rights \n     record, the Chinese government has frequently argued that the \n     international community places too much emphasis on civil and \n     political rights, while neglecting the more basic rights to \n     food, shelter, and subsistence--rights which China claims to \n     have secured for its citizens more effectively than some \n     democratic countries. In accordance with the country's post-\n     1949 political tradition, China's leaders assert that \n     economic well-being forms the basis for the enjoyment of all \n     other rights, and that the protection of economic rights can \n     therefore justify restrictions on civil liberties.\n       In some important respects, China's record in protecting \n     social and economic rights may serve as a model for the rest \n     of the developing world. Levels of well-being, as measured by \n     social indicators such as literacy and life expectancy, are \n     considerably higher in China than in other countries at \n     comparable stages of development, and in some cases higher \n     than those in much wealthier nations.\n       But China's claim to guarantee the ``right to subsistence'' \n     conceals a secret world of starvation, disease, and unnatural \n     death--a world into which thousands of Chinese citizens \n     disappear each year. The victims are neither the political \n     activists nor the religious dissidents who dominate the \n     international debate over human rights in the People's \n     Republic; they are orphans and abandoned children in \n     custodial institutions run by China's Ministry of Civil \n     Affairs. This report documents the pattern of cruelty, abuse, \n     and malign neglect which has dominated child welfare work in \n     China since the early 1950s, and which now constitutes one of \n     the country's gravest human rights problems.\n       Human Rights Watch/Asia has now pieced together at least a \n     fragmentary picture of conditions for abandoned children \n     throughout China, including staggering mortality rates for \n     infants in state institutions and the persistent failure of \n     official statistics to track the vast majority of orphans, \n     whose whereabouts and status are unknown.\n       The evidence--largely official documents cited in detail \n     below--indicates that the likelihood of survival beyond one \n     year, for a newly admitted orphan in China's welfare \n     institutions nationwide, was less than 50 percent in 1989. \n     The documents also show that overall annual mortality at many \n     of China's orphanages is far higher than that documented in \n     any other country. In Romania in December 1989, for example, \n     when foreigners first visited the grim state orphanages \n     housing abandoned and handicapped children and were outraged \n     by what they found there, a representative of the France-\n     based humanitarian group Medecins du Monde stated that the \n     1989 death rate from infectious disease and neglect was 40 \n     percent, in one home that was particularly abusive. In the \n     Chinese provinces of Fujian, Shaanxi, Guangxi and Henan, \n     overall annual mortality among institutionalized orphans that \n     year ranged from 59.2 percent to 72.5 percent.\n       When sustained over an extended period, moreover, any of \n     the above annual rates means far higher actual mortality. We \n     estimate that in China's best-known and most prestigious \n     orphanage, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute, total \n     mortality in the late 1980s and early 1990s was probably \n     running as high as 90 percent; even official figures put the \n     annual deaths-to-admissions ratio at an appalling 77.6 \n     percent in 1991, and partial figures indicate an increase in \n     1992. Neither institutional welfare policy nor the size of \n     the orphanage system have changed notably since then, while \n     the crisis of abandoned children continues unabated, due in \n     part to China's one-child policy. In the case of Shanghai, \n     there have been cosmetic improvements at the orphanage itself \n     since 1993, designed to encourage foreign adoption, but there \n     is evidence that many disabled infants and children are now \n     simply transferred to a facility outside the city, where \n     access for outsiders is extremely rare and where, according \n     to numerous reports received by Human Rights Watch/Asia, the \n     children are grossly mistreated.\n       Unlike their Romanian counterparts, the management and \n     staff of China's orphanages cannot claim that their \n     shortcomings result from a lack of funding or from \n     inadequately paid employees. Dispelling a misconception \n     reflected in nearly all Western media coverage of the issue \n     to date, Human Rights Watch/Asia's research confirms that \n     many Chinese orphanages, including some recording death rates \n     among the worst in the country, appear to enjoy more than \n     sufficient budgets, including adequate wages, bonuses, and \n     other personnel-related costs. Expenses for children's food, \n     clothing, and other necessities, however, are extremely low \n     in institutions throughout the country.\n       The crisis, both nationwide and in Shanghai, is known to \n     the top leadership of China's Ministry of Civil Affairs. \n     Conditions at the Shanghai orphanage are well known to the \n     local political elite and by members of the Politburo. But \n     the government reaction has been to maintain a facade of \n     normalcy, to punish dissenters who have sought to expose \n     abuses and, in certain crucial cases, to promote those \n     responsible for the abuses.\n\n                          A Nationwide Crisis\n\n       Abandonment of children surged in China during the 1980's, \n     in part due to the one-child population control policy and in \n     part due to policies restricting adoption by Chinese couples \n     who are not childless. The national statistics on mortality \n     cited in this report do not contain a gender breakdown, but \n     anecdotal and journalistic reporting on orphanages nationwide \n     reveals that the vast majority of children in orphanages are, \n     and consistently have been during the past decade, healthy \n     infant girls; that is, children without serious disabilities \n     who are abandoned because of traditional attitudes that value \n     boy children more highly. The financial and social problems \n     that these children are perceived to constitute are made more \n     acute by the fact that Chinese couples are not permitted to \n     adopt them, for the most part.\n       Reports of inhumane conditions in Chinese orphanages have \n     attracted growing international concern in recent years, \n     prompted chiefly by the country's greater openness to foreign \n     press coverage and charitable work financed from abroad, as \n     well as a dramatic increase in overseas adoptions from the \n     People's Republic. Although some scattered allegations have \n     succeeded in bringing to light grave abuses against China's \n     orphans, there has been virtually no effort to place these \n     charges in context through systematic research on the \n     country's institutional welfare system.\n       The Chinese government's own statistics reveal a situation \n     worse than even the most alarming Western media reports have \n     suggested. In 1989, the most recent year for which nationwide \n     figures are available, the majority of abandoned children \n     admitted to China's orphanages were dying in institutional \n     care. Many institutions, including some in major cities, \n     appeared to be operating as little more than assembly lines \n     for the elimination of unwanted orphans, with an annual \n     turnover of admissions and deaths far exceeding the number of \n     beds available.\n       In any case, the majority of abandoned children in China \n     never reach the dubious security of a state-run orphanage. \n     Many are sent instead to general-purpose state institutions, \n     where they are confined indiscriminately with retarded, \n     disabled, elderly, and mentally disturbed adults. Although \n     the statistical evidence is unclear, the limited eyewitness \n     information available suggests that death rates among \n     children held in these facilities may be even higher than in \n     China's specialized orphanages.\n       In addition, Chinese official records fail to account for \n     most of the country's abandoned \n\n[[Page S343]]\n     infants and children, only a small proportion of whom are in any form \n     of acknowledged state care. The most recent figure provided \n     by the government for the country's orphan population, \n     100,000 seems implausibly low for a country with a total \n     population of 1.2 billion. Even if it were accurate, however, \n     the whereabouts of the great majority of China's orphans \n     would still be a complete mystery, leaving crucial questions \n     about the country's child welfare system unanswered and \n     suggesting that the real scope of the catastrophe that has \n     befallen China's unwanted children may be far larger than the \n     evidence in this report documents.\n\n                         Evidence From Shanghai\n\n       In addition to nationwide statistics on the condition of \n     China's institutionalized children, Human Rights Watch/Asia \n     has recently obtained a large quality of internal \n     documentation from one of the most prominent specialized \n     orphanages in the country, the Shanghai Children's Welfare \n     Institute. Based on these documents, which include medical \n     records and other official files recording the deaths of \n     hundreds of children, and on the testimony of direct \n     witnesses who left China in 1995, Human Rights Watch/Asia has \n     concluded that conditions at the Shanghai orphanage before \n     1993 were comparable to those at some of the worst children's \n     institutions in China, several of which have already been \n     exposed in journalistic accounts in the West. Since 1993, a \n     program of cosmetic ``reforms'' has transformed the Shanghai \n     Children's Welfare Institute into an international showcase \n     for China's social policies, while an administrative \n     reorganization of the city's welfare system has largely \n     concealed the continuing abuse of infants and children.\n       Ironically, the Chinese government has praised Shanghai's \n     municipal orphanage extensively as a national model for the \n     care of abandoned and disabled children. In addition to \n     frequent flattering coverage in China's official media, the \n     Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute receives considerable \n     financial support from Chinese and international charities \n     and hosts a steady stream of private and official visitors. \n     Behind the institution's glossy official image, however, lies \n     a pattern of horrifying abuse. The brutal treatment of \n     orphans in Shanghai, which included deliberate starvation, \n     torture, and sexual assault, continued over a period of many \n     years and led to the unnatural deaths of well over 1,000 \n     children between 1986 and 1992 alone. This campaign of \n     elimination could be kept secret through the complicity of \n     both higher- and lower-level staff, and because the city's \n     Bureau of Civil Affairs, responsible for the orphanage, also \n     runs the crematoria, where starved children's corpses were \n     disposed of with minimum oversight, often even before a death \n     certificate has been filled out by the attending physician. \n     In addition, officials of various Shanghai municipal agencies \n     knowingly suppressed evidence of child abuse at the \n     orphanage, persistently ignored the institute's high monthly \n     death figures, and in 1992, quashed an investigation into \n     orphanage practices.\n       Conditions in the Shanghai orphanage came close to being \n     publicly exposed in the early 1990s as a result of pressure \n     by concerned orphanage employees, local journalists and \n     sympathetic Shanghai officials. By 1993, however, virtually \n     all the critical staff members were forced out of their \n     positions and silenced. The orphanage leadership was assisted \n     in its efforts to cover up the truth by three of the city's \n     top leaders: Wu Bangguo, Shanghai's Communist Party \n     secretary; Huang Ju, the city's mayor; and Xie Lijuan, deputy \n     mayor for health, education, and social welfare. Wu, Huang, \n     and Xie were fully informed of the abuses occurring at the \n     Children's Welfare Institute, but took no action to halt \n     them or to punish those responsible, acting instead to \n     shield senior management at the orphanage and to prevent \n     news of the abuses from reaching the public. Meanwhile, Wu \n     Bangguo and Huang Ju have risen to positions of national \n     prominence in China's ruling Politburo.\n       The cosmetic changes at the Shanghai orphanage since 1993 \n     have been engineered by Han Weicheng, its former director. \n     Although he was a major perpetrator of abuses there, Han was \n     promoted to an even more senior position within the municipal \n     welfare bureaucracy. At about the same time, the orphanage \n     was opened to visitors and large numbers of children from the \n     city's orphanage began to be transferred to another custodial \n     institution, the Shanghai No. 2 Social Welfare Institute. \n     Located on Chongming Island, a remote rural area north of \n     Shanghai, the No. 2 Social Welfare Institute, which is \n     ostensibly a home for severely retarded adults, has been \n     transformed since 1993 into a virtual dumping ground for \n     abandoned infants delivered to the orphanage. While the city \n     government has aggressively promoted the adoption of healthy \n     or mildly disabled orphans by visiting foreigners, reports \n     from visitors to the orphanage in 1995 indicate that infants \n     with more serious handicaps are generally diverted to the \n     Chongming Island institution within weeks or months of their \n     arrival. Human Rights Watch/Asia has not been able to \n     ascertain the mortality rates of children at the No. 2 Social \n     Welfare Institute, but has collected credible reports of \n     severe mistreatment and of staff impunity. Extreme secrecy \n     surrounds the functioning of the Chongming Island \n     institution, raising serious suspicions and fears as to the \n     likely fate of children transferred there.\n\n                      Perversion of Medical Ethics\n\n       Some Western observers have charged that the phenomenally \n     high death rates among China's abandoned children result from \n     neglect and lack of medical training on the part of orphanage \n     employees. Anecdotal evidence from foreign charity workers \n     and adoptive parents has painted a grim picture of decrepit \n     and poorly financed institutions run by demoralized and \n     unskilled nursing staff.\n       However, medical records and testimony obtained by Human \n     Rights Watch/Asia show that deaths at the Shanghai orphanage \n     were in many cases deliberate and cruel. Child-care workers \n     reportedly selected unwanted infants and children for death \n     by intentional deprivation of food and water--a process known \n     among the workers as the ``summary resolution'' of childrens' \n     alleged medical problems. When an orphan chosen in this \n     manner was visibly on the point of death from starvation or \n     medical neglect, orphanage doctors were than asked to perform \n     medical ``consultations'' which served as a ritual marking \n     the child for subsequent termination of care, nutrition, and \n     other life-saving intervention. Deaths from acute \n     malnutrition were then, in many cases, falsely recorded as \n     having resulted from other causes, often entirely spurious or \n     irrelevant conditions such as ``mental deficiency'' and \n     ``cleft palate.''\n       The vast majority of children's recorded at the Shanghai \n     orphanage thus resulted not from lack of access to medical \n     care but from something far more sinister: an apparently \n     systematic program of child elimination in which senior \n     medical staff played a central role. By making unfounded \n     diagnoses of mental retardation and other disorders, these \n     doctors have helped to disseminate the widespread belief--\n     which appears to be quite inaccurate--that virtually all of \n     China's abandoned children are physically or mentally \n     handicapped. Worse, the Shanghai orphanage's medical staff \n     then used these supposed disabilities as a justification for \n     eliminating unwanted infants through starvation and medical \n     neglect. Such unconscionable behavior by doctors in China's \n     most advanced and cosmopolitan city points to an ethical \n     crisis of immense proportions in the country's medical \n     profession.\n       This corruption of medical ethics reflects broader trends \n     in Chinese law and health policy, including recent debates in \n     the National People's Congress, the country's nominal \n     legislature, on legalizing euthanasia for the incapacitated \n     elderly. Official press reports indicate that the Chinese \n     government may also have given serious consideration to \n     allowing euthanasia for handicapped children, but has \n     declined to do so for fear of the international \n     repercussions. The medical evidence suggests, however, that \n     just such pseudo-eugenic practices may have been carried out \n     at the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute. At the very \n     least, the city's abandoned infants, even when not genuinely \n     disabled, became the victims of a policy of deliberate and \n     fatal neglect resulting in their wholesale death by default.\n       Reports from the Shanghai orphanage also indicate that \n     medical staff there misused their authority in other ways. In \n     several cases, children who were accused of misbehavior or \n     were in a position to expose abuses at the orphanage were \n     falsely diagnosed as ``mentally ill'' and transferred to \n     psychiatric hospitals against their will; in one case, a \n     teenage girl named Chou Hui was imprisoned for four months to \n     prevent her from testifying that she had been raped by \n     orphanage director Han Weicheng. Many other children were \n     given powerful drugs without any apparent medical \n     justification, in order to control their behavior. Human \n     Rights Watch/Asia calls on the leaders of the Chinese medical \n     profession to denounce these gross ethical violations and to \n     take urgent steps to improve standards of medical ethics in \n     China.\n\n                   The Need For A Worldwide Response\n\n       The enormous loss of life occurring in China's orphanages \n     and other children's institutions calls for immediate action \n     by the international community. The United Nations and its \n     specialized agencies must take the lead in investigating \n     conditions in China's child welfare system and in bringing \n     these abuses to an end. Governments throughout the world must \n     make the treatment of China's abandoned children one of their \n     highest priorities as they continue to press for improvements \n     in the country's human rights record.\n       The People's Republic of China ratified the United Nations \n     Convention on the Rights of the Child in December 1991, and \n     submitted its first implementation report to the U.N. \n     Committee on the Rights of the Child in 1994. The Chinese \n     government has thus submitted itself voluntarily to \n     international monitoring on the treatment of its minor \n     citizens. Nevertheless, the evidence compiled in this report \n     shows that China's policies towards abandoned infants and \n     children are in clear violation of many articles of the \n     convention. Human Rights Watch/Asia urges the Committee on \n     the Rights of the Child to place conditions in the Chinese \n     child welfare system at the top of its agenda for the coming \n     year. Specialized agencies working on children's issues in \n     China, such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \n     and the World Health Organization, should also make a \n     thorough reform of the country's orphanage system their \n     highest priority. We further call for an immediate \n     investigation into abuses against institutionalized children \n     in China by the Special Rapporteur on \n\n[[Page S344]]\n     Extrajudicial Executions, who investigates patterns of deliberate state \n     action resulting in death.\n       Action by the United Nations and its agencies must be \n     accompanied by a strong response from national governments. \n     Bilateral pressure on China to ensure the rights of abandoned \n     infants and children should be give at least as high a \n     priority as demands to free political and religious detainees \n     or to end torture and ill-treatment in the country's prisons. \n     Protecting the lives of China's orphans must remain at the \n     top of the agenda in any future human rights dialogue with \n     the Chinese authorities.\n       Despite the Chinese government's generally hostile attitude \n     towards Western human right organizations, Human Rights \n     Watch/Asia believes that many government and Communist Party \n     officials will recognize the need for immediate action to \n     resolve this humanitarian crisis. Other branches of the \n     Chinese government must hold the Ministry of Civil Affairs \n     and its officials fully accountable for the atrocities being \n     committed against China's orphans. Human Rights Watch/Asia \n     calls on the authorities to take immediate steps to bring an \n     end to these abuses and offers its full cooperation to the \n     Chinese authorities in formulating the necessary reforms. A \n     list of the organization's recommendations follows.\n\n                      Ending Impunity in Shanghai\n\n       Most Chinese citizens familiar only with official media \n     reports on the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute accept \n     the authorities' claim that conditions for the city's orphans \n     are exemplary. This report shows that the fate of most \n     abandoned children in Shanghai is, in fact, much the same as \n     elsewhere in China. Until 1993, the majority of infants \n     brought to the institute died there within a few months of \n     arrival, and the minority who survived to older childhood \n     were subject to brutal abuse and neglect.\n       Indeed, the only genuinely unique feature of the Shanghai \n     orphanage appears to be its success since 1993 at generating \n     revenue for the municipal Civil Affairs Bureau. The city's \n     newly reorganized child welfare system now presents the \n     municipal orphanage as its acceptable public face, serving as \n     an advertisement for both charitable giving and profitable \n     foreign adoptions, and a ban on negative media coverage of \n     the Children's Welfare Institute has been in force since \n     1992.\n       Human Rights Watch/Asia believes that the spectacular \n     financial success of the Shanghai policies is the real motive \n     behind official praise of the city's child welfare system as \n     a national model. We fear that efforts to duplicate the \n     Shanghai experience elsewhere in China are likely to further \n     worsen conditions for the country's abandoned children, and \n     to strengthen the vested interest of the Ministry of Civil \n     Affairs in obstructing genuine reforms.\n       Any attempt to improve the treatment of Chinese orphans \n     must therefore begin by reopening the official investigation \n     into misconduct within the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, \n     launched in 1991 and abruptly terminated the following year. \n     Above all, such an inquiry would seek the widest possible \n     publicity for any evidence of wrongdoing uncovered and would \n     pursue appropriate legal sanctions against bureau employees \n     found responsible for abusing children and causing avoidable \n     deaths.\n       Such an inquiry will confront the fact that a number of \n     people associated directly or indirectly with abuses at the \n     Shanghai orphanage continue to hold positions of authority, \n     and many have since been promoted or otherwise risen in \n     status. The beneficiaries of this apparent impunity range \n     from ordinary staff members such as the child-care worker Xu \n     Shanzhen, certified as a ``model worker'' in early 1995 \n     despite her brutal abuse of a retarded child, to the former \n     Communist Party secretary of Shanghai, Wu Bangguo, who \n     reportedly ordered media coverage of the scandal suppressed \n     and has since been appointed vice-premier of China.\n       However, these obstacles make it all the more imperative \n     that swift action be taken at the most senior levels to break \n     the cycle of impunity. Human Rights Watch/Asia urges the \n     Chinese authorities to take the following immediate steps:\n       (1) The highest government and Communist Party officials in \n     the country should publicly state their determination to \n     investigate unnatural deaths and abuse of children in welfare \n     institutions run by the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau.\n       To demonstrate this commitment, the authorities should \n     immediately reopen the 1991 inquiry into conditions at the \n     Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute. The leadership of the \n     new investigation should be entirely independent of both the \n     Shanghai municipal government and the Ministry of Civil \n     Affairs. Such an inquiry could be led by a specially \n     appointed committee of delegates to the National People's \n     Congress or the Chinese People's Political Consultative \n     Conference. Members of the committee should include medical \n     and legal professionals and should be drawn from throughout \n     the country.\n       Pending the outcome of the investigation, all management \n     personnel at the institution should be suspended from their \n     positions and replaced by an independent leadership group, \n     preferably including a number of qualified medical doctors, \n     which would aid the authorities in gathering evidence about \n     conditions at the orphanage. Administrative authority over \n     the city's custodial welfare system should be temporarily \n     transferred from the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau to another \n     government department, possibly the Shanghai Public Health \n     Bureau.\n       (2) The authorities should emphasize that institute staff \n     members implicated in criminal offenses against children, \n     including murder, rape, assault, sexual abuse, and financial \n     corruption, will be tried and punished according to Chinese \n     law. Criminal penalties should be applied as well to those \n     responsible for administrative violations, such as \n     falsification of medical records and unlawful disposal of \n     corpses, which constitute, among others, the crime of \n     ``dereliction of duty'' (duzhi zui) under China's Criminal \n     Code.\n       In reopening the investigation, the authorities should \n     place particular emphasis on the practices of ``summary \n     resolution'' before 1993, whereby children were intentionally \n     killed through deprivation of food and medical care. Public \n     statements by senior officials should stress that all such \n     incidents, where they can be verified, will be prosecuted to \n     the full extent under Chinese law.\n       (3) The scope of the investigation should be extended \n     beyond the original terms of the inquiry launched in 1991, \n     and should examine evidence of complicity by senior Shanghai \n     officials in shielding the management of the Children's \n     Welfare Institute. Criminal charges of ``dereliction of \n     duty'' should be brought against present and former city \n     officials who appear to have knowingly suppressed evidence of \n     child abuse at the orphanage. Among the officials so \n     implicated, in official documents cited in this report, are \n     Wu Bangguo, the former Communist Party secretary of Shanghai; \n     Huang Ju, Shanghai's former mayor; Xie Lijuan, the city's \n     deputy mayor, and Sun Jinfu, director of the Shanghai Civil \n     Affairs Bureau.\n       (4) The investigation should also examine the legal \n     culpability of other official bodies in Shanghai which helped \n     to conceal misconduct within the Civil Affairs Bureau, in the \n     process implicating their own officials in possible criminal \n     acts. At a minimum, these include:\n       The Shanghai Public Security Bureau, for allowing the \n     Children's Welfare Institute to disobey regulations governing \n     the reporting of unnatural deaths; for unlawfully detaining \n     and intimidating Chou Hui, the plaintiff in a rape case \n     against the then-director of the orphanage, Han Weicheng; and \n     for failing to investigate the orphanage employees accused of \n     assaulting Chen Dongxian, a driver at the Shanghai orphanage;\n       The Shanghai Public Health Bureau, for failing to \n     investigate the extremely high monthly death figures reported \n     from the Children's Welfare Institute over a period of years;\n       The Shanghai Supervision Bureau, for suppressing evidence \n     obtained during an eight-month-long inquiry that it carried \n     out into conditions at the children's Welfare Institute in \n     1991 and 1992.\n       (5) The investigation should urgently examine the present \n     situation at the Shanghai No. 2 Social Welfare Institute, \n     including evidence of unlawful practices such as the \n     detention of mentally normal adults against their will, and, \n     the use of disciplinary measures constituting torture or ill-\n     treatment. Special attention should also be paid to \n     conditions for infants and young children secretly \n     transferred to the Chongming Island institute since 1993, and \n     should seek to determine whether the killing of infants \n     through ``summary resolution'' or other similar methods is \n     presently occurring there. A criminal investigation should be \n     opened into the alleged rape and murder of a twenty-nine-\n     year-old woman, named Guang Zi, at the facility in August \n     1991.\n       (6) The municipal Propaganda Department should lift its \n     present ban on critical coverage of events at the Children's \n     Welfare Institute, and invite journalists familiar with \n     conditions at the orphanage to publish any information which \n     might assist the authorities in their investigation. The \n     progress of the official inquiry, including any resulting \n     criminal prosecutions, should be publicized without restraint \n     by local and national media.\n\n                         Public Accountability\n\n       Despite the urgent need to resolve these outstanding \n     problems in Shanghai, the above measures represent only the \n     first stage of what should be a nationwide campaign to \n     improve conditions for children in China's welfare \n     institutes. A critical factor in the success of any such \n     effort will be the Chinese government's willingness to expose \n     these institutions to intensive public scrutiny, not only \n     from concerned foreigners but, even more importantly, from \n     China's own citizens. The deceptive policy of ``openness'' \n     introduced by the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute in \n     1993 must be replaced by genuine transparency in order to \n     prevent future abuses from going undetected.\n       Human Rights Watch/Asia believes the following measures are \n     likely to produce immediate and substantial improvements in \n     the quality of care for children in state custody, even \n     without fundamental reforms in management and law:\n       (1) The Ministry of Civil Affairs should immediately \n     publish comprehensive statistics on the scale of China's \n     child abandonment problem. These should given detailed \n     figures on the number of abandoned infants and children \n     discovered in each Chinese province in recent years, as well \n     as the number of such children offered up for legal adoption, \n     fostered with private families, and placed in institutional \n     care.\n     \n[[Page S345]]\n\n       The ministry should also publish a list of all custodial \n     institutions in China which care for unsupported minors, \n     including specialized orphanages, urban ``social welfare \n     institutes,'' and collectively run ``respecting-the-aged \n     homes'' in rural areas. The list should include the location \n     of each institution and its population on a specified date, \n     as well as all available statistics on child intake and \n     mortality rates in recent years. In future, such basic \n     population statistics for each institution should be \n     published on an annual basis.\n       Since most abandoned infants and children in China are \n     delivered to the civil affairs authorities by local police \n     departments and hospitals, the Ministry of Public Security \n     and the Ministry of Public Health should begin compiling and \n     publishing regular statistics on child abandonment, including \n     the sex and estimated age of each child discovered. This will \n     provide an independent check on the accuracy of intake \n     figures submitted to the Ministry of Civil Affairs by \n     individual institutions, and will prevent the under-reporting \n     of intakes which allegedly took place in Shanghai during the \n     1980s.\n       (2) The Ministry of Civil Affairs should make public its \n     policy on ``fostering'' orphans and abandoned children in \n     private family care, including details of the screening \n     process, if any, for prospective foster parents, and of \n     monitoring procedures aimed at ensuring that fostered \n     children are treated humanely.\n       (3) The propaganda organs of the Communist Party should \n     publicize the severe problems in Shanghai's child welfare \n     system, and instruct the state-controlled media throughout \n     China to investigate conditions for children in welfare \n     institutions within their own area of coverage. The Ministry \n     of Civil Affairs should ensure that journalists participating \n     in these investigations receive full cooperation from \n     institute staff, including unrestricted access to all \n     children in each institution. Any abusive or negligent \n     conditions uncovered during the course of journalists' \n     inquiries should be publicly exposed and promptly remedied. \n     Objective reporting on conditions in China's child welfare \n     system should remain a priority indefinitely.\n       Welfare institutes should permit unscheduled visits by \n     local residents, including both Chinese and foreign \n     nationals. Local civil affairs authorities should encourage \n     public involvement in the care of orphans, particularly by \n     qualified medical personnel.\n       The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and established \n     private children's charities from overseas should be granted \n     access on a regular basis to all welfare institutions holding \n     minors.\n\n                           Management Reforms\n\n       Although the steps outlined above are likely to bring about \n     a sharp reduction of some of the worst abuses within the \n     child welfare system, basic changes in institutional \n     management are equally important in order to guarantee that \n     these initial improvements last. These include administrative \n     measures to strengthen the outside monitoring of children's \n     treatment, as well as improvements in the selection, training \n     and discipline of institute staff. Human Rights Watch/Asia \n     recommends that the Chinese authorities undertake the \n     following reforms:\n       The leadership of the Ministry of Civil Affairs should \n     publicly state its commitment to improving conditions for \n     institutionalized children, and should emphasize that the \n     directors of welfare institutes and other management-level \n     staff will be evaluated primarily on their success in \n     reducing children's death rates to an absolute minimum. The \n     directors of welfare institutes where child mortality rates \n     appear to be higher than expected, given normal levels of \n     care, should be subject to investigation and dismissed if \n     mismanagement is shown to be a contributing factor.\n       The Ministry of Civil Affairs should immediately begin \n     reorganizing its custodial welfare system to ensure that \n     minors and adults are kept in separate institutions. The use \n     of all-purpose ``social welfare institutes'' to warehouse \n     orphans and other incapacitated persons should be ended as \n     soon as practically possible.\n       (3) The Ministry of Civil Affairs should cooperate with the \n     Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Public Security \n     to ensure that staff of welfare institutions strictly follow \n     all rules and other legal requirements regarding the \n     reporting of inmates' deaths. All deaths of minors in \n     institutional care should be treated as potentially \n     unnatural, and hence subject to reporting, investigation and \n     documentation requirements of the Public Security Bureau, as \n     well as independent autopsies by qualified medical personnel \n     affiliated with the Bureau of Public Health. Local health \n     bureaus which are notified of a significant number of \n     children's deaths in welfare institutions within their \n     jurisdiction should immediately call for an investigation by \n     local authorities.\n       (4) The Ministry of Civil Affairs should promulgate strict \n     rules prohibiting the abuse of children in welfare \n     institutions, such as excessive corporal punishment, tying of \n     children's limbs, medically unjustified use of drugs to \n     control children's behavior, and all forms of paid or unpaid \n     child labor. The ministry should also promulgate a formal \n     disciplinary policy to be applied by institute management in \n     cases of misconduct by junior staff.\n       (5) All staff at custodial welfare institutes should \n     undertake a period of formal training, aimed at impressing on \n     newly assigned employees that the protection of inmates' \n     well-being is of paramount importance. Ordinary child-care \n     workers should be trained in basic first-aid techniques, \n     particularly to respond to cases of choking and accidental \n     injuries, and in appropriate feeding methods for infants and \n     small children, especially those with disabilities.\n       (6) Welfare institutes should be staffed with, or (where \n     personnel shortages cannot be resolved) be provided with full \n     and regular outside consultancy services by, an adequate \n     number of fully qualified medical professionals, including \n     specialists in pediatrics. Doctors whose medical educations \n     were interrupted, for example during the Cultural Revolution, \n     should not be employed as institute medical staff unless they \n     have completed the necessary remedial coursework.\n       (7) The surgical repair of harelips, cleft palates and \n     other correctable birth defects should be one of the highest \n     medical priorities for welfare institutes and cooperating \n     local hospitals. Abandoned infants requiring these relatively \n     inexpensive procedures should receive them as soon as \n     medically advisable, and should be given individual attention \n     in the meantime to ensure that they remain adequately \n     nourished.\n       (8) Infants and small children should not be classified as \n     ``mentally retarded'' until they are old enough to undergo \n     appropriate psychological tests. Training programs for child-\n     care workers should emphasize the importance of individual \n     care, attention and stimulation for infants' normal mental \n     development.\n\n                          Legislative Reforms\n\n       The phenomenon of child abandonment is not unique to China, \n     and many of the factors which lead parents to abandon their \n     children are beyond the government's power to remedy, at \n     least in the short term. Rural poverty, prejudice against the \n     disabled, traditional attitudes towards female children, and \n     the pressures generated by the country's stringent population \n     policy all contribute to the problem. It must be stressed, \n     however, that whatever the reasons for the orphanhood or \n     abandonment, once such children are accepted into state care, \n     the government has an unshirkable duty to provide them with \n     adequate care and protection.\n       For the foreseeable future, China will need to maintain a \n     system of state-run foster care for some orphans, \n     particularly the severely disabled. However, Human Rights \n     Watch/Asia believes that relatively minor legislative changes \n     would enable most children now living in welfare institutions \n     to be placed for adoption with Chinese families. An effective \n     domestic adoption program would eliminate the need for \n     institutional care for virtually all of China's abandoned \n     children.\n       Human Rights Watch/Asia urges the Chinese authorities to \n     take the following steps:\n       (1) China's ``Adoption Law'' and its implementing \n     regulations should be amended to abolish the legal \n     distinction between ``orphans'' and ``abandoned infants.'' \n     The provisions of the adoption law which prohibit adults \n     under age thirty-five and couples with children from adopting \n     abandoned infants without handicaps, and which prohibit \n     foster parents from adopting more than one abandoned child, \n     should be repealed.\n       (2) The State Commission for Family Planning should issue \n     instructions to local family planning authorities, expressly \n     prohibiting any interference in the adopting of children from \n     welfare institutions.\n       (3) The propaganda organs of the Communist Party should \n     publicize changes in the country's adoption policy through \n     the official media. Both the media and the State Commission \n     for Family Planning should actively promote the adoption of \n     orphans as an alternative for couples seeking larger families \n     than China's population policies allow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S341-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S345-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting five \nwithdrawals and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S345-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S345-S346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. 1124) \nto authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for military \nactivities of the Department of Defense, to prescribe personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in \n\n[[Page S346]]\nwhich it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2567.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to prohibit \nsmoking on any scheduled airline flight segment intrastate, interstate, \nor foreign air transportation.\n\n\n               the airliner cabin air quality act of 1996\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am introducing the Airliner Cabin \nAir Quality Act of 1996, which would prohibit smoking on international \nflights to and from the United States by domestic and foreign carriers.\n  Mr. President, more than 50,000 studies have established the \nscientific evidence incriminating cigarette smoking as a direct cause \nof death and disability. Volumes of evidence also document similar \nhealth effects as a result of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. \nFor example, in 1991, the National Institute for Occupational Safety \nand Health placed environmental tobacco smoke in its most significant \ncategory of human carcinogens.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that environmental \ntobacco smoke causes some 3,000 lung cancer deaths and 12,000 other \ncancer deaths each year. In addition, the EPA believes that 70 percent \nof the lung cancer deaths attributable to environmental tobacco smoke \nare due to exposures outside of the home.\n  Environmental tobacco smoke exposure leads to coughing, chest \ndiscomfort, and reduced lung function in nonsmoking adults. While these \nsymptoms may seem minor in nature, their effects on individuals can \nhave permanent health and financial consequences. It is estimated that \nflight attendants lose about $10,000 per year in salary if they are \nunable to work on international flights on which smoking is still \nallowed.\n  Mr. President, in September 1992, the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization [ICAO] passed a nonbinding resolution urging governments \nto take the necessary steps to ban smoking on all international flights \nas a safety and health measure. The resolution calls for the ban to be \nin place no later than July 1, 1996. I am hopeful, but not confident, \nthat the ICAO resolution will be successful.\n  This past summer, ICAO released a working paper on the progress being \nmade toward the implementation of its international smoking ban \nresolution. While developing the working paper, ICAO asked its more \nthan 300 members to indicate their intentions with respect to \nimplementation of the smoking ban. Of the 67 replies, 34 countries gave \neither no indication of their intentions or indicated they were going \nto delay implementation. Another 10 countries indicated implementation \nplans were under study. Only 24 countries stated that they would \nimplement the smoking ban. Based upon replies to this questionnaire, \nsome have estimated that just 13 percent of all ICAO members will take \nthe steps necessary to ban smoking on international flights.\n  Mr. President, from the perspective of the United States, the \npotentially low rate of participation of other countries in an \ninternational smoking ban should be unacceptable. The United States and \nits carriers have repeatedly demonstrated their support for an \ninternational smoking ban. As the result of an agreement between the \nUnited States, Canada, and Australia, passengers traveling between \nthese countries need not suffer through a smoke-filled flight.\n  About a year ago, the Department of Transportation provided eight \nU.S. carriers with an antitrust waiver so they could discuss \nimplementing a voluntary transatlantic smoking ban. Despite their \nunanimous resolve to move toward a smoke-free environment, the \nparticipating carriers were unable to reach an agreement. Many were \nunwilling to ban smoking because of perceptions about competitive \npressures from foreign carriers who are unwilling to voluntarily ban \nsmoking.\n  Mr. President, I have been active for many years in efforts to ensure \nclean cabin air for airline passengers. In 1988, I sponsored \nlegislation that banned smoking on domestic flights of 2 hours or less. \nThis law protected approximately 80 percent of all domestic passengers \nfrom the documented effects of environmental tobacco smoke. In 1989, \nbased upon the success and popularity of the 2-hour smoking ban, \nCongress expanded the ban to include nearly all domestic flights.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would extend the protection now \nenjoyed by domestic passengers and flight attendants to those who fly \ninto and out of this country. I wish other countries would enter into \nmultilateral smoking-ban agreements on their own so this bill would be \nunnecessary. However, that does not seem likely. Therefore, this bill \nis needed to demonstrate the U.S. Congress' resolve and continued \nleadership on this issue. The bill would create a level competitive \nplaying field for carriers utilizing our market. And, most importantly, \nit would protect the health and safety of all those who fly \ninternationally.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S346-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S346-S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 877\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Stevens] was added as a cosponsor of S. 877, a bill to amend \nsection 353 of the Public Health Service Act to exempt physician office \nlaboratories from the clinical laboratories requirements of that \nsection.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nWisconsin [Mr. Kohl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1028, a bill to \nprovide increased access to health care benefits, to provide increased \nportability of health care benefits, to provide increased security of \nhealth care benefits, to increase the purchasing power of individuals \nand small employers, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1295\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the name of the Senator from Tennessee \n[Mr. Thompson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1295, a bill to prohibit \nthe regulation of any tobacco products, or tobacco sponsored \nadvertising, used or purchased by the National Association of Stock Car \nAutomobile Racing, its agents or affiliates, or any other professional \nmotor sports association by the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nor any other instrumentality of the Federal Government, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pressler, the name of the Senator from \nTennessee [Mr. Frist] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1418, a bill to \nprovide for the more effective implementation of the prohibition \nagainst the payment to prisoners of supplemental security income \nbenefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act or monthly benefits \nunder title II of such Act, and to deny such supplemental security \nincome benefits for 10 years to a person found to have fraudulently \nobtained such benefits while in prison.\n\n\n                                S. 1421\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. \n\n[[Page S347]]\nMoseley-Braun] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1421, A bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat as a zone business an otherwise \nqualified business dissected by a census tract boundary line of a \ndesignated empowerment zone or enterprise community.\n\n\n                                S. 1519\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig] and the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1519, a bill to prohibit United States voluntary \nand assessed contributions to the United Nations if the United Nations \nimposes any tax or fee on United States persons or continues to develop \nor promote proposals for such taxes or fees.\n\n\n                                S. 1520\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mr. Dole], the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], the Senator from \nGeorgia [Mr. Coverdell], and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1520, a bill to award a congressional gold \nmedal to Ruth and Billy Graham.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 85\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 85, a \nresolution to express the sense of the Senate that obstetrician-\ngynecologists should be included in Federal laws relating to the \nprovision of health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S346-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S347-S348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n         THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM EXTENSION ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                D'AMATO (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3118\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for Mr. D'Amato, for himself, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Bond) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1494) to provide an extension for \nfiscal year 1996 for certain programs administered by the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Agriculture, and for \nother purposes;

Mr. President, last night, President Clinton \nannounced his intention to reenlist in the war against drugs. It is an \nannouncement that is long overdue.\n  For 3 years, the Clinton administration has failed to provide any \nleadership in this battle. And one of the results has been a dramatic \nincrease in drug use among America's youth.\n  One of the most eloquent and effective soldiers in the war against \ndrugs is former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Throughout the 1980's Mrs. \nReagan devoted her tremendous energy to leading the ``Just Say No'' \ncampaign--a campaign that is credited with dramatically lowering this \nNation's tolerance and use of illegal drugs.\n  Like countless other concerned citizens, Mrs. Reagan is concerned \nwith the recent increase in drug use. And a column she wrote in \nyesterday's Wall Street Journal should be required reading for all \nAmericans.\n  I salute Mrs. Reagan for her commitment to this most important issue, \nand I ask that her column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                           Just Say ``Whoa''\n\n                           (By Nancy Reagan)\n\n       Statistics released last fall from the annual Household \n     Survey of Drug Use and, more recently, from the 21st annual \n     Monitoring the Future Survey show that marijuana use among \n     teenagers was up again last year. Where is the public outrage \n     over this finding? When will this country realize that as \n     long as we don't wake up and adopt a zero tolerance for drug \n     use, we are heading down a path of no return? Most we lose \n     another generation of children to the horrors of crack \n     addiction? Must the statistics soar to all-time highs before \n     we bother to take notice?\n       Last March I was invited to testify before a congressional \n     committee, at which time I said: ``I am not here to criticize \n     or place blame, but after the great strides that we made just \n     a few years back, I'm worried that this nation is forgetting \n     how endangered our children are by drugs. I'm worried that \n     for the first time in many years, tolerance for drugs and \n     the mistaken perception that `everyone is doing it' is \n     creeping back into our national mentality. And I am \n     worried that the psychological momentum we had against \n     drug use has been lost.\n       ``[Y]et it's more than worry,'' I pleaded. ``This weakening \n     vigilance against the drug threat can have a tragic effect on \n     this country for many years to come. . . . How could we have \n     forgotten so quickly? Why is it we no longer hear the \n     drumbeat of condemnation against drugs coming from our \n     leaders and our culture? Is it any wonder drug use has \n     started climbing again, and dramatically so?''\n       Regarding the drug use survey, NBC News reported: `` `Just \n     Say No' was an effective message in the '80s . . . in the \n     '90s much more will be needed.'' Denver drug counselor Bob \n     Cota emphasized, ``Kids have to be shown why they need to \n     learn it early, in the third and fourth grades--and it has to \n     be repeated often.''\n       Repeated often--like in the '80s when the national \n     leadership was vigilant and visible. And yes, we do need even \n     more now. In response to the 1994 Monitoring the Future \n     Survey, Joseph Califano Jr., chairman and president of the \n     Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia \n     University (CASA), warned: ``If historical trends continue, \n     the jump in marijuana use among America's children (age 12-\n     18) from 1992 to 1994 signals that 820,000 more of these \n     children will try cocaine in their lifetime. Of that number, \n     about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts.'' \n     In a 1995 survey by CASA, adolescents said that drugs were \n     their ``number one'' problem. Our children are crying out for \n     help.\n       While drug use is on the rise, the perceived risk of drug \n     use is on decline. The two go hand in hand. Only a few short \n     years ago, the constant message to young people--in the \n     media, in their classrooms, and in their homes--was that \n     drugs lead to destruction. But where are those messages \n     today? Those messages, those lessons, are what change \n     perceptions, change attitudes, change lives. Each of us has a \n     responsibility to bring back those messages--loud and clear.\n       Before the drug-use increases of the past three years, we \n     really had seen marked progress. As I told the members of the \n     committee: ``A decade of effort was beginning to pay off. \n     Attitudes were being changed. I don't mean to sit here and \n     say that we had won the battle against drugs. I think it's \n     plain we had not.'' However, between 1985 and 1992, monthly \n     cocaine use declined 78%, or to an annual rate of 3.1% from \n     its peak of 13.1% in 1985. It's the same story with other \n     numbers: Annual use of any illicit drug by high school \n     seniors dropped to 27.1% in 1992 from 54.2% in 1979. ``The \n     battle was going forward one child at a time,'' I said in \n     March. ``There was momentum, unity, intolerance of the \n     exaggeration and glorification of drug use by the media--we \n     were building peer support for saying `no,' Children were \n     being taught resistance skills--in short, there was \n     progress.''\n       Now there is silence--and not without consequence. In 1994, \n     twice the number of eighth-graders were experimenting with \n     marijuana as did in 1991, and daily use of marijuana by high \n     school seniors in 1994 was up by half from 1993. The 1995 \n     Monitoring the Future Survey shows that daily use has made \n     another jump.\n       We should all, as citizens of this great nation, be \n     frightened by the latest drug statistics. We should all \n     question what they mean to our futures and those of our \n     children. We should all resolve not to be silent any longer. \n     By the latest drug statistics and the renewed calls for \n     legalization of marijuana, it is painfully obvious that our \n     ``letting up'' is going to let down the young people of this \n     country. It's time to just say ``Whoa!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S348-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S348-S349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STUDENT LOANS AND CORPORATE WELFARE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address, \nPresident Clinton made a reference to the successful effort to \nstreamline the college student loan process and make repayment easier.\n  Some of my colleagues may be surprised to learn that much of the \ncredit for these improvements should go to a conservative Republican \nfrom Wisconsin, Representative Tom Petri. He developed one of the \nearliest models for a direct loan program and for income-contingent \nrepayment, and he has been a consistent proponent over the years.\n  Earlier this month, Congressman Petri appealed to fellow \nconservatives to help save the direct loan program, which has come \nunder attack by banks and agencies that do not want to lose their \nGovernment-guaranteed income.\n  I urge my colleagues to read Mr. Petri's article which appeared in \nthe Washington Times on January 9. I ask that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            Student Loans: Direct Lending vs. Special Pleas\n\n                          (By Thomas E. Petri)\n\n       How's this for a switch? The Clinton administration stands \n     firm for private enterprise and competition, against \n     Republican attempts to stomp out a successful competitor and \n     perpetuate an inefficient monopoly.\n       That's exactly what's occurring in the ongoing student loan \n     debate. Administration officials accuse congressional \n     Republicans of caving in to loan-industry lobbyists by \n     eviscerating the Direct Student Loan program. And on this \n     issue, the administration actually occupies the conservative \n     high ground.\n       The loan industry (banks, secondary markets and guaranty \n     agencies) wants to protect its lucrative, fraud-infested, no-\n     risk student loan program from any meaningful competition. \n     It's losing in the marketplace; so it mounted a multi-\n     million-dollar lobbying campaign this year to persuade \n     Congress to eliminate direct student loans.\n       By casting the debate in simple, ideological terms, the \n     loan lobbyists have won some allies. they've equated the \n     Department of Education's Direct Student Loan (DSL) program \n     with Big Government--and they've successfully portrayed it as \n     a Clinton initiative. That guarantees enmity from \n     conservative Republicans.\n     \n[[Page S349]]\n\n       Unfortunately, it's a hoax. One creator of the DSL program \n     was a Republican with solid fiscal conservative credentials--\n     me. It was developed not by the reviled liberal Clinton, but \n     by the Bush administration.\n       And there is far more free enterprise in DSL--and less \n     bureaucracy--than in the bloated Guaranteed Student Loan \n     (GSL) program. I dislike the term ``corporate welfare,'' but \n     if any program deserves that title, it's guaranteed student \n     loans.\n       Here are conservative principles I believe in: substituting \n     market forces for political forces; simplifying programs and \n     cutting bureaucracy; saving taxpayers money.\n       On all counts, killing the DSL program goes in the wrong \n     direction.\n       All major functions under DSL are run through private \n     sector services under competitively bid contracts. This \n     competition is bringing down the cost of those contracts via \n     market forces.\n       Under the guaranteed student loan program, all payment \n     levels are determined politically by Congress--not by the \n     free market. Here's just one example of the resulting built-\n     in profits: While the student is in school or during the six-\n     month grace period following school (a period averaging 2.5 \n     years for each loan), the lender does nothing but collect \n     interest directly from the government at 2.5 percent above \n     the Treasury-bill rate on paper that's as good as a Treasury \n     bill. It's a system of political entitlements, and any \n     conservative ought to prefer the competitive bidding system \n     under direct loans.\n       The Education Department says it can manage all direct \n     loans with only 400 employees. All important business \n     functions--loan origination, servicing, debt collection--are \n     handled by private firms, with Education Department \n     supervision.\n       But overseeing 7,100 guaranteed bank lenders takes 525 \n     Education Department employees and another 5,000 employees in \n     41 federally subsidized guaranty agencies. It's a \n     bureaucratic nightmare.\n       Congress can easily oversee the direct program because it \n     involves relatively few contractors, all of whom have have \n     incentives to do a good job in order to win additional \n     contracts.\n       But there's little supervision of the guaranteed program's \n     guaranty agencies. Congress isn't looking over their \n     shoulders because they're not federal entities. State \n     legislatures aren't interested because the guaranty agencies \n     aren't state-funded. And they have no stockholders to answer \n     to. Unsurprisingly, the result is abuse.\n       In one case, a guaranty agency's chief executive officer \n     earns $700,000 a year plus untold benefits. Some 15 other \n     employees in the same agency earn more than the U.S. \n     secretary of education. In another, board members set up a \n     for-profit corporation to provide services to the guaranty \n     agency that they controlled. More taxpayer money goes largely \n     unchecked in these agencies for platinum parachutes, perks, \n     lavish pensions, executive cadillacs and dining rooms and \n     retreats at posh resorts.\n       Little wonder the lending moguls want to kill direct \n     lending. Their cause is helped by various scoring errors \n     (including some they lobbied for) that make direct lending \n     look more expensive than guaranteed. The worse is the \n     assumption of a high long-term interest rate as the cost of \n     the federal funds used to make the direct loan. That would be \n     appropriate if the interest rate that student borrowers paid \n     were fixed, but it's not. It's variable, based on 91-day \n     Treasury bills; so these loans do not carry the kind of \n     interest-rate risk that a long-term rate discounts. Indeed, \n     no private bank treats variable-rate loans the way the \n     Congressional Budget Office treats direct student loans.\n       In general, it's inconceivable that a simpler program based \n     on competitive bidding could be more expensive than a vastly \n     more complex one based on politically negotiated \n     entitlements. Especially when the complex one actually \n     encourages defaults--because guaranty agencies get to keep 27 \n     cents of every dollar they collect after a default and their \n     costs for those collections average only 13 cents on the \n     dollar.\n       Some Republicans believe that if President Clinton supports \n     a program, that program must be opposed. Right now, Mr. \n     Clinton is telling the American people that the GOP Congress \n     is trying to shut down a conservative reform effort, which is \n     good for both students and schools, in order to keep the \n     gravy flowing to powerful special interests.\n       In this case, the president is right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S348-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DAPCEP\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Detroit Area Pre-College \nEngineering Program, Inc. [DAPCEP], is celebrating its 20th anniversary \nin this year. The organization was founded in 1976 with a grant from \nthe Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. DAPCEP's mission is ``to increase the \nnumber of minority students who are motivated and academically prepared \nto choose careers in science, engineering and technical fields.''\n  In its first year, 245 students took DAPCEP enrichment courses \noffered through 1 high school and 2 universities. Today, the \norganization serves more than 5,000 sixth through twelfth graders each \nyear, through a collaboration with 8 universities, 64 Detroit public \nmiddle schools and high schools, 30 local corporations, and an active \nparent group. DAPCEP also receives funding from the National Science \nFoundation, the State of Michigan, and the city of Detroit. Current \nDAPCEP programs include an in-school component with hands-on research, \nexperiments and science fairs; Saturday morning classes; and summer \nenrichment programs. DAPCEP also offers mentoring, tutoring, summer \njobs, scholarships, and teacher training.\n  DAPCEP was featured on the NBC ``Nightly News'' in April 1995 in a \nstory highlighting successful extracurricular enrichment programs. \nDAPCEP students captured 62 percent of the top awards given at the 1995 \nMetropolitan Detroit Science and Engineering Fair, one of the largest \nand most successful fairs in the Nation. Recognized nationally as a \nmodel for pre-college programs, DAPCEP was named by Crain's Detroit \nBusiness as the 1995 Best-Managed Nonprofit for nonprofits having \nbudgets larger than $2.5 million.\n  Through working to further the study of science and engineering for \nall, DAPCEP has made a great contribution to our local community and \nour country as a whole.

Mr. President, I have long been active in issues \nof importance for individuals suffering from a mental illness or \ndisability. Through my efforts in this area, I have become familiar \nwith the vast spectrum of these disorders, and I have found that we as \na society have much to learn about both the causes and cures for these \nillnesses. Knowledge of the medical conditions underpinning these \ndisorders has only recently begun to make progress by leaps and bounds, \nand I fear that public awareness and knowledge has not grown in step. \nBecause society is still unfamiliar with these advances, an aura of \nfear and suspicion persists with regard to any one of the illnesses or \ndisorders which afflict so many Americans. It is because of this \nwidespread lack of knowledge and understanding that I add my support in \nrecognition of the National Autism Society's designation of January as \n``National Autism Awareness Month.''\n  Autism is a neurological disorder that interrupts the brain's ability \nto process and understand information. Nearly 400,000 Americans suffer \nfrom this disorder, making it more prevalent than Down's syndrome or \nmuscular dystrophy.\n  Autism is a complex, spectrum disorder that manifests itself in many \nways. Symptoms and characteristics present themselves in a variety of \ncombinations, and no two children or adults are affected in the same \nway.\n  Autism is not curable, but it is treatable. Many types of treatments \nhave proven effective in combating this disorder, and improvements are \nbeing discovered every day.\n  A generation ago, nearly 90 percent of those suffering from autism \nwere placed in an institution. Today, group homes, assisted living \narrangements, and home care are much more common. Thanks to the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act, many children with autism \nreceive appropriate education and go on to become contributing members \nof the work force.\n  In April 1995, in response to direction from Congress, the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH] held a State-of-the-Sciences Conference on \nAutism. Conference participants included scientists, clinicians, and \nparents. The conference highlighted how far we have come in diagnosing \nand treating autism, but also illuminated how far we have yet to go. \nNational Autism Month is designed to bring attention to these issues, \nand seeks to further the Nation's understanding of this complicated and \ndebilitating disorder. I fully support the National Autism Society's \ndesignation of January as ``National Autism Awareness Month,'' I share \ntheir goal of teaching America more about this disorder, and I welcome \nmy colleagues' support as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/24/senate-section/article/S349-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S349-S350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking \nCommittee be immediately discharged from further consideration of S. \n1494, and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1494) to provide an extension for fiscal year \n     1996 for certain programs administered by the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge support for the Housing Opportunity \nProgram Extenders Act of 1995. This legislation is designed to provide \nHUD and Farmers Home with authority to continue certain housing \nprograms which are strongly supported by the American public.\n  Most importantly, similar to the VA/HUD fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations bill, this bill would require HUD to renew expiring \nsection 8 project-based contracts for fiscal year 1996 for 1 year at \ncurrent rents. There are some 900,000 FHA-insured units with section 8 \nproject-based assistance expiring over the next 10 years. Many of these \nsection 8 contracts are oversubsidized under existing contracts and \nfiscal responsibility requires that Congress contain the spiraling \ncosts associated with this inventory. Moreover, under a recent HUD \nlegal opinion, HUD may renew these expiring section 8 project-based \ncontracts at the market rent with some exceptions for contract rents up \nto 120 percent of the market rents; this means that these section 8 \nprojects will begin to default and face foreclosure by HUD during \nfiscal year 1996.\n  I believe it is critical that Congress reform and adjust the costs, \nincluding section 8 costs, of this assisted housing to the existing \nmarket rents. However, in doing so, we must balance the cost of the \nexpiring section 8 contracts with the cost of foreclosure of these \nprojects to the FHA insurance fund, as well as the significant social \npolicy of the possible displacement of low-income housing residents and \nthe disinvestment by project owners in these projects which could \nresult in significant deterioration of this valuable housing stock. \nLike the VA/HUD fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill, renewing these \nsection 8 contracts for 1 year will provide the Banking Committee with \nan opportunity to develop a dialog and resulting meaningful policy that \nwill preserve this valuable housing resource as low-income housing at a \nreasonable cost to the Federal Government.\n  Second, the legislation would extend the Home Equity Conversion \nMortgage Program through fiscal year 1996, increasing the maximum \nnumber of units eligible for insurance from 25,000 to 30,000. This \nprogram is designed to allow the elderly to tap the accumulated equity \nin their homes for needed expenses without the risk of losing the \nhousing as a principal residence. This is a successful program that is \ngrowing in popularity among the elderly population as an option to \nassist in providing continuing independence, both financially and \nthrough the continuing use of their homes as a principal resident.\n  Third, the legislation would extend the home ownership program under \nthe CDBG Program as a continuing eligible activity through fiscal year \n1996. This program is widely supported by a number of communities \nthroughout the Nation which use the program as an additional resource \nto expand homeownership opportunities.\n  Finally, the bill would extend the FmHA's section 515 rural \nmultifamily program for fiscal year 1996. Currently, the fiscal year \n1996 Agriculture appropriations has limited the section 515 funding for \nfiscal year 1996 to rehabilitation. However, there is a significant \nnumber of section 515 projects in the development pipeline. Section 515 \nprojects are, in many cases, the only available and affordable low-\nincome housing in rural areas. While there has been substantial \ncriticism leveled at abuses in the section 515 program, FmHA has \naddressed a number of the failings in the program and the Banking \nCommittee has pledged to review closely the section 515 program and \naddress any concerns as part of a major housing and community \ndevelopment overhaul and reform bill.\n  In addition, a manager's amendment to this bill legislation would \nincorporate Habitat for Humanity as an eligible organization under the \nNational Community Development Initiative [NCDI]. Habitat for Humanity \nis one of the best models in this country for the development of \naffordable low-income housing. The foundation of this program is sweat \nequity, where a potential homeowner must contribute their own labor and \nhard work to the construction of their home and the homes of others. In \nthis way, participating families develop a tangible bond with their \nhomes combined with a strong interest in maintaining them. Since 1976, \nHabitat has constructed over 40,000 homes worldwide, in every U.S. \nState and in 45 other countries. As a consequence, some 250,000 people \nare living in decent, safe and affordable housing.\n  Under this program, Habitat for Humanity would receive a $25 million \nauthorization to assist in the acquisition of land or infrastructure \nimprovements, and only in the United States. I urge HUD to develop \nflexible requirements for Habitat for Humanity's participation in NCDI \nwith deference to the underlying vision of homeowner contribution to \nthe construction of their home.\n  This manager's amendment also would provide clear statutory guidance \nto empower PHAs and assisted property owners with the tools to screen \nout and evict from public and assisted housing persons who illegally \nuse drugs or whose abuse of alcohol is a risk to other tenants. I \ncannot emphasize enough the need to take the bull by the horns and \nprovide real solutions to the problems created by alcohol abuse and \nillegal drug use in federally assisted housing.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is bipartisan, simple, \nstraightforward and necessary. I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3118\n\n               (Purpose: To make a series of amendments)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand that there is a managers' amendment at the \ndesk in behalf of Senators D'Amato, Mack, and Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] for Mr. D'Amato, \n     for himself, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3118.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 5, strike ``During fiscal year 1996'' and \n     insert the following: ``To the extent that amounts are made \n     available in advance in any appropriations act for contract \n     renewals under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 for fiscal year 1996''.\n       On page 2, line 11, insert ``project-based'' after ``for''.\n       On page 5, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following new \n     sections:\n\n     SEC. 7.
