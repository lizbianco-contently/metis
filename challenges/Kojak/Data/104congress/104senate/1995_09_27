Mr. President, whenever I have the pleasure of traveling \nin north Alabama, I try to visit Bessemer, AL, about a 15-minute drive \nfrom the city of Birmingham. One of the many attractions in Bessemer is \nthe Bright Star, one of our Nation's very best family-owned \nrestaurants. Its reputation has been built over the course of this \ncentury, with fresh seafood transported from the gulf coast daily, the \nfinest cuts of meat available, and the freshest vegetables and produce.\n  Actually, I have dined at many fine restaurants during my lifetime, \nbut I consider the Bright Star one of the world's very best. It is \ncertainly on a par with the finest restaurants in New Orleans, San \nFrancisco, Washington, New York, Paris, London, Athens, Vienna, Rome, \nBudapest, and Copenhagen. At one time, it had Alabama rivals in \nMontgomery's Elite Cafe and Mobile's Constantine's, but these are \nunfortunately no longer in existence.\n  The Bright Star is well-known for its many specialties, but its \nGreek-style red snapper is truly one of the most superb seafood dishes \nI have ever tasted. There are also a variety of steaks featured, and \nthe beef tenderloin--which is marinated in special herbs that the \nGreeks know how to combine and cook in a Mediterranean style--is simply \ndelicious. There is a variety of broiled and fried fish to choose from, \nas well as giant seafood platters. One of the specialties is a \ncombination lobster and crab meat au-gratin. The broiled seafood \nplatter is widely considered one of the very best to be found anywhere.\n  One can also enjoy Italian dishes at the Bright Star, such as \nspaghetti and other types of pasta. Their appetizers are most unique \nand some of the best include shrimp remoulade, shrimp arnaud, the crab \nclaw platter, and the seafood gumbo. They offer many varieties of \nsalads, but their Greek salad--with or without anchovies--is \nmagnificent. They also have many standard American dishes. Fried \nchicken and the veal cutlet with spaghetti are popular items on the \nmenu. The chefs have acquired a real knack for preparing vegetables \nsouthern-style. They serve everything from turnip greens to black-eyed \npeas. The desserts include all varieties, ranging from Greek pastries \nto homemade southern pies, like coconut cream and banana nut. \n\n[[Page S 14336]]\n\n  For a hungry person, there is a truly impressive variety of food to \nchoose from at the Bright Star. The Texas special--consisting of the \nGreek-style snapper, tenderloin of beef Greek-style, and the lobster \nand crab meat au-gratin--is an entree that does not escape the memory \nfor years to come.\n  Sunday lunch at the Bright Star is one of its busiest times. After \nchurch services, worshipers will flock from miles around, and sometimes \ndelay their Sunday lunch until 2:30 or 3 p.m. in the afternoon, in \norder to avoid the overflow crowd.\n  After a University of Alabama football game in Birmingham, fans who \nhave come up from Tuscaloosa will stop by on the way back after the \ngame. In years past, it was not uncommon to see legendary Alabama \nfootball figures like Coach Bear Bryant, Hank Crisp, and Frank Thomas. \nAt the Bright Star, political figures are frequent guests. On one \noccasion, I ran into Senator Shelby and former Congressman Claude \nHarris at separate tables.\n  The history of the Bright Star is rich and quintessentially American. \nIn 1907, Greek immigrant Tom Bonduris established the Bright Star. When \nits doors opened, it was only a small cafe with a horseshoe-shaped bar, \nbut it soon outgrew three locations, moving to its present site in \n1915. Bill Koikos and his brother, Peter, joined in the enterprise when \nthey emigrated from Greece in 1920. Customers were introduced to a new \ndining atmosphere, complete with ceiling fans, tile floors, mirrored \nand marbled walls, and murals painted by a European artist traveling \nthrough the area, all creating a pleasing effect reflective of that \nera. While major alterations have occurred since, the same early 20th-\ncentury-style atmosphere has been largely preserved.\n  The Bright Star's reputation and success are easily measured simply \nby the satisfaction of its clientele. A place like home was the kind of \nclimate fostered by Tom Bonduris in 1907 and kept alive today by the \nKoikos brothers and their descendants--Bill's wife, Anastasia, and \nchildren, Helen, Jimmy, and Nicholas.\n  As immigrants, Tom Bonduris and Bill and Peter Koikos knew little of \nthe English language and had few possessions when they arrived in this \ncountry, but they worked hard and learned to please their customers. By \nestablishing the Bright Star restaurant as a place of ``philotimo''--a \nplace of hospitality from the heart--the Koikos and Bonduris families \ndrew upon the culture and traditions of their ancestors, striking a \nresounding chord of acceptance with the public which has never faded. \nThey brought with them certain recipes from Greece, and the Koikos \nfamily has continued to use these and secret blends of herbs and spices \never since those early days to make their food unique.\n  Today, the Bright Star is wholly owned and run by the sons of Bill \nKoikos, Nick, and Jimmy. Nick oversees the general operations of the \nrestaurant, including the kitchen, and Jimmy serves as the greeter of \ntheir patrons and as the front man. Their sister, Helen, also plays an \nactive role, working as the cashier on Fridays and Sundays and \ngenerally helping out whenever she is needed. The Koikos family has \nmaintained a high level of commitment to hard work over the lifetime of \ntheir restaurant.\n  The employees of the Bright Star are an integral part of the family \nthere, and many of them have been with the restaurant for many years. I \nask unanimous consent that a list of the employees who have been with \nthe Bright Star for 10 years or more be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks. Among these are Gwendolyn Atkinson, an employee for 32 \nyears; Mary Sherrod, 46 years; Fannie Wright, 33 years; Walter Hoskins, \n28 years; and Nita Ray, 27 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the long, dedicated, and loyal service of \nthese employees is evidence of the type of employers the Koikos \nbrothers are and the type of family atmosphere they foster in their \nrestaurant.\n  As American citizens, business owners, and participants in the \ndemocratic process, this family has developed and maintained a \nreputation envied by all those who look to our shores for a new start \nin life. Today, Koikos family members are among the best to be found in \nBessemer--or anywhere, for that matter--and Alabama has an \nestablishment in which it can take great pride. Likewise, the United \nStates of America is a better nation because of the outstanding \ncontributions of those from other lands like the Koikos family, whose \nmission has been to contribute, and whose members believe that the \nAmerican dream can still be realized if one has the courage and \ndetermination to work toward that dream.\n  I congratulate all the members of the Koikos family on the tremendous \nsuccess of the Bright Star, and I personally look forward to enjoying \nmany more dining experiences there in the future. There are still many \nitems on the menu which I have not yet tried, but hope to sample soon.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Bright Star Employees of 10 Years or More\n\n       Gwendolyn Atkinson--32 years.\n       Betty Bailey--22 years.\n       Wanda Little--11 years.\n       Mary Sherrod--46 years.\n       Robert Moore--11 years.\n       Dorothy Patton--19 years.\n       Felisa Tolbert--16 years.\n       Carl Thomas--18 years.\n       Fannie Wright--33 years.\n       Aareen Tolbert--16 years.\n       Angela Sellers--13 years.\n       Marlon Tanksley--13 years.\n       Walter Hoskins--28 years.\n       Brenda Adams--12 years.\n       Fumiko Adams--19 years.\n       Elizabeth Gardner--19 years.\n       Nita Ray--27 years.\n       Rita Weems--12 years.\n       Anne Mull--15 years.\n       Marie Jackson--20 years.\n       Sarah Marshall--10 years.\n       Anthony Ross--10 years.\n       Faye Kelley--12 years.\n       Dale Ware--10 years.\n       Jerome Walker--10 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14335-6", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LOU WHITAKER AND ALAN TRAMMELL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two \noutstanding athletes from my home State of Michigan. They deserve our \nrespect not only for their athletic achievements, which are \nconsiderable, but for their professional conduct and dedication to \ntheir community.\n  In an age when professional athletes move from city to city, it is \nrefreshing to talk about these two men. Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell \nhave been the second baseman and shortstop, respectively, for the \nDetroit Tigers for 19 years. They have played in more than 1,915 games \ntogether. That is more than any other set of teammates in the history \nof the American League.\n  We can, and should, admire their achievements on the field. Alan \nTrammell has won four Golden Glove Awards, been selected for the All-\nStar game six times, and was voted the Most Valuable Player in the 1984 \nWorld Series. Lou Whitaker was voted American League Rookie of the Year \nin 1978, has won three Golden Glove Awards, and has played on four All-\nStar teams. More uniquely, he is one of only two second basemen in \nhistory to have played in 2,000 games, had over 2,000 hits, and over \n200 homeruns. I expect that Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker will one day \nbe inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame for these achievements.\n  Even more though, we should admire their dedication and loyalty to a \nteam and a town--attributes that seem increasingly scarce today. Since \n1976, they have been a part of Detroit. I have seen many games where \nTram and Lou have turned the double play that has become their \nhallmark. The amazing thing to consider is the millions of fans in \nMichigan and across the country that have seen that same feat.\n  Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker, through their consistent performance \nand grace, have given something special to the people of our State. For \nthat they deserve our admiration and our thanks. They will always have \na special place in the hearts of millions who have cheered their feats \non and off the field.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14336-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14336-S14337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        A RESPONSE TO ABC NEWS' VIEWS OF THE EARLY ROMAN SENATE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, modern-day life expectancy now tops seventy \n\n[[Page S 14337]]\n\nyears. Compare that to the life expectancy during the days of the Roman \nEmpire, when the average Roman citizen could expect to live \napproximately 22 years (June 13, 1994, Gannett News Service). Twenty-\ntwo years--an amazing fact, especially when we consider that today, one \nmust attain the age of 25 before serving in the United States House of \nRepresentatives and the ripe old age of 30 before contemplating service \nin the United States Senate.\n  I mention this not as a point of interest, however, but to underscore \nthe fact that the august members of the Roman Senate--many of whom were \nin their thirties or forties--were, indeed, the ``senior citizens'' of \ntheir time.\n  Recently, ABC News aired a story in which they questioned the \naccuracy of two passages in my book, The Senate of the Roman Republic. \nThe reporter of this news segment chose to take issue with my assertion \nthat ``the Roman Senate, as originally created was meant to be made up \nof a body of old men.'' What ABC News failed to mention, however, was \nthe average life expectancy for that period of time--a mere twenty-two \nyears. If the ABC reporter had just looked up the word senate in \nWebster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, he would have \nseen that the very definition of senate is ``literally, an assembly of \nold men or elders * * * '' Further, when Flavius Eutropius, a fourth-\ncentury historian, was writing of the origin of Rome, he made reference \nto Romulus' creation of the first senate, `` * * * he chose a hundred \nof the older men * * * whom, from their age, he named senators.''\n  In addition, ABC disputed my claim with respect to the Roman Senate's \nveto power. As the following excerpts from noted historians will \nattest, this power of the Senate ebbed and flowed from time to time, \nbut in the main, the Senate preserved, directly or indirectly, its \nauthority and power of ratification or veto over the actions of Roman \nassemblies. I believe my case is made by the following quotes from \nprominent historians.\n--A History of the Roman People (1962) by Heichelheim and Yeo:\n\n       The senate possessed still another ancient source of \n     authority summed by the phrases auctoritas patrum, which gave \n     it the power to ratify resolutions of the popular assembly \n     before enactment.\n\n  --A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions (1963) by \n    Frank Frost Abbott:\n\n       This view that the senate was the ultimate source of \n     authority was the aristocratic theory of the constitution \n     down to the end of the republican period. . .\n\n     \n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n       Between 449 and 339, then, in the case of both the comitia \n     centuriata and the concilium plebis, a bill, in order to \n     become a law, required, first, favorable action by the \n     popular assembly, then the sanction of the patrician \n     senators. . . . Now one clause of the Publilian law, as we \n     have already seen, provided that in the case of the \n     centuriate comitia the auctoritas patrum should precede \n     the action of the comitia.''\n\n  --Roman Political Institutions from City to State (1962) by Leon \n    Homo:\n\n       The Senate.--Lastly, the Senate, the stronghold of the \n     Patriciate, which it permanently represented, enjoyed a still \n     more complete right of control. In elections and in voting of \n     laws alike, the decision of the Centuriate Assembly must, to \n     be fully valid and to produce its legal effects, be ratified \n     afterwards by the Senate (auctoritas Patrum). Refusal of the \n     Senate to ratify was an absolute veto; it made every decision \n     of the Comitia Centuriata null and void, and they had no \n     legal recourse against it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       So, through the Consuls, the Senatorial oligarchy \n     recovered, in indirect but effective form, the veto, the \n     auctoritas Patrum, of which the Lex Hortensia had deprived \n     it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       . . . the  Senate, in losing its right of veto, . . . \n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Sulla, in the course of his Dictatorship, restored its [the \n     Senate's] old right of veto, but it was only for a short \n     time.\n\n  --A History of the Roman World 753-146 BC (1980) by H.H. Scullard, \n    FBA, FSA:\n\n       Though the Senate was a deliberative body which discussed \n     and need not vote on business, it had the right to veto all \n     acts of the assembly which were invalid without senatorial \n     ratification.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In all branches of government the Roman people was supreme, \n     but in all the Senate overshadowed them: ``senatus populusque \n     Romanus'' was not an idle phrase.\n\n  --A History of Rome to A.D. 565 (1965) by Arthur E.R. Boak, Ph.D. and \n    William G. Sinnigen, Ph.D.:\n\n       The Senate also acquired the right to sanction or to veto \n     resolutions passed by the Assembly, which could not become \n     laws without the Senate's approval.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       During the early years of the Republic, the only Assembly \n     of the People was the old Curiate Assembly of the regal \n     period. . . . Its powers were limited to voting, for it did \n     not have the right to initiate legislation or to discuss or \n     amend measures that were presented to it. Its legislative \n     power, furthermore, was limited by the Senate's right of \n     veto.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The legislative power of the Centuries was limited for a \n     long time, however, by the veto power of the patrician \n     senators (the patrum auctoritas), who had to ratify measures \n     passed by the assembly before they became law. This \n     restriction was practically removed by the Publilian Law \n     (339), which required the patres to ratify in advance \n     proposals that were to be presented to this assembly.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Hence it was called the Council of Plebs (concilium \n     plebis) and not the Tribal Assembly. Its resolutions, \n     called plebiscites, were binding on plebeians only; but, \n     from the late fourth century at least, if the resolutions \n     were approved by the Senate, they became valid for all \n     Romans. In the course of the fourth century the consuls \n     began to summon for legislative purposes an assembly that \n     virtually duplicated the Council of the Plebs but was \n     called the Tribal Assembly (comitia tributa) because it \n     was presided over by a magistrate with imperium and was \n     open to all citizens. It voted in the same way as the \n     Council of the Plebs and its laws were subject to the veto \n     power of the Senate.\n\n  --A History of Rome to the Battle of Actium (1894) by Evelyn Shirley \n    Shuckburgh, M.A.:\n\n       . . . the second ordered the auctoritas of the fathers \n     (that is, a resolution of the Senate) to be given beforehand \n     in favor of laws passed in the centuriate assembly . . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       It took from the senators the power of stopping the passing \n     of a law in the centuriate assembly, . . .\n\n  Mr. President, though these two matters may seem trivial and \ninsignificant to some, I did want to take this opportunity to assure \nthe readers of my book, The Senate of the Roman Republic, that the \nconclusions drawn are based on a great deal of study on my part. Over \nthe course of many years of research, I have gleaned information, not \nonly from esteemed modern scholars in Roman history, but also from the \nactual historians of the time. My reference to the Roman Senate as an \nassembly of old men and to the veto power of the Roman Senate was \ngarnered from these authorities. I recognize that history is sometimes \nsubject to interpretation; therefore, one can only assume that this may \nhave been the premise for the ABC News story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14336-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Under the previous order, there are 4 minutes \nequally divided for debate, and a vote will follow that 4 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2784\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, speaking as a proponent of the \namendment, this amendment would strike a provision in the bill which \ncuts off disability compensation to certain veterans who are disabled \nby reason of mental problems. It cuts off their savings when they reach \n$25,000. We do that for no other veteran. We do that for nobody else in \nthe country, as far as I know.\n  The amendment is funded by limiting any tax cut under the budget \nresolution to families earning less than $100,000.\n  Madam President, there is no justification whatever for singling out \nmentally disabled people for discriminatory treatment. There is none.\n  If these veterans are disabled, we as a nation have said that they \nare entitled to disability compensation--entitled to it. It is in the \nlaw. We have not said they are entitled to compensation only if they \nare poor. We have not said they are entitled to compensation only if \nthey have savings less than $25,000. We have not said they are entitled \nto compensation only if they have no sources of funds from anywhere \nelse.\n  They are entitled to compensation. We have said that they are \nentitled because of their disability. Are we prepared to say now, for \nsome reason, that mentally disabled people are somehow less entitled as \nveterans, solely because they are disabled?\n  This Senator is not; hence, my amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nwaive the Budget Act and then to strike this provision which \ndiscriminates against mentally disabled veterans.\n  Mr. President, during last evening's debate on my amendment to strike \nthe provision from the appropriations bill which provides for a cutoff \nof compensation to mentally disabled veterans when their savings reach \na certain level, we were operating then under a limited time agreement, \nwhich I accepted in the interests of moving the progress of the bill. \nHowever, there were a number of points made during that debate which \nshould not go unanswered, so I am making this further statement to \ndescribe more fully my views on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, one point that was made a number of times during the \ndebate was that the mentally incompetent veterans we are talking about \nhave all of their needs taken care of by VA. I am not certain what \npoint was being made, but I think it is vital to note that the \nindividuals that are covered by this amendment are not under VA care. \nHowever their needs are being addressed, it is not a result of VA \nactivity except to the extent that the veterans use their compensation \npayments to pay for care.\n  Another point that must be addressed relates to the relationship of \nthose who might receive some of the veteran's estate at the time of the \nveteran's death. As I noted in my statement last evening, it is \ncertainly possible that some remote heirs might benefit from a mentally \nincapacitated veteran's estate. However, the only thing this provision \nensures is that the veteran's estate will be diminished unless the \nveteran has dependents. There is nothing in the provision which limits \nits effect to noncaring, distant relatives. The existence of a loving, \ncaring nondependent child who sees the veteran daily would not be \nsufficient to keep this provision from taking effect. It would be \ntriggered in any case in which there are no dependents.\n  Mr. President, the suggestion was made that this provision is \nnecessary in order to keep remote heirs from inheriting the estates of \nmentally disabled veterans. I note that no evidence was cited to \nsupport the proposition, nor is there any evidence that I am aware of, \nthat would demonstrate that a mentally impaired veteran is any more \nlikely to leave an estate to remote heirs than a mentally competent \none. It is important to highlight that the VA process relating to a \ndeclaration of incompetency does not mean that a veteran does not have \nthe ability to execute a valid will.\n  This concern about so-called remote heirs would apply to any disabled \nveteran who dies without a will. Any veteran--mentally disabled or \notherwise--who is able to execute a will and who does so should not \nhave limitations on who can be named as beneficiary under the will, nor \nany restriction on the amount of the estate that can pass under the \nwill. If there is a governmental interest in restricting inheritance of \nestates, any part of which is made up of VA compensation--and let me be \nclear, I do not believe that there is--then it must apply equally to a \ndisabled veteran who is not mentally incompetent.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the original enactment of this \nprovision was challenged by the Disabled American Veterans in a lawsuit \nin 1991.\n  The Federal court that heard the case--and which declared that \noriginal enactment unconstitutional--noted that the limitation did not \naffect the payment of compensation to between 95 to 98 percent of the \ndisabled veterans who have no dependents. It hardly makes sense or can \nbe defended that this small group of mentally disabled veterans should \nbe singled out for this treatment.\n  Mr. President, the only characteristic that distinguishes the class \nof veterans that is being singled out in this legislation is their \nmental injury or disease. Perhaps some believe that these veterans are \nless likely to object to such governmental intrusion into their lives, \nbut that is hardly a basis for this sort of legislation which takes \naway compensation to which the veterans are entitled.\n  Mr. President, it is worth noting that about 85 percent of estates \nleft by mentally incompetent veterans are inherited by close family \nmembers. While these individuals may or may not be dependents, that \nshould hardly disqualify them from inheriting the veterans' estates. \nIndeed, it is very often these individuals--parents, nondependent \nchildren, brothers and sisters, other close family members--who have \nmade significant personal sacrifices to care for the veteran during the \nveteran's lifetime.\n  Mr. President, it should be noted that the estates of mentally \ndisabled veterans are frequently made up of funds from sources other \nthan VA benefits, and the effect of this provision would be to require \nthese veterans to reduce the overall value of their estates in order to \ncontinue to receive the compensation which is their due.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is this: No matter what arguments are \nput forward in an attempt to justify this provision, in the end it can \nonly be seen as what it is--rank discrimination against mentally \ndisabled veterans. It is unworthy of the Congress and should be \nrejected.\n  Mr. President, I am aware of the two reports--a 1982 GAO report and a \n1988 VA inspector general report--that are cited as the justification \nfor this provision. While it may be argued that some support for this \nprovision may be found in one or both of these reports, I think that a \ncloser examination will show that this reliance is misplaced.\n  For example, Mr. President, neither report provided evidence that \nmentally disabled veterans accumulate more assets than other veterans. \nNor did either report find a basis for distinguishing mentally disabled \nveterans from all other disabled veterans on the issue of the \ndisposition of their estates or as to any other element related to \ntheir VA compensation. In fact, neither report looks at competent \nveterans.\n  Both reports assumed, with no basis, that mentally disabled veterans \ndo not have wills. This is simply not true.\n  Neither report studied mentally competent veterans to learn how they \ndispose of their estates.\n  The GAO report looked at a small sample--only four regional offices--\nhardly a sufficient basis on which to make so sweeping a change in VA \ncompensation policy.\n  With respect to the inspector general's report, my colleagues may not \nknow that the IG did not recommend that compensation payments to \nmentally incompetent veterans be stopped, but rather recommended that \nthe compensation payments be paid into a special trust fund on behalf \nof the veterans.\n  Mr. President, in essence, this provision is establishing a means \ntest for \n\n[[Page S 14339]]\none very small group of veterans, and doing so on a very scant record. \nI know that both the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees \nsupported this provision in OBRA 90. We made a mistake then, and \nnowhere is that demonstrated more clearly than in the district court \nopinion in the suit brought by DAV.\n  Our committee could have repeated the mistake in this Congress as we \nworked to meet our reconciliation mandate. We did not. The Senate \nshould not do so either.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of the \nRockefeller amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its \nadoption. This is a simple amendment, and its passage will send an \nimportant message to America's veterans that we will not forget our \nobligations to them.\n  Veteran's medical care accounts for nearly half of the budget of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. It provides for the care and treatment \nof eligible beneficiaries in VA hospitals, nursing homes, and \noutpatient facilities. When you walk down the halls VA hospitals like \nthe one in White River Junction, VT, you see the proud faces and \nshattered bodies of men who have given more to their country than just \nlip-service and taxes. I say men because the overwhelming majority of \nthese veterans are men, although the number of women veterans is \nrising.\n  Mr. President, if there is one area where everyone can agree that the \nFederal Government has a compelling role, it is in the care of our \nNation's service disabled and indigent veterans. It is the Federal \nGovernment which raises armies and the Federal Government which sends \nour young people off to war. It is the Federal Government which is \nobligated to take care of veterans after the shooting stops.\n  The appropriations bill before us cuts the VA medical care account \n$511 million below the President's request. No one can stand in front \nof this body and say that these cuts are not going to affect veterans, \nbecause the fact is that they will. They will make a difference in the \nservices provided at White River Junction and at VA hospitals across \nthe country. This amendment restores the medical care fund back to the \nPresident's request, and uses the funds from Republican tax cuts to pay \nfor it.\n  Everyone in this body is familiar with the $245 billion in tax cuts \nthat have been proposed by the Republican leadership. I have been \nagainst these cuts from the start, because more than half of the \nbenefits go toward those who make more than $100,000 a year. Let me \ntell you, I do not hear from too many Vermonters making that much money \nthat say they need a tax cut. I would consider supporting tax cuts that \ntarget the lower and middle class, but not this one. By voting for this \namendment, we are putting our spending priorities back where they \nbelong, and that is on providing services for the veterans who have \nearned them.\n  I think more people around the Senate should heed the words of \nAbraham Lincoln, which are chiseled on a plaque at the Veterans \nAdministration building a few blocks from here. These words ring as \ntrue today as they did in the aftermath of the bloody Civil War: ``To \ncare for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his \norphan.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I am very proud to be an original \ncosponsor, I say to my colleagues, of both of these amendments. There \nis, I think, a very, very direct question for each Senator to answer. \nIn exchange for agreeing not to have any tax giveaways for individuals, \nfamilies with incomes under $100,000 a year, we will make sure that we \ndo not put into effect an egregious practice of mean testing \ncompensation for veterans that are struggling with mental illness, \nservice-connected.\n  As the Secretary has said, Jesse Brown, I think one of the best \nSecretaries we have, the only difference between veterans that are \nmentally incapacitated and physically is those that are mentally quite \noften cannot speak for themselves. This would be a terrible and cruel \nthing if we now have this unequal treatment.\n  Finally, Madam President, to be able to restore $511 million so we \nkeep a quality of inpatient and outpatient care, that is what this is \nabout; not the tax giveaways for those with high incomes and a \ncommitment to veterans.\n  These are two extremely important amendments that represent a litmus \ntest for all of us.\n  Madam President, I am pleased and proud to be an original cosponsor \nof the two amendments to H.R. 2099, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1996 that specifically concern our Nation's veterans. My \ndistinguished colleagues who are cosponsoring this amendment are to be \ncongratulated for their efforts to ensure veterans' access to quality \nVA health care is not seriously compromised and to protect some \nmentally incompetent veterans who are being targeted for \ndiscriminatory, arbitrary, and shameful cuts in VA compensation.\n  Madam President, while these amendments address two different \nissues--veterans health care and compensation for the most vulnerable \ngroup of American veterans--they are prompted by one basic concern. Our \npressing need to balance the budget. Unfortunately this pressing need \nis being used to justify unequal sacrifice. Veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities and indigent veterans, many of whom earned their \nVA benefits at great cost on bloody battlefields are seeing those \nbenefits whittled away, while the most affluent of our citizens are \nexempted from sacrifice. Instead of being asked to share the pain, the \nwealthy seemingly are supposed to contribute to balancing the budget by \naccepting substantial tax cuts. What kind of shared sacrifice is this?\n  I believe that one of the great strengths of these amendments is that \nthey make a significant contribution to righting the balance. The $511 \nmillion that would be restored to the medical care account to enable \nthe VA to meet veterans health care needs and the $170 million that is \nneeded to ensure that all mentally ill veterans continue to receive \nunrestricted compensation are to be offset by limiting any tax cuts \nprovided in the reconciliation bill to families with incomes of less \nthan $100,000.\n  Our Nation's veterans are prepared to sacrifice for the good of this \ncountry as they have done so often in the past, but only if the \nsacrifices they are asked to make are: First, equitable; second, \nreasonable; and third, essential. Clearly, these sacrifices that \nservice-connected--particularly mentally incompetent veterans--and \nindigent veterans are being asked to make meet none of these essential \ncriteria.\n  Madam President, before I conclude I would like to discuss each of \nthe amendments. One of the amendments would restore to the medical care \naccount $511 million cut from the President's budget for fiscal year \n1996. While there may be some doubt as to the validity of VA \nprojections of the precise impact of such a cut on veterans health \ncare, there is little doubt that it would result in some combination of \nsubstantial reductions in the number of veterans treated both as \noutpatients and inpatients as the number of VA health care personnel \nshrink. According to the VA, this cut could have an impact that is \nequivalent to closing some sizable VA medical facilities.\n  While not directly related to this amendment but related to the \nquality of VA health care generally, this bill also would eliminate all \nmajor medical construction projects requested by the President. In the \nprocess, some projects involving VA hospitals that do not meet \ncommunity standards and are deteriorating would not be funded. How can \nwe treat veterans in facilites that do not meet fire and other safety \nstandards? In obsolete facilities that lack separate rest rooms and \ndressing room areas for men and women veterans? This is a travesty and \nno way to treat those who have defended our country. Our veterans do \nnot deserve such shabby and undignified treatment and I will do all in \nmy power to see that this shameful situation ends. I hope that all of \nmy colleagues will join me in this long overdue effort.\n  Madam President, as I pointed out at a Veterans' Affairs Committee \nhearing a few months ago these cuts could not come at a worse time. We \nare now talking about cutting $270 billion over the next 7 years from \nMedicare and making deep cuts in Medicaid. This could lead to a much \ngreater demand for VA services precisely at a time when VA health care \ncapabilities are eroding. Would the VA be able to cope with an \n\n[[Page S 14340]]\ninflux of elderly and indigent veterans eligible for health care, but \ncurrently covered by Medicare or Medicaid? There sometimes is much talk \nabout a declining veterans population, but much less about an aging \nveterans population--one that disproportionately requires expensive and \nintensive care. What happens if this population grows even more as a \nresult of Medicare and Medicaid cuts? Before veterans fall victim to \nthe law of unintended consequences, I strongly urge my colleagues to \ngive careful consideration to the cumulative impact on veterans health \ncare of such concurrent cuts in Federal health care funding.\n  Regarding the other Rockefeller amendment, I was frankly appalled \nwhen I learned that both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 2099 \ninclude a provision that limits compensation benefits for mentally \nincompetent veterans without dependents but does not limit benefits for \nphysically incapacitated veterans without dependents--or any other \nclass of veterans for that matter. As I understand it, compensation for \nservice-connected disabilities paid to mentally incompetent veterans \nwithout dependents would be terminated when the veteran's estate \nreached $25,000 and not reinstated until the veteran's estate fell to \n$10,000.\n  Such unequal treatment is outrageous and indefensible. How can we \ndiscriminate against veterans who became disabled while serving their \ncountry only because they are mentally ill. In eloquent and informative \ntestimony before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs Jessie Brown, who I regard as an outstanding Cabinet \nofficer and a singularly tenacious and effective advocate for veterans, \npointed out that the only difference between veterans who have lost \nboth arms and legs and those who have a mental condition as a result of \ncombat fatigue, is that the latter group cannot defend themselves. \nMoreover, the Secretary stressed, we are not only talking about \nveterans who seem to have no organic basis for their mental illness, \nbut also veterans who were shot in the head on the battlefield and as a \nresult of brain damage cannot attend to their own affairs. And, I might \nadd that to make matters worse, this provision amounts to means-tested \ncompensation that applies to only one class of veterans--the mentally \nill. I am aware that such a provision was enacted in OBRA 1990 and \nwithstood court challenge, but the fact that it was held to be \nconstitutional makes it no less abhorrent. Fortunately Congress had the \ngood sense to let this onerous provision expire in 1992.\n  Victimizing the most vulnerable of our veterans while providing tax \ncuts to our wealthiest citizens smacks of afflicting the afflicted \nwhile comforting the comfortable. I urge my colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle to support the Rockefeller amendment on this subject.\n  Finally, Madam President, I am very proud to be a Member of the \nSenate, the oldest democratically elected deliberative body in the \nworld. But I am sure the last thing any of you would want is for this \ngreat deliberative body to merely rubber stamp ill-advised actions by \nthe House and in the case of the VA medical account to make matters \neven worse by appropriating $327 million less than was appropriated by \nthe House.\n  The veterans health care and compensation protected by these two \namendments are by no means handouts, but entitlements earned by men and \nwomen who put their lives on the line to defend this great country. \nThey are part and parcel of America's irrevocable contract with its \nveterans, a contract that long predates the Contract With America we \nhave heard so much about recently.\n  I have a deep commitment to Minnesota veterans to protect the \nveterans benefits they have earned and are entitled to and in \ncosponsoring these amendments I am keeping my faith with them. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting both amendments.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, thank you very much.\n  We should be clear about a couple of things. The money is not \nnecessary to take care of incompetent veterans. These veterans are \nbeing taken care of through the Veterans Administration system.\n  They can keep up to $25,000 of their estate, but beyond that we are \nsaying, as the House did, that we should not continue to build up their \nestate. These are people that do not have a spouse. They do not have a \ndependent child or dependent parent. This money simply goes to \nnondependent heirs when these incompetent veterans die.\n  We had to make tough choices in putting this bill together because of \nthe limits of funds. Madam President, $170 million that would have gone \ninto the estates of these veterans goes to veterans' medical care.\n  Now, the solution offered by my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia is to rely on a phony offset. Everybody in this Senate knows \nthat there is no tax cut in this budget. He proposes to offset it \nagainst a tax cut. It is not there.\n  What this budget waiver does is ask our colleagues to waive the \nBudget Act, to give up on balancing the budget, to forget about our \npromise to the American people to end the deficit in the year 2002.\n  This is the ultimate budget buster. This is where the opponents of \nbalancing the budget start the effort to unravel the budget agreement. \nIt is a typical liberal solution--we will not make choices. If they \nwere serious about getting this money back for these veterans, they \nwould have offered a real offset and made choices as we have to do in \nthe appropriations process.\n  They did not. They said, ``Let's bust the budget. Let's have the \nultimate estate builder plan, putting money into the veterans' \nestates,'' not to go to their heirs, but putting it on the credit cards \nof our children and grandchildren.\n  I urge my colleagues not to waive the Budget Act on this matter.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be included \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The pending question is \non agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act for the consideration \nof amendment No. 2784, offered by the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted, yeas 47, nays 53 , as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 465 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 47, the nays are \n53. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion to waive the Budget Act is not agreed \nto. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  \n[[Page S 14341]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the remaining stacked votes be \nreduced to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2785\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes equally divided on the pending question.\n  The pending question is another motion to waive the Budget Act, \namendment No. 2785, offered by the Senator from West Virginia. The \nSenator will have 2 minutes and the Senator from Missouri will have 2 \nminutes. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized as soon as the \nSenate comes to order.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  This amendment would provide funding for veterans' health care at the \nlevel requested by the President, which is $16.96 billion, and would \noffset the $511 million increase that that represents by limiting any \ntax cut under the budget resolution to families that earn less than \n$100,000.\n  Again, I think this choice is a simple one. The President simply \nwanted to keep the funding for veterans' health care services--the \npeople whom we have said have a special entitlement to health care \nservices--consistent with inflation. And it is not even health care \ninflation. It is regular inflation, which is 3.4 percent. Health care \ninflation is almost double that.\n  And so the President's request is below what is truly needed. We are \nalready reducing veterans' health care, but the Senate has reduced it \nway, way below, and the result will be that we will close some veterans \nhospitals, that we will deny eligible veterans both inpatient and \noutpatient care, well over 100,000 of them; and interestingly and \nimportantly, in an organization, that is fighting to hold on to its \nbest health care people, we will lose 6,500 Veterans Affairs' health \ncare professionals. I think this is an unsustainable proposition, and I \nthink the President sought only a modest increase. It was not even an \ninflationary increase in the real terms of health care.\n  I hope that the motion to waive the Budget Act will be sustained, and \nI request the yeas and the nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield 1 minute to the chairman of the \nVeterans' Committee, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I chair the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. It is always remarkable to have to come here to the floor \nand get into a debate that somehow reflects that we do not take care of \nour veterans in America.\n  When I came to this committee, we were giving veterans $20 billion. \nIn this proposal, it is now close to $40 billion. Everything we have \ndone with veterans health care has gone up. We have more nurses; we \nhave more doctors. Remember this figure if you will, please. Madam \nPresident, 90 percent of the health care goes to non-service-connected \ndisability--90 percent non-service-connected disability--not service-\nconnected disability. This is a serious issue. If anyone can believe we \ndo not take care of the veterans of the United States, please drop by \nmy office. The occupancy rates at the hospitals are going down. The \npopulation is going down and the budget is going up, just as it should \nbe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. So veterans are well taken care of. This is an assault \non the budget process.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, only inside the Beltway would a $285 \nmillion increase in veterans medical care be attacked as a cut. In a \nvery difficult time we allocated $285 million more for veterans medical \ncare to assure that they can provide the care that is needed for \nveterans.\n  To say that this is being offset by a tax cut is more phony baloney. \nIt is an effort to break the budget agreement. We had to make choices. \nIf the proponents were serious about increasing money even more than we \nhave for veterans medical care, they would have come up with a real \noffset.\n  Be clear about it: A vote to waive the Budget Act does not improve \nveterans health care; it merely busts the budget agreement and puts a \ngreater deficit on the American economy and a greater burden on our \nchildren and our grandchildren who will have to bear the expense.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 51, nays 49.\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 466 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this the vote, the ayes are 51, the nays \nare 49. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion to waive the Budget Act is \nrejected. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was rejected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2786\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 2786, \noffered by the Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus]. There are 4 minutes \nfor debate to be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It provides \nthat no rider to this appropriations bill would take effect if it would \nweaken protection of human health and the environment. It is designed \nto send a strong message, particularly to the House, that we should not \nuse appropriations bills for a back-door attack on environmental \nprotection.\n  Last night, Senator Bond argued that the bill gives unfettered \ndiscretion to EPA and might even be unconstitutional. I might say to my \ncolleagues, I checked with the Justice Department. The Justice \nDepartment has reviewed the amendment and concluded that the amendment \nis constitutional. So that is not a problem.\n  It is also aimed only at a set of specific rifle-shot riders, and if \nthe administrator, under the amendment, invalidates a particular rider, \nthe administrator would be fully bound by all of the terms and \nconditions of the underlying law.\n  Let me remind everyone why this amendment is necessary. We need to \nreform our environmental laws, to make them not only strong but smart. \nBut the appropriations bill, and particularly the House, is not \nenvironmental reform. It contains riders that roll back, eliminate \nenvironmental laws. For example, it eliminates the \n\n[[Page S 14342]]\nGreat Lakes initiative; it eliminates rules for toxic air emissions \nfrom hazardous waste incinerators and refineries; it eliminates \nenforcement of the wetlands program. In the Environment & Public Works \nCommittee, we are dealing with the wetlands program, working to reform \nit. This rider eliminates it. It eliminates rules that control \ndischarge of raw sewage into public waters. The list of riders goes on.\n  The Senate bill takes a much more moderate approach, and I compliment \nthe Senator from Missouri for doing so. But we have to send a strong \nmessage to the conferees: We should not load up this bill with riders \nthat would threaten the health and quality of American families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I oppose the \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Murray and \nWellstone be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the level of funding for EPA and the \nlegislative riders contained in this bill mean one thing for the \ncitizens of our Nation: a lower quality of life. To a large degree, the \nquality of our lives depends on the integrity of our environment; the \nquality of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil we farm \nand live on. For the last 25 years EPA has set out to improve and \nguarantee the quality of life for all Americans by cleaning up our air, \nwater, and soil and keeping them clean. But with inadequate funding and \ncongressionally mandated caveats and barriers, our people and our \nenvironment will no longer be adequately protected.\n  We all need water to live. We are, in fact, 60 percent water \nourselves. Clean water is essential to our survival. But riders in this \nbill would prevent EPA from protecting Americans from drinking water \ncontaminants that are known to be harmful. Because of this bill, the \npublic will continue to be exposed to contaminants like arsenic, radon, \nand the microbe cryptosporidium.\n  Arsenic is a known carcinogen. The current arsenic rule, implemented \nin 1942, poses a 1 in 50 cancer risk--10,000 times worse than is \ngenerally considered acceptable. By preventing EPA from issuing a final \narsenic rule, this bill will allow over 30 million Americans to \ncontinue to drink arsenic-laced drinking water every day.\n  The same is true of radon. Drinking water containing radioactive \nradon is known to cause cancer. Controlling radon in drinking water \nwill prevent hundreds of cancers. Over 40 million people will continue \nto drink radon-contaminated water unless EPA is allowed to act.\n  In 1994, a cryptosporidium outbreak in a contaminated well in Walla \nWalla, WA, sickened or hospitalized dozens of people. A groundwater \ndisinfection rule would likely have prevented this outbreak. But this \nbill would prohibit EPA from requiring any groundwater to be treated to \nkill parasites.\n  We also need clean air to breathe. But this bill requires EPA to \nreevaluate the standards it has imposed on the oil refinery industry to \nutilize the Most Available Control Technology [MACT] to control \nemissions from valves and pumps. These leaks account for as much as \none-half of total refinery emissions. Industry requested this rider \nbecause they believe that emissions have been overestimated. However, \nthe estimated emissions of toxic pollutants from a medium-sized \nrefinery are 240 tons per year, almost 10 times greater than the \nminimum statutory definition of a ``major source'' of toxic air \npollution subject to the same control measures. It seems unlikely that \nEPA has made such a tremendous overestimation of emissions.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the report accompanying this bill contains a \nprovision that will certainly delay cleanup of a Superfund landfill in \nmy State of Washington. This landfill is located on the Tulalip Indian \nReservation in an estuary of Puget Sound and is disgorging contaminants \ndirectly into the sound. The language in this report directs EPA to do \nmore studies and engage in more discussion in the hopes the agency will \nnot implement its presumptive remedy of capping the site. While I agree \nthat the cost to these powerful PRP's might be high, the cost to the \npeople who live around the sound, or eat fish from the sound, or \nrecreate in the Sound is much higher. I have tried to get the committee \nor the provision's sponsor to insert language that forced the PRP's and \nEPA to act quickly to stop this seeping mess, but I was not entirely \nsuccessful. The sponsor promises this will not delay cleanup and that \nthese studies and discussions will be completed within fiscal year \n1996. I, and the people who want a clean Puget Sound, can only hope \nthat is the case.\n  Mr. President, we must remain committed to improving and protecting \nthe quality of life for the citizens of our Nation. This means \nprotecting the environment. I urge my colleagues to support efforts to \nincrease funding for EPA and to strip the legislative riders from this \nbill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nBaucus' amendment because it assures that no provision in the House or \nthe Senate appropriations bills governing EPA's budget will harm public \nhealth or the environment.\n  The No. 1 responsibility we have, and what people demand from us, is \nto protect the public we serve from harm. This means guarding our \nnational security with a strong defense, and keeping our streets safe \nfrom crime. But that also means protecting people from breathing \npolluted air, from drinking poisonous water, and from eating \ncontaminated food--in other words, protecting people from harms from \nwhich they cannot protect themselves.\n  We often fail to think of these problems in terms of being a threat \nto our safety and well-being, primarily because the Federal Government \nhas done such a good job in guaranteeing that we have clean air and \nclean water and edible food. One of the great ironies here is that some \nof the riders in the appropriations bills this Congress may succeed in \nattempts to eviscerate our key environmental laws precisely because we \nhave succeeded in diminishing environmental dangers from every day \nlife.\n  Make no mistake, however, the riders particularly in the House bill \nwill, if they find their way into law, quickly remind people of the \nvery real dangers we have been fighting against for the last \ngeneration. The riders would severely limit the agency's ability to \nensure that our water is safe, our food is safe, and our air is clean.\n  What makes these riders particularly outrageous is that they are \nbeing done without any opportunity for the public to comment on what \nwould be a revolutionary shift in our national policies. This is \nessentially the equivalent of tacking on a provision legalizing \nnarcotics in America to the FBI's appropriation.\n  The riders relating to the Clean Water Act would quite simply end \nenforcement and implementation of the Clean Water Act. The riders would \nmean widespread degradation of the water quality in Long Island Sound. \nIt would threaten the sound's beaches and its enormous commercial \nshellfish industry, which has the top oyster harvest in the Nation. In \nfact, Long Island Sound supports $5 billion a year in water-quality \ndependent uses. These economic benefits are due in large part to the \nimprovement in water quality brought about by the Clean Water Act.\n  The Clean Water Act riders would prevent enforcement of controls for \ncombined sewer overflows and practices to reduce stormwater pollution. \nThese programs were designed to keep raw sewage off beaches and out of \nwaterways and reduce dirty runoff from streets and farms. They are \ncritical to the cleanup and long-term health of Long Island Sound. Last \nyear alone Connecticut had 162 beach closings from too high a count of \ndisease-causing bacteria. These bacteria come from raw untreated sewage \nthat still flows from sewerage treatment systems in Connecticut and New \nYork that are old and being stressed from a growing population in \ncoastal areas. Under the House bill, raw sewage would continue to spill \ninto waters from outdated or inadequate sewage treatment and collection \nsystems. Stormwater controls would be eliminated from many urban areas. \nThe result would be widespread degradation of water quality, which \nwould threaten the State's commercial fishing and shellfishing \nindustry. As \n\n[[Page S 14343]]\nthe Connecticut Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Sidney \nHolbrook, has written about the House bill: ``If enacted in its current \nform, the bill would adversely impact important water quality and \npublic health initiatives.''\n  EPA does much more than enforce the law. EPA provides guidance and \nfunding so that States and localities can upgrade and repair their \naging sewerage systems. Language in the House bill would completely \nstop EPA from issuing stormwater permits, providing technical \nassistance and outreach, and enforcing against the most serious \noverflow problems.\n  Let me briefly discuss my concerns with some of the other riders.\n  One rider would prevent the EPA from enforcing its rule limiting \nemissions of hazardous air pollutants from refineries. This rule, which \nhas just gone final, would reduce toxic emissions from refinery \nfacilities by almost 60 percent--approximately 53,400 tons per year of \ntoxic emissions and 277,000 tons per year of emissions of volatile \norganic compounds, the major contributor to smog. The health impacts of \nhazardous air pollutants include potential respiratory, reproductive, \nand neurotoxic effects.\n  The rule simply requires that petroleum refineries seal their storage \ntanks, control process vents, and detect and seal equipment leaks. \nAbout 50 percent of the 165 refining facilities in this country are \nalready meeting or almost meeting the rule's requirements. This rule \nlevels the playing field and provides minimum protections to all \ncommunities living in proximity to a petroleum refinery. EPA has made \nsubstantial changes from its proposed rule based on the comments of \nindustry, resulting in much greater flexibility. Even the American \nPetroleum Industry by a vote of l7 to 3 supports the rule. That this \nrule cannot be enforced by EPA is simply a delay tactic by a small \ngroup of refineries that do not want to comply with standard industry \npractices.\n  Another rider on the House side would limit EPA's ability to gather \ndata under the toxic release inventory that would give the public a \nbetter understanding of toxic chemicals released into their environment \nand where they work.\n  The Toxic Release Program is a non-regulatory, noncommand, and \ncontrol program. It is essentially a market-based program--providing \ninformation to the public so that it can make informed choices and \nenter constructive dialog with facilities in their communities.\n  I have just mentioned a few riders in my comments--there are more \nthan 25 others that I didn't mention but all affect EPA's duties. The \nBaucus amendment will assure that none of the appropriations riders \nwill endanger current health and environmental protections that we rely \nupon and expect and which improve our quality of life.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, last night I said that this amendment was \nbreathtaking. First, I extend my sincere thanks to the kind words that \nthe Senator from Montana has made about the measures we put in our \nbill. He addressed his arguments against the so-called legislative \nriders in the House bill. Regardless of how good or bad they are, how \ngood or bad ours are, his solution is to give the EPA administrator \nunfettered authority to disregard a law passed by the Congress and \nsigned by the President.\n  He claims that the Justice Department advised him it is not \nunconstitutional. I say look at the Chadha decision, and it is clearly \nunconstitutional. That is not the question here. The courts would have \nto decide it. But I do not want to see this body going on record as \ngiving an unelected bureaucrat the authority to disregard a law passed \nby Congress and signed by the President. This is truly outstanding. So \nmany people in Washington talk about Congress' solutions being ``neat, \nsimple and wrong.'' Well, this goes one step further; it is neat, \nsimple, and unconstitutional.\n\n  Let me, for the benefit of my colleagues, read this to you:\n\n       Any prohibition or limitation in this Act on the \n     implementation or enforcement of any law administered by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall \n     not apply if the Administrator determines that application of \n     the prohibition or limitation would diminish the protection \n     of human health or the environment otherwise provided by law.\n\n  That, to me, gives the EPA Administrator the power to veto, ignore, \nor totally disregard a law. I am not going to move to table this. I \nwant my colleagues to have the pleasure of voting up or down on the \nsimple proposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table has already been made.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \nmotion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I want my colleagues to have the pleasure of voting yes or \nno on this simple proposition: Do you want the unelected Administrator \nof the EPA to be able to change laws passed by Congress and signed by \nthe President?\n  I certainly do not. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 61, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 467 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--61\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So the amendment (No. 2786) was rejected.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2782\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment numbered 2782 \nof the Senator from Maryland; 10 minutes will be equally divided, and \nthe Senator from Maryland will be recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, could I inquire of the parliamentary \nsituation, the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes for debate before the \nvote, 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, 5 on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I implore my colleagues to support this amendment on \nthe homeless. The committee has cut the money for homeless assistance \nby 32 percent from last year's level. In fact, the committee level is \nbelow the level of the year before last. The House has cut homeless \nassistance by 40 percent. If we fail to adopt this amendment, our \nconferees will be working with a figure of 32 percent below last year--\na cut of $360 million. The House has a cut of $444 million below last \nyear. If we pass this amendment, we will give our conferees an \nopportunity in conference to do something about the homeless.\n  We are making progress in our fight against homelessness and this \namendment will advance that cause. This proposal would bring homeless \nfunding \n\n[[Page S 14344]]\nback to last year's level--$1.1 billion. The Appropriations Committee \nsaid in its report that ``The committee is worried that the block grant \napproach with funds less than $1 billion may disadvantage some areas \nwith significant homeless populations and some homeless providers.'' \nThis amendment will bring homeless funding back above the $1 billion \nlevel so we can move to a formula grant. A formula grant will make it \npossible for the States, the localities, the churches, the social \nservice agencies, the civic organizations, and the nonprofit groups to \nwork collectively in a more constructive and positive fashion to \nresolve the problem of the homeless.\n  The offset for this amendment comes out of the funds for the renewal \nof expiring section 8 contracts. The reduction in renewal resources is \nmade possible by a provision in this amendment that allows the \nSecretary to require housing agencies to use section 8 reserves to \nrenew their expiring contracts. The HUD Secretary has written to us \nthat this offset would not create a problem in renewing expiring \ncontracts. He writes, ``Funding for renewal of expiring contracts can \nbe reduced without any impact on existing recipients.''\n  The act that encompasses our homeless assistance programs is named \nafter Stewart McKinney--the distinguished former Republican Congressman \nfrom Connecticut. Ever since Congressman McKinney's efforts to develop \nthe homeless assistance programs, Federal policies for homeless \nassistance have enjoyed bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to \ncontinue this bipartisan approach here today.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ remaining of the 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 30 seconds, if the Chair will remind me.\n  Mrs. Lucie McKinney--the widow of the very distinguished former \nRepublican Congressman--wrote an article a couple of weeks ago about \nthe programs that help the homeless. Let me just quote the end of that \narticle. She wrote:\n\n       We do know how to end homelessness. While the cure is not \n     cost-free, it costs a whole lot less than not facing and \n     solving the problem. Saving lives and saving money--how can \n     that be bad?\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining. The \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes and ask to be \nadvised when that 2 minutes runs.\n  Mr. President, this amendment proposes to increase funding for \nhomeless activities by $360 million, certainly a noble objective. But \nthe budgetary offset comes from the appropriations for renewal of \nsection 8 rental subsidy contracts.\n  There is no dispute that more homeless assistance funding could be \nused. The committee looked everywhere it could to find this money, to \nbalance the needs of the homeless with those who are now getting \nexisting low-income housing assistance. Despite severe budgetary \nconstraints, the committee increased House-passed homeless funding by \n$84 million. When combined with amounts released by HUD, homeless \nactivities in fiscal year 1996 should be maintained at current rates.\n  We provided in the report, because of the tightness of funds, HUD is \n``expected to work through negotiated rulemaking and include \nrecommendations made by States and localities as well as homeless \nassistance providers.''\n  I find it startling that the Secretary of HUD is now saying he can do \nwithout this $360 million. They originally requested $5.8 billion for \nsection 8 renewals. At my request, they reviewed it and came down to \n$4.8 billion for their request. We were only able to provide them $4.3 \nbillion. And the very persuasive Senator from Maryland is able to \nconvince the Secretary he can take less than $4 billion?\n  Make no mistake, these section 8 renewals are renewals that can be \nused for the elderly, the disabled, people with AIDS and others needing \nhomeless assistance. Unfortunately, this is a shell game. It may make \n``letters to the editor'' writers feel better, but it is a phony effort \nto get money where we cannot take it--from those who are without funds \nfor their housing.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, as I mentioned yesterday, I took a little \ntime on Sunday to reread Will Durant's book, ``The Lessons of \nHistory.'' He said, through the centuries nations have this struggle \nbetween those who are more fortunate and those who are less fortunate. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  The less fortunate, those who are homeless, we have them on the \nstreets like we did not have when I was a young man and when the \nPresiding Officer was young. It is going to get worse if we do not deal \nwith it. This is a cutback of 32 percent and is imprudent and unwise.\n  I support the Sarbanes amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in closing, let me just underscore that \nI would prefer that we not take the money out of the section 8 \nreserves. But we are forced by the budget rules to find an offset. The \nquestion before us here is, amongst the priorities, which activities \nought to come first? The homeless are at the very bottom of the scale. \nThey are out on the street. We have been trying to put together an \ninfrastructure to try to deal with their needs and we are having some \nsuccess across the country. Each of you know that in your local \ncommunities you have church groups, you have civic organizations, you \nhave community groups who are marshaling their resources to try to deal \nwith the needs of the homeless. They need this Federal support.\n  The Appropriations Committee has written that the homeless assistance \nprograms would have to get back above $1 billion in order to justify a \nformula approach. In the Banking Committee last year, we included a \nformula approach to homeless assistance that was supported unanimously \nin the committee. That is where we want to get. The funding in this \namendment gives us a chance to get there.\n  The funding in this amendment also gives the chairman of the \ncommittee something to work with in the conference. The House is 40 \npercent below last year's figure. The current Senate figure represents \na 32-percent cut. If the Senate goes to conference on that basis, you \nknow the final outcome is going to be somewhere in between. If the \nSenate bill is allowed to stand, you are going to have a cut of 35 to \n40 percent in the funding for the homeless when this bill comes back \nfrom conference. The amendment before you today will enable the \nchairman to work in conference in order to provide adequate resources \nto deal with this pressing national issue.\n  I am simply saying to my colleagues, support this amendment: Vote to \nshift some of this money from section 8 reserves to the homeless \nprograms. I am not happy with doing it, but we think we can handle the \nsection 8 renewal needs out of existing resources and the Secretary has \nindicated as much in his letter to us. The additional resources for the \nhomeless in this amendment will give us a chance to put a new approach \ninto effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, unfortunately, this does not solve the \nproblem. It takes money from those who depend upon section 8 vouchers \nor certificates. It is saying to all those on section 8--elderly, \ndisabled, people with AIDS--that we are taking $360 million away from \nthe pool for renewing these contracts, and there will be people who are \nnow dependent upon section 8 housing who could be thrown out when their \ncontracts expire.\n  The Secretary, Secretary Cisneros, said after he revised it, we need \n$4.8 billion. We were only able in this tight budget time to give him \n$4.3 billion. I do not believe him when he says that he can make this \nwork with less than $4 billion. I think that is an accommodation.\n  We all would like to accommodate everything. There is no money there. \nUnfortunately, this is a smoke and mirrors game. The amendment \nspecifically says that notwithstanding certain provisions of this act, \nthe $360 million `` * * * shall not become available for obligation \nuntil September 30, 1996, \n\n[[Page S 14345]]\nand shall remain available until expended.''\n  What they are saying is, we are taking money away from reserves in \n1996 to throw it into spending in 1997, in hopes that it will look \nbetter in 1996. We are in danger of taking away the section 8 \nassistance for people who need it, to make them homeless, to increase \nthe need for the homeless assistance.\n  I share the concern of the Senator from Maryland and the others for \nthe homeless.\n  We have worked what I believe is a reasonable compromise. We need to \nstay with this plan to provide section 8 assistance for those who are \nnow depending upon the Federal Government for their housing.\n  This is a smoke and mirrors effort that unfortunately does not \nimprove and might endanger the people that we are trying to help.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold the tabling \nmotion as he did on the Baucus amendment, and allow an up-or-down vote?\n  Mr. BOND. I believe we need to table this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Missouri to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Maryland. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 468 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2782) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wonder if I might inquire of the managers \nwhen they believe we may be able to complete action on this bill?\n  It is my understanding it is going to be vetoed, but there are still \na lot of amendments on the other side. I am not certain how many \nrequire rollcalls. If we are going to complete action on two additional \nbills, Labor-HHS and State-Justice-Commerce, and this is our third day \non this bill, I do not know how we can do two others in 2 days. So if \nanybody knows, when might we complete action on this bill? Plus we will \nrecess the Senate so we will be able to have meetings of the Finance \nCommittee, so we probably will not do anything after this bill the rest \nof the day.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. If I might respond, we have been working out a number of \nthese amendments. I think we are very close to agreement on a number of \nthem. Some of them clearly are going to require votes. We are ready to \nline up two, one with an hour time agreement, one with a 45-minute time \nagreement. Then I cannot say on this side that there are any more of \nour amendments that should require a vote. I think they can be accepted \nor would be included in a--excuse me, there is one Senator Chafee is \ngoing to offer, proposes to offer about the brown fields.\n  I hope that will be agreed upon. That might require a vote. It should \nbe a short time limit. I would be interested on the minority side in \nwhat my colleague sees as the opportunities there.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, responding to the Republican leader's \ndesire to move this bill, we have our next two amendments lined up, the \nLautenberg amendment and the Feingold amendment. When we asked for the \ntime agreement, that is maximum. Both men are here to offer their \namendments.\n  We intend to move very expeditiously. I recommend that after those \ntwo amendments, those votes be stacked. I truly believe we can do a lot \nof clear out and clean up. I am anticipating that either amendments \nwill be worked out or that they will be withdrawn so they could be \noffered on other bills. I cannot guarantee that. We are working down \nour list, as well.\n  So my recommendation is Lautenberg, Feingold, stacked votes; see kind \nof where we are, and then we will move right along.\n  Mr. DOLE. We have one other amendment, the Simon-Moseley-Braun \namendment. Is that being worked out?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we are working out an agreement that \nthat one can be accepted. That is on the transfer of fair housing. I \nthink so long as we can guarantee that the transfer will occur--we do \nnot want to disrupt operations. Our staff is working on it, and I hope \nwe are close to agreement on it. I think we share the same goals. I \njust want to make sure that the language in the amendment gets us \nthere.\n  Mr. DOLE. So just let us see--11, 12, 1. Maybe we can complete action \non this bill by 2 p.m.?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think the prickly point here is what Senator Bumpers \nchooses to do on the NASA-Russian reactor sale. I think that is a \nprickly pear.\n  Mr. DOLE. That could take some time, then.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think we need to confer with Senator Bumpers as to \nwhat his disposition is. We will do this during the debate, Mr. Leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am still trying to work it out; it may not be able to \nhappen. But if we could do all these appropriations bills and the CR, \nthen we would not be in session next week. But we also have to complete \naction in the different committees on reconciliation this week. And I \nunderstand there has been an objection to the Finance Committee \nmeeting. The Democratic leader has already indicated this to me. I will \nmake the request, so whoever wishes to object can object at this time, \nbecause it is very important that that committee meet. And if we have \nan objection, then when we finish this bill, the Senate will be in \nrecess. Then we will meet until we complete action on that, and then \ncome back to the additional appropriations bills. If we do not finish \nthem this week, we will finish them next week.\n\n\n         OBJECTION TO PERMISSION FOR FINANCE COMMITTEE TO MEET\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand the objector is on the floor. I \nask consent that the Committee on Finance be permitted to meet \nWednesday, September 27, 1995, to conduct the markup of spending \nrecommendations for the budget reconciliation legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have consulted with a number of my colleagues, some of \nwhom are on the floor, and there is a concern on this side that we have \nnot had an opportunity to have some hearings and discuss this matter in \ngreater detail. The hope was that over the course of whatever period of \ntime we will have more of an opportunity to look at it. As a result of \nthat concern, then we will object at this time.\n\n[[Page S 14346]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I do understand that the Democratic leader \nhas consented to six other committees to meet during today's session of \nthe Senate.\n  I have six unanimous-consent requests for committees to meet during \ntoday's session of the Senate. They all have the approval of the \nDemocratic leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these requests be agreed to en bloc, and \nthat each request be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that request?\n  Mr. DOLE. That does not include Finance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the requests is printed in today's Record under \n``Authority for Committees to Meet.'')\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank my colleagues and the managers.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg].\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder if my colleague will yield for a moment? \nSince I was a part of this objection with the minority leader, I wanted \nto take 2 minutes, if that would be all right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the minority leader and I have issued \nan objection to the Finance Committee meeting. The reason for that, Mr. \nPresident, is that I just think that what is going on right now here is \na rush to foolishness.\n  Mr. President, in my State of Minnesota, we just found out a few days \nago that as opposed to $2.5 billion in Medicaid cuts, we were going to \nbe seeing $3.5 billion in Medicaid cuts. It was just yesterday that we \nfinally got the specifics of what is going to happen in Medicare. And I \njust will tell you, Mr. President, that I am pleased to be a part of \nthis with the minority leader because when I was home in Minnesota, I \nfound that it is not that people are opposed to change, but people have \nthis sense that there is this fast track to recklessness here, that we \nare not carefully evaluating what the impact is going to be on people.\n  What people in Minnesota are saying is, what is the rush? You all do \nthe work you are supposed to do. How can a Finance Committee today go \nahead without any public hearings on these filed proposals, pass it out \nof the Finance Committee, and then put it into a reconciliation process \nwhere we have limited debate?\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that there is no more precious \ncommodity than health care and the health care of the people we \nrepresent. This objection, with the minority leader, is an objection to \na process. And this process right now I think is really way off course.\n  We have no business--the Finance Committee should not pass out \nproposals without any public hearing, without having experts come in. \nWe have not done that at all. We should not be doing that. Mr. \nPresident, this is supposed to be a deliberative body and it is \nsupposed to be a representative democracy. We are supposed to be \ncareful about the impact of what we do on the lives of people we \nrepresent. I would just say that I am very proud to be a part of this \nobjection because somebody, somewhere, sometime has to say to people in \nthe country that these changes are getting ramrodded through the \nSenate. That is what is going on here. The proposal came out yesterday, \nI say to my colleague from Maryland.\n  I will tell you, as you look at these specific proposals, I can tell \nyou as a Senator from Minnesota that I know there is going to be a lot \nof pain in my State. I believe, Mr. President, that the Finance \nCommittee needs to have the public hearing and I believe that Senators \nneed to be back in their States now that we have specific proposals, \nand we need to be talking to the people who are affected by this.\n  Let us not be afraid of the people we represent. Let us let the \npeople in the country take a look at what we are doing. What this \neffort is, is an effort to say ``no'' to this rush to recklessness, \n``no'' to this fast track to foolishness. The committee ought to have a \npublic hearing. I think it is unacceptable.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Do I have the floor?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from New Jersey----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will say to my colleague from New Jersey, may I have \n1 more minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota no longer has the \nfloor. The Senator only yielded for a question.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thought the time the Senator asked for would be \nconsiderably shorter, and I ask that we have a chance to move.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Enough has been said. People have heard it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14337-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14346-S14366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is important that we move forward on this \nbill.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I object.\n  I simply want to clarify a point with the manager.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was objection. Has the Senator objected?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I simply wanted to ask clarification with regard to the \nunanimous-consent request. I was only attempting to make sure that I \ncan make that clarification before the unanimous-consent agreement is \nentered into.\n  I ask unanimous consent to ask a question of the manager with regard \nto this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. Under our time agreement, our time \nis 45 minutes. My understanding is we would have 30 minutes on our \nside. Is that inconsistent with the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. BOND. I ask there be an hour equally divided.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That will be fine. I thank the manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as so \nmodified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment will do three things. \nIt will restore funding for hazardous waste cleanup and for sewage \ntreatment plants at last year's levels and provide funds for the \nCouncil of Environmental Quality to enable it to continue its work to \nmeet its important responsibilities.\n  First, Mr. President, I commend our colleague, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bond, for his work on this bill and for adding \nover $650 million to the EPA budget. I know that he has done his best \nunder very difficult circumstances. He deserves credit for that. In no \nway should my request here be viewed as being critical of the effort. \nBut nevertheless, Mr. President, I believe that we are going to have to \ndo better and hope that we can find a way to do it.\n  I also want to thank my friend and colleague from Maryland for her \nhard work on the subcommittee bill and hope also she will be with me as \nwe work our way through this to try and adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. President, even with the additions that were made by the \nsubcommittee, the bill still would cut EPA by more than 22 percent from \nthe President's request. That is far more than many other agencies.\n  Unfortunately, these deep cuts in EPA's budget are indicative of a \nmuch broader attack on the environment in this Congress. This year, we \nhave seen efforts to undercut the Clean Water Act, dismantle the \ncommunity right-to-know law, weaken the laws protecting endangered \nspecies and making environmental regulations that are almost impossible \nto promulgate. It seems that there is no end to the new majority's \nassault on the environment.\n  That is not what the American people voted for last November. They do \nnot want environmental laws curtailed. They do not want to see the \ngutting of our attempt to improve the environment.\n  A recent Harris poll showed that over 70 percent of the American \npublic, of both parties, believe that EPA regulations are just right \nor, in fact, not tough enough. Clearly, most Americans care about our \nenvironment, feeling, in many cases, very strongly about it.\n  Mr. President, $432 million of this amendment restores money for the \nHazardous Waste Cleanup Program. The bill reported by the \nAppropriations Committee calls for a cut of roughly a third in \nhazardous site cleanup funding. That will mean many hazardous waste \nsites will not get cleaned up, and many people who live near these \nsites will continue to be exposed to dangerous and often lethal \nchemicals.\n  I recognize that some critics of the Superfund say we should not \nprovide money to the program unless some of its problems are fixed, and \nI agree we have to fix the problems. But while the program has had its \nproblems in the past, which we are presently working to correct, people \nstill want the cleanups to continue. While the controversy surrounding \nthe program has focused largely on the issue of liability, there is no \ndispute about the need to clean up these sites, nor about the need for \nFederal funds to help do so.\n  Communities concerned about the health of their citizens need this \nmoney to move ahead with cleanups, while the responsible parties, those \naccused of doing the pollution, who created the pollution, litigate \namongst themselves trying to avoid paying for their obligation. Federal \nmoney also is needed if those responsible cannot be found or refuse \npayment.\n  In addition, while everyone agrees that responsible parties should \nlead cleanup efforts where possible, Government oversight is necessary \nto assure that agreements are met and the public health is protected.\n  About 260 sites in 44 States will not be cleaned up because of the \nfunding cuts in this bill. Just look at the map, and we see that \ncleanups will stop, the red indicating that 1 to 5 cleanups will be \ndelayed; in the blue area, 6 to 10 cleanups will be delayed; and in the \narea where we see green, including New Jersey, California, Florida, \nmore than 10 cleanup attempts will be delayed. We cover almost the \nwhole map. The only places where there is no delay is where we see the \nStates outlined in white. It is a pretty ominous review that we are \nlooking at.\n  Beyond the severe environmental and health consequences that are \napparent by delays, this will mean also 3,500 jobs will be lost in the \nprivate sector, and that would cause enormous loss of time getting rid \nof the hazardous waste blight that exists across our country.\n  Also, sites that communities plan to use for economic redevelopment \nwill not be available for use in the communities. As land lays \ncontaminated and unusable, local communities will suffer economic \nlosses that cannot be recouped.\n  In my own State of New Jersey, 16 sites will see their cleanup \ndelayed or terminated. For example, efforts will be halted at the \nRoebling Steel site, a former steel manufacturer next to the Delaware \nRiver, a company that had an illustrious history. Material manufactured \nthere was sent all over the world, but they fell on hard times, and now \nwe are dealing with a contamination that was left from their operation. \nRunoff from the precipitation on the site may have already contaminated \nthe Delaware River and surrounding wetlands.\n  Approximately 12,000 people in this area depend on ground water for \ntheir drinking water. An adjacent playground is contaminated with PCB's \nand heavy metals, including lead.\n  Mr. President, hazardous waste sites have significant negative \nconsequences for human health, and these can range from cancer to \nrespiratory problems to birth defects. The need to prevent these kinds \nof diseases more than anything else is what makes funding Superfund so \nimportant.\n  The second part of my amendment, Mr. President, will restore money to \nthe States' revolving loan funds. The Clean Water Act requires that \ncities and towns comply with minimum waste treatment standards. States \nreport that they will need $126 billion to comply with these \nrequirements.\n\n  This amendment keeps funding for the State revolving loan fund at \nlast year's level by restoring $328 million.\n  Finally, my amendment would add just over $1 million to continue the \nwork for the Council on Environmental Quality. For a small amount, CEQ \ncan \n\n[[Page S 14349]]\ncoordinate the administration's environmental programs. This is \nimportant, especially with respect to the coordination of environmental \nimpact statements.\n  To fund these increases, Mr. President, my amendment would reduce the \ntax break that otherwise will be provided in the reconciliation bill \nthis year. From all indications, this tax break will be targeted \nlargely at the wealthiest individuals in America and a variety of \nspecial interests.\n  Mr. President, the rich or poor in this country do not want to leave \na contaminated environment for their children or their grandchildren, \nand I am sure that if this proposition that we have put forward is \nclosely examined and we say, all right, if tax breaks are going to be \ngiven, we have to make sure that they are for the lower income, not \njust the top people or wage earners in our country.\n  So, Mr. President, I am sure that if forced to choose between a tax \nbreak for the rich and strengthening environmental protections, I \nbelieve that Americans would strongly support the environment and \nthusly this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for the well-being and \nhealth of our citizens and our environment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey for \nhis kind words. I appreciate the comments he made about our efforts \nhere. But I wish we could have his support for the measure as passed by \nthe committee and sent to the floor.\n  I must rise in strong opposition to the amendment on substantive \ngrounds and also the fact that it busts the subcommittee's 602(b) \nallocation.\n  I will address, as I have previously, the budgetary sleight of hand \nand the smoke and mirrors that have been suggested as an offset. But \nlet me talk about some of the substantive provisions, because I agree \nwith the Senator that they are very important.\n  As he noted, we worked very hard to increase funding for the \nenvironment because we have made great progress in the environment in \nthis country. We need to continue that progress. Everything that we are \ndoing in this bill is designed to ensure that the progress we have made \ncontinues.\n  We have urged the EPA to pay heed to and adopt the recommendations of \nthe National Academy of Public Administration, who have told EPA how \nthey can do a better job of utilizing their funds, be more effective, \nand make sure that we get the most for our dollars in the environmental \nprograms.\n  That study was requested when my colleague, the Senator from \nMaryland, was chairman of the committee. It is something I support \nbecause I believe we can make progress. But I do not believe that this \namendment can be supported, and I will raise a budget act point of \norder to it.\n  Let me talk, though, about the substance. First, Superfund. While \nthere may be disagreement on how we reform the program, there is \nvirtually no disagreement that I know of that the program must be \nreformed. We have studies by the dozens outlining the problems with the \nSuperfund Program. There have been 90-day reviews and 30-day reviews to \nimprove the program. There have been Rand studies, CBO studies, GAO \nreports, and the National Commission on Superfund Reform.\n  We are all familiar with the morass of litigation, the excessive \nadministrative burdens, the length of time to clean up the sites. Most \nof us have heard from our constituents, small businesses, mom and pop \noperations that were bankrupted because their trash was hauled legally \nto a dump which later became a Superfund site and they became liable.\n  We have all heard the stories about EPA requiring cleanups so clean \nthat kids can eat the dirt, even when there were no kids near the site, \nwhere it is an industrial site, where nobody has even proposed to bring \nin a day care center or to make it a playground for a school.\n  When we devote our resources to overutilization of cleanup techniques \nin an area where they are less necessary, we take away from funds where \nthey can be put to uses right away, where they can have a positive \nimpact on human health and the environment and avoid dangers.\n  But the list of grievances against the Superfund goes on and on and \non. We have poured billions of dollars into this program with little to \nshow for it. We have spent billions of dollars and we have only about \n70 sites which have actually been cleaned up and deleted from the \nnational priorities list. We have hundreds of studies going on at sites \nand even more being litigated. This is a wonderful opportunity for full \nemployment for lawyers, for administrative hassles, and that is not \nwhat we ought to be about. We ought to be about cleaning up Superfund \nsites.\n  In his first speech to Congress, President Clinton declared, ``I \nwould like to use the Superfund to clean up pollution for a change and \nnot just pay lawyers.'' I believe I was one of a large group of \nSenators who stood and applauded that statement. I believe there is \nvery strong agreement on both sides of the aisle that the President set \nthe proper tone: clean up pollution, stop paying lawyers. There is \nlittle disagreement on either side that the program is not working, or \nnot working as well as it should.\n  The committee limited Superfund funding to $1 billion, as in the \nHouse, because the committee recognized that it was time to stop \nthrowing away money at a wasteful, broken program. The committee's \nrecommendations will fund sites which pose an immediate threat to human \nhealth and the environment and sites which are currently at some active \nstage in the Superfund cleanup pipeline.\n  Our recommendations reflect the findings of a General Accounting \nOffice report, which I requested. This General Accounting Office report \nsays that two-thirds of the Superfund sites GAO looked at do not pose \nhuman health risks under current land uses.\n  We are spending two-thirds of the money in the current Superfund \nProgram on sites that do not pose a significant hazard to human health \nnow or in the future under current land uses. I am not suggesting that \nthese sites are not important and should not be cleaned up. I am saying \nthat for these sites, we can delay cleanups until we reform the program \nso that we can concentrate our efforts on those sites which will \nprovide a benefit in lessening dangers to human health and to ensure \nthat commonsense solutions are implemented.\n  The committee's recommendation reflected the fact that the \nreauthorization process is well underway. It will be a transition year, \nas it should be, for the Superfund Program. Therefore, we should only \nfund critical activities pending implementation of a reform program.\n  Now, the Senator's amendment also would double funding for the \nCouncil on Environmental Quality. I point out that this committee has \nrecommended continuing the Council on Environmental Quality at last \nyear's funding. We would save CEQ, where the House wants to terminate \nthat body.\n  The question will be whether we terminate it or not. The ultimate \nconference committee will not come out with more than $1 million \nbecause we have put that amount in and the House has already passed.\n  Despite some concerns that many may have that the CEQ is duplicating \nother agencies, this committee found, and I believe that CEQ does \nperform a valuable function; it performs a function of coordinating the \nactivities of the administration and all the different bodies which may \nact on environmental matters.\n  However, I think it should be limited to activities which are \nstatutory in nature and which do not duplicate other agencies' \nactivities. The funding provided is about the same level as the current \nlevel funding for CEQ.\n  Now, the third point as to State revolving funds which the Senator's \namendment would add $328 million. I fully support added funding for \nStates to meet environmental mandates. That is why the bill before us \ncarves out a special appropriation just for State funding.\n  We increased funding for the State activities that comprises more \nthan 40 percent of the EPA appropriations because that is money going \nto the places where it can actually clean up the environment. \n\n[[Page S 14350]]\n\n  We believe that with reforms that can be implemented either by \nlegislation or through the administrative procedures, we can ensure \nthat the States will do a better job because they will not be limited \njust to cleaning up one particular kind of pollution but can direct \ntheir efforts to pollution which occurs in the air, the water, and the \nland, and not be limited just to one medium.\n  Included in this funding that we have recommended is an increase of \n$300 million in funding for clean water State revolving funds over the \ncurrent budget. Last year's bill contained some $800 million in sewer \ntreatment earmarks. Those were nice for all of us to go home and take \ncredit for, but they did not maximize the available funds for cleaning \nup the environment.\n  We eliminated those earmarks so we can provide adequate funding for \nState revolving funds. I think the bill addresses the concern about the \nneed for State revolving funds.\n  I think that the bill is sound on environmental grounds, sound \nsubstantively, and I say that all of the talk about tax cuts, \neliminating tax cuts, is so much political rhetoric. There are no tax \ncuts in this budget. There is no offset.\n  We had to make tough choices in the subcommittee and the full \ncommittee. We chose to increase the allocation for EPA, but we are \ndoing so within the constraints imposed upon us by Congress in the \nbudget resolution.\n  This amendment would bust the budget resolution. If the Senator was \nconcerned, really concerned about getting more money in the \nenvironment, then he could have offered an amendment which would have \nproposed legitimate offsets. He did not do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the waiver of the Budget Act.\n  I reserve the time. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nhis advocacy in the issues of environmental protection, protecting \npublic health, safety, and having the concern particularly for the \nenvironmental problems in an urban area. Senator Lautenberg has been a \nlongstanding advocate and a longstanding expert in this issue as a \nmember of the authorizing committee.\n  I also want to acknowledge Senator Bond's efforts to really support a \nstreamlining of a lot of the regulatory process.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Lautenberg's amendment to \npartially restore funding to some of EPA's most important programs.\n  This amendment adds: $431.6 million to the Superfund Program, $328 \nmillion to the Water Infrastructure State revolving funds, and $1.188 \nmillion to the Council on Environmental Quality [CEQ].\n  I am particularly concerned about the $431.6 million cut below the \ncurrent funding for the Superfund Program.\n  Superfund was designed to address one of our Nation's worst public \nhealth and environmental problems--hazardous waste.\n  There are 1,300 sites that have been placed on the national \npriorities list, which is the listing of the most serious hazardous \nwaste sites in the country.\n  The health risks posed to people who live near these sites are \nsignificant. I think we owe it to our communities to ensure that these \ntoxic dumps are cleaned up.\n  What happens if we do not restore funding to the Superfund Program?\n  There will be no funding for about 120 new, long-term cleanup \nprojects, cleanup of about 160 immediate public health threats could be \nsignificantly delayed, and we risk letting polluters get off the hook \nbecause we will not be able to reach and enforce settlements for \ncleanups.\n  The Lautenberg amendment will restore funding to ensure that public \nhealth is protected, polluters continue to clean up their messes, and \nnew research continues to develop cheaper, cleaner, and faster ways to \nclean up toxic wastes.\n  I also have serious concerns about the reduction of $586 million \nbelow the President's request that this bill contains for water \ninfrastructure State revolving funds.\n  This cut means that about 107 wastewater treatment projects will not \nproceed.\n  It also means that, because State revolving fund dollars are \nreinvested over time, a reduction in infrastructure investments will be \nfelt in future years.\n  The immediate loss of $587 million will result in a cumulative loss \nof $2.3 billion in funding over the next 20 years.\n  In my home State of Maryland this funding is a big deal.\n  Mr. President, Maryland's Eastern Shore relies heavily on two things, \nfishing and tourism. These represent a huge chunk of the local economy.\n  EPA's most recent water quality inventory reports that 37 percent of \nthe Nation's shellfish beds are restricted, limited, or closed.\n  I'm afraid that this funding level could cause water quality to \ncontinue to decline, which is no small concern for States like mine \nwhich depend heavily on rivers and coastal waters.\n  In addition, last year 85 beaches in Maryland were closed to protect \nthe public from swimming in unsafe waters.\n  I do not know about the rest of my colleagues, but when I go to the \nbeach I want to take a swim or wade in the surf. None of that can \nhappen if we do not protect our waters.\n  I am very concerned that this decrease in funding will have serious \nadverse effects on the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The funding that Maryland gets from the State revolving fund program \nis critical to preventing the water pollution that runs off into the \nbay. All of our efforts to clean the bay, at both the State and Federal \nlevel, will be wasted if we cannot control this runoff.\n  The bill also requires that the Safe Drinking Water Act be \nreauthorized by April 30, 1995.\n  If the program is not reauthorized, all drinking water State \nrevolving funds will be transferred to clean water State revolving \nfunds.\n  This means that nearly 270 projects to improve substandard drinking \nwater systems which serve nearly 29 million Americans will not be \nfunded if reauthorization does not occur.\n  I hope the Senate does not forget the recent cryptosporidium outbreak \nin the Milwaukee, WI, water supply which caused about 400,000 people to \nget sick, resulting in the deaths of 100 people.\n  Finally, I think it is important that this amendment funds the \nCouncil on Environmental Quality at the President's request.\n  CEQ is the Federal office that is responsible for coordinating our \nnational environmental policy. If we did not have the CEQ, the job of \ncoordinating Federal environmental policy would be left to executive \nlevel staff inside the Office of the President. This would mean that \ncongressional oversight would be limited.\n  Make no mistake about it, the American people care about protecting \npublic health and the environment.\n  There are many issues that have been raised about the Superfund \nProgram, many legitimate issues raised about the safe drinking water. I \ndo not believe we should cut the budget. I believe we should streamline \nthe regulations.\n  Cutting the budget, in effect, deregulates or eliminates these \nregulations. We have come so far on cleaning up the environment. I am \ngrateful in this bill that there is funding for the Chesapeake Bay \nProgram, and we are seeing the bay come back to life.\n  We have seen the work that we have done on air pollution and water \npollution. In Maryland we see that good environment is good business \nbecause it does affect our seafood industry. It does affect the ability \nof business. Good environment means that there is a reward for \nbusinesses that do comply.\n  There are many things I could say about this amendment but I think \nSenator Lautenberg said it best as he always does. He has my support \nfor this amendment. He has my support for restoration of these cuts in \nthe environmental programs in round two. I believe that President \nClinton will veto this bill in round two.\n  I hope with the new allocation we could overcome where we are \nessentially cutting America's future by cutting the environmental \nprograms.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask the Chair how much time remains \nfor our side on debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to take a few minutes to respond to the \ncomments of the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee.\n  I first will explain very briefly why it is that I complimented him \neven as I \n\n[[Page S 14351]]\nvoted against the subcommittee bill. It is fairly simple. I think \nyeoman work was done. I think that the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri gave it a good effort but I still feel that we are not \nadequately protecting our communities against environmental pollution.\n  To me it is fairly simple, because I think that the legacy that each \nof us in America can best leave our children, the grandchildren, and \nthose that follow, rich or poor, is to leave them a cleaner \nenvironment; to continue the progress that has been made in some areas.\n  In 1973, only 40 percent of our streams were fishable and swimmable, \nwhich is really the test for the quality of the water. Now it is 60 \npercent.\n  If we do not fund the revolving fund and insist on cleaning up--\ntreating wastewater before it gets to the streams, I do not want to be \ncrude, but it will go in some cases direct from the toilet into the \nrivers, into the lakes. That is an outrageous condition for a country \nas well off, despite our problems, as this country of ours is.\n  Superfund sites--there is always a question raised by those that are \nskeptical about how dangerous these sites are.\n  Mr. President, I have to respond by talking about a condition in, \ncoincidentally, in Forest City and Glover, MO. A 1995 study among \nresidents who lived near Superfund sites shows an increase in reports \nof respiratory problems and increased pulmonary function disorder.\n  Investigators have reported elevated rates of birth defects in \nchildren of women living near 700 hazardous waste sites in California; \nchildren of women living near sites with high-exposure rates to \nsolvents have greater than twice the rates of neural birth defects such \nas spina bifida. The study goes on. There is a real hazard there.\n\n  I can tell you this, I do not want my kids drinking water from a \nwater supply, a groundwater supply that may have been leached into by \ncontaminants left by a polluter.\n  I have to ask this question as well. Why is it that suddenly in the \nAmerican diet or the American purchases in the food market--water? \nPeople walk around with bottles of water like they were a belt on their \npants. It is quite remarkable that now, suddenly, that has become a \nmajor business.\n  Why? I bet it is because people just like spending money. I bet it is \nbecause people love carrying these water bottles in their backpacks or \nback pockets. It is plain they are afraid to drink the water that comes \nout of the tap. Face up to it.\n  What we are saying is we do not want a tax cut for the rich in this \ncountry, for the richest in this country--that is where the money comes \nfrom. It does not come from smoke and it does not come from mirrors; it \ncomes from eliminating a tax break for the wealthiest in our society. I \nthink that is a very good idea. I do not know anybody who could not use \nmore money, even the most profligate spender, but the fact of the \nmatter is this is a country in deep financial distress and the last \nthing we ought to be doing is giving a tax break for those who do not \nneed it and who would be a lot better off if we invest our money in our \nsociety, presenting our kids with a cleaner environment, not having to \nworry about the air that our parents breathe or the ground our kids \nplay on. I think that is a much better investment than a tax cut for \nthe rich--be they idle or earned.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the Superfund--and I \ndiscussed this in my office with my very able staff yesterday--the \ntitle suggests something that escapes understanding that the American \npeople have about what it all means. Superfund ought to have a \ndifferent name. It ought to be getting rid of threats to the health of \npeople in the community. Superfund has some connotation that it is a \nmajor spending program by Government and that we all enjoy throwing \nmoney down the drainpipe.\n  That is hardly the case. Superfund is a program that works, and the \nmoney that we spend in litigation is not out of the Superfund trust \nfund. Rather, it is spent between companies trying to dislodge \nthemselves from their liability; between insurance companies and their \ninsured, the insurance company denying the claim, the insured saying, \n``You insured me for that and I want you to pay; that is why I paid \nthose premiums.'' So that is where a lot of the money comes from for \nlitigation. It is not out of the Superfund trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I think we have to get the definitions very clear. \nSuperfund was and is a very complicated program. It was begun in 1980, \nalmost in innocence, just responding to the threat of environmental \npollution and the health hazards that it represented for children. We \nhave not discussed the environment that is affected as well, the \npollution of lakes and ponds and streams, water supplies, all of those \nthings.\n  Mr. President, when we look at Superfund we say it is almost 15 years \nold now, what has happened? I will tell you what has happened. Mr. \nPresident, 289 sites have been cleaned up. That is not bad. We have \n1,300 sites to go, but we are better at it. We move faster on it. And \nif we fail to fund it at the proper level and lose a lot of the skills \nand expertise that is now resident in EPA and in the Superfund \ndepartment, it will take a long time to rebuild those skills and \nreorganize the structure. That is not a way to do business, not when \nyou have long-term projects that are inevitably more complicated than \nexpected.\n  But we are gaining knowledge all the time, and, again, every one of \nthe sites on the Superfund list has begun to have some attention, \nwhether it is in the drawing of specifications that would be applied to \nconstruction or just simply a track for beginning the appropriate \nengineering studies.\n  I was fortunate a few weeks ago. I was able to go to a site in the \nsouthern part of my State, a site that was one of the worst industrial \npollution sites in the country. There was a responsible party. They \npaid a significant share of it.\n  By the way, I think it is very interesting to note that, of the money \nspent on Superfund cleanup, 70 percent came from responsible parties--\nnot just from the trust funds, the Superfund trust fund.\n  I was able to go to this community. It is called the Lipari landfill \nsite. It was a site that was contaminated over a number of years. Now \nit is clean enough to introduce fish back in the site. I stood there \nwith a bunch of schoolchildren, fourth and fifth grade, and we put \nsmallmouth bass in there and we put bigmouth bass in there. I think \nthat was for Senators' benefit.\n  We put fish back in the pond. The kids were so excited. I was \nexcited. I even got my feet wet in there. But the fact of the matter \nis, that was a turning point for the community. They were celebrating \nrevival. They were celebrating almost, if I may call it in religious \nterms, a redemption. The community center point, a halcyon lake, was \nnow going to be able to be used for recreational purposes by the \nchildren of the community. So we saw a Superfund success.\n  Once again, if I may ask, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I understand my \ncolleague from Delaware is on his way and wants to speak. I hope I can \nreserve the remainder of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. I \nbelieve the Senator from New Hampshire is on his way to the floor. As \nchairman of the subcommittee with responsibility over Superfund, I \nthink it is very important he share with us his views. I do hope we can \nyield back some of the time so we can move on. This is a very important \namendment, but I believe we have outlined it rather clearly.\n  I would like to begin by agreeing with my colleague from New Jersey. \nHe said many things that I agree with, particularly about largemouth \nbass. I love to go bass fishing, too. I want to see our waters cleaned \nup. We want to move together on that. He says we want to stop raw \nsewage going into lakes, rivers and streams. That is why, in this \ncommittee bill, we increase by $300 million the money going into the \nState revolving fund.\n  The Senator from New Jersey made a very clear case for dealing with \nSuperfund sites where there is human health at risk. I could not agree \nwith him more. We need to be cleaning up these Superfund sites where \nthere are \n\n[[Page S 14352]]\nhuman health risks. Unfortunately, two-thirds of the money being spent \nright now is going to sites which do not involve immediate human health \nrisks or risks under current land uses. So we put in $1 billion and \nsaid ``prioritize those sites where human health risks exist now or \nmight exist in the future.'' And then let us reform the program.\n  The Senator from New Jersey talked about the tremendous hassles, the \nlitigation, the administrative time and hassle that is going into the \nSuperfund debates. We need to get out of debates on who is responsible \nand move forward with cleaning up. I look forward to working with the \nSenator from New Jersey to do that.\n  He also talks about people who are afraid to drink the water. We need \nto authorize the safe drinking water fund. Again, we are working on \nthat together in the Environment and Public Works Committee. I think it \nis very important that we cut through the chaff and get down to the \nserious job of making sure that our drinking water supply is safe. I \nlook forward to working with him there.\n  Let me just put a couple of things into perspective. The Senator from \nNew Jersey says that our budget for EPA is 22 percent below the \nrequest.\n  Let me put that in perspective. It should come as no secret to this \nbody that we are making cuts. The subcommittee's allocation was 12 \npercent below last year's. There have been virtually no cuts in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, the largest portion of the budget of \nthis subcommittee.\n  Second, most of the reductions in the Environmental Protection Agency \nhave come from earmarked sewage grants and unauthorized State revolving \nfunds and Superfund, where we proposed to target the resources in \nSuperfund to those instances where human health is at risk or may be at \nrisk under current land uses.\n  We agree that protecting human health from Superfund sites is vitally \nimportant. We have not cut money for standard setting, for technical \nassistance, for enforcement. Those are held close to the current levels \ndespite the subcommittee's constrained allocation. And, as I stated \nbefore, the committee's recommendation increases State grants. It \nrecognizes the importance of fully funding the States so they can meet \nthe environmental mandates. But, frankly, where we come down to \ndisagreement is when the Senator contends--I believe without any \njustification at all--that the money for busting the budget in the \nenvironment is going to come from tax cuts from the wealthy.\n  Unlike President Clinton's budget, this budget does not include in \nits budget tax cuts for anybody, even the tax credit for working \nfamilies that we would like to see involved. That is not in this \nbudget. There is no money to be used in this budget from these cuts for \ntax increases. If this Senator's amendment is agreed to, and the Budget \nAct point of order is waived, we will break the budget. There will be \nno tax cuts, and we will not be on a path to balance the budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  This is simply a budget busting amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nnot to support it.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire has \narrived.\n  The Senator from Delaware came in earlier. I ask the Senator from New \nJersey if he wishes to proceed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes and ten seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield to the Senator from Delaware 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague, the distinguished \nranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Mikulski, in support of our \nenvironmental protection laws.\n  Mr. President, I think our Republican friends should be straight up. \nWhy do they not just eliminate the Clean Air Act, eliminate the Clean \nWater Act, and drastically reduce the requirements? Why do you not just \ndo that? Otherwise, the local municipalities, the cities, and the \nStates are not going to be able to meet the requirements of these acts.\n  I heard all of this talk last year about unfunded mandates. My Lord, \ndid my Republican colleagues bleed over what we were doing to the poor \nStates. They bled and they wept and they talked about the unholy \nFederal Government, and about what it was hoisting upon States. Folks, \nyou cannot have it both ways.\n  I say to my friends from New Hampshire and Missouri: Either do it or \ndo not do it. Step up to the plate with a little truth in legislating. \nOK? This bill is the ultimate unfunded mandate. They know darned well \nthe voters will kill them if they denigrate the Clean Water Act; and \nthey will kill them politically if they denigrate the Clean Air Act. \nThey know what will happen if they attempt to gut these environmental \nlaws. I have not had a single mother or father, or anyone, come up to \nme and say, ``You know, you folks in the Federal Government are \nspending too much time determining whether my water is clean.'' Not one \nhas complained about a Federal bureaucrat trying to clean their water.\n  So what do you do here? You do what you are getting real good at. You \nsay, ``OK, we are not going to denigrate the Clean Air Act nor the \nClean Water Act. We are just not going to give the EPA the money, and \nwe are not going to give the States money.'' So all the little \ncommunities now, like one in my State which has a toxic waste dump with \n7,000 drums of toxic waste sitting there contaminating the water \nsupply, have to fend for themselves. That site is contaminating the \narea with 2,000 people living within 1 mile of it. And what do we say \nwith this one? We say, ``We think they should still clean that up, and \nwe do not want to give you an unfunded mandate. But you find the money, \nState. Clean it up.''\n  Look. This bill is an unfunded mandate, or a backdoor way of trying \nto lower the water quality and lower the air quality. It is one of the \ntwo. If it is done in the name of balancing the budget, I understand \nthat mantra. I voted for a constitutional amendment on balancing the \nbudget. I am for balancing the budget. Let us balance people's \ncheckbooks in terms of how much money they pay the Federal Government \nin taxes. Do you want to balance something? Balance it that way. \nBalance it that way. But do not say to the States, ``We want you to \nkeep the water clean and the air clean. We are not changing the Federal \nstandard on that. But, by the way, we are not going to send you the \nmoney. We are not going to step in there.''\n  What do you think you are all going to do to local taxes, folks? What \ndo you think is going to happen here? These folks are going to save you \nmoney. Oh, they are going to save you money all right. One of two \nthings will happen. Your water is dirty, or your local taxes are going \nup--one of the two. But in the meantime, people making over $100,000 \nbucks will get a tax cut. That is not right.\n  Mr. President, though not as severe as the House version, the bill \nbefore us today does much to protect businesses from liability but \nlittle to protect American families from pollution.\n  The addition of nearly one dozen legislative riders--or loopholes for \npolluters--is, in my view, just plain wrong.\n  An appropriations bill is not the place to hastily form policies \nwhich will affect the drinking water of every American family, the air \nevery American child breathes.\n  We hear so much about unfunded mandates, in fact, one of the first \npieces of legislation passed by this Congress was an unfunded mandates \nbill which makes it harder for the Federal Government to impose costs \nupon States.\n  As a former county councilman I support this effort. Yet, the bill \nbefore us cuts the Environmental Protection Agency's budget by a \nwhopping $1 billion.\n  Who is going to pick up the cost for these necessary protection \nefforts? State and local governments--an unfunded mandate. That is why \nthis amendment is so necessary.\n  By cutting hazardous waste cleanup efforts by 36 percent, this bill \nwill prevent additional progress from being made at our most dangerous \ntoxic sites.\n\n[[Page S 14353]]\n\n  One such site in my home State of Delaware--an industrial waste \nlandfill in New Castle County--contains over 7,000 drums of toxic \nliquids and chemicals.\n  The soil is contaminated with heavy metals. The ground water is \ncontaminated. About 2,000 people live within 1 mile of the site.\n  I want that site cleaned up. I want those families to live and raise \ntheir children in a clean, safe environment.\n  The level of funding in the bill would jeopardize future progress at \nthis site--and I am not going to put Delaware's communities at risk.\n  The bill as currently written also cuts by over $328 million \nassistance to local governments in meeting their Clean Water Act \nresponsibilities.\n  These funds are desperately needed by local communities to modernize \nfacilities which treat wastewater pollution.\n  The cut means that raw sewage will pollute local waters, potentially \nreaching America's coastline, places such as Rehobeth and Dewey Beaches \nin Delaware.\n  Years ago, I literally dredged raw sewage from the floor of the \nDelaware Bay to demonstrate just how polluted that waterway once was.\n  Today it is much cleaner, and raw sewage is no longer as severe a \nproblem.\n  I am not going to turn back the clock on that progress--America's \nbeaches should be littered with vacationers, not sewage.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, the amendment provides an extremely modest \namount of funding for the Council on Environmental Quality.\n  The former Republican Governor of Delaware, Mr. Russ Peterson, a man \nwhom I have the utmost respect and admiration for, formerly chaired \nthis Council.\n  It's mission is simple: To eliminate duplication and waste by \ncoordinating the Government's use of environmental impact statements, \nin the process saving the taxpayers' money.\n  It is a wise use of resources, the return is far greater than the \ninvestment and we ought to support it.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will not add one penny to the Federal \ndeficit or debt.\n  It is funded by simple fairness--any future tax cut provided in the \nbudget bill both Chambers are now working on should go to the middle \nclass only.\n  It is as simple as that.\n  The middle class has been taking a beating over the past two decades. \nThey have played by the rules, paid their taxes, done right by their \nchildren, and yet their standard of living has fallen.\n  Violence has encroached upon their lives unlike any other time in our \nhistory. Women, and even men, no longer feel safe walking to their cars \nat night across dimly lighted parking lots. Armed robberies at \nautomatic teller machines are now commonplace in safe suburban areas.\n  The middle class have earned a tax break, they deserve help sending \ntheir children to college, or buying their first home.\n  Mr. President, this amendment puts environmental protection for \nAmerica's families, ahead of liability protection for polluting special \ninterests and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I always enjoy hearing my colleague from Delaware talk. It is very \nentertaining. But it has nothing to do with this bill. If he is talking \nabout unfunded mandates, the Superfund is not an unfunded mandate. \nNinety percent comes from the Superfund trust fund. We are saying we \nmust reform the program so that we spend less money on the cleanups and \nthat the States' share of 10 percent will go down.\n  He is talking about not giving enough money to the States. We put \n$300 million more in the State revolving fund because we are concerned. \nIt is a wonderful rhetoric, an enjoyable argument; just not this bill. \nAnd this bill is what we are talking about. The amendment has nothing \nto do with the comments, the very delightful comments, of my friend \nfrom Delaware.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Missouri for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address a few brief comments regarding \nthe amendment that has been offered by my colleague, the Senator from \nNew Jersey. As the Senate knows, Senator Lautenberg is the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Superfund, which I chair. I have worked \nclosely with the Senator on the reauthorization of this program. I am \nvery familiar with his concerns and understand the concerns that he has \nregarding this program.\n  But I think we must point out, Mr. President, that this program, to \nput it mildly, has had its share of problems over the past 15 years. It \nhas had some successes. But its cleanup rate, success ratio, has been \nvery, very low without getting into a lot of detail here.\n  This has been a failed program. It is very premature at this point in \nthe process--given the reconciliation before us that Senator Bond has \nalready addressed--to simply say we are going to dump $400 million into \nthe Superfund Program without knowing at this point what the reforms \nare or what the reforms should be.\n  During the last 9 months of our subcommittee, the Senate Superfund \nSubcommittee has held seven hearings on Superfund. Senator Lautenberg \nattended all of those hearings. They were very extensive. I know there \nwas a lot of information provided on how this program should be \nchanged. There were many divergent ideas, and no one with all of the \nanswers. There was a series of exchanges between people. Many had ideas \nthat were in conflict with each other.\n  One issue, as I indicated in my opening sentence, was made very clear \nin all of those hearings. The bottom line as we walked out of those \nhearings was that Superfund was a well-intentioned program but a deeply \ntroubled program. It makes no sense to simply out of the blue take $400 \nmillion from somewhere else, anywhere else--I do not care where it \ncomes from, the rich or from wherever you want to take it. From \nwherever you take it, to put $400 million into a troubled program \nbefore we have addressed the reforms that need to be made is a mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment at the urging of the \nSenator who chairs that committee, who is prepared within the next few \ndays to present to the full Senate, certainly to the committee, \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and ultimately to the full \nSenate a comprehensive reform which I believe is fair and that I \nbelieve will address many of the concerns we feel about the Superfund \nProgram.\n  Given the pendency of this reauthorization effort, I just cannot see \nhow providing these additional moneys now to the Superfund Program is a \ngood use of very limited financial resources. It is premature.\n  I am not saying, I wish to emphasize to the Senator from New Jersey, \nthat at some point I would not like to have additional funds for that \nprogram. Maybe they would be needed. But at this point it is premature, \nand I must for that reason urge the rejection of the Lautenberg \namendment.\n  If we are successful--and I believe we will be--in reauthorizing a \nstreamlined and improved Superfund Program within the next few weeks, \nit is certainly possible that next year I might be here saying that \nwhen we look at the fiscal year 1997 VA-HUD-independent agencies \nprogram, money should be shifted within that program to the Superfund \nProgram, perhaps at the expense of something else. I very well might \nmake that case.\n  In view of the problems that we now face, in view of the fact that we \nare on the verge now of presenting these reforms, this amendment is \nsimply premature. I think the Senate and all of my colleagues deserve \nthe opportunity to address these concerns to see what the real problems \nof the Superfund Program are, to see how we are addressing those \nproblems one by one, from the liability issue, to the State involvement \nissue, to the remedy issue. All of these issues are going to be fully \naddressed, including the funding issue, in the reform bill, and I hope \nmy colleagues would await that bill, pass judgment on that bill, before \nsimply dumping additional resources into the Superfund Program.\n  I yield back any time I might have to my colleague from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I express my sincere thanks to the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. I realize what a difficult \n\n[[Page S 14354]]\njob this is. We look forward to working with him. It is vitally \nimportant for the environmental health and well being of this country \nto reauthorize this measure. He has taken the lead in that very \ndifficult effort. We look forward to seeing that measure in committee \nand coming to the floor so we can perform some badly needed surgery to \nmake sure the Superfund does what everybody expects it would do, and \nthat is clean up dangerous sites and to do it on a priority basis.\n  Now, Mr. President, I believe there are no further speakers on my \nside, so I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time. As I \nsaid before, there is no offset. It is totally smoke and mirrors. But \nin the technical language, Mr. President, the adoption of the pending \namendment would cause the Appropriations Committee to breach its \ndiscretionary allocation as well as breach revenue amounts established \nin the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution. Therefore, pursuant to \nsection 302(f) and 306 of the Congressional Budget Act, I raise a point \nof order against the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to waive the application of the Budget Act as \nit pertains to the pending amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion to \nwaive? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent--since \nthe amendment last night was prepared, there have been some amendments \nthat were proposed here, and I simply ask unanimous consent to modify \nthe amendment to not inadvertently strike any language that was \npreviously adopted by the Senate. These changes make no substantial \nchange in my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 125, strike lines 12 through 17.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I understand there is a 30-minute time \nallotment on our side; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself such time as necessary.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today will strike the \nprovision buried in the VA-HUD appropriations bill that I believe would \nlikely have serious consequences for the protection and enforcement of \nthe civil rights laws in our country.\n  The committee bill, unfortunately, includes a provision that would \nprevent HUD from spending any of its appropriated funds to ``sign, \nimplement, or enforce any requirement or regulation relating to the \napplication of the Fair Housing Act to the business of property \ninsurance.''\n  Believe it or not, this provision would banish HUD from investigating \nany complaints of property insurance discrimination, or ``insurance \nredlining'' as it is more commonly known. The term ``redlining'' \nactually evolved from the practice of particular individuals in the \nbanking industry using maps with red lines drawn around certain \nneighborhoods. These individuals would then instruct their loan \nofficers to avoid offering their financial services to residents of \nthese redlined neighborhoods. These redlined neighborhoods typically \nwere low income \n\n[[Page S 14356]]\nand minority communities, and it resulted in the unavailability of the \nfinancial services that were necessary to purchase a home or a business \nor an automobile.\n  But even as Congress identified and moved to curb these \ndiscriminatory practices in the banking industry, a disturbing and \ngrowing level of discrimination was emerging from the insurance \nindustry that would continue to deny certain individuals the basic \nopportunity to own their own home or to start a small business.\n  Property insurance, as we all know, is almost an absolute requirement \nto obtaining a home loan. And this was best illustrated by Judge Frank \nEasterbrook of the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in that \ncourt's ruling that redlining practices are illegal and a violation of \nthe Fair Housing Act.\n  The judge was speaking for a unanimous court when he observed:\n\n       Lenders require their borrowers to secure property \n     insurance. No insurance, no loan; no loan, no house; lack of \n     insurance thus makes housing unavailable.\n\n  Mr. President, the key question, of course, is does redlining \nactually exist as a practice? Countless new reports and studies \nindicate that there is a prevalent and growing level of discriminatory \nunderwriting in the insurance industry. Studies such as the 1979 report \nof the Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin \nadvisory committees to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and the \nrecent study on home insurance in 14 cities released by the community \nadvocacy group ACORN have pointed out that insurance redlining \npractices are, in fact, widespread in America. These reports highlight \nthe fallacies of the contention that lack of adequate insurance in many \nof these communities is due to economics, or that it is simply due to \nstatistically based risk assessment.\n  In addition, there is, unfortunately, some substantial anecdotal \nevidence that suggests individuals residing in minority and low-income \ncommunities are systematically denied affordable or adequate homeowners \ninsurance.\n  The ramifications of reducing access to affordable and adequate \nhomeowners insurance have proven severe for urban areas with large \nminority communities. Without property insurance, an individual cannot \nobtain a home loan. Without a home loan, an individual cannot obtain a \nhome. Thus, refusing to provide property insurance to an individual \nbecause he or she lives in a predominantly minority community has to be \na clear violation of the civil rights protections of the Fair Housing \nAct.\n  My own interest in this matter is longstanding, but it especially \ngrew out of a widely reported redlining abuse in the city of Milwaukee, \nWI, where it was well documented that insurance redlining was occurring \non a widespread basis. I was outraged that this sordid, documented \ndiscrimination was occurring, not only in my own home State, but \napparently in many other States as well, including Illinois, Missouri, \nand Ohio.\n  Mr. President, it is important not to forget who these redlining \nvictims really are. They are hard-working Americans. They have played \nby the rules. And they are just trying to buy a home. They are trying \nto bring a sense of stability and vitality to their families and to \ntheir communities, many times communities that desperately need that \nkind of stability and vitality.\n  Unfortunately, as happened in Milwaukee, they often run into a brick \nwall of ignorance and injustice. The pattern of discrimination in \nMilwaukee led seven of our Milwaukee residents to join with the NAACP \nto file suit against the American Family Insurance Co. An unprecedented \nand historic out-of-court settlement was reached in this case between \nthe parties where the insurance company actually agreed, rather than go \nforward with the litigation, to spend $14.5 million compensating these \nand other Milwaukee homeowners who had been discriminated against, as \nwell as some of the funds for special housing programs in the city of \nMilwaukee.\n  Mr. President, for those of my colleagues who might think such \ndiscrimination in the insurance market is limited to Milwaukee, WI, I \nassure you this is not the case. There is ample reason to believe that \ninsurance redlining does occur. It occurs all across this country. And \nwe should be taking steps to enhance the Government's ability to combat \nthis form of discrimination.\n  Mr. President, that is just the opposite of what is happening here. \nWe are not taking the steps forward that need to be made. The language \nin this bill would actually take us about five steps backward. The \nprovisions of this bill are a direct attempt to stop the Federal \nGovernment from investigating complaints of discrimination under the \nFair Housing Act. That is what it is.\n  Mr. President, I have to say that I am very disturbed by this behind-\nclosed-doors attempt to undermine the civil rights laws of this \ncountry. There have been no hearings on this proposal by either the \nBanking Committee or the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I would like to know where the mandate for this change \nto our fair housing laws came from. I would like to know where the \nsupporters of this radical language feel that the American people are \nsomehow overprotected from racial and ethnic discrimination. Was this \npart of the Contract With America, to roll back the civil rights \nprotections of this Nation? I did not see it in there.\n  I am very troubled that this would even be attempted. The supporters \nof this new language claim that the Fair Housing Act does not say one \nword about property insurance. It is true that the original act does \nnot say that. But as a result of the Fair Housing Act amendments of \n1988, Mr. President, which were signed by President Reagan, HUD \npromulgated regulations that specifically placed property insurance \nunder the umbrella of the Fair Housing Act. These regulations were then \npromulgated by the Bush administration.\n  Let me repeat that. For those who might think HUD's involvement in \ncombating property insurance discrimination is simply an initiative of \nthe Clinton administration, that is categorically wrong. The \nregulations were as a result of a law that passed Congress with strong \nbipartisan support and was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. \nAnd then the regulations were promulgated under the administration of \nPresident George Bush. So let us set aside the faulty assertion that \nHUD's role in enforcing the Fair Housing Act as it applies to property \ninsurance is somehow just a new effort to expand the Federal \nGovernment's regulatory powers over a particular industry.\n  Mr. President, the supporters of this new language also say that \nregulating the insurance industry should be the sole domain of the \nStates as mandated under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n  Mr. President, this, also, is a diversionary tactic. This is not an \nissue of regulating the insurance industry. The States are the \nregulators of the insurance industry. What this is, Mr. President, is \nan argument about whether the Federal Government has the ability to \nenforce the civil rights of those who have been discriminated against \nwhen they are attempting to purchase a home. That is what this is \nabout--not taking away the powers of the States to regulate insurance. \nAnd this argument also fails to recognize that virtually every Federal \ncourt that has ruled on this issue, including the sixth circuit and the \nseventh circuit, have held that the Fair Housing Act applies to \nproperty insurance and that HUD was legally authorized to enforce the \nFHA as it relates to homeowners insurance.\n  Mr. President, I would like to begin to conclude these remarks by \nreading from an editorial in opposition to this ill-advised language, \nand that led to the attempt to strike the language.\n  Mr. President, this is not an article from The Washington Post or the \nNew York Times. It is from the National Underwriter, which is the trade \npublication of the insurance industry. Let us see what they say about \nthis attempt to gut the enforcement by HUD.\n  The editorial said:\n\n       However receptive the Republican-controlled Congress is to \n     business rewrites of legislation, and however large public \n     antipathy to poverty and affirmative action programs seems, \n     we feel the overwhelming majority of Americans believe in the \n     fundamental principle that all U.S. citizens deserve equal \n     access to the same goods and services, including those \n     offered by insurers.\n       . . ..while the industry may not be looking to avoid \n     redlining or civil-rights oversight, insurers certainly \n     appear to be using a legislative end-run to keep HUD from \n     trying to \n\n[[Page S 14357]]\n     rectify legitimate insurance redlining and civil-rights wrongs.\n\n  That is what the insurance industry has even said about some of their \ncounterparts' effort to block this.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of that \neditorial be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I find it remarkable that the trade \npublication of the very industry in question has observed this is \nnothing more than a backdoor attempt to stop HUD from combating \nlegitimate and real redlining abuses and discriminatory practices. I am \nnot out here on the floor today to throw a blanket indictment on the \ninsurance industry. I know many individuals in my home State who work \nin the industry, and it is my firm belief the vast majority of those \npeople are decent, hard-working Americans who would join with me and \nthe Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Illinois and others in \ncondemning this sort of bigotry and discrimination. Unfortunately, it \nis evidence that these sort of abuses do occur. And the Federal \nGovernment has to do all it can do to enforce the Fair Housing Act as \nis required under current law.\n  I hope my colleagues will set aside their partisan and political \ndifferences and adhere to a set of principles that I think we really \ncould all agree on. That not only includes the principle that every \nAmerican should be free from discrimination wherever it may occur, but \nalso a commitment and dedication to protecting and enforcing the civil \nrights in this country and continuing to battle the various forms of \nbigotry and discrimination that continue to pervade this Nation.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to reject the committee language which would \nquite simply block HUD's effort to fight insurance redlining, and I ask \nsupport for the amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the National Underwriter, Aug. 21, 1995]\n\n                  Insurer Attack on HUD Could Backfire\n\n       As bald expressions of lobbying muscle go, the insurance \n     industry's recent success in cutting off the U.S. Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development's insurance purse strings in \n     the House was certainly impressive.\n       But in the real world--that is, the world outside the D.C. \n     Beltway--the industry's legislative coup may not play as \n     well.\n       A broad coalition of insurers and their associations--led \n     by the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \n     the National Association of Independent Insurers, State Farm \n     and Allstate--pushed for language in this year's House \n     version of the HUD appropriations bill which precludes the \n     agency from using its funding for any insurance-related \n     matter. That would effectively end HUD's much-feared \n     initiative to set and enforce anti-redlining standards for \n     property insurers.\n       Whatever their antipathies to having HUD stick its nose in \n     their business, we think this coalition made a major \n     miscalculation.\n       With recent court decisions running against them and a high \n     level of public concern over insurers writing off rather than \n     underwriting inner cities, insurers have simply tried to \n     legislate away the heat without addressing the underlying \n     problems which prompted HUD to act in the first place.\n       But the heat will not dissipate so easily, as National Fair \n     Housing Alliance Executive Director Shanna Smith made clear. \n     There are still the courts to consider--and in case the \n     insurance industry has forgotten, if there is one thing \n     consumer groups are good at, it is grassroots organizing of a \n     particularly loud and visible sort that attracts the press \n     and gives CEOs and public relations officials ulcers, not to \n     mention shareholders.\n       The insurance industry--which isn't exactly held up by the \n     public as an example of enlightened corporate interest to \n     begin with--can almost certainly count on organized, deep and \n     sustained consumer outrage if it pushes through the ban on \n     funding for HUD insurance oversight.\n       All this for what? A one-year reprieve? (As part of an \n     annual budget bill, the insurance funding ban is only for \n     fiscal year 1996, and would need to be renewed annually.)\n       However receptive the Republican-controlled Congress is to \n     business rewrites of legislation, and however large public \n     antipathy to poverty and affirmative-action programs seems, \n     we feel the overwhelming majority of Americans believe in the \n     fundamental principle that all U.S. citizens deserve equal \n     access to the same goods and services, including those \n     offered by insurers.\n       HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros called the insurance funding \n     ban ``an affront to civil rights.'' And the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners has unequivocally \n     stated that urban poor and minority consumers do not have the \n     same access to insurance products as their wealthier, \n     suburban and white counterparts.\n       NAMIC's vice president of federal affairs, Pamela Allen, \n     says insurers don't seek to avoid redlining issues or civil \n     rights laws, but simply want to avoid dual regulation.\n       Perhaps this argument has some merit, but while the \n     industry may not be looking to avoid redlining or civil-\n     rights oversight, insurers certainly appear to be using a \n     legislative end-run to keep HUD from trying to rectify \n     legitimate insurance redlining and civil-rights wrongs.\n       Fiscally constrained state insurance regulators, with less \n     restrictive unfair trade practices laws, do not have HUD's \n     ability to conduct major probes and extract national \n     settlements from large multi-state carriers.\n       NFHA's Ms. Smith told the National Underwriter: ``I wish \n     the presidents of the [insurance] companies would meet with \n     us. They are sending subordinates in and they are not getting \n     a clear picture of the seriousness of the charges against \n     them.''\n       If this is true, then we think insurers are jeopardizing \n     their reputations by trying to make HUD go away. Instead of \n     stiff-arming consumer and community-housing groups working \n     with HUD in the process, insurers should act in good faith to \n     seek out and repair any problems which might exist.\n       We know it is unlikely the industry will back off on this \n     issue as it goes to the Senate. But suffice it to say when \n     the next in the never-ending series of industry op-ed pieces \n     on improving insurers' poor public image appear on these \n     pages, we think we will be able to point out one example of \n     what not to do.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 13 seconds left for the \nproponents of the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. First, let me agree with my friend from Wisconsin that we \ndo not support nor do I think the insurance industry would support \nredlining. We believe that everyone should have access to all services, \nwhether they be insurance or housing or credit, not in any way limited \nby race, gender or other impermissible classifications.\n  What this language in the bill does--published, reviewed by the \ncommittee and the subcommittee, and brought here on the floor, not \nbehind some closed doors, as he implied--is to say very simply that HUD \nshould follow the law, a novel concept, perhaps one that may be a \nlittle foreign when one has perfect, pure motives. But even pure \nmotives do not warrant disregard of the law.\n\n  Section 218 of the VA-HUD appropriations bill prohibits the use of \nany funds provided by the bill for the application of the Fair Housing \nAct to property insurance. This provision was also included in the \nHouse version of the bill. In theirs, however, it went farther, and I \nthink that may have been what the Senator was addressing. He said you \ncould not even look into the existence of it. We did not say that in \nour bill.\n  This provision, however, is an important means of eliminating \nduplication and wasteful expenditures of taxpayers' money. HUD's Office \nof Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has devoted substantial resources \nto regulatory and other activities aimed at addressing alleged property \ninsurance discrimination, purportedly pursuant to the Fair Housing Act. \nHUD not only has devoted its own personnel to these activities, it has \npaid millions of taxpayers' dollars to fund studies by outside \nconsultants, to hire large law firms to do investigations and to fund \nenforcement efforts by private groups. HUD's property insurance \nactivities and efforts to regulate insurance are unwarranted and beyond \nthe scope of the law, beyond the scope of the Fair Housing Act and in \ncontravention of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n  Every State and the District of Columbia have laws and regulations \naddressing unfair discrimination in property insurance, and they should \nbe enforced. The States are actively enforcing these antidiscrimination \nprovisions. Certainly, we can urge them to do better, but the law gives \nthat responsibility to the States, and that is where the argument \nshould be made.\n  The States are employing a wide variety of measures to ensure neither \nrace nor any other factor enters into a decision whether to provide a \ncitizen property insurance. In light of these comprehensive State-level \nprotections, \n\n[[Page S 14358]]\nHUD's insurance-related activities do more than add another unnecessary \nlayer of Federal bureaucracy. The application of the Fair Housing Act \nto property insurance not only unnecessarily duplicates State action, \nbut it also contravenes Congress' intent regarding the scope of the \nlaw.\n  Congress never intended the Fair Housing Act to warrant HUD to \nregulate property insurance practices. The act expressly governs home \nsales and rentals and the services that home sellers, landlords, \nmortgage lenders, real estate providers and brokers provide, but it \nmakes no mention whatsoever of the separate service of providing \nproperty insurance.\n  Indeed, a review of the legislative history shows that Congress \nspecifically chose not to include the sale or underwriting of insurance \nwithin the purview of the act.\n  Further, application of the Fair Housing Act to insurance defies \nCongress' specific decision 50 years ago that in the area of insurance \nregulation, in particular, the States should remain unencumbered by \nFederal interference. In the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, Congress \ndetermined that unless a Federal law ``specifically relates to the \nbusiness of insurance,'' that law shall not be deemed applicable to \ninsurance practices. By applying the Fair Housing Act to insurance, HUD \nsimply disregards the fact that the law does not ``specifically relate \nto the business of insurance.''\n  Some argue that HUD's actions are justified by court decisions, \nciting two appellate court rulings, one in the seventh circuit and one \nin the sixth circuit. But these decisions do not, in fact, confirm that \nthe Fair Housing Act applies to insurance. Indeed, they are expressly \ncontradictory in connection with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in \nMackay.\n  A favored position is that HUD included in the 1989 Fair Housing Act \nregulations a reference to nondiscrimination in the provision of \nproperty or hazard insurance or dwellings. But HUD took this action \nwithout expressed legislative authority from Congress. Unless the \nSupreme Court should interpret the HUD regulation as giving itself \nlegislative authority, then there is no national authority for applying \nthe Fair Housing Act to property insurance.\n  I believe that the American people want Congress to have the Federal \nGovernment perform those functions it should perform, and it is \nrequired by constitutional law or other practice to do that \neffectively, to do our job well and to return to State and local \ngovernments those activities which are expressly left to the States and \nlocal governments. Regulation of insurance is one of those.\n  As for the Federal Government, I think we have to streamline \nregulatory activities, and that means hard choices. However, there is \none area where Federal spending should be cut back, where it should not \nbe a problem to determine whether cutbacks are appropriate, and that is \nwhen HUD's activities go beyond the scope of the law. If HUD is not \nauthorized to do it, in fact, is expressly prohibited from doing it, we \nhave said in this bill, ``Don't spend any more money to do it.''\n  This would not be in question if HUD had not been going beyond the \nscope of the law in spending millions of dollars already. There is \nsimply no justification, in a time of scarce resources, when HUD needs \nto be providing assistance in housing for those in grave need, to take \naway from that vital function funds that could go for housing and apply \nthem to insurance-related activities that duplicate existing \ncomprehensive State regulations, at the expense of the American \ntaxpayer and at the expense of those people who depend upon federally \nassisted housing for their shelter.\n  This should be an easy choice for this body: Provide housing \nassistance to those who need it, deal with the problems of the \nhomeless, but get HUD out of an area where it has no authority, no \nresponsibility and, in fact, has spent millions of dollars beyond its \nauthority.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a very strong cosponsor of the \nFeingold/Moseley-Braun amendment. As has been stated by the author of \nthe amendment, this amendment would strike the provisions in this bill \nthat prohibit HUD from enforcing fair housing laws as they pertain to \nproperty insurance. What does that mean? It means that the amendment \nthat we are cosponsoring would eliminate the prohibition that now in \nthe law says that HUD will not be able to prevent redlining in property \ninsurance.\n  The language that is currently in the bill would bar HUD from \npreventing insurance companies from discriminating on the basis of \nrace, sex, nationality, religion, or disability. This has primarily \nmanifested on the issue of race.\n  Property insurance, as we know, is necessary to qualify for a home \nmortgage loan. Allowing property insurance companies to disregard the \nhousing act could end up denying not only insurance to homeowners but \nactually would be an impediment to owning homes themselves. As a \nSenator who has always worked for social justice, I cannot support the \nprovision currently in this bill.\n  I am directly affected by this. I live in Baltimore City. I now pay \nmore for insurance. I pay more for my property insurance. I pay more \nfor my car insurance. I pay more not because of who I am, what I am, \nbut because of my zip code, and there is a prejudice against that zip \ncode simply because it is in Baltimore City.\n  Yes, I live 8 blocks from a public housing project. I live around the \ncorner from a shelter for battered women. I live in a Polish community \nthat is also now historic in gentry.\n  We have one of the lowest crime rates in Baltimore City. We have one \nof the lowest auto theft rates in the city. We have one of the lowest \nrates of problems related to fires, theft, robbery, assault, mayhem, \nbut we pay more. And why? Not because we are good citizens, but because \nwe live in a certain zip code.\n  Now, hey, at least, though, I can get the insurance. I pay more, \nperhaps unjustly, but I pay more, and so do my neighbors. So do those \nyoung students at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. So do the \nPolish ladies who belong to the Society of Sodality. So do the priests \nat St. Stanislaus Church, and so do the people of color who live around \nus in the neighborhood. Now, I do not think that happens to be right.\n\n  Also in Baltimore County and Prince Georges County we have a rising \nnumber of African-American middle-class people who have access to home \nownership, often primarily because of what is in this bill.\n  Through the VA and through the FHA, this subcommittee--and I know \nthis chairman has promoted home ownership. Now, though we are promoting \nhome ownership on one side of the Federal ledger, we are going to deny \nthe Federal Government's ability to enforce antiredlining in property \ninsurance. I do not think that works.\n  At a time in our Nation's history when civil rights violations are \nuniversally rejected by people of conscience, and I know 99 other \npeople in this body who also agree with that, I cannot understand why \nthe Senate wants this type of provision. I hope that all Senators will \nfind this provision as unsettling as I do. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Now, we can talk about States rights. I will not start the debate \nhere on States rights. But the phrase ``States rights'' has been a code \nword word and buzzword for so long under the guise of States rights \nthat often there has stood prejudice in our society. I am not going to \nbring that up.\n  But what I will bring up is when we talk about duplication, about the \nfact that States and local governments have one set of laws and the \nFederal Government should not duplicate--when I was in the Baltimore \nCity Council, I passed the first legislation in the city government to \nprevent discrimination on the basis of disability. Then some 12 years \nlater, we passed a Federal law. Nobody in the Baltimore City Council \nsaid, ``Oh, no, Barb, we do not need that because you did this 12 years \nago.'' Well, we needed it there, and we need it now. When we look at \nthe fact that it is the Federal Government that is promoting home \nownership, the Federal Government has a role in making sure the people \nwho benefit from VA \n\n[[Page S 14359]]\nand FHA can get the property insurance to protect their property.\n  I have a letter from the Fair Housing Coalition, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: We are a group of national civil \n     rights and community organizations writing to express our \n     united opposition to anti-civil rights provisions passed as \n     part of the FY 1996 VA-HUD appropriations bill by the U.S. \n     House of Representatives. The first provision exempts an \n     entire industry from complying with basic, civil rights \n     protections under the Fair Housing Act. The second defunds \n     the community-based infrastructure which undertakes \n     enforcement as well as preventive efforts to eliminate all \n     forms of housing discrimination. Together, these two \n     provisions go beyond curtailing HUD's enforcement activities \n     related to homeowners insurance discrimination.\n       The House language would bar the U.S. Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development from preventing insurance companies \n     from discriminating on the basis of race, sex, national \n     origin, color, religion, familial status or disability in \n     determining which homes or homeowners qualify for homeowners \n     insurance. Without homeowners insurance, potential homeowners \n     cannot qualify for a home mortgage loan and consequently \n     cannot purchase or own their own home.\n       Discrimination in the provision of homeowners insurance \n     continues to plague middle-class, working-class and \n     integrated and minority neighborhoods. Complaints from \n     homeowners, as well as studies and investigations demonstrate \n     the current pervasiveness of this problem. For example, a \n     study by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \n     found that it is more difficult for residents of minority and \n     integrated neighborhoods to obtain insurance coverage and \n     that these homeowners often pay more for inferior coverage. \n     Equally damaging are the extra efforts African-American and \n     Latino homeowners must undertake in order to obtain any type \n     of coverage.\n       The insurance industry responds that monitoring of \n     homeowners insurance is the purview of the states and outside \n     the jurisdiction of the Fair Housing Act. However, the Sixth \n     and Seventh Circuit Courts of Appeal have determined that HUD \n     has authority to investigate insurance discrimination \n     complaints and that the Fair Housing Act prohibits insurance \n     redlining.\n       If this anti-civil rights rider remains, HUD would be \n     required to suspend all activities pertaining to property \n     insurance. Ordinary citizens will be denied the HUD \n     administrative process for resolution of their complaints. In \n     fact, HUD would be prohibited from continuing the \n     investigation and settlement efforts of the 28 insurance \n     discrimination complaints now pending. The benefits of an \n     effective conciliation process will be lost, leaving only the \n     option of costlier, private litigation--an option few \n     ordinary citizens can afford. The ability of society as a \n     whole to redress the consequences of discrimination in \n     homeowners insurance will also be seriously curtailed because \n     no state insurance law provides protection to insurance \n     consumers equivalent to the protections of the Federal Fair \n     Housing Act.\n       The House language also removes the Fair Housing \n     Initiatives Program (FHIP) which provides funding to \n     nonprofits, municipalities and universities across the \n     country to enable them to provide education, outreach, \n     enforcement and counseling to both citizens and industry \n     associations on all forms of housing discrimination. FHIP-\n     funded organizations provide training and information to \n     landlords, real estate agents, mortgage lenders and other \n     members of the real estate industry about their \n     responsibilities and protections under the Fair Housing Act. \n     FHIP-funded organizations are also the first resource \n     available to victims of all forms of housing discrimination. \n     Such agency intervention often results in informal resolution \n     of complaints so that they never reach HUD or the courts.\n       The House language goes far beyond exempting the insurance \n     industry from HUD enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. It \n     eliminates all HUD efforts to ensure that homeowners \n     insurance is provided to every American on an equal basis. By \n     defunding FHIP, the U.S. Congress also would be abandoning \n     support for the nonprofits, municipalities and universities \n     which undertake enforcement as well as preventive measures to \n     reduce all forms of housing discrimination.\n       This coalition is united in its belief that guaranteeing \n     equal access to the opportunity of homeownership is a \n     quintessential federal activity. The availability of \n     homeowners insurance is no different than the availability of \n     a home mortgage loan on equal terms.\n       We urge you to continue the bipartisan tradition of \n     supporting the Fair Housing Act by opposing efforts to exempt \n     the insurance industry from complying with this crucial civil \n     rights protection and by supporting continued funding for \n     FHIP.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Civil Liberties Union.\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       Center for Community Change.\n       Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs.\n       Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n       NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.\n       National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium.\n       National Council of La Raza.\n       National Fair Housing Alliance.\n       National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n       National Puerto Rican Coalition, Inc.\n       National Urban League.\n       NETWORK: A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby.\n       People for the American Way.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what they point out is that the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners found it is more difficult for \nresidents of minority and integrated neighborhoods to obtain insurance \ncoverage and that these homeowners often pay more for inferior \ncoverage. Equally damaging are the efforts of African-American and \nLatino owners, what they must undertake in order to obtain any type of \ncoverage. And if this civil rights rider would continue, HUD would be \nrequired to suspend most activities pertaining to property insurance \nand, in fact, it would even mitigate solving some of the problems we \nface.\n  I know about the McCarran-Ferguson Act. I tried to end discrimination \nin insurance when I was in the House of Representatives. I heard enough \nabout that to qualify for law school. But one thing I do know is that \nwhen the insurance industry complains that it is exempt from coverage \nunder the Fair Housing Act because of this, that is not so.\n  The position of the Federal Government and the courts is that the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act does not supersede or impair Federal authority to \nenforce the Fair Housing Act. While every State has property insurance \nlaws that prohibit unfair discrimination, no State law provides the \nprotection to insurance consumers equivalent to the protection of the \nFederal Fair Housing Act.\n  Also, the insurance industry claims that all minority or ethnic \nhomeowners who are eligible for insurance are able to purchase it. Yet \ninvestigations by the National Fair Housing Alliance have found that \nwhile some minorities have been able to attain insurance, this coverage \nis often inferior. In many instances, they found out that African-\nAmericans or Latinos, when they called an agent, did not receive a \nreturn call or a followup phone call.\n  Also, insurance companies claim that the disclosure of underwriting \nand pricing mechanisms would violate trade secrets, damaging their \nprofits. But Connecticut requires the filing of the underwriting \nguidelines and makes them publicly available, and there is no evidence \nthat it has a detrimental effect on any of the company's profits.\n  Also, the insurance industry claims that it costs more to provide \ninsurance in urban neighborhoods, which is why they say it must be so \nhigh. While the industry makes that claim, they have never presented \nany evidence to document that. The evidence, for example, from the \nMissouri Insurance Commission shows that is not true.\n  Because, again, of the activities of the Federal Government to make \nhome ownership available, we now have many of our African-American \nconstituents living in the suburbs. It is a wonderful happening in \nMaryland. It is exciting to see that. I would hate to see that after \nworking so hard to have access to the American dream, the ability to \nget insurance turns into an American nightmare because of an action \ntaken by the Federal Government that says it is wrong to redline on the \nbasis of race, gender, national origin, or disability, to be able to \nget the property that you worked so hard to get, and to not be able to \nhave it insured.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the \namendment offered by Senator Feingold that will strike section 218, a \nprovision in the bill that would bar HUD from using funds to pursue \nclaims of property insurance redlining. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  I want to make it very clear that I believe the U.S. Senate should \nnot set the precedent of exempting property insurance from fair housing \nlaws. The Senate report accompanying H.R. 2099 states that section 218 \n``prohibits the use of any funds by HUD for any activity pertaining to \nproperty insurance.'' What this means is that HUD could not \n\n[[Page S 14360]]\ninvestigate any Fair Housing claims of property insurance redlining. If \nthe provision is not stricken, Americans might be kept from buying \nhouses because they might not be able to get homeowners insurance. I \nbelieve that all Americans have the right to homeowners' insurance \nregardless of race or ethnicity or the neighborhood where they live.\n  The insurance industry claims that this type of denial of coverage is \nnot taking place, but HUD reports that it continues to process and \nsettle thousands of claims of property insurance redlining. \nUnfortunately, the practice of denying coverage to Americans because of \nthe neighborhood they live in or the color of their skin is still \nhappening. The Wall Street Journal on September 12, 1995, reported in \nan article titled, ``Study Finds Redlining Is Widespread in Sales of \nHome-Insurance Policies,'' that a ``study by the Fair Housing Alliance \nand other civil rights groups found that minority callers to insurance \nagents were often denied service or quoted higher rates than white \ncallers seeking insurance for similar homes in predominately white \nneighborhoods.''\n  If HUD is barred from investigating claims of property insurance \nredlining, Americans will be denied the protection of a basic civil \nrights law. I do not think that insurance companies should be exempt \nfrom property insurance provisions in the Fair Housing Act.\n  This is a simple amendment that will protect all Americans from \ndiscrimination by insurance companies when they are trying to purchase \nhomeowners insurance. I want to thank my colleague for offering this \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The pending appropriations bill would prevent \nenforcement of the Fair Housing Act against the insurance industry. I \nrise in support of the Feingold amendment to strike this ill-considered \nproposal.\n  Equal access to housing is a right guaranteed to all Americans, and \nthe Fair Housing Act is one of the pillars of our civil rights laws. \nDiscrimination against racial and ethnic minorities seeking to rent or \npurchase housing is just as repugnant as employment discrimination or \ndiscrimination in public accommodations.\n  In the wake of the Supreme Court's Adarand decision, the country is \ncurrently engaged in an important debate about affirmative efforts to \npromote the integration of minorities into American society. But \nwhatever the outcome of that debate, I had thought that the basic \npillars of our civil rights laws--the laws that prohibit discrimination \nagainst minorities--were not up for grabs in the current Congress. Yet \nthe attack on the Fair Housing Act embodied in the pending bill raises \ndoubts about this Congress' commitment to eradicating discrimination.\n  The bill before us contains two unacceptable provisions relating to \nthe Fair Housing Act. First, it shifts the authority to enforce \nviolations of the Fair Housing Act from the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development to the Department of Justice. Second, the bill bars \nenforcement of the Fair Housing Act in the area of housing insurance \nredlining.\n  We have reached an agreement with the Senator from Missouri to \npostpone the transfer of enforcement authority while the committees of \njurisdiction consider this complex question. But the insurance proposal \nis still in the bill, and the pending Feingold amendment would strike \nit.\n  I was one of the authors of the 1988 fair housing amendments, a \ncomprehensive effort to improve and expand enforcement of the laws \ndesigned to protect the civil rights of those seeking to buy or rent \nproperty. One of the clear purposes of the 1988 act was to end \ndiscrimination in the provision of property insurance. Since that time, \nevery court which has addressed the issue has agreed that the Fair \nHousing Act covers property insurance discrimination.\n  The reasoning behind the 1988 amendments is simple. The ability to \nobtain property insurance is a precondition to buying a home. Without \nproperty insurance, a lender will not provide a mortgage. Without a \nmortgage, most Americans would not be able to afford a home. The 1988 \nfair housing amendments were intended to insure that all Americans can \napply equally for property insurance--without discrimination.\n  Even today, it is more difficult for residents of predominately \nminority communities to obtain property insurance. And when they can \nsecure insurance, it is often at an inflated price. The Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, using the 1988 fair housing amendments, \nis successfully working to end this fundamental violation of civil \nrights. We cannot now take a step backward and deny millions of \nAmericans the chance to own their own home by making it more difficult \nfor them to obtain property insurance.\n  One effect of this provision would be to take enforcement of the laws \nagainst ``redlining'' out of Federal hands and effectively leave such \nenforcement to the vagaries of State law. While some States have \nstatutes prohibiting some aspects of discrimination in the provision of \nproperty insurance, these laws do not go as far as the Fair Housing Act \nin preventing discrimination. For example, as of 1993, only 26 States \nhad specific prohibitions on the offensive practice of insurance \nredlining.\n  In addition, no State law provides redress equivalent to the Federal \nFair Housing Act. State laws simply do not provide the breadth of \ncoverage or range of remedies which are currently available under \nFederal law. Why then, should we limit the remedies due to victims of \nhousing discrimination?\n  This Congress has consistently rejected efforts to give States \nexclusive control over civil rights, and there are sound historical \nreasons for that. We should not make an exception to that simple \nprinciple. We must not move backward in the fight to end housing \ndiscrimination. We must ensure, through the pending amendment, that all \nAmericans have equal access to the housing market--without \ndiscrimination.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feingold \namendment to strike the language in this bill barring the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development from enforcing the Fair Housing Act \nagainst insurance redlining. The language in this bill will deny the \nprotection of a basic civil rights law to people subject to \ndiscrimination by a particular industry. Because insurance redlining is \na reality in America, efforts to eliminate such discrimination should \nbe aggressively undertaken. Sadly, by stripping HUD of its enforcement \nauthority, this bill will allow such discrimination to flourish.\n  Mr. President, insurance redlining is a serious problem in this \ncountry. Recently, American Family Mutual Insurance Co. settled a \nredlining case by paying $16.5 million. The lawsuit was filed by seven \nAfrican-American homeowners in Milwaukee who were either turned down, \noffered inferior policies, or charged more money for less coverage on \nhome insurance policies. The insurance company settled the lawsuit \nafter it was discovered that a manager at the company wrote to an agent \nwho was willing to write insurance for African-Americans: ``Quit \nwriting all those Blacks.''\n  In addition, Mr. President, the National Fair Housing Alliance \nconducted a 3-year investigation--partially funded with $800,000 from a \nHUD grant awarded when Jack Kemp was HUD Secretary--using white and \nminority testers posing as middle-class homeowners seeking property \ninsurance coverage. The test covered nine major cities and targeted \nAllstate, State Farm, and Nationwide Insurance. The homes selected were \nof comparable value, size, age, style, construction, and were located \nin middle-class neighborhoods.\n  The investigation uncovered the fact that discrimination against \nAfrican-American and Latino neighborhoods occurred more than 50 percent \nof the time. Astoundingly, in Chicago, Latino testers ran into problems \nin more than 95 percent of their attempts to obtain insurance, while in \nToledo, African-Americans experienced discrimination by  State  Farm  \n85  percent  of  the time.  While white testers encountered no problems \nobtaining insurance quotations and favorable rates, African-American \nand Latino testers encountered the following problems:\n  Failure by insurance agents to return repeated phone calls;\n  Failure to provide quote information;\n  Giving preconditions for providing quotes--inspection of property, \ncredit rating checks; \n\n[[Page S 14361]]\n\n  Failure to provide replacement-cost coverage to homes of blacks and \nLatinos; and\n  Charging more money to blacks and Latinos, while providing less \ncoverage.\n  Mr. President, property insurance discrimination is illegal under the \nFair Housing Act. Under Secretary Cisneros, HUD has been an active \nparticipant in enforcing the Fair Housing Act and ensuring that \nproperty insurance discrimination ceases. The insurance industry has \nbeen fighting in court to restrict HUD's authority to enforce insurance \nredlining. The industry has not been successful in the judicial arena \nin its efforts to stop HUD's enforcement activities. Thus, the industry \nhas now turned to Congress to restrain stepped-up Federal fair lending \nenforcement efforts.\n  Insurance redlining directly affects the ability of African-\nAmericans, Asians, and Hispanics to purchase a home, because the denial \nof insurance results in the denial of a mortgage loan, which in turn \nresults in the inability to purchase a home. Mr. President, opponents \nof affirmative action in Congress have argued that strong enforcement \nof civil rights laws is the appropriate mechanism to stop \ndiscrimination. However, efforts are now underway to strip the one \nagency that has been aggressively battling housing discrimination of \nits enforcement authority and remove a whole category of \ndiscrimination--insurance redlining--from the reach of the law. This \neffort needs to be stopped in its tracks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the words \nof the chairman of this committee and make a couple of points.\n  Whenever we start talking about Government and Government rules and \nregulations, first of all I do not think anybody deplores \ndiscrimination at any stage more than I do. Because we would allow this \ninto this bill will not take care of the problems that we seem to be \nfacing in insurance redlining.\n  Of course, I still believe in the jurisdiction of McCarran-Ferguson. \nEvery State and the District of Columbia have laws and regulations \naddressing unfair discrimination in property insurance. Do we become \nredundant and put one law on top of another, thinking that the Federal \nenforcement will be any better than the State enforcement? I think that \nis a question.\n  Congressman Kennedy over on the House side offered an amendment to \nstrike the language prohibiting HUD from promulgating Federal \nregulations and it was soundly defeated, bipartisan, by a 266-to-157 \nmargin.\n  What we are seeing with this amendment is exactly what this Senator \nand the American people do not want to see--the Federal Government \ngetting involved in something where the States clearly have \njurisdiction. It might surprise you that even Congressman Dingell, \nformer chairman over on the House side, in a letter dated November 3, \n1994 to Secretary Cisneros of HUD, and Alice Rivlin, said this:\n\n       It is important to note that the Fair Housing Act does not \n     explicitly address discrimination in property insurance. Nor \n     does the legislative history that accompanies the act \n     indicate any intention to apply these provisions to business \n     insurance.\n\n  He went on and added:\n\n       It is also particularly significant because the legislative \n     history of the act reveals that in 1980, in 1983, 1986, and \n     1988, Congress specifically rejected attempts to amend the \n     act to cover property insurance.\n\n  So we are going into an area that clearly is the jurisdiction of the \nStates. I think we are also going into an area where we become very, \nvery redundant on the laws, and putting one on top of the other \nprobably does not take care of the problem that all of us want to see \ntaken care of.\n  I ask my colleagues, if redundancy is part of what we are trying to \nfight out in this Government, then maybe we should take a look and see \nwhat we are doing here where the States clearly have jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from Illinois 4 minutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President. I do not agree with the \nSenator's use of the term ``redundancy.'' If anything, this debate is \nkind of deja vu all over again. This is precisely the battle lines that \nwere drawn in the civil rights debates that happened in this very \nChamber 30, 40 years ago, and that I had hoped our Nation had moved \nbeyond.\n  This is an issue of civil rights. This is an issue of civil rights \nfor all Americans--not just African Americans, not just minority \nAmericans, but all Americans.\n  Mr. President, since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \nall other legislation intended to provide equality of opportunity to \nall Americans, since that time the Congress has consistently rejected \nthe argument that the Federal Government should leave the enforcement \nof civil rights to the exclusive jurisdiction of the States.\n  Members may recall--before my time, certainly--but people may recall \nthe arguments made in the 1960's about States rights and how the States \nshould have exclusive province for enforcement of civil rights. The \nCongress stepped in and said, ``No, that is not correct. We have a very \nreal national interest in ensuring that all Americans have effective \nremedies for acts of discrimination.''\n  Mr. President, that is precisely what this debate is about. As a \nrecent editorial stated:\n\n       If State laws are effective and States are actively \n     investigating opposing penalties . . . why has every \n     significant legal action been taken by private attorneys or \n     the Federal Government? Why have such actions been taken \n     almost exclusively under the jurisdiction of Federal fair \n     housing law and not State insurance codes? Where, for \n     example, was the Wisconsin insurance commissioner throughout \n     the 8 years during which the case against American Family was \n     being investigated and litigated?\n\n  In short, Mr. President, the antiredlining protections of the Federal \nFair Housing Act have provided us with the ability to have enforcement \nof fair housing laws, have provided us with the ability to enforce \nantidiscrimination laws and antiredlining laws. Because of that \nprotection, Americans are better off; our country is better off.\n  I plead with my colleagues not to allow this issue to become one of \ndivision among us, but rather to bring us together and allow for the \nprotections of the law against redlining, against discrimination, to \ncontinue.\n  I encourage support for the amendment of Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 3 minutes to the senior Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Feingold \namendment.\n  It is very interesting that the Senator from Missouri, the senior \nSenator from Missouri, mentioned the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The \nAssociation of Attorneys General of the States unanimously wants that \nrepealed.\n  I can remember when Attorney General Ed Meese, not a flaming radical, \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee that McCarran-Ferguson ought \nto be repealed.\n  When Senator Bond says, ``We do not support redlining,'' that is like \nsaying we do not support going through this red light, but we are not \ngoing to arrest you if you do go through this red light. That just does \nnot make any sense.\n  I am old enough, Mr. President, to remember the 1954 school \ndesegregation decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, and we thought we \nwere going to move into an integrated society.\n  But our housing pattern has prevented the kind of progress that we \nshould have. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners \nrecognizes that this is a serious problem. The pattern of housing \ndiscrimination is clear. It is probably one of the most blatant areas \nof discrimination that remains in our society.\n  When I was a young, green State legislator, I was a sponsor of fair \nhousing legislation to prohibit discrimination, and I remember it was a \nvery emotional issue at that point. I can remember talking to groups \nand sometimes someone would ask the question: Will this not lead to \nmixed marriages? And I said that I thought all marriages were mixed \nmarriages.\n  The questioner would respond: Well, that is not exactly what I meant. \nAnd of course they would spell out their worry about interracial \nmarriages, and I would say: How many of you in here married the boy or \ngirl next door? I \n\n[[Page S 14362]]\nnever, ever had anyone raise their hand. Then I said: If you really are \nconcerned about racially mixed marriages, then have people move next \ndoor; then you will solve what you see as a problem.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, if we pass this without the Feingold \namendment, we are going to make it easier to discriminate. That is the \nreality. Part of the American dream ought to be to have a home that you \nlike and to be able to pay for that home. We should not be denying that \ndream. That is what this bill does without this amendment.\n  I hope that we can appeal to some of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to stand up for civil rights on this issue. We should not \ntake a step backward.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to finish with one point here and \nthen I think I will yield some time to the other side because I think \nwe have pretty much made our point.\n  When we look at the McCarran-Ferguson Act, it says:\n\n       No act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, \n     impair, or intercede any law enacted by any State for the \n     purpose of regulating the business of insurance unless such \n     act specifically relates to the business of insurance.\n\n  In other words, what they are saying, if we want to change the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act, it has to be done in freestanding legislation.\n  Basically, I will go right back to say that we are just adding \nredundancy. We are adding another layer of bureaucracy to try to deal \nwith something the States are having success in enforcing. I think we \nare laying one law on top of another law.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of extra time to the manager on the \nother side and I yield back the balance of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin now has 13 minutes and 5 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself a moment to say that I certainly thank \nthe Senator from Montana for his great courtesy in yielding some of his \ntime.\n  I will now yield 7 minutes to the junior Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. President, I want to also thank the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Wisconsin for yielding me additional time. I tried to talk \nfast because I thought we were under greater time constraints than we \nare. I do want to address the whole question of regulation.\n  Mr. President, this issue has nothing to do with regulation. It is \nabout civil rights. Enforcement of antiredlining provisions does not \nregulate insurance; rather, it prohibits discrimination. It works to \nensure that insurance, like all other goods and services, is available \nto all citizens regardless of race.\n  We cannot allow, we should not allow, civil rights protections to be \nrolled back in the name of insurance reform. There is no reason, Mr. \nPresident, why discrimination in insurance should be treated any \ndifferently than any other form of housing discrimination.\n  Enforcement of the Fair Housing Act does not involve regulation. \nRegulation of rates or other aspects of the insurance business is \nindeed a State responsibility, and no one has argued that point.\n  What HUD is obligated to do, and what it has done under this section \nof the law, is to enforce civil rights laws that prohibit \ndiscrimination. No one has offered any valid explanation to show why \nthis particular industry should be exempted from civil rights \nantidiscrimination laws.\n  In the absence of the Feingold amendment, that is what this Congress \nwill be doing.\n  Mr. President, I appeal to my colleagues that the smokescreen of \nState rights to regulate insurance is just that in this instance. This \nis very clearly an issue going to the heart of enforcement of our laws \nprohibiting discrimination of all types.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support the attempt by Senator \nFeingold to add back into the law the protections against insurance \nredlining that his amendment provides. I call on my colleagues to take \na good, close look at what is at stake in this debate. We talked. There \nare a lot of words around all of these issues. But the reality of it is \nthat when anyone has to pay more for any good or service just because \nof the color of his or her skin, that is a situation that these United \nStates, I hope, has moved away from and will continue to move away from \nand will never go back to. To suggest we go back to that under the \nguise of the sloganizing about States rights is shortsighted, \ncounterproductive, antediluvian, and I frankly would be stunned if that \nwould be the kind of signal this Congress wants to send to the American \npeople.\n\n  I therefore express strong support for the Feingold amendment and \nhope my colleagues will do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require.\n  I thank the junior Senator from Illinois not only for her statement, \nbut for her great leadership on this issue. I share her view. I will be \nstunned if this body, that has risen to the occasion on many instances, \nactually goes forward and takes this extremely serious and harsh act \nwith regard to the civil rights laws of our country.\n  There was a suggestion at the beginning by the Senator from Missouri \nthat somehow there would still be an ability for HUD to do something \nabout this problem if we do not reverse this. But what the language \nsays in the current committee amendment is:\n\n       None of the funds provided in this act will be used during \n     fiscal year 1996 to sign, promulgate, implement, or enforce \n     any requirement or regulation relating to the application of \n     the Fair Housing Act to the business of property insurance.\n\n  That is pretty clear. Maybe they can think about the issue during \ntheir coffee break, but they are not going to be able to do a darned \nthing about it. Do not let anyone kid you, this completely guts HUD's \nability to do something about property insurance discrimination.\n  Then there was an attempt, I know in good faith, to suggest that \nsomehow the McCarran-Ferguson Act prevents the Federal Government from \ntaking this step. Let us look at the plain language of the Fair Housing \nAct. The Fair Housing Act, which is also a law of our country just as \nmuch as the McCarran-Ferguson Act, says it is unlawful ``* * * to make \nunavailable or deny housing because of race, and prohibits \ndiscrimination in the provision of services [in the provision of \nservices] in connection with the sale of a dwelling.''\n  Any American will tell you that homeowners insurance is the provision \nof services in connection with the sale of a dwelling. It is clearly \nwithin the ambit of that statute and it has been litigated. It has been \nlitigated in the legal circuit that both the Senator from Illinois and \nI live in, the seventh circuit. They took up the question of whether \nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act prevented the application of the Fair Housing \nAct to property insurance and they ruled that in fact it was perfectly \nconsistent with and within the provisions of that law. So this, too, is \na red herring. It is a red herring that attempts to obfuscate the fact \nthat this is a direct assault on years and years of trying to do \nsomething at the national level about a widespread national effort by \nsome elements in the insurance industry to prevent honest, hard-working \nAmericans from owning a home.\n  I have come out to the floor since the November 8 election and I have \nvoted to send some powers back to the States. I agree with that \nsentiment in many areas. I voted for the unfunded mandate bill. With \nsome concern, I voted for the Senate version of the welfare bill. I \nvoted to let the States decide what the speed limit should be. I voted \nto let the States decide whether we should have helmet laws. I voted to \nlet the States decide what the drinking age should be. I even voted to \nlet them decide whether or not to have seatbelt laws. But this goes too \nfar. This is ridiculous, to suggest you simply leave a consistent \nnational pattern of discrimination up to the States.\n  I recently received a letter from James Hall of Milwaukee. Mr. Hall \nwas one of the lead attorneys in the Milwaukee redlining case that went \nto the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In this letter, Mr. Hall laid \nout the reasons why the plaintiffs in this case chose the Federal route \nrather than relying on the Wisconsin State laws and courts. \n\n[[Page S 14363]]\n\n  I ask unanimous request that the text of the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Hall, Patterson & Charne, S.C.,\n                                Milwaukee, WI, September 26, 1995.\n     Re: Insurance Redlining.\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: The purpose of this letter is to \n     discuss aspects of my involvement in the lawsuit NAACP, et \n     al. vs. American Family Mutual Insurance Company, which was \n     filed in United States District Court for the East District \n     of Wisconsin in July 1990 and resulted in a settlement in the \n     spring of 1995. I understand that you are familiar with the \n     terms of the Settlement Agreement and the involvement of the \n     United States Justice Department in arriving at the \n     settlement with the defendant American Family Insurance Co.\n       The attorneys for the plaintiffs (the NAACP and seven \n     individuals), decided to commence the action in the United \n     States District Court, as opposed to Wisconsin state courts. \n     There were several reasons for our decision and why similarly \n     situated plaintiffs may decide to utilize the federal courts:\n       1. We believed that the scope and range of remedies and \n     relief obtainable under Title VIII in federal court were \n     superior to those which we could expect to obtain in state \n     court. There was more precedent in terms of Title VIII \n     litigation and remedies (although not necessarily in the area \n     of insurance redlining). This included the possibility of \n     advancing a disparate impact theory of proof as opposed to \n     relying totally on having to prove ``intent.''\n       2. It is very difficult to proceed with complex litigation \n     while advancing on theories that may or may not hold water. \n     For instance, the District Court dismissed one of the \n     plaintiffs' causes of action based on state insurance law, \n     finding that it was not clear that the state law intended a \n     private cause of action. It is likely that litigants pursuing \n     theories under state law will find themselves in uncharted \n     waters advancing causes of action without precedent when \n     proceeding under various state statutes. Fortunately, in our \n     case, we had other causes of action, including the Fair \n     Housing Act claim, which survived.\n       3. While the McCarran-Ferguson Act could have potentially \n     created a problem, we advanced the theory (and the Seventh \n     Circuit Court of Appeals agreed), that the Fair Housing Act \n     provisions are consistent with the provisions of the \n     Wisconsin statutes outlawing insurance discrimination. \n     Accordingly, the McCarran-Ferguson Act was not found to have \n     been violated. However, there may be serious questions \n     concerning the ability to proceed in states which enact \n     legislation providing, for instance, that state statutes are \n     the exclusive remedy for discrimination. (It is doubtful that \n     any state would pass legislation which is outright \n     inconsistent with the federal Fair Housing Act, for instance, \n     providing that insurance discrimination is lawful.)\n       4. Another consideration involves the situation a national \n     or regional insurer conducts business in several states. In \n     order to meaningfully address that insurer's practices, it \n     may be necessary to commence litigation in each of the \n     various states. It is much more convenient and cost-effective \n     to be able to utilize the federal system.\n       All of the above reasons, but in particular, uncertainties \n     about the burdens of proof and the scope of remedies, \n     resulted in our decision to bring the action in the United \n     States District Court. We appreciate the efforts of yourself, \n     Senator Mosley Braun, and others aimed at continuing to allow \n     HUD to have the ability to have meaningful involvement in \n     this very important area of the law which affects the lives \n     of millions of Americans.\n       If I may be of assistance in any way, please advise.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James H. Hall, Jr.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this should not be done, even in the \nname of the Contract With America, which I do not support, but I have \nsupported some provisions of this. This really defaces the notion of \ndevolution to the States. Some things still have to be done by the \nFederal Government and one thing for sure is combating discrimination \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes and 28 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, this deals with a pharmaceutical plant in \nKalamazoo, MI, and the pretreatment requirements for that plant. We are \namending the underlying language that is in the bill.\n  This amendment has been agreed to by those involved, such as the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Michigan and the senior Senator from \nMichigan, as well as the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, let me set the stage for this amendment by saying a \nfew words about the pretreatment program under the Clean Water Act, our \nmost successful environmental law.\n  The subject we are discussing is sewage treatment. Prior to enactment \nof the Clean Water Act, one of our Nation's most serious water \npollution problems was the discharge of untreated sewage--domestic \nwaste collected from homes, workplaces and other institutions--\ncollected by sewers and quite often discharged without treatment to \nlakes, rivers and streams.\n  Untreated sewage creates a host of problems. It presents health \nhazards to those who would use the water for recreation or fishing. The \nnutrients in the sewage promote the growth of algae that robs the water \nof oxygen needed by the fish and other organisms living in the water. \nAnd the loading of sediments and toxic chemicals can kill birds and \nother wildlife depending on the aquatic environment for food and \nhabitat.\n  So, in 1972 we committed the Nation to solving this problem by \nbuilding a series of municipal sewage treatment plants. We have \ninvested more than $120 billion--more than $65 billion of that in \nFederal dollars--to build, 16,000 sewage treatment plants across the \ncountry. They remove the sludge from the water. They clarify the water \nbefore it is discharged. They kill the pathogenic organisms in the \nsewage that would otherwise spread disease. And they dramatically \nreduce the nutrient loadings.\n  It has been a big success. For instance, you hear that Lake Erie was \nbrought back from the dead or that the Potomac River is once again a \nplace for recreation. That is the result of the Clean Water Act and \nthese sewage treatment plants.\n  One essential part of this effort under the Clean Water Act is called \nthe pretreatment program. Sewage treatment plants receive more than \ndomestic waste for our homes and workplaces. They also receive billions \nof gallons of industrial wastewater.\n  Tens of thousands of manufacturing plants and commercial businesses \ndump the waste from their processes into the sewer. These industrial \ndischarges contain hundreds of different kinds of pollutants--\nindustrial solvents, toxic metals, acids, caustic agents, oil and \ngrease, and so on.\n  Sewage treatment plants are not generally designed to handle all of \nthese industrial chemicals. In fact, the industrial discharges can \ncause severe damage to sewage treatment plants. And even where the \nplant is not damaged by the industrial chemicals, the plant does not \ntreat the toxics--it does not destroy them--it merely passes them \nthrough to the water or to the land where the sludge from the plant is \ndisposed.\n  Because of these problems with industrial waste, Congress established \nthe pretreatment program under the Clean Water Act. It requires that \nindustries treat their wastes before putting them into the sewer. That \nis why the program is called pretreatment. Pollution control equipment \nis installed at the industrial plant and it is operated to remove \npollutants such as metals and sediment or to neutralize pollutants \nincluding acids and caustics before the wastewater is put into the \nsewer.\n  This is the background for this amendment. The Clean Water Act has \nfostered a very successful program to treat domestic sewage. An \nessential part of this program is a requirement for pretreatment of \nindustrial wastewater before it is put into the sewer and sent to the \nsewage treatment plant. Substantial reductions in the toxic pollution \nof our rivers and lakes have been achieved by the cities that operate \npretreatment programs.\n  Let me break down the argument for the pretreatment program into four \npoints.\n  First, the pretreatment program protects sewage treatment plants from \ndamage by these industrial chemicals. The toxics in industrial waste \ncan interfere with the chemical and biological processes used by the \ncentralized sewage treatment plant.\n  Second, because sewage treatment plants are not designed to treat \nmany of these industrial wastes--the plant merely passes the waste \nalong to the environment--pretreatment is required before the \ndischarge. Treatment before the discharge is much more efficient \nbecause it occurs before the industrial waste from one plant is mixed \nwith all the other material that goes into the sewer.\n  At the industrial plant you have a very concentrated waste stream. \nApplying control equipment to that stream can remove substantially all \nof the toxic agents. But put that waste into the sewer untreated and \nmix it with millions of gallons of wastewater from homes and workplaces \nand it is much more difficult to remove the toxic constituents.\n  It stands to reason that a treatment method applied to a small \nconcentrated waste stream will be more effective and less costly than \nattempting to remove the same amount of material diluted in a large \nquantity of wastewater.\n  Third, the pretreatment program simplifies the task we face under the \nClean Water Program. It would be virtually impossible to set \npollution standards for every single chemical that is discharged to the \nenvironment. To know what impact a particular chemical has on a \nparticular waterbody is a question that may take years of study to \nanswer--for that one chemical and one lake or stream. To know how \nhundreds of different industrial chemicals affect the aquatic \nenvironments receiving pollution from the 16,000 different sewage \ntreatment plants is a challenge way beyond the best science we have \ntoday.\n\n  We get around this impossible task by asking that those who discharge \n\n\n[[Page S 14365]]\ntheir industrial wastes to our rivers and lakes--and to the sewage \ntreatment plants that discharge to our rivers and lakes--use the best \navailable pollution control technology before the waste leaves their \nplant.\n  And fourth, the pretreatment program establishes a uniform level of \ncontrols across the whole Nation. It is no secret that the States and \ncities of our country are in daily competition to attract and hold \njobs. One factor in locating a new business is the regulatory climate \nthat applies in a State or city. It is cheaper to do business where the \nregulations are not so strict.\n  Prior to the Clean Water Act, many States had difficulty establishing \neffective pollution control programs because of their fear that \nbusiness would move elsewhere. A State putting on tight controls to \ncleanup a lake or river faced the prospect that its employers would \nflee across the State line to keep production costs down. That fear was \nin part removed when the Clean Water Act established a uniform level of \ntreatment required of all plants in each industry all across the \nNation. Standards issued by EPA under the pretreatment program that \napply to all the plants in an industry all across the country relieve \nsome of the pressure on States that want to have good programs of their \nown.\n  So, that is the background for this amendment. The pretreatment \nprogram is a very sensible part of a very successful national effort to \nreduce the adverse effects of sewage discharged to our lakes, rivers \nand estuaries. I think the Clean Water Act has been our most successful \nenvironmental law and it has succeeded because of the technology-based \ncontrols that have been put on industrial discharges through programs \nlike the pretreatment program.\n  Mr. President, there is a rider in this bill that would exempt some \nindustrial dischargers in the city of Kalamazoo from the requirements \nof the pretreatment program in the Clean Water Act. The Kalamazoo \nsewage treatment plant is designed to achieve advanced treatment and to \nhandle some of the wastes that are sent to it by industrial facilities. \nBecause of this advanced capacity, it may be that some industry waste \nstreams in Kalamazoo can be handled at the sewage treatment plant and \nwithout the need for pretreatment at the industrial facility. The \npurpose of the rider is to reduce compliance costs by waiving redundant \ntreatment requirements.\n  I am concerned, however, on two points which I have addressed in the \namendment that is now the pending business. My amendment would not \neliminate the exemption. But it would tighten it up in these two ways.\n  First, it would only allow exemptions in Kalamazoo for pharmaceutical \nplants already located there. If the Senate adopted my amendment we \nwould not be providing an exemption for all of the industrial \nfacilities in Kalamazoo.\n  Second, the amendment would require EPA to determine that treatment \nby the Kalamazoo sewage plant is truly effective as the national \nstandard. The exemption would be conditioned on a finding that the \ntotal loading of all pollutants to the environment through the air, \nsurface water, ground water and to agricultural and residential lands \nwould not be greater under the exemption than it would be if the \npharmaceutical plant complied with the national standard.\n  With respect to determining compliance, the State of Michigan should \nassume that the Kalamazoo plant is operating at discharge levels \nconsistent with the technology requirements and other requirements of \nthe law including water quality based limitations incorporated into the \npermit. Any removals achieved beyond this level are available to offset \nthe reductions that would otherwise have been achieved by the \npharmaceutical plant.\n  If the argument made for this rider is correct--that the Kalamazoo \ntreatment plant protects the environment with respect to the wastes \nfrom industrial sources as well as any national regulation could--well \nthen, the pharmaceutical plant could get its exemption. If that showing \ncannot be made, then the pretreatment program that will apply to all of \nthe rest of the pharmaceutical industry, would apply in this case, too.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and the two Senators from \nMichigan for working to make sure that this amendment does precisely \nwhat it was intended to.\n  I believe the refinements in the amendment have been worked out to \nthe satisfaction of all parties. We think the objective is a good \nobjective. We are prepared to accept the measure on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I add my thanks to the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Rhode Island, who has worked very hard with \nus to try to find language that will allow this project to go forward, \nto try to save the taxpayers of Kalamazoo, MI, from having to build an \nalmost identical water treatment facility to the one that already \nexists to deal with problems at the existing facility. We appreciate \nthat.\n  We will continue to move forward and continue to work with the \nSenator from Rhode Island to make sure this project successfully stays \non track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2790) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2791\n\n   (Purpose: To make an amendment relating to housing assistance to \n                         residents of colonias)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \ncommittee amendments are set aside, and the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2791.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 40, line 17, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That section 916 of the \n     Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act shall apply \n     with respect to fiscal year 1996, notwithstanding section \n     916(f) of that Act''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment \nwith my colleagues Senator Hutchison and Senator Domenici. This \namendment would extend for 1 year the authority of the Secretary to \nrequire a set aside of up to 10 percent of a United States-Mexico \nborder State's community development block grant allocation, as under \nsection 916 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of \n1990, for colonias. The colonias provision has been in effect in every \nyear following the passage of the Cranston-Gonzalez Act in the 101st \nCongress, allow the original authorization lapsed in 1994. It is not a \nchange in the status quo, and has no budget impact. Although section \n916 of Cranston-Gonzalez requires States to make 10 percent of CDBG \nfunds available for colonias, in cases like New Mexico and California, \nwhere the full 10 percent has not been utilized each year, HUD has \nallowed States to reallocate the funds within the State. The point is \nthat the funding is there.\n  For my colleagues not familiar with colonias, these are distressed, \nrural, and predominantly unincorporated communities located within 150 \nmiles of the United States-Mexico border. Texas has documented well \nover 1,100 colonias, while my State of New Mexico has over 30. They are \noften created \n\n[[Page S 14366]]\nwhen developers sell unimproved lots, and using sales contracts, retain \ntitle until the debt on the property is fully paid. They often do not \nhave adequate water and sewage access.\n  These conditions create a serious public health, safety, and \nenvironmental risk to the border regions. Perhaps more importantly, \nthey represent third-world conditions in the United States. I believe, \nand the Secretary of HUD agrees, that we must make the eradication of \nsuch conditions within the United States a national priority.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will accept this amendment, \naddressing the problems of the colonias has been a national priority, \nand I believe that it should remain one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I know that this amendment is supported by \nSenators on this side, the Senator from New Mexico and the junior \nSenator from Texas. We are making inquiry to determine whether they \nwish to speak on this amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to add my statement in support \nof Senator Bingaman's amendment of which I am a cosponsor. I do \nappreciate this 10 percent set-aside for the colonias. Colonias are \nplaces that we did not know existed in America. You would not believe \nit. I have walked in a colonia. They are places that people live that \ndo not have good water, and they do not have sanitary systems or sewage \ntreatment. They are terrible.\n  What we are we doing with this amendment is to say that it is a \npriority for our country to clear those places up so that every \nAmerican has the ability to live in sanitary, basically clean \nconditions. I support the amendment. I appreciate Senator Bond taking \nthis amendment for us to make sure that we serve the people in need.\n  The issue of designating a portion of border States' CDBG money for \nhousing is one of giving proper recognition and emphasis to the \ndevelopment needs of severely distressed, rural and mostly \nunincorporated settlements located along the United States-Mexico \nborder. Colonias are located within 150 miles of the Mexican border, in \nthe States of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas.\n  Texas has the longest border with Mexico of any state.\n  In 1993, Texas reported the existence of 1,193 colonias with an \nestimated population of 279,963 people. In 1994, New Mexico reported 34 \ncolonias, with a population of 28,000 residents.\n  Senator Bingaman and I believe it important to formally recognize the \nscale of this challenge.\n  For fiscal year 1995, VA, HUD appropriations report language \nspecified 10 percent of the State's share of CDBG money for housing in \ncolonias. The conference report did not specify, ``colonias,'' but \ninstead, folded that commitment into $400 million for a number of new \ninitiatives.\n  That money came under a sunset provision. It requires new action to \ncontinue the formal commitment from us at the Federal level.\n  This does not involve any new or additional funds.\n  It is merely a statement of urgent priority that these funds be \navailable for housing in the colonias upon application.\n  This money only comes from the border States' shares. It does not \nimpinge on any other States or their resources.\n  Mr. President, I urge we reaffirm that commitment to the people of \nthe colonias that they are truly a part of American society and \nAmerica's priorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Bingaman-Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest we proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2791) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 142, line 20, after the period, insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That the Administrator shall \n     continue funding the Brownfields Economic Redevelopment \n     Initiative from available funds at a level necessary to \n     complete the award of 50 cumulative Brownfield Pilots planned \n     for award by the end of FY96 and carry out other elements of \n     the Brownfields Action Agenda in order to facilitate economic \n     redevelopment at Brownfields sites.''\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Lieberman to preserve a very small but important \npart of the Superfund Program, EPA's brownfields economic redevelopment \ninitiative. We all know what brownfields are--they are the abandoned \nplant that might be contaminated, or might not be. No one knows exactly \nwhat the problems at these sites are, so people are afraid to invest in \nthem or redevelop them, people are afraid of liability. So rather using \nold industrial sites, new development flees the city and tears up our \nopen space, greenfields. In the meantime, these old sites remain a \nblight and a big hole in local tax bases.\n  EPA's brownfields economic redevelopment initiative--its brownfields \nprogram--is a Superfund success story. The brownfields initiative is a \ncost-effective means of ameliorating some of these unintended \nconsequences of Superfund, especially in economically depressed urban \nareas. Real risk reduction is achieved when brownfields sites are \ncleaned up, and it is private investment money that does most of the \nwork. The small amount of money EPA allocates to brownfields is highly \nleveraged.\n  This effort includes 50 planned pilot projects across the Nation to \ndemonstrate that we can reuse existing contaminated sites for economic \ndevelopment instead of undeveloped clean sites. Each of these pilot \nprojects are awarded up to $200,000 over 2 years. These funds are used \nto help with the up-front investigations and evaluation that must take \nplace before deciding on how best to clean a site.\n  To date, EPA has awarded about 18 out of 50 planned grants. I think \nit's vitally important that EPA's brownfields effort continue as a high \npriority, and the purpose of my amendment is to make sure that this \nhappens.\n  What is the consequence if we fail to encourage the private sector to \ntake on brownfields sites? Often, the sites remain abandoned or \norphan--as many are--they may migrate onto the NPL or State lists for \npublicly funded cleanup. The Superfund bill Senator Smith is working to \nbring forward in the next few weeks will contain provisions to make \nbrownfields redevelopment easier.\n  This is a good way to spend some of the limited Superfund dollars \navailable this year. We get real risk reduction by examining and \nevaluating these sites. We are learning valuable lessons at each of the \npilots on how to create public and private partnerships between the \nFederal Government, State and local government, and the private sector \nto get abandoned urban eyesores back on the tax roles, producing jobs \nin cities like Providence. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment to preserve one of the best things EPA has done on Superfund \nin the past several years.\n  I commend Senator Bond, a member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee as well as chairman of the Committee on Small Business and \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over Superfund, for \nhis interest in Superfund and his commitment to helping us move forward \nwith Superfund reform this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has offered this amendment. I am very glad he called it to our \nattention. We have, in St. Louis, MO, a significant impact from the \nbrownfields question. I think this is one of EPA's better initiatives. \nIt may make one suspicious to look at the breadth of support of this.\n  But David Osborne, author of ``Reinventing Government,'' said:\n\n       This is an important initiative. The barriers to cleaning \n     up urban Superfund sites have stopped redevelopment in its \n     tracks time and time again. This initiative will begin to \n     solve that problem. It will bring businesses back to the \n     city, create jobs and increase the urban tax base.\n  Gregg Easterbrook, author of ``A Moment on the Earth,'' said:\n\n       EPA's Brownfields initiative represents ecological realism \n     at its finest, balancing the needs of nature and commerce. \n     This path-breaking initiative shows that environmental \n     protection can undergo genuine regulatory reform, becoming \n     simpler and more cost-effective, without sacrifice of its \n     underlying mission.\n\n  Philip Howard, author of ``The Death of Common Sense,'' said:\n\n       EPA's Brownfields initiative represents an important change \n     in direction. It will help the environment and the economy at \n     the same time by dealing with the problem of contaminated \n     properties in a commonsense way.\n\n  I think this is a win-win proposition for everybody. We are delighted \nto accept the amendment on this side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I wish to congratulate the Senator from Rhode Island \nwho came forth with this amendment. Not only do we not object to the \namendment, we enthusiastically support it.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wanted to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland and also the manager of the bill, Senator Bond, a \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Both have been \nvery helpful to us as we worked our way through this amendment. I \nparticularly am grateful to all staff who has also been very \ncooperative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2792) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2793\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for the Service Members Occupational \n                    Conversion and Training Program)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2793.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 19, strike ``$1,345,300,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,352,180,000.''\n       On page 3, strike line 24 and add ``as amended; Provided \n     further, That of the amounts appropriated for readjustment \n     benefits, $6,880,000 shall be available for funding the \n     Service Members Occupational Conversion and Training program \n     as authorized by sections 4481-4497 of Public Law 102-484, as \n     amended.''\n       On page 10, line 18, strike ``$88,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$872,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment will provide funding for \nthe Service Members Occupational Conversion and Training Act, known as \nSMOCTA. SMOCTA is the common name for it.\n  It will provide job training for unemployed veterans, veterans whose \noccupational specialty in the military is not transferable to the \ncivilian work force, and for veterans rated 30 percent disabled or \nhigher. The amendment \n\n[[Page S 14368]]\nprovides funding to continue the program for 1 year. It is paid for by \ntransferring less than 1 percent of VA's general operating expense \naccount, $8 million. In other words, the general operating expense fund \ncontains $880 million; this amendment transfers only $8 million, less \nthan 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, the SMOCTA program was created by the fiscal year 1993 \nDefense Authorization Act as a pilot program to provide training wage \nsubsidies to employers who hire recently separated unemployed service \nmembers for new careers in the private sector. The 1993 Defense \nAppropriations Act appropriated $75 million for SMOCTA. Those funds \nhave been largely obligated, and any remaining balance will not be \navailable for obligation after September 30, 1995. This amendment will \nprovide a minimum level of funding to carry out the program through its \nperiod of authorization, September 30, 1996. Mr. President, although \nthere were some initial bureaucratic delays in getting the program \nimplemented, the program has been very successful. Over 8,300 employers \nhave certified training programs, including national corporate chains. \nThose employers have filed nearly 15,000 notices of intent to employ \nveterans. Over 50,000 veterans have been certified for the program. \nApproximately 10,700 veterans have been placed in job training, for a \nperiod of 12-18 months, at an average cost per veteran of approximately \n$4,000.\n  The Departments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans Affairs have worked \nhard to establish this program. It would be a mistake to let this \nprogram expire at this time. To not extend this program would send a \nmessage to the veterans of our Nation, caught in the military \ndownsizing, that we do not care about their futures. It would tell \nemployers that the Federal Government cannot be trusted in partnership \nagreements. I do not believe these are messages the U.S. Senate wishes \nto send.\n  Mr. President, without this amendment, SMOCTA funding will terminate \nat the end of the current fiscal year. My amendment will cure the \nconflict between the authorization period and availability of \nappropriations for this program.\n  Mr. President, there has been some debate over the proper funding \nsource for this program. This results partly because the original \nfunding for this program was from Defense appropriations. However, let \nme emphasize that this is not a program directly related to our funding \nmilitary readiness or modernization. It is a program for veterans. The \nauthorization recognized this program would require a partnership \nbetween the Defense Department, the Department of Labor, and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Passing funding responsibility from one \nagency to another will not aid our veterans who rely on readjustment \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, the SMOCTA program has strong support in the business \ncommunity and the veterans community. I encourage my colleagues to join \nin supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, both sides have agreed to accept \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2793) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to thank the manager of the bill on behalf of \nthe veterans of this country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2794\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n Agency not to act under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act \n to prohibit the manufacturing, processing, or distributing of certain \n         fishing sinkers or lures to giving notice to Congress)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Harkin. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2794.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency shall not, under authority of section 6 of the Toxic \n     Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2605), take final action on \n     the proposed rule dated February 28, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 11122 \n     (March 9, 1994)) to prohibit or otherwise restrict the \n     manufacturing, processing, distributing, or use of any \n     fishing sinkers or lures containing lead, zinc, or brass \n     unless the Administrator finds that the risk to waterfowl \n     cannot be addressed through alternative means in which case, \n     the rule making may proceed 180 days after Congress is \n     notified of the finding.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this legislation deals with lead \nsinkers. It has been worked out on both sides. Senator Harkin wished to \nhave this amendment adopted. It has been cleared, I believe, by both \nsides, and I move its adoption.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, since my State of Missouri is not only a \nleading manufacturer of fishing lures and therefore very much \ninterested in it--Missouri happens to host a large number of people who \nenjoy fishing--it is therefore with great pleasure on behalf of this \nside that we are willing to accept the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2794) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2795\n\n(Purpose: To provide HUD with the authority to renew expiring section 8 \n  project-based contracts through a budget-based analysis. This will \nprovide HUD with the tools to begin to address the high-cost of section \n   8 project-based assistance while Congress begins to fully address \n options in lieu of the renewal of section 8 project-based assistance. \n This amendment will help provide HUD with tools to avoid foreclosure \n                 and possible displacement of tenants)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nthe pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant \nlegislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] for himself, Mr. \n     D'Amato, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Mack, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2795.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 105, beginning on line 10, strike ``SEC. 214.'' and \n     all that follows through line 4 on page 107:\n\n     ``SEC. 214. SECTION 8 CONTRACT RENEWAL.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary shall renew upon expiration each contract \n     for project-based assistance under section 8 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937 that expires during fiscal year \n     1996 in accordance with this subsection.\n       ``(b) Contract Term.--Each contract described in subsection \n     (a) may be renewed for a term not to exceed 2 years.\n       ``(c) Rents and Other Contract Terms.--Except as provided \n     in subsections (d) and (e), the Secretary shall offer to \n     renew each contract described in subsection (a) (including \n     any contract relating to a multifamily project whose mortgage \n     is insured or assisted under the new construction and \n     substantial rehabilitation program under section 8 of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937):\n       ``(1) at a rent equal to the budget-based rent for the \n     project;\n       ``(2) at the current rent, where the current rent does not \n     exceed 120 percent of the fair market rent for the \n     jurisdiction in which the project is located; or\n       ``(3) at the current rent, pending the implementation of \n     guidelines for budget-based rents.\n       ``(d) Loan Management Set-Aside Contracts.--The Secretary \n     shall offer to renew each loan management set-aside contract \n     at a rent equal to the budget-based rent for the unit, as \n     determined by the Secretary, for a period not to exceed 1 \n     year.\n       ``(e) Tenant-Based Assistance Option.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the Secretary may, with the consent \n     of the owner of a project that is subject to a contract \n     described in subsection (a) and with notice to and in \n     consultation with the tenants, agree to provide tenant-based \n     rental assistance under section 8(b) or 8(o) in lieu of \n     renewing a contract to provide project-based \n\n[[Page S 14369]]\n     rental assistance under subsection (a).

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nMr. D'Amato, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Mack. This is designed to provide HUD \nwith authority to renew expiring section 8 project-based contracts \nthrough a budget-based analysis.\n  Now, what that means is that we are working with HUD, with OMB and \nthe Congressional Budget Office to resolve a very difficult problem \nwhere project-based certificates have been issued in the past. The cost \nis above market rate. These are expensive projects.\n  HUD knows, we know, the budget offices know, we have to resolve this \nproblem. Since we were unable to get an agreement on a measure to fix \nthe problem this year and stay within our budget allocations, there was \na prospect that in some areas where there was very little available \nhousing, people who live in project-based section 8 housing could be \ndisplaced.\n  This problem was particularly acute in Salt Lake City, UT. Senator \nBennett brought that to our attention. We found that there are many \nother areas around the country where it is possible that the \ndevelopments could be converted to private use, people displaced. Even \nthough we would make available section 8 certificates for those people \ndisplaced, as a simple matter of fact, there may not have been enough \nhousing to take care of them. This is particularly true for the elderly \nand disabled.\n  This amendment tells the Secretary to use a budget-based analysis to \ntake a look at the costs of operating the Department and the debt \nservice, to renew the contracts for a year on a basis which is fair \nboth to the owner of the property and to the Federal Government so that \nwe may continue to work on the problem of resolving the question about \nthe expenditure on project-based certificates which are far above \nmarket rate.\n  This is a fix that I think is acceptable on both sides. I hope my \ncolleagues will accept it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to rise in support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. I absolutely concur \nwith his remarks.\n  In our hearings in the subcommittee, we found that the issues related \nto market rate are quite severe. They need to be addressed. They need \nto be addressed with some promptness and urgency. Otherwise, we could \nbe facing the debacle not unlike some of the issues we faced in the S \ncrisis.\n  Senator Bond of Missouri is really an expert on this issue. I believe \nwe should follow his lead on this amendment. I support it. I am willing \nto accept it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman for assistance in dealing with an issue that is very important \nto myself, Senator Exon and the people of the rural areas of Nebraska. \nAs you are aware, there is currently a large differential in rents \nbetween rural and urban areas in our country. I am concerned that too \nlarge a variance would have a significant adverse effect on low income \nelderly populations. We must enable developers to continue to provide \nour rural areas with this valuable service. This is a problem not just \nin Nebraska but also in neighboring States that have large rural \npopulations. I understand the need for the budgetary constraints that \nhave been placed upon your committee. However, unrealistically low fair \nmarket rents will have a devastating impact on the numerous rural \nbeneficiaries of assisted housing. As the fair market rent levels \ndecline, the negative effects of excessive rent differentials between \nurban and nearby rural areas become more significant. I respectfully \nask the chairman to do what he can to rectify this unfortunate \nsituation in the conference.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the concerns expressed by Senator \nKerrey. Obviously there will be some real variances between smaller, \nrural communities and our larger, metropolitan areas. Nonetheless, we \nneed to continue to provide a realistic incentive for developers to \nbuild projects in areas that are experiencing a shortage of affordable \nhousing. I would also urge the committee to review the current \nmechanism.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership that Senator \nKerrey has taken on this issue. One of the reasons that the current \nsituation regarding fair market rents in small towns is so unfair is \nthe history of how many of these projects were developed up to 20 years \nago. The rent limitations that were used at the time were about the \nsame for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Now, at contract \nrenewal time, the projects in smaller towns outside metropolitan areas \nare subject to far different rent standards than urban areas face. \nThere are some projects that face rent levels that will actually be \nlower than the rents approved 20 years ago when the projects were \nbuilt. These very low rent levels create a situation where projects \nwill not be able to be maintained. Projects may be forced into \nforeclosure or conversion to regular rental housing. Current renters in \nmy State, mostly the elderly and disabled, will face deteriorating \nbuildings or eviction. They may get new section 8 certificates. But, \nthe availability of affordable housing in homes near elderly resident's \nfamilies will not, in a large number of cases, be available. I ask that \nthis problem be examined in conference and relief fashioned to treat \nprojects in small towns outside metropolitan areas in a fair and even \nhanded manner.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's comments. I \ncertainly understand the severity of this problem. Missouri, as well as \nNebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa is home to a largely rural population. \nI, too, am concerned for the future of this program. I will work with \nSenator Mikulski and members of the conference to address this issue. \nWe include in this bill provisions which will make available budget-\nbased rent renewal levels for project-based contracts which will remove \nthe artificial impediment of the current ``fair market'' calculation. I \nhope this will help address this serious concern.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2795) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  MACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of engaging in a \nshort colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Missouri, the \nchairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. Will the Senator \nassist me in clarifying an issue in the bill under consideration today?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be pleased to assist my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Mississippi and senior member of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page S 14370]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Missouri. The issue I wish to \nclarify is the Appropriations Committee's intent regarding the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's refinery maximum achievable control \ntechnology [MACT] rule. This rulemaking is of deep concern to me, as I \nam sure it is to the Senator from Missouri.\n  In promulgating the refinery MACT rule, EPA has ignored the \nprinciples of sound science, used outdated data to establish emissions \ncontrols, developed extremely questionable estimates of the benefits to \nbe gained from these emissions controls, and failed to take into \naccount the impact of these regulations on the smaller refiners around \nthe nation, including those in my home State of Mississippi.\n  Does the Senator from Missouri share my concerns?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, sir, I do. In fact, the concerns of the Senator from \nMississippi reflect the concerns of the Appropriations Committee. In \nthe committee's report on this bill, we expressed our disapproval with \nthe way in which EPA promulgated the refinery MACT rule. To quote from \nthe committee report: ``The committee strongly encourages EPA to \nreevaluate the refinery MACT and other MACT standards which are not \nbased on sound science''.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chairman. One further point. Would the \nChairman agree that there is significant sentiment on the \nAppropriations Committee and in the Senate to talk further, and perhaps \ntake stronger, action on this issue next year if EPA does not engage in \na serious reevaluation of the refinery MACT rule during fiscal year \n1996?\n  Mr. BOND. That is indeed the sentiment of many members of the \ncommittee. I have heard from many of my colleagues, both on the \nAppropriations Committee and the authorizing committee--the Environment \nand Public Works Committee--on the refinery MACT issue. The Senator and \nhis colleagues can be assured that if EPA does not heed the directive \ncontained in the Committee report on this bill, the leadership of the \ncommittee will be prepared to take additional action in the future.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chairman. I appreciate this willingness to \naddress the refinery MACT issue in the committee report.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with \nchairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I want to discuss the need for regulatory reform at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  As the chairman knows, I have been extremely concerned with the \npetroleum refinery MACT regulation. MACT is the acronym for the term \nmaximum achievable control technology. I would like to thank him for \nadding report language which reflects the committee's concerns with \nthis rule. I strongly encourage EPA to reevaluate this rule because it \nis not based on sound science.\n  In 1980, industry did not have the extensive controls and \ntechnologies that are now in use. In fact, in 1980, the requirements \nfrom the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments had not yet kicked in. \nObviously, in the last 15 years, refineries have made significant \nimprovements in reducing emissions. EPA has simply ignored all of these \nimprovements and based a rule on 15-year-old data in order to inflate \nits benefits.\n  This rule will cost refineries and fuel consumers in this country at \nleast $100 million each year. This puts refineries in Montana and \nthroughout the Nation at economic risk. And what about the jobs these \nrefineries provide the local communities? Well, they are at risk, too. \nAlmost $20 million of this will be spent to meet the paperwork and \nmonitoring requirements of the rule which do nothing to improve public \nhealth or the environmental protection.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make one final point. All of the \ninformation is based on EPA's own data and analysis. None of this \ninformation is based on any kind of industry study. This information \ncan be found in the final rule published in the Federal Register on \nAugust 18, 1995. Refiners in Montana have simply asked that this rule \nbe based on sound science, including accurate and current data. They \nhave not asked for any rollback of environmental regulations. Since the \ndata are the basis for the entire rulemaking, it seems to me that EPA \nmust go back to the beginning and redo the rule from scratch.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman in conference regarding \nthe refinery MACT rule; and I thank him.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Montana has valid concerns. Other members \nof the subcommittee have also questioned the basis for this rule. I \nwill work with him and other members in the conference committee \nregarding the regulation. This rule will serve as an important \nprecedent for subsequent MACT regulations for other industries.\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate the chairman's comments and support.\n\n\n                 brevard and leavenworth va facilities\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it strikes me that the VA has not given a \ngreat deal of thought to defining its mission for the next century. In \nits fiscal year 1996 budget submission, the VA requested funding for \ntwo new hospitals. However, it is clear that our veterans would be \nbetter served if the VA, like the rest of the Nation's health care \nproviders, began focusing on outpatient and ambulatory care. I note \nwith interest that the committee has not funded the VA's hospital \nconstruction request. I believe that is a result of the committee's \nconcern about VA's lack of strategic planning as well as budgetary \nconcerns.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my colleague is correct. Today, the VA is \nunable to provide a strategic vision of VA health care for the next \ncentury that squares with facility investment decisions. The VA's \nfiscal year 1996 request continues to emphasize costly and inefficient \nhealth care delivery systems that are out of step with the overall \nnational trends in health care. Given the fact that private-sector \nhealth care providers have moved in the direction of outpatient care, \ncoupled with plummeting Federal budgets and the demographic trends \nrelated to veterans, it would not be prudent to build additional \nhospitals. Similarly, other investment decisions such as building new \nambulatory and long-term care facilities cannot be made rationally \nwithout an overall plan that reconciles facilities to health care goals \nand populations. I am also concerned about the budgetary requirements \nof building new facilities. Not only is construction costly but \noperating costs will put additional pressures on a declining budget.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, east central Florida is a critically \nunderserved area with a growing population of retired, limited-income \nveterans. Florida has the highest percentage of veterans 65 years and \nolder in the Nation. They currently represent 30 percent of the State's \nveterans population and, contrary to GAO's recent report, the numbers \nare increasing daily. Certainly, Florida veterans, Senator Graham, and \nI acknowledge the budget constraints before this Congress and the need \nfor a balanced budget. For this reason, we have modified our present \nrequest to reflect fiscal reality while still meeting long identified \nmedical service needs. Recognizing that neither the House nor the \nSenate intend to fund the original plan for a comprehensive medical \nfacility at this time, we are requesting that the VA be able to use the \npreviously appropriated fiscal year 1995 funds for the design and \nconstruction of an outpatient medical facility and long-term nursing \ncare facility which will provide immediate relief to Florida veterans.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I stand along side my colleague, Mr. Mack, \nin calling this Congress to take action in providing long promised and \nmuch needed medical services to Florida veterans. While Congress \nsquabbled over the location of the facility, our veterans continued to \nwait. Finally, with the issue of location resolved, the President's \nfiscal year 1996 budget request included this facility, and veterans \nthought they saw the light at the end of the tunnel. We were extremely \ndisappointed to say the least when that request was ignored by the \nHouse VA/HUD Subcommittee.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, rather than a new hospital, I propose a \nnursing home facility and an outpatient clinic which will help complete \nthe southeast regional and statewide network of veteran health care \nproviders while addressing the need to provide long-term care service \nto veterans in east central Florida.\n\n[[Page S 14371]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague from Florida \nregarding downgrading the request for funding a comprehensive hospital \nto an outpatient clinic and long-term nursing care facility. This \nproposal is to construct a nursing home care facility and outpatient \nclinic on the site contributed for the East Central Florida Medical \nCenter to provide specialized care which is not currently available.\n  A 120-bed nursing home care unit will have, in addition to regular \nnursing home care, the capacity to provide psychogeriatric care--\nincluding that for Alzheimer's patients--and ventilator-dependent care. \nThe ambulatory care clinic will be available to serve all veterans in \nthe area. Approximately 30,000 patient visits per year will be \naccommodated. The total cost would be $35 million. We have existing \nfunds of $17.2 million which was appropriated in fiscal year 1995 for \nthe design and planning of the VA medical facility. We would like to \nuse those funds toward the design and construction of the alternative \nproposal. In the near future, we would request that Congress provide \nthe balance of $17.8 million to complete the project. This proposal is \nmore than a Band-aid to the problem and is surely a more reasonable \nrequest for our veterans to make of this Congress.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I agree that outpatient, ambulatory care \nshould be the focus of future construction by the VA. In my home State \nof Kansas, I have been working closely with the staff of the Dwight D. \nEisenhower VAMC in Leavenworth to improve outpatient care for our \nveterans with the addition of a new ambulatory care clinic. Currently, \nprimary care treatment processes at the Leavenworth VAMC are \nunnecessarily fragmented and severely deficient in the space required \nfor their functions. This clinic is a must if the Leavenworth VAMC is \nto retain its College of American Pathologists accreditation.\n  Last year, the Congress provided funds to begin planning and design \nof this facility. It is my expectation that the VA will include this \nproject in next year's budget. However, if they do not, it is my \nunderstanding that the committee will give this project every \nconsideration. I would ask my friend, the Chairman, is that correct?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the majority leader is correct. The \ncommittee is well aware of the need for the Brevard County and \nLeavenworth facilities. We understand that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs will be in a position to begin construction of the Brevard \nfacility during fiscal year 1996 and the Leavenworth facility in fiscal \nyear 1997. Like my colleagues, I expect the Department to consider \nincluding these projects in its fiscal year 1997 budget submission. \nHowever, if they do not, we will carefully consider both projects.\n\n\n                       toxic substances registry\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I would like to commend my colleague from Missouri and the \nChairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee for continued funding of the Agency \nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry study on minority health. I \nbelieve this is important work. I would also like to speak to a \ncomplementary research effort that will help to protect minority \npopulations, women, infants, and other populations from the adverse \nhealth effects of consuming chemically contaminated fish. In \nparticular, this study identifies specific populations residing in the \nGreat Lakes basin that may be at higher risk of exposure to chemical \ncontaminants present in one or more of the Great Lakes. To date, ATSDR \nhas learned about the trends in Great Lakes fish consumption. For \nexample, fish is an essential component of diets of minority \npopulations such as Native Americans and sport-anglers. The preliminary \nfindings from this ATSDR study are helping to clarify the actual \nimpacts of chemical exposure through fish consumption to these specific \npopulations. In some cases, certain effects are not as prominent as \nfeared, but the study corroborates that there are human health effects \nand helps to pinpoint the trends.\n  However, continued research is needed to identify other susceptible \npopulations, exposure pathways and correlation of exposure levels to \nhealth effects. Most importantly, we need to mobilize a public \neducation effort to help members of at-risk populations and the medical \ncommunity learn about the adverse human health effects of contaminated \nfish consumption and identify ways to minimize these harmful effects. \nWithout continued funding the money and time invested in this research \nwill be wasted and we will not have critical information to prevent \nrisks to human health from contaminated fish consumption.\n  Mr. KOHL. The Senate has proposed a $14 million cut from fiscal year \n1995 for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the \nHouse proposed a $7 million cut from fiscal year 1995. The House report \non H.R. 2099 specifically calls for continued ATSDR funding for this \nstudy on consumption of contaminated fish and the harmful human health \neffects. Continuing this incomplete study will allow us to develop \nstrategies of prevent harmful human health effects from consumption of \ncontaminated fish. Understanding the consumption trends of Great Lakes \nfish is only helpful if we can draw conclusions from that information \nand then develop strategies to prevent harmful human health effects \nfrom this significant exposure pathway. Will the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies be \nwilling to work with our colleagues in the House to ensure adequate \nfunding to complete this important, far-sighted research?\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the concerns expressed by the Senators from \nOhio and Wisconsin about this ATSDR study and I have a better \nunderstanding of the significance of continued funding for the research \non chemically contaminated fish. I will give close consideration in \nConference to securing adequate funding for the ATSDR study on the \nhuman health effects of contaminated fish consumption.\n\n\n                            Savannah sewers\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Chairman's \nattention a critically needed project in Savannah, GA. Savannah, has \nbeen plagued with repetitive and devastating flooding over the last 15 \nyears. The population affected is primarily low-income, distressed, and \nminority. These families have repeatedly been forced to leave their \nhomes and businesses with great economic consequences.\n  The Federal, State and local governments have had to, on several \noccasions, commit significant resources to address the emergency needs \nof these areas. Consequently, the city of Savannah, in collaboration \nwith the private and nonprofit sectors, has created a highly innovative \nplan to provide permanent solutions to the core flood areas that will \nsignificantly reduce long-term Government expenditures.\n  The overall plan involves over $100 million in carefully constructed \nengineering solutions. The city has already committed and raised $32 \nmillion of this total. They have also devised a series of retention \nstructures, canal widening and station collector system improvements \nthat will save the Federal Government money over the long-term and \nrepresent a true abatement commitment.\n  Mr. President, I seek the Chairman's support for Federal \nparticipation in this unique partnership, albeit on a limited basis. If \nthe conference committee should decide to provide funding for EPA sewer \ntreatment grants, I would appreciate his careful consideration of the \nSavannah project. The City of Savannah requests $900,000 for critical \nengineering studies for pumping, engineering, and canal widening work \nin these flood-prone areas and $10 million for crucial collector system \nimprovements at the primary pumping station.\n  I would remind the Chairman that the city has already raised $32 \nmillion toward the overall cost and plan components. Therefore these \nEPA funds would be matched with proven commitments.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator for his comments and request. I am \naware of the serious flooding and wastewater/sewer problems confronted \nby the city of Savannah. Like the Senator from Georgia, I have \nfirsthand knowledge of the devastation that such repetitive flooding \ncan have on families, homes and small businesses. I am impressed by the \nlevel of resources already committed by the City of Savannah to resolve \nthis problem in a more efficient, cost-effective manner. The Senator \nfrom Georgia and the city of Savannah are to be commended for his new \nprivate-public partnership concept.\n\n[[Page S 14372]]\n\n  Accordingly, it would be my intention that this project receive \npriority consideration in conference for funding through the fiscal \nyear 1996 allocations made under this bill for water infrastructure \nneeds.\n\n\n                             ciesin funding\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to engage the distinguished manager of the \nbill in a brief colloquy regarding concerns that have already been \nraised by the junior Senator from Michigan. This matter regards the \nfiscal 1996 funding situation of the Consortium for International Earth \nScience Information Network [CIESIN].\n  I am grateful that the Chairman has provided some assurances that \nCIESIN will not be prohibited from competitively bidding on NASA \ncontracts in the future, despite the Committee's concurrence with the \n``House recommendation'' regarding specific funding for CIESIN. I would \nappreciate the Chairman's assistance in clarifying this statement just \na little further. It is my understanding that the House report \nlanguage, while not funding CIESIN specifically, does not in any way \nlimit the opportunity for CIESIN and NASA to continue to operate under \nthe terms of the existing contract, including option years.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Michigan is correct. While we do not \nidentify specific 1996 funds for CIESIN within this bill, nothing \ninterferes with the rights and options that either party has under the \nexisting contract.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Missouri for that clarification \nand appreciate his willingness to address our concerns. If the manager \nof the bill will yield further, the committee's report suggests that \nNASA should seek greater commercial, international, and Government \nparticipation in the EOSDIS program, with the goal of reducing costs. \nAnd, the Committee has highlighted the Goddard Space Flight Center in \nMaryland and the Earth Resources Observation System Data Center in \nSioux Falls, SD, as core elements of a revamped EOSDIS.\n  Given that CIESIN has already developed international partners, is \nbroadly supported by university researchers, and has won recognition \nfor its innovative software, including this year's Smithsonian award \nfor innovative software development, would the Chairman concur that \nCIESIN should be afforded appropriate recognition by NASA in the \nagency's development of its fiscal 1997 appropriation request, \nespecially since the committee's report already urges NASA to integrate \nCIESIN activities within its EOS plan for fiscal year 1996?\n  Mr. BOND. That matter will, of course, be up to NASA and the \nadministration. But, given that CIESIN is already meeting standards \nthat this committee has set out for other components of EODIS, we would \nexpect that CIESIN would be given full and fair consideration in the \ndevelopment of NASA's fiscal 1997 budget request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chairman for assisting me in clarifying the \ncommittee's intentions. I also want to acknowledge and thank the \ndistinguished ranking member for her assistance in funding CIESIN in \npast years.\n\n\n                       tenant opportunity program\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am wondering if the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee will engage in a colloquy with me regarding the Tenant \nOpportunity Program.\n  Mr. BOND. I would be pleased to yield to my colleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend. Mr. President, the Tenant Opportunity \nProgram--known as TOP--was created by the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development to provide technical assistance and training for \npublic housing residents to organize their communities. Its goal is \ntenant empowerment. That may be a noble goal. But, TOP is not, in my \nview, the best way to achieve it.\n  The program is poorly designed, loosely structured, and ripe for \nabuse. Just how ripe was evident earlier this year in the city of \nWilmington, DE. Six Wilmington public housing projects were each \nawarded $100,000 TOP grants, and a consultant--a consultant--tried to \nclaim $60,000 of each grant. Incredible as it may sound, my colleagues \nheard me correctly: 60 percent of each TOP grant in Wilmington, DE was \ngoing to be paid to a consultant. That's a total consultant fee of \n$360,000 from just six grants.\n  Mr. President, this may sound like one bad apple. And, the Department \nis to be commended for investigating this case, discovering that the \napplication procedures were violated by the consultant, and canceling \nthese particular six grants. But, the more I look into the whole \nprogram, the more I am convinced that the problem here is with the \nprogram itself.\n  For example, the most disorganized public housing projects in \nWilmington--the ones that need this program the most--were unable to \nget a TOP grant because they were not organized enough. That is a \nclassic Catch-22 situation. Another example: no where does the program \nrequire that the recipients of the grants specify exactly how the \ntaxpayers' money will be used. And, the major beneficiary of this \nprogram seems to be consultants, not public housing residents.\n  Now, I would like to ask the chairman of the Subcommittee about the \nCommittee's intention regarding funding for TOP. The House, in its \nversion of the VA-HUD Appropriations bill, provided $15 million for the \nprogram. As I read the Senate version of the bill, no funding is \nprovided for TOP. I want to ask the chairman if my understanding is \ncorrect--that it is the committee's intent to kill this program.\n  And, before he answers, let me just say that I ask this question \nbecause the Department created TOP in the first place without an \nexplicit authorization from Congress. My concern is that without an \nexplicit statement from Congress that TOP is to receive no funding, I \nfear that the Department may try to fund the program anyway, using \nunearmarked funds from the annual contributions for assisted housing \naccount or funds from the Supportive Services Program under the \nCommunity Development Grants.\n  In other words, I am concerned about the Department playing shell \ngames, and I want to be absolutely clear for the record. Is it the \nCommittee's intent that no money whatsoever is to be spent on the \nTenant Opportunity Program?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, yes, the Senator from Delaware is correct. \nThis bill provides no money for the Tenant Opportunity Program--and the \nDepartment is not to use any funds to continue the program.\n  What we are trying to do in this bill is to make better use of \nlimited HUD dollars--and to make sure that those dollars benefit the \nresidents of public housing. I agree with the Senator that TOP appears \nto have a lot of problems in the way it is administered, and it is \nclearly not providing the benefits to residents that it should.\n  I should note, however, that within the broad parameters of the new \nsupportive services block grant under the community development block \ngrant appropriations, localities are encouraged to provide services and \ntechnical assistance to public and assisted housing residents to \nencourage and promote employment. To this end, activities with goals \nsimilar to the TOP program are permitted, but I would certainly concur \nthat the excessive consultant payments would constitute an abuse which \nwe will not tolerate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise to enter into a colloquy with my colleagues \nSenators Bond and Mikulski regarding NASA's plans to consolidate all \nresearch and science-based aircraft at Dryden Flight Research Center.\n  Mr. BOND. I am interested to discuss this important matter with the \nSenator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am also pleased to have this opportunity to discuss \nNASA consolidation, an issue about which I have been deeply concerned.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As my colleagues know, NASA has offered a plan to \nconsolidate all flight research and science platform aircraft at NASA's \nDryden Flight Research Center in California. While I agree with the \ngoals of NASA consolidation to save taxpayers money, I have strong \nconcerns that this aircraft consolidation plan could cost more than it \nwould save. The current aircraft consolidation plan drafted by NASA \nconsiders the costs of moving the aircraft to Dryden Flight Research \nCenter, but does not include the costs to operate these aircraft from \ntheir consolidated location.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask Senator Feinstein if any other sites have been \nevaluated for this aircraft consolidation?\n\n[[Page S 14373]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do not believe so. The only consolidation plans I \nhave seen move aircraft to Dryden. While, I certainly do not oppose \nDryden as the consolidated site, I think that steps should be taken to \nensure that this consolidation will truly save the taxpayers money.\n  Mr. BOND. Would the Senator from California be amenable to requesting \nthat NASA submit their cost justifications for this consolidation to \nthe subcommittee before they proceed with consolidation?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, that would be an excellent course of action. \nPerhaps NASA's justifications should include the costs of and cost \nsavings resulting from this consolidation and the operation of this \naircraft from their consolidated location for the next 5 years.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Perhaps we should also request NASA provide the \nsubcommittee with a cost-based justification of the movement of these \naircraft before NASA takes action.\n  Mr. BOND. I think both of those suggestions are acceptable and would \nbe happy to work with Senators Mikulski and Feinstein to develop this \nlanguage in the report of the conference with the House.\n\n\n   nasa's implementation of the zero-base review and its aeronautics \n                                programs\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, when Dan Goldin became NASA Administrator \nin early 1992, the agency's annual budget was about $17.5 billion and \nheaded to about $22 billion by the end of the decade. Now, however, the \nannual budget is declining from $14.5 billion and will likely be below \n$13 billion by the end of the decade. In terms of FTE's NASA's work \nforce has been cut too--from about 24,000 in January 1993 to less than \n21,000 today, and headed to about 17,500 by the year 2000.\n  In order to manage these drastic cuts, over the last 9 or 10 months \nMr. Goldin has conducted a so-called zero-base review. The purpose of \nthis often painful process was to solicit ideas and develop plans on \nhow the agency could function more efficiently. The review was \nconducted assuming that all existing missions will continue, but \nfunctions and missions would be streamlined or downsized. Mr. Goldin \nhas made clear that any further budget cuts will result in elimination \nof core missions.\n  Now Mr. President, let me be clear that I think Dan Goldin has done \nan outstanding job in a very difficult situation. There are very few \npeople I know who have the vision, energy, and knowledge of the NASA \nAdministrator. He has been criticized for making the tough decisions, \nbut these decisions have to be made. Many of the recommendations \nresulting from the zero-base review are now beginning to be \nimplemented, and I believe it is imperative that Congress carefully \nmonitor the changes taking place at NASA so that we may be sure that we \nare getting the most from the taxpayers' dollar. Change for change's \nsake alone is not always the best policy.\n  One recommendation of the zero-base review has been brought to my \nattention, and that of my colleagues, in particular the distinguished \nSenator from California, Senator Feinstein. This proposal regards \nconsolidating flight operations management of all aircraft, except \nthose in support of the space shuttle, at Dryden Flight Research \nCenter. The review concluded that after an initial investment of $23 \nmillion, about $9 million could be saved annually if this \nrecommendation is implemented.\n  Currently NASA owns 65 research aircraft that support a wide range of \nNASA programs. Eighteen of these aircraft are scheduled to be retired \nby the end of fiscal year 1996 as a result of the programs they support \nbeing completed. The proposed consolidation would result in an \nadditional 11 aircraft being retired, leaving just 36 aircraft in \nNASA's inventory. The proposal would also result in a reduction of 80 \ncontractor and Federal FTE's, from 400 to 320.\n  Mr. President. It seems to me that the first ``A'' in ``NASA'' is at \nrisk. As a result of budget cuts, it appears that we are nearly halving \na vital component in our Nation's aeronautic research base.\n  These cuts hit particularly hard at a NASA facility which has made \nsubstantial, significant contributions over the past 50 years to our \nNation's aeronautics industry. I am speaking about NASA's Lewis \nResearch Center in Brookpark, OH. Currently seven research aircraft are \nbased out of Lewis, including a newly refurbished DC-9 which is a \ncenterpiece of Lewis' microgravity research program. It is my \nunderstanding that at least 5 of the 7 aircraft stationed at Lewis may \nbe transferred to Dryden under the proposed consolidation.\n  Now I understand that it may be possible to achieve some savings \nthrough consolidation of flight operations. However, if this action \nadversely impacts the ability of NASA scientists and engineers to \nperform their mission--and to do their research--then I think we are \nbeing penny wise and pound foolish. It is my understanding that the \nmanagers of this legislation have agreed with the Senator from \nCalifornia, that a closer look needs to be taken at this aspect of the \nzero-base review before it is finally implemented. I believe that such \na review is appropriate and I look forward to studying its results, as \nwell as other ongoing studies and audits of components of the zero-base \nreview.\n\n\n                               oversight\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to ensure \nthat the Congress is permitted to conduct appropriate oversight of a \nnew research program proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  This program is known as the Science To Achieve Results or STAR \nProgram. I want to be sure that the Agency fully advises the Congress \nof how and at what level this program will be funded and which active \nresearch programs will be affected by this redirection of funds.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the need to provide the Agency with \nadequate flexibility to direct scarce research dollars to those \nproblems posing the greatest risk to public health and the environment. \nThis program, however, it not aimed at responding to environmental \nproblems. The STAR Program is aimed at making grants to universities to \ndo basic science research at the expense of ongoing EPA-sponsored \nresearch.\n  I am convinced that the result of implementing STAR will be that \nongoing research for the Agency's regulatory programs will suffer, \nprivate sector contracts will be interrupted, and research currently \nconducted by the academic community will be terminated.\n  It is my understanding that EPA originally proposed to fund the STAR \nProgram at approximately $100 million. As the committee does not \nprovide any additional funds to finance this program, the committee \ngives EPA the flexibility to reprogram funds, without congressional \napproval, from other research accounts. I am concerned that to fund the \nSTAR Program the Agency will move funds from laboratories it currently \noperates to its headquarters to dole out to a few selected \nuniversities.\n  Mr. President, it appears that EPA is clearly attempting to move \nitself into a new area of research that is already being conducted at \nthe National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. \nThis duplication of basic science research will result in severe \nshortfalls in the applied science program.\n  I want to be sure that my colleagues understand that it is applied \nscience research that is critical to providing information to support \nthe Agency's regulatory program. As a member of the Environment \nCommittee, I am concerned that EPA's regulatory programs suffer from a \nlack of sound science principles. Further degrading this research \neffort will only result in wasted dollars and regulations that are not \nbased on sound scientific evidence.\n  Mr. President, if the aim of the STAR Program is to expand Federal \nsupport for university-based research, I submit that this aim is \nalready being accomplished by the Federal laboratories under \ncooperative agreements. The STAR Program will simply take research \ndollars from some universities to give to other universities.\n  My greatest concern with EPA's proposal is that the Agency has failed \nto justify the need for such a significant redirection of resources and \nis attempting to fund a program without full disclosure to the \nCongress.\n  The Agency has failed to demonstrate the trade offs that will occur \nfrom implementing the STAR Program \n\n[[Page S 14374]]\nand failed to disclose the negative impacts that will be imposed on \nongoing research.\n  In my view, the Agency should at the very least fully document these \nimpacts and disclose to the Congress how this program will be funded \nand at what level.\n  My amendment does not prevent the Agency from using funds for this \nprogram. My amendment simply asks the Agency to report to the Congress \non the details of this program and receive congressional approval \nbefore they move forward with the STAR Program.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for recognizing the \nmerits of this amendment and supporting its adoption.\n\n\n   IMPOSITION OF CHEMICAL USE DATA AND THE COMBUSTION STRATEGY--MACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Kit Bond, the distinguished chairman \nof the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. I \nwant to discuss two topics. The first deals with EPA's expanded \nreporting requirements for hazardous chemicals. The second is to \nclarify the Senate's position on EPA's lack of statutory authority to \npursue a combustion strategy.\n  For the first issue I am referring to EPA's plan to expand the toxic \nrelease inventory [TRI] under the Emergency Planning and Community \nRight-to-Know Act [EPCRA]. EPA is now working on regulations to require \nthe reporting of data on toxic chemical use, and to extend TRI \nreporting requirements to additional facilities. At a time when \nCongress is trying to provide responsible relief from unnecessary \nreporting, these actions would significantly increase administrative \nburdens costing hundreds of millions of dollars without commensurate \nbenefits to enhance either human health or the environment.\n  Moreover, the addition of chemical use data would not further EPCRA's \ngoal of reducing chemical releases. Chemical use bears no direct \nrelationship to emissions, waste generation, health risks or \nenvironmental hazards. Risk is a function of hazard and exposure. \nChemical use will not indicate exposure. Furthermore, EPA's plans to \nexpand regulatory requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act \nto gather chemical use data is equally inappropriate.\n  For all of these reasons, I believe that this program requires \nreexamination and redirection--not expansion along the lines that EPA \nintends. Clearly, there is an immediate need to first compare the \nreduction in risks by recent substantial reductions in emissions, \nbefore simply adding new informational requirements or facilities. \nRisks now need to be evaluated on a benefit-to-cost or a risk-to-risk \nbasis.\n  One of EPA's guiding principles in its strategic plan is pollution \nprevention. With the Pollution Prevention Act [PPA] of 1990 Congress \nestablished a national policy to focus EPA's actions on the reduction \nof wastes and releases into the environment. According to the act, \npollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever \nfeasible. While pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should \nbe treated safely, whenever possible, and safe disposal should be \nemployed only as a last resort.\n  While PPA prefers reduction of wastes and emissions at the source, \nEPA has reinterpreted the statutory definition of pollution prevention \nto place an inordinate and sometimes exclusive emphasis on reduction of \ntoxic use at the source. This mandates reductions in material or \nchemical use without consideration of emissions and risks posed by the \nsubstance. EPA's policy is based on two false assumptions. One, that \nuse indicates risk, and two, that all chemical use is harmful and \nshould be eliminated. This approach has prompted me to examine the \ndirection this administration is taking EPA with its new TRI reporting \nrequirements.\n  It is contrary to the basic objective of the manufacturing process, \nwhich is to harness reactive and toxic materials for useful and \nbeneficial purposes. While product reformulation and substitution of \nless toxic substances do have a vital place in pollution prevention, \nthe key to efficiently reducing pollution is to allow industry the \nflexibility to use as many tools as possible to achieve emissions \nreductions. Congress wisely established the pollution prevention \nhierarchy to allow for this flexibility. It must remain.\n  I believe that a timeout needs to be called on these recent changes \nto the TRI Program. The usefulness of chemical use data as well as \nexpanding the list of facilities required to report data needs to be \nassessed through public dialogue and objective analysis before it is \nrequired.\n  In fact I believe, EPA's new TRI reporting approach would exceed its \nstatutory authority. When Congress enacted EPCRA, it specifically \nconsidered the issue of whether or not EPA should have the authority to \ncollect use information, as distinct from chemical releases \ninformation. Congress decided that EPA should not have this authority.\n  A majority of the Senate, as reflected through a recorded vote, \nbelieves that TRI needs to be reexamined and redirected--not expanded \nalong the lines EPA is considering.\n  While I am not going to offer an amendment today to address this \nmatter, I think the Conference Committee should accept a legislative \nprovision that calls for a pause while Congress examines the direction \nin which EPA is taking the TRI Program. I look forward to your \ncontinued leadership and support of this effort.\n  Mr. BOND. The concerns of the Senator from Mississippi are valid and \nvery timely. During the debate on S.343, the Senate voted to retain \nprovisions to reform the toxic release inventory's listing and \ndelisting criteria along the lines sketched out by the Senator. The \ncentral feature of those reforms is a greater focus on the risk posed \nby these chemicals. As the Senator correctly notes, risk is a function \nof hazard and exposure. For this reason, I too am very troubled by \nEPA's proposal to require reporting of the mere use of materials. It is \ninconsistent with a risk-based approach, and I believe there is no \nstatutory authority for expanding the TRI to include use reporting.\n  I also share the Senator's concerns with the expansion of the TRI to \nadditional types of facilities. Just last year, the EPA nearly doubled \nthe number of chemicals subject to TRI reporting. The current reporting \ncycle will be the first cycle to incorporate this expansion. No further \nexpansion should be considered until the scope of the current expansion \nis fully apparent and it is clear the EPA has the resources to manage \nthe increased amount of data. I believe we should work with the House \nto craft mutually acceptable language redirecting EPA's efforts toward \nhigher priority activities in fiscal year 1996, and to encourage EPA to \nwork with Congress in the interim to develop risk-based legislative \nreforms to TRI.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the Chairman's comments on TRI reform. Now, I \nwould like to explain the issue regarding the establishment of an MACT \nfloor. Although the current provision does not directly reference \ncombustion or any other particular MACT standard, it does deal with an \nissue of concern to industrial on-site incinerators and boilers and \nindustrial furnace operators. It is my understanding that the Report \nlanguage does not prohibit EPA from pursuing its combustion strategy, \nbut only requires certain legal and procedural safeguards be followed.\n  In short, the report language seems to support the conclusion that \nEPA cannot use appropriated moneys on: First, the use of permit \nconditions without required site-specific finding; second, the setting \nof an MACT standard under any authority other than the Clean Air Act; \nand third, the setting of an MACT standard without making the required \nfinding that certain facilities are already achieving the standard.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The committee report makes \nparticular reference to the MACT standard for refineries, as an \nillustrative example of the overall problem. The committee based its \nconclusion on input it received regarding a number of proposed and \nfinal MACT standards under consideration, including the proposed MACT \nstandard for on-site incinerators and boilers and industrial furnace \noperators. Therefore, it is my belief that the provision is applicable \nto all MACT proposals that may be inconsistent \n\n[[Page S 14375]]\nwith past precedent, the proper administrative process or the text of \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  One of the most important requirements of the Clean Air Act is the \nproper establishment of the so called MACT floor. The act states that \nthe MACT floor is ``the average emission limitation achieved in \npractice by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources'' that \nqualify for the given category or subcategory. The EPA must establish \nthat the limitations on emissions that constitute the MACT floor are \nachieved, or exceeded, in practice by 12 percent of the qualifying \nfacilities. In addition, we are also concerned that in determining the \nMACT floor for a given source category, EPA may divide the source \ncategory into smaller parts and calculate the MACT floor separately for \neach part or pollutant. The results of this impermissible approach is \nthat typically no single major source in a source category can meet the \nMACT standard without installing additional controls. Congress clearly \ncontemplated that if MACT is set at the MACT floor, the top 12 percent \nof major sources in a source category should not need to install \nadditional controls to meet MACT. Of course, EPA may then go beyond the \nMACT floor by determining that the additional emissions limitations are \njustified in light of their cost, non-air quality health and \nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements. The report language is \nnot intended in any way to stop the MACT program, but to limit the \nprogram to those efforts previously authorized by Congress.\n  Mr. LOTT. I sense a disturbing trend at EPA. First, EPA is \nconditioning Resource Conservation and Recovery Act [RCRA] permits on \nrequirements that have not been subject to full administrative process. \nSecond, EPA is in the process of choosing the most severe result from \nseparate statutes to create a hybrid. Congress did not intend EPA to \nmix and match its authority under the Clean Air Act and RCRA. Thus, \nignoring the independent limitation on authority and process imposed by \neach statute. Finally, EPA expressed its intention to set a separate \nMACT floor for each hazardous air pollutant. By adopting such an \napproach, EPA would be able to set multiple MACT floors that no single \nfacility may be able to meet in practice. I believe the MACT language \nin the Act does not allow EPA to do this. My bottom line is that EPA \nshould comply fully with the statutory and administrative controls on \nrulemaking.\n  Mr. BOND. The EPA has stated that its use of the so called omnibus \npermitting authority under RCRA must be accompanied by site-specific \nfindings in the administrative record supporting a permit that any \nconditions are necessary to ensure protection of human health and the \nenvironment. I expect EPA to comply fully with its own procedural \nrequirements for omnibus permitting authority under RCRA, for MACT \nstandards under the Clean Air Act and all other authorizing statutes. \nThe committee would oppose any attempts by EPA to ignore its legal \nobligations.\n  I will carefully consider the views of the Senator from Mississippi \non these issues, who I understand speaks for many other Senators with \nsimilar concerns, and work to ensure that EPA implements its statutory \nauthority consistent with the intent of Congress and its own rules and \nregulations.\n\n\n            Transferring Fair Housing Enforcement Authority\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the issue of transferring fair housing \nenforcement authority from the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to the Department of Justice is no small matter. I am \npleased that Senator Bond has agreed to delay any such transfer for 18 \nmonths. During this time, I expect the Judiciary Committee to review \nthis issue. It may be that some or all of HUD's fair housing functions \nshould be transferred. If so, some functions may be better transferred \nto agencies other than DOJ.\n  I have no doubt that excesses in HUD's enforcement policies have \ngiven rise to the idea of transferring its fair housing enforcement \nauthority elsewhere. I hope HUD gets a message from this episode and \nreviews its policies and practices.\n\n\n                        Mercury-Containing Lamps\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to bring up an issue that Senators \nGregg, Snowe, and Smith and I have been working on during the \nconsideration of the VA/HUD Appropriations bill. The report \naccompanying H.R. 2099 includes language regarding the waste disposal \ntreatment of mercury-containing flourescent light bulbs. I think it is \nimportant to clarify some of the issues raised in the report and \nprovide additional context for the rule.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] has been considering a rule \nwhich would either conditionally exempt mercury containing lightbulbs \nfrom existing hazardous waste requirements or allow lamps to be treated \nunder the universal waste rule. The report language does not reference \nthe two options available. Is it the Chairman's understanding that the \nEPA does indeed face this choice in finalizing a rule?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The rule does \ncontain two options.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the concerns raised by my \ncolleagues about this rule. The point has been made that the EPA should \nnot create a major disincentive for switching to energy efficient lamps \nby requiring burdensome treatment of the lamps. On the other hand, 42 \nStates have consumption warnings for eating the fish from the streams \nand lakes in our towns. Mercury containing lamps are the largest single \ncontributor of mercury to the municipal waste stream, and our policies \nshould take that fact into consideration. Our country has a mercury \npollution problem that warrants our attention, and I share the \nchairman's concern about addressing the problem in a way that makes \nsense in cost-benefit analysis context.\n  I also understand the Chairman's concern about expediting the final \nrule. However, I want to point out that we are considering this bill \nonly 3 days from the end of the fiscal year. Final passage of the \nconference report may not occur until late next month. The deadline \nincluded in the report language may allow for only a month for EPA to \ndecide, with holidays. I just want to emphasize that this is a very \ntight timeline, and it does not provide the recycling industry enough \ntime to adjust if necessary. I would like to work with other Senators \nto ensure that there is an adequate adjustment period.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to get the rule out soon, but I will \nwork with other Senators to ensure that there is time for a reasonable \ntransition.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman for discussing \nthis issue on the floor. Mercury pollution is an important issue. There \nare some areas where almost everyone agrees, such as the need to end \nincineration of mercury-containing lamps.\n\n\n                        superfund npl provision\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, would the chairman of the VA-HUD \nSubcommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator. The Senator has included the fiscal \nyear 1996 VA-HUD bill a provision that prohibits the addition of any \nnew sites to the Superfund ``National Priorities List,'' with one \nexception. The language enables the ``governor of a state, or \nappropriate tribal leader'' to veto the EPA Administrator's request \nthat a site be placed on the NPL. With one reservation, I support the \nprovision in the VA-HUD bill because this Senator wants to see \nSuperfund reauthorized, and the prohibition provides an important time \nout from adding new sites to the NPL. My reservation is this: I am \nconcerned that the phrase ``appropriate tribal leader'' expands the \nauthority of tribes, beyond that which they are granted under current \nlaw, to veto a site recommended by the EPA Administrator for listing on \nthe NPL.\n  The fiscal year 1995 rescission bill included a provision similar to \nthat included in the bill before the Senate, with one exception. The \nbill currently before the Senate gives the authority to both the \nGovernor of a State, or an appropriate tribal leader to veto the EPA \nAdministrator's request that a site be added to the NPL. Was it the \nintent of the subcommittee chairman to expand the authority of Indian \ntribes under the Superfund law with this provision?\n\n[[Page S 14376]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct, it was not the intent of the \nsubcommittee to expand the authority of Indian tribes in this \nprovision.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator yield for another question on the same \nissue?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator would be happy to do so.\n  Mr. GORTON. As the Senator from Missouri knows, the chairman of the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund is \nworking hard to put together a Superfund reauthorization bill, and \nbring it to the Senate floor this year. There are an entire range of \nissues associated with the fact that Indian tribes are not currently \ntreat as persons under the Superfund law, and are not liable for clean \nup of waste that a tribe may have contributed to a site. I have \ndiscussed this issue with Senator Smith and he told me that these \nissues will be looked at as he develops legislation to reauthorize the \nlaw. Consequently, I would ask that the Senator drop out the ``or \nappropriate tribal leader'' provision during conference with the House \nover the fiscal year 1996 VA-HUD bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to work with the Senator to address this \nissue during conference.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2781\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted not to restore \nfunding for the Americorps Program and with great reluctance, I opposed \nthe amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Maryland. I did \nso not because the Corporation for National and Community Service is a \nbad investment. In fact, I am a strong supporter of the AmeriCorps \nProgram and believe community service can make a big difference in our \nsociety. Unfortunately, the amendment restored AmeriCorps funding at \nthe expense of other important Federal programs.\n  Mr. President, I have seen first hand the positive results of the \nAmeriCorps Program. It has shown great promise in addressing today's \nurban and rural problems by uniting communities. Program participants \nin Wisconsin have worked hard to fight hunger, provide child care, \ncombat illiteracy, and build low-income housing.\n  By dedicating service to their communities, participants receive a \nsmall stipend and assistance to further their education. Corps \nparticipants are also able to leverage private resources in carrying \nout their activities, which adds to the effectiveness of the Federal \ninvestment.\n  I am distressed that the Senate has decided not to fund the national \nservice program and strongly believe the AmeriCorps Program merits \ncontinuation. But the amendment relied on alternative funding sources \nthat I could not accept, including raising FHA's loan limits.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that in the past I have opposed \nefforts to raise the FHA's loan limits. My position on this issue is \nclear and I will not take this time to recite all of the reasons that I \noppose raising the loan limits. I will, however, say that raising the \nloan limits will not help the low and moderate-income home buyers who \nshould be the prime beneficiaries of FHA's efforts. For the record, I \nalso note that I would have gladly worked with the authors of the \namendment to find other more appropriate offsets, if only I had \nreceived sufficient advance notice of the amendment.\n\n\n           Community Development Financial Institutions Fund\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the community \ndevelopment financial institutions (CDFI) fund.\n  The CDFI fund is a key priority for President Clinton. He and Vice \nPresident Gore campaigned in 1992 to create a new partnership with the \nprivate sector to revitalize economically distressed communities. The \nPresident and Vice President spoke passionately about their vision for \nsupporting local community development banks.\n  After the election of 1992, both Republicans and Democrats in the \nlast Congress turned the President's vision into ground-breaking \nlegislation that created the CDFI fund. The legislation passed the \nSenate unanimously and was approved by a 410 to 12 vote in the House.\n  Unfortunately, the CDFI fund is now a hostage of partisan politics. \nUnder this appropriations bill, the CDFI fund is terminated. Before \neven giving this program a chance to succeed, this bill kills it. That \nis a real shame.\n  The fund is a small but very innovative program. For a modest $50 \nmillion budget, the fund has the potential to make a significant impact \nin distressed communities.\n  The fund's investments would create new jobs, promote small business, \nrestore neighborhoods, and generate tax revenues in communities \ndesperate for community development.\n  How would the CDFI fund succeed in areas where more traditional \nfinancing has failed?\n  The fund would create a permanent, self-sustaining network of \nfinancial institutions that are dedicated to serving distressed \ncommunities. These financial institutions include a fast-growing \nindustry of specialized financial service providers--community \ndevelopment financial institutions. The fund would also provide \nincentives for banks and thrifts to increase their community \ndevelopment activities and invest in CDFIs.\n  The CDFI fund's initiatives would be an innovative departure from \ntraditional community development programs because they leverage \nsignificant private sector resources. It is estimated that every $1 of \nfund resources would leverage $10 in non-Federal resources. And these \nlocally-controlled CDFIs would be able to respond more quickly and \neffectively to market-building opportunities than traditional community \ndevelopment organizations.\n  The CDFI fund has caught the interest of many community development \norganizations across the Nation. Unfortunately, these fine community \ndevelopment organizations and many others throughout the country may \nnever get the opportunity to receive assistance from the CDFI fund. I \nstrongly believe that would be a short-sighted mistake--putting \npartisan politics ahead of our distressed communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to restore funding for the CDFI fund if the \nSenate revisits this bill during the appropriations process.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, community development financial \ninstitutions [CDFI] play an important role in my home State, and I join \nmy friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, in expressing my strong support \nfor the CDFI fund.\n  Community Development Financial Institutions are essential to serving \ncommunities that often find it difficult to cultivate financial \nsupport. CDFI's prove that private sector, locally controlled financial \ninstitutions can combine rigorous fiscal management with a commitment \nto improving communities by offering capital access along with related \ntraining and technical services when other institutions may not. CDFI's \nprovide capital to distressed communities, as well as increase the \nnumber of joint venture loans between Federal, State, and private \nentities.\n  Mr. President, Cascadia Revolving Fund, of Seattle, is a prime \nexample of how CDFI's can complement traditional financial \ninstitutions. Cascadia is a nonprofit community development loan fund \nwhich makes loans and provides technical assistance to low-income, \nminority- and women-owned businesses in addition to businesses in \neconomically distressed areas. Over the past 10 years, Cascadia has \nlent over $3 million, and 90 percent of the businesses they have \nassisted are still in business today.\n  The Community Development Banking Act of 1994, which created the CDFI \nfund, received broad bipartisan support in the 103d Congress. The \nlegislation passed the Senate unanimously, and was approved by a 410 to \n12 vote in the House. Today, there are roughly 310 CDFI's operating in \n45 States that manage more than $1 billion in primarily private sector \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, it would be a shame to terminate this program designed \nto revitalize economically distressed communities before even giving it \na chance to succeed. If the Senate has the opportunity to revisit this \nbill during the appropriations process, I urge my colleagues to restore \nfunding to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, things are finally beginning to turn \naround in urban America. We have finally taken some small, tentative \nsteps to give children a safe and nurturing environment, to help \ncommunities repair \n\n[[Page S 14377]]\nthemselves, to help individuals find and get jobs, to help poor people \ndevelop assets for the future, and to restore strong financial \ninstitutions that help communities save their own money, invest, \nborrow, and grow.\n  But just as the economics of urban America were starting to improve, \nthis bill pulls out one of the most vital initiatives to bring capital, \ninitiative, savings, and growth to those who have been isolated from \nit: the Community Development Financial Institutions Program. This \ninitiative evolved from the Community Capital Partnership Act that I \nintroduced in 1993. I am very disappointed that the committee included \nno funds for community development financial institutions, and I want \nto remind the chairman of the subcommittee that there is significant, \npassionate support in the Senate for the continuation of this program.\n  Most of us take basic financial institutions for granted. We have \nsavings and checking accounts, our bank lends our money to businesses \nin our communities, and we borrow ourselves when it comes time to buy a \nhome or we have an inspiration to start a business. But in most \nAmerican cities, the only financial institution they know is the check-\ncashing cubicle, which charges up to 5 percent just to cash a \nGovernment check, and takes the money back out of the community. People \nwho want to save have nowhere to go and businesses have no access to \ncapital. Within the 165 squares miles that make up the areas most \naffected by the Los Angeles riots, there are 19 bank branches, as \ncompared to 135 check cashing establishments.\n  People who want to borrow have even fewer opportunities. They can buy \na car or furniture on time, or on a rent-to-own plan, but if they want \nto borrow to get ahead, by starting a small service business or a \nstore, they're out of luck. The ``McNeil-Lehrer Newshour'' last year \ninterviewed some ambitious entrepreneurs in rural Arkansas, one of them \na woman named Jesse Pearl Jackson, who owns a beauty salon. She needed \na loan for new equipment, and when she went to a bank, she says the \nloan officer ``laughed me clean out the door. She said, `You want money \nfor what?' She said, `You don't walk in here and ask me for an \napplication for a loan. That is not the way you do it.' I said, `Well, \nif you will tell me what to do, then I will come back, and I will do it \nright the next time.' She was laughing so hard and making fun of me so \nbad I never went back.'' There is money to be made here, for any bank \nwilling to take entrepreneurs like Ms. Jackson seriously, but large \nfinancial institutions without roots in the community are unlikely to \nsee those opportunities.\n  But there are islands of hope for people who want to save and invest \nin troubled communities. Last year I visited La Casa de Don Pedro, \nwhich operates a credit union in a very poor section of Newark. La Casa \nis a multi-purpose community organization that just happens to have a \ncredit union. While I was there, a stream of members poured into the \nsmall building which houses the credit union, day care center, and \nother programs, depositing $20, $50, and $100 at a time. I did not see \nany banks in the vicinity of La Casa. If it were not for the credit \nunion, many of the community's residents would have no place to deposit \ntheir money, secure small loans, or take advantage of other services we \noften take for granted.\n  This fund does not, and should not, seek to create organizations that \nwill be perpetually dependent on Government for support. Instead, it \nseeks to reach in at a point of leverage in capital-starved communities \nand get them started. It does not set development strategies for either \nthe institutions or the communities they serve. Instead, it lets those \ninvolved in the struggle for economic recovery find their own path.\n  There has been such widespread support for the idea of expanding \ncommunity financial institutions, even though it is a relatively new \nidea to many people. I still hear some wariness, though, about this \ninvestment from people who argue that poor people do not save and that \ndistressed communities do not have the resources to support economic \ndevelopment.\n  The evidence contradicts this cynical view. In Paterson, NJ, last \nyear, I visited one of the few banks that had not left that city. I \nstruck up a conversation with a customer, who volunteered that she was \ndepositing $100. Surprised, I asked her how much she generally saved in \na week. She told me that she and her husband had five children and \nearned $20,000 last year--below the poverty line. But even on this \nincome, they saved $3,000 that year, for health emergencies, for \ncollege, or to give their children a chance at a better life. Their \nexperience tells me that saving for the future is a fundamental value \nof our country, not limited to the middle class, and that if we all had \naccess to the institutions that make capitalism work, we could all be a \npart of vital, self-sufficient communities.\n  Mr. President, I know we expect this legislation to be vetoed, \nbecause it sets all the wrong priorities. The defunding of the CDFI \ninitiative is only one example. I hope that we will have an opportunity \nto reconsider this bill, to put all its priorities in order, and that \nwhen we do, we will find a way to continue to support community \ndevelopment financial institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14366-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14377-S14394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FUND\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the \ncommunity development financial institutions [CDFI] fund.\n  Created by legislation enacted in 1993, the CDFI fund, in a new \npartnership with the private sector, would revitalize economically \ndistressed communities. The fund would create a permanent network of \nfinancial institutions that are dedicated to serving these communities.\n  Today many low- and moderate-income Americans across the country are \nunable to cash a check, borrow money to buy a home, or secure a small \nloan to start or invest in a business. Rural communities, because they \nare remote, have unique problems in this regard.\n  Designed to encourage community development through lending to \nunderserved low- and moderate-income people and communities, CDFI's are \nespecially important to the people in these communities who do not have \naffordable credit, capital, and basic banking services.\n  The CDFI's would go a long way toward stimulating the economy in \nthose communities by helping to create new jobs and promote the \ndevelopment of small business. And at a small cost. CDFI's are required \nto provide a minimum of $1 of matching funds for each Federal dollar \nreceived.\n  When enacted in 1993, the CDFI fund had the overwhelming support of \nboth Houses of Congress. The President is a strong advocate of the \nfund. It is not a large program; but it can be an extremely effective \none. It should not be terminated before having a chance to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to reinstate funding for \nthis vital program.\n\n\n                             EPA Provisions\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we consider the VA-HUD Appropriations \nbill, we will set the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency, \nand this budget for EPA turns back the clock on 25 years of bipartisan \nprogress and tips the balance from the protection of people to the \nprotection of the special interests of some industries.\n  The Gingrich majority and the extremists on the right have placed in \njeopardy the gains we have fought for, and the progress we have made to \nprotect the environment and ensure the health and safety of every \nAmerican in the last 25 years.\n  Ironically, for 19 of the last 25 years Republicans were in charge of \nthe EPA. It was Richard Nixon who signed into law the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act and declared protection of the environment to \nbe a national priority. And today the Republican majority is turning \nits back on its own promise.\n  Twenty-five years ago environmental organizations let their voices be \nheard and the message was loud and clear. We must find that voice \nagain. We must unite in our efforts and let the message resound across \nthis Nation and through the halls of Congress--that we will not turn \nback the clock on environmental protection.\n  We will not retreat. We will not give in. We will fight for clean \nair, clean water, and the preservation of our land and oceans and \nrivers so that the world we leave our children will be the same \nmagnificent world that was handed down to us. \n\n[[Page S 14378]]\n\n  I call on every one who believes in the importance of environmental \nprotection and who has been part of this fight to stand together and \nrenew the effort we began. We cannot assume we can change the agenda in \nCongress.\n  We cannot take anything for granted. We must rebuild, retool, \nreorganize, and reeducate. We must put aside whatever differences exist \nbetween groups or regions and stand up for what we know is right for \nthe Nation and for the environmental gains we have made.\n  We have to start anew--as people committed to the environment--we \nmust begin again as if this were April 22, 1970, the first Earth Day.\n  We must take advantage of America's attention on the 25th anniversary \nof that day to galvanize support across the country for what Americans \nbelieve and want for the environment: clean air, clean water, pristine \nrivers, and protected ecosystems, abundant species of plants and \nanimals, clean beaches, parks and public lands that are clean and safe, \ncities with breathable air, industries and businesses that are willing \nto do all they can to protect the environment, and a government that \ncares.\n  These should be the 10 commandments for the new environmental \nmovement, and our call to action is clear: Remember April 22, 1970. \nAnd, Mr. President, we must do so in a rational bi-partisan manner.\n  But this bill--this bill--Mr. President, speaks volumes about the new \nRepublican Party and its retreat from responsible policies designed to \nprotect the health and safety of all Americans--of all incomes, all \nraces, and particularly those who are the most vulnerable in society \ntoday.\n  The central question in this debate is: What priority do we place on \nprotecting our Nation's vital natural resources and the health of its \ncitizens? Regrettably, I must say that the Appropriations Committee \ndoes not put as high a priority on the environment as the American \npeople do.\n  This bill cuts the EPA budget by $1.7 billion--23 percent below the \nlevel originally appropriated to the EPA for the current fiscal year. \nIn addition, it includes 11 legislative riders that eliminate critical \nenvironmental protections provided in such statutes as the Safe \nDrinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act.\n  Mr. President, I am cosponsoring several amendments today to restore \nsome of the more egregious cuts and provisions in this bill to bring it \nmore in line with what I believe to be the priorities of most \nAmericans.\n  In addition to the EPA, the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies \nappropriations bill before us today includes funding for the Veterans \nAdministration, for Housing and Urban Development, the National Science \nFoundation, and the National Aeronautic and Space Administration--all \nimportant Federal programs.\n  But of all the agencies, the agency that has the most direct impact \non American lives is the EPA.\n  I find it ironic that it is the EPA budget that takes the largest \nreduction of any agency's budget in this bill--23 percent cut from \nfunding levels originally appropriated for the current fiscal year.\n  Americans have, indeed, called for meaningful budget reductions and \nreforms and the President and Congress have serious plans to meet those \nreduction goals; and all departments and agencies must join in this \neffort if we are to succeed. But the best approach, by far, is first to \neliminate wasteful spending, and then spread the reductions across \nagencies. Unfortunately, this is not the approach of the appropriators.\n  The committee this year, while cutting the EPA budget by 23 percent \nis reducing its other agencies by far less.\n  The fiscal year 1996 Senate appropriations bill for EPA would deal a \nharsh blow to efforts to protect public health and the environment for \nMassachusetts and the Nation.\n  While the President has proposed a balanced budget that would \npreserve the environment and protect the health and safety of American \nfamilies, the bill before us cuts those protections dramatically, while \nplacing severe limits on existing protections.\n  Let me take a moment to highlight the key cuts that would have an \nenormous negative impact on millions of citizens.\n  First, this bill cuts desperately needed assistance to State and \nlocal governments for important water infrastructure programs through \nthe State revolving loan fund [SRF]. This bill cuts almost $600 million \nto provide assistance to local communities to offset the enormous costs \nof sewage treatment facilities in order to provide cleaner local \nwater--cleaner water in nearby rivers and adjoining shorelines.\n  Of that, the $20 million which would be targeted to Massachusetts \nalone would assist over 300 communities across my State.\n  Hundreds of thousands of citizens in my State--as in dozens of States \nacross this Nation--rely on clean water for their livelihood.\n  From tourism to fisheries, industries depend on the quality of \nwater--and history shows that industry did not care about the quality \nof water when it had the chance--when there was no EPA. I wonder what \nhas changed today.\n  My State is but one of many that had beaches closed to protect the \npublic from unsafe waters in 1994. These closings cost millions of \ndollars but can be avoided with prudent, preventive clean water \nstandards and a reliable water infrastructure system.\n  Local communities cannot shoulder this burden alone. That is why \nCongress created a Federal-State-local government partnership to \nfinance this process.\n  That is why, earlier this year, we passed and the President signed \ninto law, the Unfunded Mandates Act requiring that future legislative \ninitiatives provide Federal financial assistance to State and local \ngovernments for implementing such large-scale undertakings.\n  I find it ironic that this same congressional leadership would now \nsupport cutting hundreds of millions of assistance to local and State \ngovernments when it is so urgently needed.\n  A second area of concern are funding cuts for the cleanup of the \ntoxic waste sites. The Hazardous Waste Cleanup Program funding is \ntargeted for a 36-percent reduction--$500 million.\n  A reduction on this scale would slow cleanups and would stall cleanup \nefforts in communities that have patiently waited for Federal \nintervention.\n  In Massachusetts alone, there are four new communities slated to \nbegin cleanup efforts in 1996--New Bedford, Dartmouth, Palmer, and \nTyngsborough.\n  All of these communities would be adversely impacted by these \nunprecedented cutbacks. And what do we tell the people who live there: \n``Don't worry. The problem will take care of itself once we get \nGovernment off our backs?''\n  Mr. President, the problem is that companies did not take care of \nthese situations before there was an EPA--or before a young man named \nJimmy Anderson got sick from a contaminated well in Woburn, MA. He died \nfrom lymphocytic leukemia in 1981.\n  Let me digress for a moment because Jimmy Anderson's story makes the \npoint better than any rhetoric I could come up with today.\n  Almost 30 years ago, Jimmy's mother Anne suspected something was \nwrong with their water because it smelled bad, only to be assured that \nthe water was safe. Then, in early 1972, Jimmy got sick.\n  Despite Mrs. Anderson's concerns and protests, the wells remained in \nuse until 1979 when a State environmental inspection triggered by an \nunrelated incident detected unusually high levels of toxins.\n  Eventually, other leukemia victims came forward and it turned out \nthat between 1966 and 1986 there were 28 cases of leukemia among Woburn \nchildren with victims concentrated in a section of Woburn served by two \nwells.\n  Investigations revealed that there were lagoons of arsenic, chromium, \nand lead discovered on a tract of land that once housed a number of \nchemical plants, or from a nearby abandoned tannery that had left \nbehind a huge mound of decades old rotting horsehides that gave off a \nsmell that commuters used to call the Woburn odor.\n  I say to my colleagues, before we rush headlong into getting \nGovernment out of the business of protecting people like Jimmy Anderson \nI think we should reflect for a moment on the consequences of turning \nback the clock to \n\n[[Page S 14379]]\na time when there were no real regulations and industry did, indeed, \nhave Government off of its back.\n  Let me read what Anne Anderson said to a congressional committee. She \nsaid,\n\n       It is difficult for me to come before you today, but I do \n     so with the realization that industry has the strength, \n     influence, and resources that we, the victims, do not. I am \n     here as a reminder of the tragic consequences of controlled \n     toxic waste, and the necessity of those who are responsible \n     for it to assume that responsibility.\n\n  Mr. President, this is why we have made the choices we did for the \nlast 25 years. And they were the right choices.\n  I would submit to my colleagues that this bill throws responsibility \nto the wind, and begins a tragic return to the days when toxic lagoons \ncontaminated the water in Woburn and killed Jimmy Anderson.\n  Now, getting back to the third point, Mr. President, the massive \nbudget cuts proposed for EPA's enforcement and compliance programs seem \nextremely shortsighted. The Senate appropriators target the EPA \nenforcement program for a 20-percent cutback.\n  This is the office that goes after the bad actors in the \nenvironmental arena; they are the ones that most directly protect the \npublic's health and safety.\n  Cutting back enforcement will only encourage polluters to continue \nbreaking the law. In Massachusetts during 1994, EPA and State \ninspectors visited 1,091 facilities to ensure public health and safety \nstandards. Of those visits, 117 State and Federal enforcement actions \nwere taken to protect the public.\n  By weakening enforcement, more polluters are given an unfair economic \nadvantage over responsible industry competitors play by the rules \nbecause polluters have lower production costs.\n  Less enforcement means more risk taking by polluters because they are \nless likely to get caught.\n  Let me tell you a tale of two companies. One bought scrubbers; the \nother bought lobbyists and lawyers.\n  In the early 1990's, Federal regulators discovered that a number of \nforest products companies had underestimated certain emissions at \nplywood and waferboard plants by a factor of 10--and had therefore \nfailed to apply for permits under the Clean Air Act or install \nnecessary but expensive pollution controls.\n  When EPA moved to require permits and installation of such equipment, \nWeyerhaeuser and Georgia-Pacific chose very different responses.\n  The one that played by the rules finds itself at a serious \ncompetitive disadvantage--if its rival can get away with it.\n  Weyerhaueser more or less played by the rules, moving quickly to \ninstall tens of millions of dollars in pollution controls at its \nplants--according to company officials--even before EPA began its \nenforcement action.\n  The company paid a substantial fine to State regulators, though it is \ncurrently contesting any EPA decision to seek fines.\n  Georgia-Pacific, on the other hand, chose to fight EPA, claiming it \nhad only followed the agency's own faulty document--though a 1983 \nindustry-produced technical bulletin corrected and publicized the \nerror--and that State regulators had in any event approved its plants.\n  The company spent its money instead on Washington lawyers and \nlobbyists, who managed to slip a special provision into the original \nDole regulatory reform bill effectively freeing Georgia-Pacific from \nany obligation to install the expensive equipment.\n  According to Weyerhaeuser, the pollution controls add $1 million a \nyear to operating costs at each plant. If Georgia-Pacific can get away \nwith its plan to avoid installing any controls whatsoever, Weyerhaeuser \nplants will then be at a serious disadvantage during the next downturn \nin the highly cyclical building products industry.\n  By playing by the rules, Weyerhaeuser will have lost.\n  Weyerhaeuser's director of environmental affairs says Georgia \nPacific's tactic: ``sends exactly the wrong signal. We're finding \nourselves in the position of being penalized for coming into \ncompliance. We think that's unfair.''\n  Finally, Mr. President, in addition to the unjustified draconian \nbudget cuts, there are nearly a dozen legislative riders that have no \nbusiness being added to an appropriations bill. These legislative \nproposals should be considered by the authorizing committees with \njurisdiction.\n  This bill guts EPA and virtually lets the free marketeers decide what \nis right, and puts its faith in the perceived altruism of American \ncapitalists who somehow and for some reason, now, in 1995, have seen \nthe light and will do better in the future than they did in the past.\n  It puts its faith in industry's willingness to care more about the \ncommon man than the bottom line. It says that if Government would only \nleave everyone alone, everyone will do the right thing. If we stop \nwatching where folks dump their toxic waste, what they spew into the \nair, and what chemicals they use, everyone will act in the common \ninterest.\n  I am not sure that is the case. But I am sure that EPA balances the \nequation between those who care and those who don not. Why now, are we \nwilling to tip that balance--to favor the polluters over the people.\n  My Republican friends will deny that this bill tips the balance or \nturns back the clock. They will stand here and tell us that Government \nhas been intrusive and it has--that Government has overregulated and it \nhas--that Government is demanding too much of small business and it is.\n  They will give us example after example of ludicrous regulations and \nI agree that those regulations should be abolished, but not at the \nexpense of the progress we have made.\n  But they will not tell us is why we needed an EPA. They conveniently \nforget about Jimmy Anderson.\n  This chorus to cut Government--with its refrain of getting Government \noff our backs--is becoming a dirge for the common man.\n  And we are marching into the next century to a slow and painful \nfuneral march for the death of common sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            reno va hospital\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate the impact the proposed VA/HUD appropriations bill is having on \nveterans who rely on the Veterans Affairs medical center located in \nReno, NV, for inpatient hospital care.\n  I recognize the difficult funding decisions that faced the VA/HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee. And I know the subcommittee wants to \nprovide quality health care for veterans in quality medical facilities. \nBut the decision to not fund any major construction projects \njeopardizes the ability of the Reno VA hospital to provide that quality \ninpatient care to its veterans.\n  The Reno VA hospital's $20.1 million major construction project to \nbuild an inpatient bed wing project is an authorized project. The \nproject's construction plans will be completed in November. The project \nwill be ready for bid award in January, 1996. The House VA/HUD \nappropriations bill, passed in June, includes $20.1 million for the \nproject. But there is no funding for this authorized project in this \nSenate bill.\n  The Reno VA hospital's current inpatient bed wing was designed prior \nto World War II, and is today a woefully inadequate facility. The Reno \nVA hospital inpatient bed wind has been in noncompliance with JCAHO \naccreditation standards for nearly 6 years. It again faces an \naccreditation evaluation from JCAHO on October 10.\n  The hospital's inpatient wing's deficiencies include inadequate fire \nprevention including lacking water sprinklers, an inadequate oxygen \nsystem in patient rooms, inadequate air conditioning, and inadequate \nhandicapped access. Further, the patient rooms lack wash basins and \ntoilets which violate both privacy standards for the patients, and \nhealth standards for nurses and physicians who are required to wash \ntheir hands before leaving a patient's room. With the increase in women \npatients using the hospital, the lack of wash basins and toilets \nproblem is further exacerbated. Can you imagine being sick in a room \nwith no air conditioning? In a room with no toilet facility except down \nthe hall?\n  I know we would all agree this situation is intolerable. This \ninpatient care unit is woefully inadequate to meet even the most basic \nof standards for care and safety. The personal dignity of all the \nveterans who receive their inpatient hospital care there is \ncompromised.\n  This hospital critically needs the new inpatient hospital wing to \nensure the \n\n[[Page S 14380]]\ncenter does not lose the JCAHO accreditation. To date, no Veteran \nAffairs medical facility has lost its accreditation. However, JCAHO has \nrecently been under industry criticism for not being as stringent as it \nshould be to ensure the quality of its accreditation standards. When a \nfacility like the Reno hospital has been in noncompliance with \naccreditation standards for 6 years, and is unable to show JCAHO a \ndefinitive plan to correct those deficiencies, because its construction \nproject has not been funded, it is surely not beyond the realm of \npossibility that Reno could be facing nonaccreditation.\n  And what happens should the hospital lose its accreditation? The \nhospital will be given a specific time period to move the current \ninpatient patients out of the facility, and obviously no new patients \ncan be admitted. The hospital's medical residents from the University \nof Nevada-Reno medical school will have to leave the hospital \nimmediately as they cannot practice in an unaccredited facility. The \nhospital's physicians will leave as soon as possible, as physicians do \nnot further their professional standing by serving in an unaccredited \nfacility. The hospital's research program will be dismantled because \nFederal research funds cannot flow to an unaccredited facility. In \nsimple terms, Reno will no longer have an inpatient hospital.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have worked to attain funding for a new \ninpatient bed wing. During the last budget cycle, the Reno hospital and \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs drastically scaled back the \nconstruction project by nearly half its original cost. This revision \nwas done to face the reality of funding constraints for major \nconstruction projects, and to ensure the hospital would have a \ndefinitive plan to meet its accreditation deficiencies. It is ironic \nthat a construction project which has been significantly scaled back, \nand would solve the Reno hospital accreditation problems cannot go \nforward.\n  The subcommittee has recommended that no major construction project, \nwhether authorized or not, should be funded. I understand the concerns \nof the subcommittee and the Senate Veteran's Affairs Committee that \nmajor construction projects should not go forward while the Department \nof Veterans Affairs is developing a new veterans health care delivery \nsystem. However, the veterans who rely upon the Reno VA hospital for \ninpatient medical care cannot wait.\n  The subcommittee increased the minor construction account funding to \ntry to provide additional funds for facilities to use to address their \naccreditation, and life and safety deficiencies. But the minor \nconstruction account funding is not the answer for the Reno hospital.\n\n  The minor construction account limits funding to no more than $3 \nmillion per project. It is estimated to require $13.9 million to \nrenovate the current inpatient bed wing; obviously over the $3 million \nproject limit. Even if a $13.9 million expenditure could be made from \nthe minor construction fund, the hospital would still not meet \naccreditation standards. This is an old building. Most of this building \nis uninsulated. Its electrical system is at capacity. Its steam \nradiator heating system is beyond economical repair. Only so much can \nbe done within the limits of such a building. Is it wise to put \nmillions into an old building, that will not in the end meet \naccreditation and life safety code requirements? I think not.\n  It must also be noted that the estimated $13.9 million renovation \ncost does not include the costs of contracting out inpatient hospital \ncare during the disruption caused by such construction work. There is \nno other VA health care facility within competitive travel distance to \nassume any of Reno's inpatient caseload. Given the population influx of \nveterans into northern Nevada, and the increased patient load of \nCalifornia veterans due to closure of the Martinez VA facility damaged \nby earthquake, this hospital needs to be able to continue to serve the \ninpatient hospital needs of veterans for years to come.\n  None of us wants a VA hospital closed for accreditation \nnoncompliance. None of us wants sick veterans receiving care in a \nhospital room with no air conditioning or inadequate fire protection. \nGiven extreme budget restraints, hard decisions must be made. But when \nthose hard decisions serve to prevent a vitally needed construction \nproject like the Reno hospital inpatient wing from going forward, the \nfunding priorities are skewed. Reno needs a new inpatient wing without \nfurther delay.\n\n\n                      national science foundation\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the Chairman of the Veteran's Affairs and Housing \nand Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Subcommittee yield for \na question?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be pleased to yield for a question from the senior \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  As the chairman knows, starting in fiscal year 1991, the Veterans \nAffairs and Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee urged the \ncreation of a new Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic \nSciences at the National Science Foundation. This was led by our \ncolleague Senator Barbara Mikulski.\n  The subcommittee also was instrumental in encouraging the new NSF \nDirectorate to pursue a program called the Human Capital Initiative, \nwhich supports basic behavioral research aimed at some of our most \nserious national problems--such as education, substance abuse, \nviolence, productivity, problems of aging, health, and others.\n  This year, for fiscal year 1966, the subcommittee has had to make \nsome hard choices among programs to live within their 602(b) \nallocations. The chairman has been fair and even-handed in his efforts \nto craft a bill within the spending total available to him.\n  Is it the chairman's intention that this fairness will also carry \nover when final allocations are made at NSF, and that NSF's programs in \nthe Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate will receive \nequitable treatment with other research disciplines?\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for the question.\n  It is my intention and my expectation that the National Science \nFoundation would continue the current practice of recommending support \nlevels for that Directorate and for the programs represented by the \nHuman Capital Initiative, within the overall funding recommendations of \nthe committee in its operating plan. As you know, we generally accord \nthe recommendations of the Foundation considerable deference given the \ntechnical nature of many of these allocation decisions, and it is my \nintention to continue this practice.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As the ranking minority member of the subcommittee, I \nalso would like to thank the Senator from Hawaii for his question, and \nI wholeheartedly support the answer provided by Chairman Bond. It would \nbe a matter of great concern to me if any area of research at the \nNational Science Foundation is singled out and given inappropriate \nreductions in funding. Our support for the Social, Behavioral and \nEconomic Sciences Directorate and for the Human Capital Initiative must \ncontinue to be strong and I hope to see those programs funded as \ngenerously as our appropriations will allow.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are still a number of amendments left \non the list. We do not believe the Senators proposing them are planning \nto come down. Senator Daschle has reserved a relevant amendment, \nSenator Simpson has reserved an amendment to eliminate the EPA SEE \nprogram. We are preparing to move to the adoption of the final \nmanagers' amendment.\n  I ask that, if there are any Senators who do wish to pursue these \namendments, that they call the cloakroom immediately and let us know, \nbecause as soon as we do the managers' amendment we will be ready to \nproceed to third reading.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Petroleum Refinery MACT Standards\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am in strong support of language at this \n\n\n[[Page S 14381]]\npoint calling for the EPA to reevaluate the petroleum refinery MACT \nstandards. The refinery MACT legislation is a prime example of the EPA \nregulations run amok.\n  As I said at a hearing earlier this year, refinery MACT regulation \ncould be a poster child for nonsensical regulations. Its costs far \nexceed any possible benefits.\n  As a member of the authorizing subcommittee, I can speak for a \nmajority of the subcommittee in saying that the EPA has taken the wrong \ndirection in its implementation of the Clean Air Act amendments. The \nimplementation of the act is an issue that the subcommittee will be \naddressing in the coming months. However, in the meantime we need to \nput a stop to the refinery MACT rule from taking effect.\n  These are the rules that were promulgated, yet the standards which \nwere used were standards prior to 1980 when, in fact, the refineries \nhad complied with the 1990 amendments. Those things were not taken into \nconsideration.\n  We are talking about millions of dollars, if we leave these \nregulations in effect. This does not roll back any environmental laws. \nIt just allows the EPA the time to fix an obviously flawed regulation.\n  In the defense of the EPA, I would say they were under a court-\nordered deadline when this happened, and I feel this is an opportunity \nfor us to at least have language in there suggesting we rescind \ncompliance for that period of time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                remaining excepted committee amendments\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \ncommittee amendments previously excepted from adoption be adopted en \nbloc at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, could I ask the managers \nof the bill to explain No. 12.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we are referring to the items that were \nexcepted by request of the other side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. BOND. We are now prepared to go through the list of amendments we \npropose to adopt en bloc in the managers' amendments.\n  I will send these amendments to the desk and ask unanimous consent \nthat they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this appropriations bill, as reported by \nthe committee, contained an ill-advised proposal to transfer all \nenforcement authority under the Fair Housing Act from the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to the Department of Justice.\n  I am strongly opposed to any such transfer of authority, for reasons \nthat I will describe in a moment.\n  But I and other opponents of the transfer proposal have agreed not to \noffer an amendment to strike the provision because the chairman of the \nsubcommittee has agreed to include in the managers' package an \namendment to postpone any transfer of enforcement authority on the \ntransfer of adequate personnel and resources to the Department of \nJustice.\n  Let me explain my reasons for opposing the transfer of fair housing \nenforcement authority. At the outset, I would note that this sweeping \nreorganization has not been the subject of a single day of hearings in \nthe Judiciary Committee. Since enactment of the Fair Housing Act, each \nDepartment has put in place the procedural mechanisms to fulfill its \nobligations under the act. In a scant 2 pages of legislative language, \nthis bill seeks to change the fundamental structure of fair housing \nenforcement.\n  I was one of the members of the bipartisan coalition that crafted the \nFair Housing Act amendments in 1988. That \n\n[[Page S 14382]]\nbill was a comprehensive, carefully considered set of improvements to \nthe act. One of the central components of the 1988 bill was a division \nof responsibility for fair housing enforcement between the Department \nof Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In \nfact, the enforcement scheme was the product of lengthy discussions \nwith the real estate industry itself.\n  Under the current structure, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment responds to discrimination complaints and provide \nadministrative enforcement of those complaints. It is the only agency \nwhich maintains a system of field investigators and the legal staff \nnecessary to respond to complaints of discrimination in housing. It is \nthe only agency which investigates housing discrimination complaints \nand provides administrative hearings to reduce the need for litigation. \nIt is the only agency with a specific process to encourage voluntary \ncompliance with the Fair Housing Act.\n  HUD is the only agency which can efficiently and effectively combat \nhousing discrimination on a daily basis because it is the only agency \nwhich was set up to enforce the Fair Housing Act on a daily basis.\n  Only after HUD has conducted a through investigation and attempted to \nsettle the dispute short of litigation, does the Department of Justice \nbecome involved in the case. In fact, only one in five cases is ever \nreferred by HUD to the Department of Justice. In 1995, almost half of \nall complaints filed with HUD were resolved through conciliation.\n  The Department of Justice is the Nation's litigator. Its only \ninvestigatory branch is the FBI. The Justice Department is ill-equipped \nto handle the major structural change involved in assuming HUD's \nobligations under the Fair Housing Act. The Department would have to \nset up a structure to receive, investigate, process, prosecute and \nadjudicate over 10,000 complaints annually. Concurrently, it would have \nto administer field enforcement in several State offices. The Justice \nDepartment has no State offices for such purposes, and has no resources \nfor procuring such offices. In effect, the Department of Justice would \nhave to re-create the structure already present in HUD; all at a cost \nto the American taxpayer.\n  The Justice Department does not have the capacity, nor does it want, \nto take on HUD's enforcement obligations under the Fair Housing Act. It \nis a waste of time and money to mandate this restructuring when HUD \nalready has a system in place--a system which works to effectively and \nquickly investigate and resolve discrimination complaints. Both \nAttorney General Reno and Secretary Cisneros oppose the transfer \nproposal.\n  If H.R. 2099 were to pass without the changes in the managers' \namendment, the effect would be devastating. As of September 30, 1995, \nHUD's swift administrative investigation and resolution of complaints \nwould cease. In addition HUD would be barred from seeking injunctions \nfor plaintiffs whose injuries are immediate and irreparable, continuing \nsettlement negotiations already in progress, investigating complaints, \nor even providing counsel in pending litigation. As a result, the law \nprotecting people from discrimination in housing would become a dead \nletter.\n  My willingness to negotiate a postponement of the transfer should not \nbe interpreted to mean that I now support the transfer of enforcement \nauthority. I do not. I intend to work over the course of the next 18 \nmonths to prevent this transfer from taking place.\n  I understand the managers' amendment to mean that over the next 18 \nmonths, both the Judiciary Committee and the Banking Committee will \nexamine this proposal and its implications. If we conclude that such \ntransfer is unwarranted, we will act to avert it by subsequent \nlegislation. And it is further my understanding, as one who has \nnegotiated this compromise, that no transfer of the legal authority to \nenforce the Fair Housing Act shall ever take effect until and unless \nadequate personnel and resources are provided to the Department of \nJustice to enforce the act with the same rigor and dedication as HUD \ncurrently does.\n  Above all, I oppose any legislative effort to weaken the Fair Housing \nAct. The Senate wisely accepted the Feingold amendment to ensure that \nthe insurance industry is covered by the act. And our resolution of the \nenforcement question ensures that there will be no precipitous transfer \nof authority--and perhaps no transfer at all if cooler heads prevail.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President. I strongly object to a provision in the \nfiscal year 1996 Veterans Administration/Housing and Urban Development, \nVA-HUD, appropriations bill. The provision repeals the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development's, HUD, Fair Housing Act enforcement \nauthority and transfers it to the Department of Justice, DOJ. While I \nappreciate the efforts of Senator Bond to work with me to improve the \nlanguage of the provision and to give some time before the transfer of \nauthority is to take place, I still believe that the approach in this \nbill is wrong.\n  The VA-HUD Subcommittee report states that ``[t]he intent of this \nprovision is not to minimize the importance of addressing housing \ndiscrimination in this Nation.'' Unfortunately, this provision does \njust that.\n  The subcommittee report also states that ``the Justice Department \nwith its own significant responsibilities to address all forms of \ndiscrimination represents a good place to consolidate and to provide \nconsistency for the Federal Government to combat discrimination * * *'' \nThe Justice Department itself has said that it would not be such an \nappropriate place.\n  Make no mistake about it--the repeal of HUD's authority would \nseverely harm fair housing enforcement. HUD receives 10,000 complaints \neach year filed by those alleging housing discrimination. HUD's 10 \nregional enforcement centers take action on every bona fide complaint, \nby investigating, conciliating, and otherwise overseeing the \ndisposition of each complaint. HUD resolves most of its cases through \nthe conciliation process.\n  DOJ simply cannot devote such resources to enforcement of the Fair \nHousing Act given its current responsibilities and structure. DOJ's \nCivil Rights Office is not an investigative agency with a field office \nstructure to investigate individual complaints. DOJ's investigative arm \nis the FBI, which would have tremendous difficulties handling the \nvolume of housing discrimination cases, and would be deterred from its \nown crucial responsibilities.\n  Moreover, under current law, HUD is responsible for providing \nadministrative hearings, writing regulations, and overseeing fair \nhousing policies. If the transfer of authority occurred, DOJ would need \nto develop its own national infrastructure to implement the \nadministrative enforcement program already in place at HUD. Not only \ndoes DOJ lack experience in running administrative enforcement \nprograms, but this transfer of authority would be extremely costly. \nEnforcement of this important legislation would create unnecessary \ntransition costs to the taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately, the decision to transfer HUD's authority to DOJ is \nbeing done without the benefit of public deliberation and debate. It is \nmy understanding that this proposal has not been the subject of \nhearings in either committee of jurisdiction--the Judiciary Committee \nor Banking Committee. In addition, neither HUD nor DOJ was consulted \nprior to the provision's inclusion in this appropriations bill. Even \nmore importantly, both HUD and DOJ are strenuously opposed to the \ntransfer of authority.\n  A host of organizations, representing a broad spectrum of interests, \nalso opposes the provision. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \nan umbrella group over 100 civil right groups, as well as the National \nAssociation of Realtors, Institute of Real Estate Management, National \nApartment Association, National Assisted Housing Management \nAssociation, National Leased Housing Authorities, and the National \nMulti-Housing Council, all oppose the transfer.\n  In 1988, the Fair Housing Act was carefully crafted to ensure that \nthere was an effective and efficient mechanism for addressing fair \nhousing concerns. The Department of Housing and urban Development, the \nsource of policymaking and expertise in the area of housing, was \ndetermined to be the most appropriate agency to address these concerns. \nWhile it may be true \n\n[[Page S 14383]]\nthat there have been problems with enforcement, certainly the solution \ndoes not lie in dismantling this carefully crafted enforcement \nmechanism with one stroke of the pen. In closing, I urge my colleagues \nto reject the inclusion of this provision in the final version of this \nbill, and I will be working toward that end.\n  Also, I concur in the views expressed by Senator Kennedy concerning \nthe effect of the postponement of the transfer proposal and the \nconditions under which that transfer would take place.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, while I appreciate the cooperation \nof the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, in allowing for a delay in \nthe proposed transfer of fair housing enforcement from the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development to the Department of Justice, I \nstrongly object to the transfer occurring at all.\n  One of the most powerful symbols of America is the home. Having a \nhome is the American dream. Every parent wants to raise their child in \na safe, decent home. Every young couple wants to live in a place of \ntheir own. Every grandparent wants a home where the family can visit.\n  The Fair Housing Act guarantees that every American has a chance at \nhome--a chance that cannot be denied because of their race, gender, \nnational origin, color, religion, family status, or disability.\n  In 1988, the U.S. Congress, after careful deliberation, voted \noverwhelmingly to strengthen enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. \nPresident Reagan and Vice President Bush strongly supported Congress' \nefforts.\n  The 1988 amendments to the Fair Housing Act established an \nadministrative enforcement procedure within HUD to facilitate speedy \ninvestigation and resolution of fair housing complaints as an \nalternative to filing suit in Federal courts, where there are lengthy \ndelays.\n  From 1989 to 1994, the number of discrimination complaints HUD \nreceived more than doubled. The number now stands at around 10,000 \ncomplaints a year.\n  Here's an example of the type of complaint HUD investigates: A woman \nin Chicago was being sexually harassed by her landlord. He was found to \nhave consistently conditioned women's tenancy on their performing \nsexual favors for him. HUD investigated the case, the Department of \nJustice brought charges and he was found guilty and made to pay \n$180,000.\n  Here's another example: an African-American was turned down for an \napartment in a predominantly white New England city because another \nAfrican-American already lived in the building and the landlord thought \nthe neighbors might care. HUD's Fair Housing Office negotiated a \nsettlement and the man received $2,500.\n  Discrimination in granting mortgages and homeowners insurance \ncontinues to be a serious problem. Since 1989, banks have been required \nto report the race of their loan applicants. From that information we \nfind that, according to the Federal Reserve, in 1990, minorities of all \nincomes were rejected for mortgage loans at more than twice the rate of \nwhites.\n  A study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition in 1994 \nfound that moderate-income and minority individuals were being \nconsistently underserved by 52 large mortgage lenders.\n  According to a study by the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners, which examined the availability and price of homeowners \ninsurance in 25 cities in 13 States, average premiums are higher, and \navailability more limited in minority areas, even when loss costs are \ntaken into account.\n  According to a study by the Missouri Insurance Commissioner, among \nthe 20 largest Missouri homeowner insurance companies, 5 have minority \nmarket shares of less than one-twentieth their share of the white \nmarkets.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank Majority Leader Dole and \nSenator Bond for their assistance in passing Senator Feingold's \namendment providing for the continued enforcement of the Fair Housing \nAct in cases of discrimination in the granting of homeowners insurance. \nWe preserved an important civil rights protection today.\n  HUD is better suited to enforcing the Fair Housing Act than the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  HUD's ability to enforce the Fair Housing Act was strengthened in \n1988 when they were given the ability to investigate, conciliate, and \nbring suit in cases where discrimination was occurring. Previously, HUD \nwas not allowed to play an official role in combating any of the \nhousing discrimination it witnessed.\n  HUD investigates all complaints. If HUD finds that there is a basis \nfor a complaint and no conciliation can be reached, the parties have \nthe option of having a hearing before an administrative law judge or a \nFederal trial. If any person or HUD chooses a Federal trial that is the \nvenue.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development now investigates \n10,000 cases a year.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development is in a unique \nposition to combat discrimination in housing and to make fair housing \npolicy decisions within an overall housing policy framework. HUD works \nwith tenants, landlords, mortgage lenders, advocacy groups, and others \nevery day in nonadversarial ways.\n  HUD maintains a field operation to receive complaints, including 10 \nregional offices and has a staff of over 600 in the Office of Fair \nHousing and Equal Opportunity Office; of the 10,000 complaints it \nreceives, HUD investigates each one and attempts conciliation in each \ncase. HUD provides for administrative hearings and for administering \nvoluntary compliance programs, grant programs and interpretive actions.\n  In 1994, HUD was able to resolve over 40 percent of the \ndiscrimination cases with conciliation--neither side ever had to go to \ncourt. HUD resolves over five cases through the conciliation process \nfor every one it refers for litigation.\n  If HUD believes a violation of the law may have occurred, a \ncomplainant may be provided with Government representation at no cost.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development has worked hard to \nimprove their antidiscrimination efforts and wants to continue their \nefforts. The Department of Justice believes that the appropriate place \nfor these efforts is with the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  If there is a pattern or practice of housing discrimination, the \nAttorney General can bring civil action in a Federal district court.\n  Any case before HUD that goes before Federal court is handled by the \nDepartment of Justice already.\n  The traditional role and expertise of DOJ has been to litigate cases, \nnot to perform administrative enforcement. HUD operates a system of \nadministrative adjudication of complaints using administrative law \njudges.\n  The Department of Justice does not have the people or the field \noffice structure to handle the caseload or investigate individual \ncomplaints. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is \nnot an investigative agency. The investigative arm of the Department of \nJustice is the FBI.\n  This transfer is premature and ill-conceived. There have been no \nhearings, no reports issued, and no analysis recommending that the Fair \nHousing Act enforcement authority be transferred from HUD to the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Appropriations bills are not the appropriate place to effect major \npolicy changes. This is a proposal that should receive the \nconsideration of the Judiciary Committee at the very least since its \neffects would so dramatically effect the Department of Justice.\n  It is true that the process for handling discrimination complaints is \nnot flawless. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is having \nto work hard to make their Fair Housing Office effective and \nresponsive. But, there is no compelling reason for a transfer of \nenforcement authority to occur. The practical effect of this move would \nbe to reduce the protections afforded to the victims of housing \ndiscrimination.\n  The Department of Justice cannot and should not handle the \ninvestigative and conciliation functions of HUD. The administrative law \njudges free up the Federal courts and reduce the time it takes for \ndisputes to be resolved.\n  If this is a change that should occur, the Congress should hear \ntestimony and be presented with evidence that the transfer is in the \nbest interests of the country and the people facing discrimination. I \nam willing to study the issue further.\n\n[[Page S 14384]]\n\n  It is my belief that we should let the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development continue to work with the Department of Justice to \nensure that every person, every family, has the opportunity to have a \nhome.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Moseley-Braun \namendment requiring that the transfer of enforcement of housing \ndiscrimination from the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n[HUD] to the Department of Justice [DOJ] cannot take place unless DOJ \nis given adequate resources and manpower to continue administrative \nenforcement of the Fair Housing Act.\n  Mr. President, I am opposed to transferring enforcement authority \nfrom HUD to DOJ. Establishing an organizational and physical \ninfrastructure to handle administrative enforcement of housing \ndiscrimination at the Department of Justice represents a poor policy \nchoice and a needless expenditure of taxpayer funds. Such a transfer \nwould not result in improvements in either efficiency or function. \nHowever, Mr. President, I support this amendment requiring that such a \ntransfer cannot occur unless continued administrative enforcement of \nhousing discrimination is ensured.\n  Pursuant to the Fair Housing Act, HUD has an administrative structure \nthat is responsible for enforcing fair housing violations against \nindividuals. Administrative functions include writing regulations, \nseeking voluntary compliance agreements with members of the housing \nindustry, and establishing and overseeing a network of State and local \nagencies to process complaints under local fair housing laws and \nordinances. Roughly 10,000 fair housing complaints are filed annually \nwith HUD, and the agency has 10 regional enforcement centers around the \ncountry to process these complaints.\n  In contrast to HUD's mandate to investigate individual complaints and \nto settle disputes administratively, DOJ has independent authority \nunder the Fair Housing Act to enforce through litigation violations of \nthe act where it finds a pattern and practice of discrimination. DOJ \ndoes not have the infrastructure to handle individual fair housing \ncomplaints. For example, it does not have an investigative agency with \na field office structure to investigate individual complaints.\n  Mr. President, transferring enforcement authority from HUD to DOJ \nwould require DOJ to recreate a structure that already exists at HUD. \nWhile I oppose such a transfer, I nevertheless support my colleague \nfrom Illinois in requiring that such a transfer cannot occur unless the \nresources and manpower are provided to ensure continued administrative \nenforcement of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2797\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a study by the National Academy of Sciences)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert: ``Not later than 90 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall enter into an \n     arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to \n     investigate and report on the scientific bases for the public \n     recommendations of the EPA with respect to indoor radon and \n     other naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM).

Madam President, I rise today to commend the two floor \nmanagers of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Missouri [Mr. \nBond], and the distinguished Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], and \ntheir staff, for their excellent and efficient management of the VA-HUD \nFiscal Year 1996 Appropriations Act.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss an amendment I am \noffering on this appropriations bill. My amendment encourages agencies \nfunded under the bill to become more energy efficient and directs them \nto reduce facility energy costs by 5 percent. The agencies will report \nto the Congress at the end of the year on their efforts to conserve \nenergy and will make recommendations for further conservation efforts. \nI have offered this amendment to every appropriations bill that has \ncome before the Senate this year, and it has been accepted to each one.\n  I believe this is a common-sense amendment: The Federal Government \nspends nearly $4 billion annually to heat, cool, and power its 500,000 \nbuildings. The Office of Technology Assistance and the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, a non-profit group which I chair with Senator Jeffords, \nestimate that Federal agencies could save $1 billion annually if they \nwould make an effort to become more energy efficient and conserve \nenergy.\n  Madam President, I hope this amendment will encourage agencies to use \nnew energy savings technologies when making building improvements in \ninsulation, building controls, lighting, \n\n[[Page S 14385]]\nheating, and air conditioning. The Department of Energy has made \navailable for government-wide agency use streamlined energy saving \nperformance contracts procedures, modeled after private sector \ninitiatives.

Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor an amendment to H.R. \n2099, the VA-HUD-independent agencies appropriations bill. I am pleased \nto cosponsor this amendment which will prohibit the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development [HUD] from enforcing a complaint of \ndiscrimination on the basis of a housing provider's occupancy standard, \nenforcement of which goes well beyond the standards described in the \nMarch 20, 1991 memorandum of the general counsel of HUD to all Regional \nCounsel.\n  Mr. President, an occupancy standard is one which specifies the \nnumber of people who may live in a residential rental unit. An internal \n1991 HUD memorandum, issued by former HUD General Counsel Keating to \nall regional counsel, clearly established a straightforward occupancy \nstandard of ``two persons per bedroom'' as generally reasonable.\n  The two-per-bedroom occupancy standard has been deemed reasonable \nwithin the enforcement of fair housing discrimination laws under the \nFair Housing Act. That is until Henry Cisneros became Secretary of HUD. \nSecretary Cisneros and his Deputy Roberta Achtenberg have disagreed \nwith the traditional occupancy standard, arguing that it discriminates \nagainst larger families.\n  In July of this year HUD General Counsel Diaz issued a memorandum \nwhich, in effect, supplants the two-per-bedroom standard, and may force \nhousing owners to accept six, seven, eight, or even nine people into a \ntwo-bedroom apartment.\n  Mr. Diaz's standard is without merit. Mr. Diaz has used the BOCA--\nBuilding Officials and Code Administrators--Property Maintenance Code \nas a foundation for his occupancy standard. The BOCA code is a health \nand safety code specifically drafted by engineers and architects to \nprovide guidance to municipalities on the maximum number of individuals \nwho may safely occupy any building. It was never intended to alter the \nminimum number of family members HUD could require owners to accept \nunder fair housing law.\n  The code was adopted without any consultation, public hearings, or \nanalysis of its impact of the Nation's rental housing industries. That \nis wrong. It was not the intent of Congress to allow HUD to establish a \nnational occupancy standard. Secretary Cisneros, through HUD's general \ncounsel, has circumvented the Federal Government's rule making process \nby imposing this standard through an advisory without public hearings.\n  This amendment blocks HUD's attempt to set a national occupancy \nstandard through an advisory. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2804\n\n (Purpose: To make an amendment relating to eligible activities under \n section 105 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Madam President, I rise today, with my colleague \nSenator Kohl to offer an amendment that requires the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to report on the impact of the use of \nFederal community development funds on plant relocations and the \nresultant job dislocation.\n  Our concern was generated by an announcement made in 1994 by a major \nemployer in Wisconsin, Briggs & Stratton, that a Milwaukee plant would \nbe closed, and 2,000 workers would be permanently displaced. The actual \neconomic impact upon this community is even greater since it is \nestimated that 1.24 related jobs will be lost for every 1 of the 2,000 \nBriggs jobs affected. The devastating news was compounded by the \nsubsequent discovery that many of these jobs were being transferred to \nplants, which were being expanded in two other States, and that Federal \ncommunity development block grant, CDBG, funds were being used to \nfacilitate the transfer of these jobs from one State to another.\n  Our initial response was to introduce legislation prohibiting the use \nof such funds for the relocation of plants and the resultant job \ndislocation. The House of Representatives agreed with the approach and \napproved an identical amendment to the housing reauthorization bill.\n  We believed at the time, and now that the CDBG program was designed \nto foster community and economic development; not to help move jobs \naround the country.\n  Obviously, during a period of permanent economic restructuring, which \nresults in plant closings, downsizing of Federal programs and defense \nindustry conversion, there is tremendous competition between \ncommunities for new plants and other business expansions to offset \nother job losses.\n  States and local communities are doing everything they can to attract \nnew business and retain existing businesses. But we believe it is \nsimply wrong to use Federal dollars to help one community raid jobs \nfrom another State.\n  There is no way we can justify to the taxpayers in my State that they \nare sending their money to Washington to be distributed to other States \nso that it can be used to attract jobs out of Wisconsin, leaving behind \ncommunities whose economic stability has been destroyed. Thousands of \npeople whose jobs are directly, or indirectly lost as a result of the \ntransfer of these jobs out of our State are justifiably outraged by \nthis misuse of funds.\n  However, Madam President, after further consideration, and \nconsultation with the floor managers we recognize that indeed the \nunderlying issue is complex.\n  Wisconsin, as are other States, is regularly involved in the activity \nof attracting new business to the State, and retaining existing \nbusinesses. We recognize that economic incentive proposals developed to \nenhance the State's opportunity often include a wide variety of \nfinancial combinations including job training funds, tax incentives, \ninfrastructure improvements and other financing tools.\n  These combinations often obscure the leveraged value of the Federal \nfunds in the package in convincing a company to make a decision to move \nout of State. However, recognizing these factors does not clear the \npicture, but begs the question of what is the impact of the Federal \ndollar in these situations in influencing the decisions of the targeted \ncompany.\n  This amendment would address the issue by directing the HUD Secretary \nto conduct a study over the next year, and report back to Congress with \nrecommendations on what would be a sensible legislative approach to \nboth protecting the workers and communities that lose businesses and \nemployment to other States, and how Federal funds might be \nappropriately utilized in developing economic opportunity for \ncommunities across the Nation, without placing other communities in \njeopardy.\n  The study would examine and investigate the extent to which Federal \ncommunity development funds are used in combination with other Federal, \nState or local revenue sources in attracting new business from other \nStates. The study would also examine and assess the degree to which \nFederal community development funds are key to a company's decision to \nmove--are they incidental to the decision, a factor, a key decision \npoint, or the linchpin of the deal?\n  An examination of the findings by the Congress upon completion of \nsuch a study would then become the basis for further legislative action \nif necessary.\n  We thank the floor managers for recognizing our legitimate concerns, \nand for their willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion to help \nperfect this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, these amendments have been cleared on both \nsides. They are ready for adoption.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we have cleared these amendments with \nall of the relevant authorizing committees. There are no objections on \nour side, and in many instances they are enthusiastically either \nsponsored or approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2796 through 2808) en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, the drill that we just went through took a \nlittle bit of time, but, frankly, I would like to commend the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from Colorado, because many times I have \nfound that things I did not support have crept into legislation in the \npast. I hope that by doing this, we put all our colleagues, or at least \ntheir staffs, on notice. We are beginning what I hope will be a useful \nprocess, and I thank the Senators for recommending it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I want to acknowledge the hard work of \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee in assembling this complex appropriations \nbill. The diverse range of agencies funded by this bill--the Veterans \nAdministration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautic and Space \nAdministration, the National Science Foundation, and numerous other \nindependent agencies--makes the VA-HUD bill one of the most difficult \nappropriations bills to balance.\n  It is clear that the resource constraints placed on the \nAppropriations Committee by the budget resolution this year made it \nimpossible to fund adequately all of the programs and activities in the \nbill that are important to me, important to the people of \nMassachusetts, and important to the people of this country. \nNonetheless, with respect to the way in which the bill addresses \nhousing and related programs, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nare to be commended for good faith \n\n[[Page S 14388]]\nefforts to minimize the pain from the reductions.\n  There are several items in the bill that are quite positive, and I \nthank the chairman and the ranking member for including these. I am \nparticularly pleased that the bill includes an appropriation for the \nYouthbuild Program. Youthbuild is working to provide kids who live in \ntough places with some confidence and some hope along with a solid \npackage of job skills while contributing to their communities the \nproducts of their work in the form of rehabilitated homes and other \nstructures. Youthbuild deserves our continued support.\n  I am also a strong supporter of the provisions in this bill that fund \nthe Community Development Block Grant and HOME Programs at the 1995 \nappropriated levels. CDBG has a solid 20-year track record of providing \nflexible community development assistance to State and local \ngovernments. HOME also provides flexible resources to State and local \ngovernments for the purpose of fostering partnerships in support of \naffordable housing. HOME is designed to leverage the additional public \nand private resources and is achieving excellent results in targeting \nthese housing resources to low-income families. Both CDBG and HOME are \ncritical to the successes of the community-based nonprofit movement.\n  Another important element of the bill before the Senate is the $624 \nmillion it contains for the Low-Income Housing Preservation and \nResident Homeownership Act, or LIHPRHA. I congratulate the chairman for \nhis commitment to the preservation program's mission. We cannot afford \na hiatus in preservation funding, because we would then risk losing \naffordable housing resources and displacing people from their homes. We \nall recognize that LIHPRHA has some structural problems that need \ncorrecting, and the bill has made an important contribution in pushing \nforward preservation program reforms. It is unfortunate that the \nLIHPRHA capital grant reforms in this bill are delayed a year for \ntechnical reasons related to budget scoring. However, since they are, \nit is important that we continue to process and preserve the projects \nunder the old program using available resources and not stand idly than \nwaiting for the new program to be perfected, enacted, and implemented.\n  Finally, I would like to express relief that the bill does not repeal \nthe Brooke amendment as some have proposed. The Brooke amendment limits \nthe rent paid by a poor family to 30 percent of income. The bill does \nmake some changes in the public housing rent-setting process that we \nwill have to monitor closely. I support the provision in this bill \nproviding public housing authorities with the flexibility to set \nceiling rents and adopt policies that deduct earned income in \ncalculating the adjusted income against which the 30 percent standard \nis applied. These changes should help enable working families to remain \nin public housing developments and improve the income mix of the public \nhousing communities. I am less enthusiastic about a provision in the \nbill that requires all residents to pay a minimum rent of $25 per \nmonth, particularly in the context of other cutbacks in programs of \nassistance to poor families.\n  There are, however, Madam President, too many instances where I \nbelieve the bill takes the wrong course. First, and foremost, the bill \nmakes major reductions in HUD's total resources. The bill cuts funding \nfor public housing operating subsidies, public housing modernization, \nhomeless assistance, and the section 8 tenant-based assistance. These \nHUD programs serve the housing needs of the poorest of the poor. Over \ntime, underfunding public housing will erode its quality as public \nhousing authorities cut back on maintenance due to a lack of resources. \nA provision delaying the reissuance of vouchers that come available \nwill mean that homeless families which have risen to the top of local \nwaiting lists will have to wait 6 months to receive housing assistance. \nThe bill also reduces public housing authority fees for the \nadministration of the section 8 program in a way that does not take \ninto account the different cost structures for administering the \nprogram nor does it seem to have considered the distinct possibility \nthat at least some public housing authorities will simply choose not to \ncontinue to administer the program after these cuts take effect. These \ncuts are an excellent reflection the tyranny of the budget that binds \nthe Congress.\n  Madam President, I would like to also register my concern about the \nextent of authorizing provisions in this bill. Some of these provisions \nhave not gone through the hearing process nor have members had the \nopportunity to consult concerning them with all of the affected parties \nand other experts on program operations. I am particularly concerned \nthat the numerous discrete, piecemeal provisions--while often helpful--\nwill undermine or contradict efforts to engage in a more comprehensive \nexamination of the HUD statutes. As a member of the authorizing \ncommittee, I am hopeful that we will review all of these provisions in \nmore detail.\n  There are three particularly egregious authorizing provisions in this \nbill that highlight the need for a more orderly process of hearings and \ndeliberation. These are the provisions transferring HUD's Office of \nFair Housing to the Department of Justice, the transfer of the Office \nof Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight to Treasury, and a prohibition \nagainst enforcing the fair housing laws against property insurers who \ndiscriminate. I oppose the inclusion of all three provisions in this \nbill.\n  I realize that HUD is taking a disproportionate share of the budget \ncuts because some of its programs have been troubled and do not enjoy a \npositive public image. The cuts, then, underscore the need for the \nCongress to work harder to improve HUD's management systems, and to \nreduce the workload placed on HUD's staff by consolidating programs and \ndevolving some HUD responsibilities to other capable partners. We also \nneed to be willing to take a more aggressive approach toward the poorly \nmanaged inventory and that portion of the HUD-assisted inventory that \nhas aged to the point of obsolescence.\n  So, notwithstanding my broader concerns with authorizing on an \nappropriations bill and authorizing out of context, I note that several \nprovisions in this bill are helpful. For example, the bill allows HUD \nto consolidate seven categorical homeless programs into a formula grant \nprogram. This reform will reduce HUD's workload and allow the \nDepartment to redeploy the staff who currently spend many hours \nreviewing thousands of applications.\n  The bill also includes several provisions that may prove helpful in \nallowing public housing agencies to adapt to the cuts in the bill. In \nparticular, the bill provides new, expanded, eligible activities for \nthe public housing modernization program that deserve more hearing, but \nare defensible in the face of large cuts in resources. Revisiting our \nadmission policies pertaining to public and assisted housing also is \nnecessary not only from the perspective of shrinking resources, but \nfrom the need to reverse the overconcentration of the poor.\n  I am very concerned that this bill pushes forward too far and too \nfast on the Department's proposal to enact legislation with respect to \nmark-to-market of the assisted housing inventory. We need not rush into \na complicated proposal that likely will result in forcing many \nproperties into default. The administration has proposed to voucher out \nthe public and assisted inventory. This approach may make sense in \nthose instances where the housing has been poorly managed and low-\nincome people have been forced to live in squalor. However, I have \nserious concerns about vouchers as a substitute for well-managed, well-\nlocated housing. I have concerns that vouchers do not work for everyone \nin every market. Vouchers are not accepted by many landlords. The \navailable suggests that if we move to vouchers, many housing assistance \nrecipients will be displaced from a place that they currently call \nhome.\n  Fundamentally, this appropriations bill does not and could not come \nclose to meeting the housing needs of this country. More than 5 million \nvery low income Americans face severe housing needs. They suffer from \nhomelessness, they pay rents that take more than 50 percent of their \nhousehold income, or they live in severely substandard conditions. We \nhave not been willing to provide the resources necessary to meet these \nneeds. Over the last 15 \n\n[[Page S 14389]]\nyears of troubled housing policy, though, both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations have been committed to making progress \ntoward meeting these needs, albeit with different levels of energy and \ncommitment. The resource levels in this bill are simply not adequate to \nthe task of preserving the affordable housing gains from the past, \nreforming HUD's programs, compensating for previous underfunding of \ncapital needs, and making progress against our Nation's large \noutstanding needs for affordable housing.\n  The effects of the budget on this bill and thence in these vital \nGovernment services are extremely troubling. Our Nation will pay and \npay dearly--both now and even more in the future--for shortchanging \nthese pressing needs. Some of us--the most unfortunate--will pay more \ndearly than others, but their plight will affect us all.\n  Knowing this, we need to make the greatest possible effort to find \nmore resources that can be devoted to meeting the objectives I have \ndescribed. I hope to be joined in good faith by colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle seeking that goal.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we are coming into the closing minutes \nnow of this bill. We started the debate on VA-HUD appropriations around \nMonday at 3 o'clock. A lot has gone on since then, and I commend \nSenator Bond on moving this bill and the way he has handled this \nlegislation in the Chamber.\n  I know this is the first time he has chaired the committee and \nbrought the bill to the floor. I compliment him on the way we have been \nable to move in such an efficient way. I thank his professional staff \nfor the many courtesies and consultation provided my staff.\n  I thank Mr. Rusty Mathews, Mr. Steve Crane, and Mr. Kevin Kelly, who \nprovided technical assistance on my side.\n  In this bill, we won some and we lost some. We won some by preserving \nAmerica's future in space. We came to an agreement on redlining. And we \nlost issues like national service. This is America. This is democracy. \nWe have spoken, and I believe it is now time to vote. I believe the \nPresident will have significant concerns with this bill. I believe the \nPresident will veto it. But I believe the time now for debate has \nconcluded, and I again wish to thank my colleagues for the support that \nthey gave me during this time.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, let me express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Maryland, who has been absolutely invaluable in helping us \nmove this forward. I must confess that until I had this pleasure, I did \nnot understand all that went with it. I commend her for the great \nservice she has provided this committee in the past and the help she \ngave me.\n  I join with her in thanking Rusty Mathews, Kevin Kelly, Steve Crane, \nthe people on her side. For my part, I thank Stephen Kohashi, Carrie \nApostolou, Steve Isakowitz, and the members of my staff, Julie Dammann, \nJohn Kamarck, Tracy Henke, Keith Cole, Leanne Jerome, and the others \nwho have helped a great deal.\n  Let me say very briefly--we have already made the points--this bill \nis within the budget. It sets some priorities in a very tough time. I \nthink with the help of committee members and the Members of this body \nwe have fine-tuned it as best we can. It does allow the agencies to \nmove forward with the vitally needed programs that are so important in \nthis country in the many areas we fund.\n  I hope that the President, the Office of Management and Budget will \ncommunicate with us as to what their objections are and how we might \nsolve them. I know that all my colleagues have enjoyed these 2 days. I \ndo not wish to go through this drill again. If the administration will \nlet us know what their objections are, we have, I think, done as good a \njob as possible within the dollars available, and if we are going to \nbalance the budget as not only this body has said but I believe the \npeople of America demand, this is what we have to work with.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and the Senate proceed immediately to vote on the \npassage of the bill with no other intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask for a recorded vote, the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its \namendments, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes thereon, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to; and the Presiding Officer (Ms. Snowe) \nappointed Mr. Bond, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Burns, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Hatfield, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Johnston, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Byrd conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Senator Bond, of \nMissouri, and Senator Barbara Mikulski, of Maryland. They put a very \ngood bill together. I understand that the Senator from Maryland does \nnot support the bill in its final stages. Let me just make a few \nobservations.\n\n  Some of us are beginning to say we need to ask some new questions \nabout programs and projects and activities of the Federal Government. \nThe leading question that we have to start asking ourselves is: What \ncan we afford? We never did that for a long time. In fact, I ask \nSenators to reflect on the past 8 to 12 years and, for the most part, \nthe question was never asked: Can we afford this? An amendment was \noffered because it sounded good, or it was something that perhaps, in a \nperfect economic environment, would be neat, and we looked around to \nsee if we could get 51 votes, and we would go to conference and see if \nwe could hold it, and all of a sudden we would have something new \ngoing.\n  But I believe balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility do not \nactually happen in huge waves and big doses of cuts. I think they come \nwith hard work. Every chairman who has had to produce an appropriations \nbill this \n\n[[Page S 14390]]\nyear on the domestic side has had to take less than they had the year \nbefore, and that means very simply that, through hard work and, \nhopefully, some wisdom, priorities had to be discussed and priorities \nhad to be decided upon.\n  It is no longer the day of being able to say to every Senator that \nasks for things that we have taken care of you. In fact, I believe we \nare at the point, and there will be more years to come when we have to \nsay to most that we cannot give you what you want.\n  Senator Bond had a tough job. Few Americans understand that this bill \nhas veterans in it, has public housing in it, and at the same time has \nmany other programs, including the space program. Who would think that \none appropriations bill would cover that spectrum? He has had to \nbalance, with less of a budget than last year, these same great demands \nand responsibilities that we have.\n  I believe this bill attempts, in very difficult times in terms of \nmoney--because we want to get to a balance sooner rather than later, \nand we want to make sure that we do not burden our children with more \nand more of our debt.\n  I just came to the floor to say to Senator Bond that he did an \nexcellent job. I commend him and those who have produced bills \nheretofore that have met the targets. I commend them also.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I cannot support this legislation. In \nfar too many ways, it fails the American people, the people of \nCalifornia I was sent to represent, and the principles of good \ngovernment and good policy to which I subscribe. The bill turns its \nback on responsibility, obligation, and hope.\n\n\n                        Environmental Protection\n\n  One of the primary functions of government is to protect the public's \nhealth and safety. Our Federal laws and regulations are written to \nimprove and protect the high quality of life that we enjoy in our \ncountry. Every day, the people of our Nation enjoy the benefits of \nalmost a century of progress in Federal laws and regulations that \nreduce the threat of illness, injury, and death from consumer products, \nworkplace hazards, and environmental toxins.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency, created by President Nixon in \n1970, is responsible for the implementation of our most fundamental \nenvironmental protection laws: The Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act; laws that protect us from improper \ndisposal of hazardous waste disposal; laws that protect us from \nexposure to radiation and toxic substances; and laws that regulate the \nclean-up of hazardous waste sites all over the country. As the year \n2000 approaches, Americans can look back with immense pride in the \nprogress we have achieved in protections of our health and safety.\n  Unfortunately, the drastic cuts in EPA's budget in this bill will cut \nto the bone, jeopardizing all the progress we have made.\n  For example, the 23 percent cut in the EPA enforcement budget in the \nbill will inevitably result in a rollback of national efforts to ensure \nthat every American breathes clean air, drinks clean water, and is safe \nfrom the dangers of hazardous waste.\n  The bill will reduce the ability of the EPA to respond to threats to \nthe environment and human health. In the long run this will mean more \nwater pollution, more smog in our cities and countryside, more food \npoisoning, more toxic waste problems.\n  Cuts will severely undercut the number of Federal and State \nenvironmental inspections, thereby increasing the risk to the public \nhealth and environment from unchecked violators. In fiscal year 1994, \nmore than 2,600 facilities were inspected in California and 447 \nenforcement actions were taken by Federal or State environmental \nagencies.\n  Cuts will mean that state monitoring and inspection programs will \neither have to be either severely curtailed, paid for by the state or \npossibly eliminated.\n  Cuts will hurt EPA/industry compliance initiatives which are underway \nin key industrial sectors in my State, such as the Gillette Corporation \nEnvironmental Leadership Program, a project of the Gillette Corporation \nof Santa Monica, CA, and the Agriculture Compliance Assistance Services \nCenter, which was developed in conjunction with the Agriculture \nExtension Service to provide ``one stop shopping'' for information to \nassist farms in complying with environmental regulations. Support for \nthis Center--and initiatives like it underway in other industries--will \nbe severely undercut by these cuts in the EPA budget.\n  In addition to the budget cuts, the bill includes a number of \nunacceptable riders that will: Eliminate EPA's role in issuing permits \nto fill wetlands; prohibit the EPA from issuing a new safeguard to \nprotect the public from drinking water contamination; prohibit the EPA \nfrom implementing Clean Air Act programs; restrict the listing of new \nSuperfund sites; prohibit the EPA from issuing final rules for arsenic, \nsulphates, radon, ground water disinfection, or the contaminants in \nphase IVB in drinking water.\n  The ban on standard-setting is the equivalent of a ban on the \nimplementation of one of the central provisions of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act, and is a blow to the ongoing bipartisan negotiations in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee on Safe Drinking Water Act \nreauthorization.\n  EPA is under court order to issue these standards, which are now more \nthan 6 years late. The riders in this bill are an unnecessary \ninterference with the ongoing process and will only serve to delay it \nfurther.\n  Congress required the groundwater disinfection rule to be issued in \n1989. The Centers for Disease Control has documented that many disease \noutbreaks are caused by parasite-contaminated groundwater (often from \nsewage, animal waste, or septic tanks). While not all groundwater must \nbe disinfected, if the rider is in place, EPA will be barred from \nrequiring any groundwater to be treated to kill parasites.\n  The bill eliminates the EPA's veto authority over the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers wetlands permits, a power that it needs in order to ensure \nconsistent interpretation and implementation of the Clean Water Act.\n  EPA has used the veto sparingly--only 11 times since 1972--and in \neach case had to demonstrate that the discharge would have an \nunacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish \nbeds, fishery areas, wildlife, or recreation. Typically, a veto has \ninvolved only major projects with significant potential adverse \nimpacts. The total waters protected by EPA veto: 7,299 acres or about \n664 acres protected per veto.\n  The power of EPA's veto has played a very constructive role in the \nreaching of compromises on proposed development plans to fill wetlands. \nMoreover, since the Environment and Public Works Committee is now \nconsidering wetlands reform legislation, this rider is, again, an \nunnecessary and untimely interference with the ongoing efforts to make \nappropriate changes in the law.\n  The bill cuts the Superfund program for cleaning up hazardous waste \nsites by 36 percent or almost $500 million.\n  California has 23 sites listed on the Superfund National Priorities \nList-- more than any other state. According to the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the proposed Superfund cuts would severely impact \ncleanup at 12 of these facilities (since the other 11 facilities are on \nthe base closure list and oversight is paid by the base closure \naccount, it is not clear what impact, if any, the Superfund cut will \nhave on the 11 other sites).\n  Thus, in the area of environmental protection, the bill before us \nfails to provide even a merely adequate amount of funding for the \nprograms and policies that protect the public health and safety.\n\n\n                            Housing Programs\n\n  The cuts made by this bill in the programs of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development will have a tremendous impact on \ncommunities and neighborhoods across the country.\n  HUD was hit particularly hard in this spending measure. Under the \nSenate bill, HUD would receive 19 percent less funding than what was \nrequested by the administration and over 20 percent less than what was \napproved in last year's bill.\n  This will mean significant cuts in funding to serve our Nation's \nhomeless. The Senate bill contains $360 million less than what was in \nthe President's \n\n[[Page S 14391]]\nrequest for homeless assistance--the last safety net for homeless \nindividuals and families. This translates into $49 million less than \nlast year for California to address its homeless problem at a time when \noverall budget cuts may force more people into homelessness.\n  Another cruel cut is in new incremental housing vouchers. The bill \nprovides $590 million less than the 1995 post-rescission amount. This \ncut will mean that low-income families, homeless families, and families \nwith special problems will not receive the housing assistance for which \nthey have waited so long.\n  Public housing modernization funds would also be significantly \nreduced. California will receive $17 million less than fiscal year 1995 \nin modernization funding.\n  This cut will undermine efforts to make much needed improvements to \nthe worst public housing developments and threaten the existing supply \nof quality public housing in our Nation's cities. Without sufficient \npublic housing modernization funding, we will be left with public \nhousing that is a blight to our cities and is unfit for families who \nmust raise their children there.\n  Aside from the spending cuts, I am concerned about the legislative \nriders in the bill which would authorize significant changes to the \nenforcement of the Fair Housing Act. Housing discrimination is a matter \nwhich deserves our serious attention. The transfer of this type of \nauthority should be considered in the authorizing committee and not as \na legislative rider on an appropriations measure.\n  The Senate bill contains provisions to reform the Low-Income Housing \nPreservation Program. California has an estimated 22,000 units of \naffordable housing which may be lost without a sufficiently funded \nprogram to preserve them. Thousands of seniors and working families in \nhigh cost housing markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles could be \ndisplaced, with no other affordable housing available to them. Adequate \nfunding must be maintained so that this valuable housing stock can be \npreserved.\n\n\n                            Veterans Health\n\n  The bill fails to provide an adequate amount of funds for veterans \nhealth programs: veterans' medicare care is more than $500 million \nbelow the President's request.\n  This cut will result in a serious impact on the ability of the \nDepartment to deliver quality care to deserving veterans. VA Secretary \nJesse Brown estimates that 113,000 fewer veterans would be treated in \nfiscal year 1996 than in the previous year without the additional \nfunding. This could mean an estimated 1 million fewer outpatient visits \nfor the men and women who have fought for and served our country.\n  The Appropriations Committee's rationale for not including full \nfunding is that the number of veterans is declining. However, we must \nremember that the number of older veterans is increasing, as is the \nnumber of patients VA serves. Drastic changes made to Medicaid and \nMedicare could result in further strains to the VA health care system.\n\n\n                     National Service (AmeriCorps)\n\n  The national service program, signed into law on September 21, 1993, \ncreated the Corporation for National and Community Service to \nadminister a number of service programs. AmeriCorps is the largest of \nthose programs.\n  AmeriCorps programs are managed by bi-partisan State commissions. \nFederal funds go directly to the States to support locally designed and \noperated programs addressing unmet needs in the areas of education, \npublic safety, health, housing, and the environment.\n  The concept of national service is to bring together Americans of all \nages, backgrounds and talents to work to build-up America, to set us on \na united goal of service to our Nation.\n  When I was a junior at Brooklyn College, President John F. Kennedy \nurged our Nation's young people to ``ask not what your country can do \nfor you, but what you can do for your country.'' More than 30 years \nlater, those words have not lost their sense of urgency.\n  There are currently 20,000 Ameri-Corps members and 350 programs \nnationwide. AmeriCorps members earn a small living allowance--about \n$600 per month--and receive limited health care benefits. At the end of \ntheir term of service--roughly 1,700 hours full-time over a year--they \nreceive an education award worth $4,725. The award may be used to pay \nfor current or future college and graduate school tuition, job \ntraining, or to repay existing student loans.\n  In my State, there are over 2,500 AmeriCorps members serving in \napproximately 27 programs throughout the State.\n  I believe giving young Americans an opportunity to serve our country \nbefore, during, or after college and subsequently providing them with \nan educational award is a good use of our dollars.\n  In a society of ever increasing apathy, the commitment of young \npeople to national service is something I urge my colleagues to support \nand not malign.\n\n\n                           Travis VA Hospital\n\n  Finally, I am profoundly disappointed by the Appropriations \nCommittee's refusal to fund the Veterans hospital now under \nconstruction at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California.\n  In 1991, a severe earthquake damaged northern California's only VA \nhospital in Martinez. That facility served over 400,000 veterans, and \nits closure forced many to drive up to 8 hours to receive medical care. \nThe Bush administration recognized the tremendous need created by the \nMartinez closure and promised the community that a replacement facility \nwould be constructed in Fairfield, at Travis Air Force Base. The \ncommittee's action breaks that 4-year-old promise to the veterans of \nnorthern California.\n  Last year, Congress appropriated $7 million to complete design and \nbegin construction on the Travis-VA medical center. Nearly $20 million \nhas been spent on the project to date, and more than a year ago, Vice \nPresident Gore broke ground. Construction is now underway.\n  For fiscal year 1996, President Clinton requested the funds needed to \ncomplete construction. The committee has now rejected this request, \nwhich seriously jeopardizes the prospect that the hospital will ever be \nbuilt.\n  The committee's only explanation for its action was that due to \nbudget restrictions, it chose not to fund new construction projects. \nHowever, as I have already explained, this project is not a new \nfacility, designed to meet an expected future need. It is a replacement \nhospital--promised by the past two administrations--designed to meet an \nexisting need in northern California.\n  The decision not to fund the Travis-VA medical center breaks faith \nwith California's veterans, and violates promises made by the past two \nPresidential administrations.\n  Because of the foregoing reasons, I have voted against the VA/HUD/\nIndependent Agencies appropriations bill, and I will urge the President \nto exercise his veto power against it, in the hope that the ensuing \nnegotiations will produce a better bill.\n  Madam President, I understand the hard work that went into this bill \nby both the majority and minority sides. I just hope that the President \nwill veto this bill. As I have said, I think this bill turns its back \non responsibility, it turns its back on obligation, and it turns its \nback on hope.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico says, times are tough, and the numbers \nwe have to deal with are lower, of course. Well, I ask, why is it that \nwe are giving the military $7 billion more than they asked for, $7 \nbillion more than the generals and admirals asked for--and, therefore, \nwe have to cut the heart out of our kids, our people who need housing \nand, for God's sake, our veterans. By the way, about 20 to 30 percent \nof our homeless are veterans.\n  So, I hope the American people have watched this debate, Madam \nPresident. This is what we have been talking about. I voted to balance \nthe budget in 7 years, but not to do it this way, to hurt our kids, to \ncut out National Youth Service, and to threaten up to 22,000 units of \naffordable housing may be lost in California unless we can fix this \nproblem up in conference. It is called the Low-Income Housing \nPreservation Program, and because landlords may opt to prepay their \nmortgages, we may lose this valuable housing stock if we do not \nsufficiently fund the program. Middle-income people and low-income \npeople will face increases in their rents and may be thrown out on the \nstreets.\n  The veterans hospital at Travis, in the Fairfield area of my State, \nwhere \n\n[[Page S 14392]]\nthere was an official groundbreaking because we need a veterans \nhospital badly, it is zeroed out in this bill. And for what? To pay for \na tax cut to those people making over $350,000 a year, who get back \n$20,000; to give the Pentagon more than the Pentagon asks for. I just \nfeel very sad today. I acknowledge the hard work of the committee. \nBelieve me, they were given a number that was very difficult to reach, \nand I have sympathy with that situation. I serve on the Budget \nCommittee, and Chairman Domenici spoke eloquently about the problems we \nare facing. But I know we did not have to go about it this way.\n  I hope the American people get that, and I hope they do not just say \nthis is too complicated. This is about priorities. This is about what \nwe stand for. And we are turning our backs on the veterans of this \ncountry, and we are turning our backs on the lowest of the low, the \nhomeless people.\n  We did not have to do it. We tell our young kids that you are just \nnot worth it. And for what? As far as I am concerned, there are three \nbills the President ought to veto, and this is one of them. We can \nsustain that veto, and I hope when we really meet the crunch, there \nwill be some give and take around this place, because this bill is \nunacceptable. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I voted against the last appropriations \nbill on the floor of the Senate. I was interested in the remarks \noffered by the Senator from California.\n  I said earlier this week that the three appropriations bills that we \nwould be confronted with this week represented probably the worst \npossible choices one could make. This process is all about choices. \nThere are some who forever want people to believe that there is one \nside of the aisle in Congress that represents big spenders and a biding \ninterest in spending more and more on everything while the other side \nof the aisle represents a bunch of frugal skinflints who really do not \nwant to spend, the ones who are putting the brakes on and are trying to \nbring down the deficit.\n  What a bunch of hogwash, a total bunch of nonsense. The question is \nnot whether we spend money; the question is how we spend the money. \nNever is it better illustrated than in what we have seen in the last \nweek or so. We have conference committee on the defense bill reporting \nout in the last day or two, saying they want $3/4 billion more than the \nPresident or the Secretary of Defense said is necessary to defend this \ncountry, with B-2 bombers and star wars alone--just those two issues; \n$3 to $4 billion more to buy B-2 bombers and star wars. But they have \nsaid, by the way, we cannot afford the 50,000 kids who are now on Head \nStart. They are going to get kicked off. Yes, they all have names. They \nare going to lose Head Start benefits. But we want to buy 20 more B-2 \nbombers for $30 billion despite the fact that the Defense Department \ndid not ask for it.\n  But we cannot afford to give disadvantaged kids in the inner city a \nlittle hope in the summer with a summer job. These kids who have \nnothing, who feel often hopeless and helpless, who look for an \nopportunity to get a job in a summer jobs program in the city, and we \nare saying to 600,000 of these kids--kids who all have a name and a \ndream that maybe they can get a summer job--we are sorry, we cannot \nafford a summer job for a disadvantaged kid like you in the inner city. \nBut we insist on spending money to start building star wars. The Senate \nput in $300 million more than the President asked for, and when the \nbill went to conference, it got worse. Let us build interceptor \nmissiles and laser beams.\n  Where does all of this end? There is no Soviet Union. The threat has \nchanged. Yet, the appetite to spend has not changed. It is not liberal \nor conservative. Seven billion dollars was added to the defense budget \nto buy trucks that the Secretary of Defense said he does not need, jet \nairplanes that the Secretary of Defense said he did not want, and \nsubmarines nobody asked for. And yes, to build star wars and B-2 \nbombers. That is $7 billion extra that was stuck in that bill by people \nwho say they are against public spending.\n  Where is the demonstration of frugality when it comes to that budget? \nWhy is it that the sky is the limit? There is no bottom to the coin \npurse when it comes to the defense budget.\n  I am for defending this country. I do not think there is anybody here \nwho is going to do more than I will do to support the men and women who \nwear the uniform in this country, who defend freedom and liberty.\n  The fact is, it serves no interest, especially not the interests of \nthe men and women who devote their lives to public service, by sending \nthe military money to build gold-plated, boondoggle weapon programs we \ndo not need. That takes money away from the day-to-day needs of the men \nand women in the military.\n  More important than that, it finally is a matter of choice. It is a \nchoice of saying the star wars program is more important than Head \nStart. Buying B-2 bombers that the Secretary of Defense says we do not \nneed is more important than giving kids a job for the summer or a tax \ncut, 50 percent of which will go to the most affluent in the country. \nFifty percent of the benefits of the $245 billion tax cut, at a time \nwhen we are up to our neck in debt, goes to families whose incomes are \nover $100,000. A tax cut is more important than the benefits for \nincapacitated veterans?\n  I am telling you, there is something wrong with those choices. It is \nnot a matter of saying spend, spend, spend, but a matter of saying make \nthe right choice. Thomas Jefferson said those who think that a country \ncan be both ignorant and free think of something that never was and \nnever can be. If we do not understand that our future is not in \nbuilding star wars, but our future is investing in this country's kids, \ninvesting in education, investing for the future, if we do not \nunderstand that, I am telling you that these choices we make today, as \nviewed by historians 100 years from now, will cause them to scratch \ntheir heads and say, ``What on Earth were they thinking about? What on \nEarth could their values have been to suggest somehow that kids are not \nvery important?\"\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank the Senator for putting perspective on \nthis bill. I want to just enter into a couple questions with my friend.\n  Does the Senator know how much the Republicans would like to cut from \nMedicare over the next 7 years?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The proposed cut in the baseline that is needed to meet \nMedicare expenditures for those who are eligible is $270 billion over \nthe 7 years.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So they are proposing to cut $270 billion, which they say \nis not a cut, but, in fact, if the population keeps aging and if \nmedical technology keeps moving forward, this is what is anticipated. \nThey want to take $270 billion out over 7 years.\n  Does the Senator know how much Health and Human Services said is \nneeded in order to make Medicare sound, is needed to cut out of the \nprogram?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The adjustments that are necessary in Medicare are about \n$89 billion, not $270 billion.\n  Incidentally, those who say you can cut $270 billion out of Medicare \nwithout having any impact on senior citizens must go to sleep and put \ntheir teeth under the pillow hoping a dollar shows up the next morning.\n  Where on Earth do they get these fanciful notions that you can do \nthis without affecting senior citizens? Of course, if you cut $270 \nbillion from Medicare, you are going to wind up with a health care \nprogram for senior citizens that costs senior citizens more money and \ngives them less health care. That is the point.\n  Why do we have that equation? Well, it is simple. The $270 billion \nproposed cut in the amount needed for Medicare is, I think, proposed in \norder to allow room for a $245 billion tax cut.\n  Now, I recognize and freely admit that for someone to stand up in the \nSenate and say, look, I serve in the U.S. Senate and I want to exhibit \ngreat courage today and my courage propels me to suggest we should have \na tax cut. Well, what a wildly popular thing. It is like putting a raft \nin whitewater and rushing downstream. Wildly popular concept, having a \ntax cut. If you want to be popular, stand here and call for a tax cut.\n  My view is that the same people who are calling for a tax cut are the \nones \n\n[[Page S 14393]]\nwho were saying we ought to balance the budget. I say we should balance \nthe budget. Talk about tax cuts after the budget is balanced. But why \nare they talking about Medicare cuts now? So they can talk about a tax \ncut at the same time. That is the linchpin of all of this.\n  I do not think it adds up. My sense is, yes, I would like everybody \nto pay lower taxes. I would like there to be zero taxes. Of course, we \nhave to have police, we have to have roads, we have to send our kids to \nschool. There are a number of things we do in the public sector that \nare enormously important. Many were in this piece of legislation I just \nvoted against because I thought it took money away from the good \nchoices and gave them to the poorer choices.\n  It seems to me we must be serious about a lot of things if we want to \nreduce the Federal deficit. Therefore, if we are serious--and I am--do \nnot talk about tax cuts until that job is done. Then talk about tax \ncuts.\n  Even more importantly, let us not talk about ravaging a health care \nprogram that has been so successful for senior citizens in this country \nin order to accommodate a tax cut, half of which will go to people with \nincomes over $100,000 a year.\n  Mrs. BOXER. One final question I want to ask of my friend. If we were \nto take that tax cut and put it aside for the moment, and if we were \njust to give the Pentagon what the Pentagon asked for and not more, \nwhich is what the Republican Congress has done, and it adds up to $30 \nbillion-plus more than they asked for, would that not make it possible \nfor us to take care of the Medicare problem and resolve it out 10 years \nso that it is fiscally sound? Would that not make it possible for us \nnot to go to an elderly couple and tell the husband whose wife is in a \nnursing home, ``Sorry, sell your house, sell the car, because we are \ngoing after your assets''? Would it not make it possible for us to take \ncare of those kids in Head Start that you talked about, keep a national \nservice program, meet our obligations to veterans, do the things we \nneed to do to keep our environment safe?\n  Would it not be possible to meet those obligations, balance the \nbudget if we set aside those enormous tax cuts out there which benefit \nthe very wealthiest, and just give the Pentagon what they asked for and \nnot all these billions more that has been thrown at them?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, the Senator from California is correct. This is \nultimately about choices. We choose to do one thing or we choose to do \nanother. We make a choice and decide which of these choices are more \nimportant for the future of the country. That is what this process is \nall about.\n  I am not somebody who believes that one side has all the answers and \nthe other side causes all the problems. I think this country would be a \nlot better off if we got the best of what both parties have to offer, \nrather than end up with the worst of what the two give us. I want to \nsee much more bipartisanship in these decisions.\n  The plain fact is we are dealing with legislation coming to the floor \nwhere choices have already been made, and the choice that has been laid \nbefore us on these appropriations bills is to take 50,000 kids off Head \nStart, deny 100,000 disadvantaged youth summer jobs, and 170,000 \nincapacitated veterans on fewer benefits.\n  My point is, these choices do not seem logical to me in the face of \nother spending choices that were made.\n  Build star wars, build 20 new B-2 bombers. I responded to a column in \nthe newspaper very critical of me for opposing star wars, and I said \nwhen the defense bill came to the floor of the Senate, I said it \nsmelled a little like my mom's kitchen when she used to render lard \nwhen I was a kid. I could hardly walk in the house because when you \nrender lard, it has an awful smell.\n  This defense bill has $7 billion in extra spending. I talked about \nthe trucks that were not asked for, jet planes nobody needed. The hood \nornament on this irresponsibility was blimps. They wanted to buy $60 \nmillion worth of blimps. I have talked about it half a dozen times on \nthe floor, trying to figure out who wants blimps. What are the blimps \nfor?\n  Sixty million dollars is provided for in the defense bill by people \nwho say they are conservative, in order to build lighter-than-air \nairships; translated, that means blimps. Only in Washington would you \nsay lighter-than-air airships--blimps is what they are. I do not know \nwhether they will paint Snoopy on them or paint Goodyear, but somebody \nwants to build $60 million worth of blimps.\n  I think it is pretty hard to look into the face of a 3-year-old or 4-\nyear-old kid who is benefiting by getting a head-start in life, through \na program we know works and works well, and say, ``We are sorry, we \ncannot afford you because we are off buying blimps.'' Lord only knows \nwhat they want to buy blimps for in the defense bill, but there is \nexample after example of that.\n  When you come to the floor and talk about these issues, investing in \nthings that are important, you get letters and calls. I saw a letter \ntoday. A fellow from Houston, TX, wrote and said he heard me on the \nfloor talking about kids. It is true. I talked about a young man from \nNew York City named David Bright. I have never forgotten his testimony. \nHe was 10 years old, from New York City. He lived in a homeless \nshelter. He said, ``No kid like me should have to put his head down on \nhis desk in the afternoon because it hurts to be hungry.'' He was \ntalking about hunger and being homeless and having nothing.\n  The guy from Houston, TX, was writing to me after watching C-SPAN. He \nsaid: ``All you nut cases ought to stop spending money on all this \nliberal stuff.''\n  If we have people out there who decide that kids do not matter, that \nhunger does not matter, that star wars is where it is at in the future, \nin my judgment they are not thinking much about the future of this \ncountry. This country's future is with its kids, with education, with \nopportunity, and a commitment by this Congress to those kids.\n  The only reason I rose to speak was because the Senator from \nCalifornia talked about this piece of legislation. I voted against it \nbecause, frankly, I think it makes the wrong choices.\n  I would like just for a moment to continue discussing Medicare \nbecause that is the subject of some hearings this afternoon that will \noccur in the Senate Finance Committee. It is, I think, one of the \nlargest issues ricocheting around the Congress.\n  I respect the fact there are some who say we want to save Medicare \nwhile others want to kill it. The proposal to cut $270 million from \nwhat is needed to finance Medicare is offered by those who say we are \nthe ones who want to save it. I only observe that at least 95 to 97 \npercent of those who say they want to save Medicare with this very \nlarge cut in funding--95 to 97 percent of them voted against the \nprogram in the first place, at least those in their party did 30 years \nago. It seems unlikely to me that the party that harbors some who think \nMedicare is socialism and really should not continue is going to \npropose a $270 billion cut in order to save it.\n  It is far more likely, it seems to me, that we will save the Medicare \nProgram--and we should save the Medicare Program--by having Republicans \nand Democrats get together and decide that this program makes sense, \nthat this program helps make us a better country.\n  When the Medicare Program was developed, fewer than 50 percent of the \nsenior citizens of this country had any health care coverage at all. \nNow 97 to 99 percent of the senior citizens in America have health care \ncoverage. It is a remarkable success story. Frankly, people are living \nlonger.\n  All of us know that one of the pressures on us, from the Medicare \nfinancing persepctive, is that people live longer and expect more. It \nis not unusual to run into a senior citizen someplace who is in his \nmidseventies and has had heart surgery to unplug all the arteries from \nthe heart that got plugged from eating all this fatty food. They have \nhad cataract surgery, replaced both knees, replaced a hip. So here they \nare, 75 years old, and they have their heart unplugged, they have their \narteries all clear, with blood pumping away in there. They are feeling \ngood. They are walking and running and jogging with good knees and \nhips. They can see like a million bucks because they had cataract \nsurgery.\n  That costs a lot of money. It is the result of remarkable, wonderful, \n\n\n[[Page S 14394]]\nbreathtaking technology. But it is also very expensive. In some ways, \nthat is a sign of success, is it not? Thirty years ago, they would have \nbeen dead; dead, or in a wheelchair, or unable to see. The alternative? \nRemarkable, breathtaking achievements in health care and a Medicare \nProgram that works. Expensive? Yes. Does it need adjustments? Of \ncourse. Should we make them? Yes.\n  But should we take from the Medicare Program substantial moneys so we \ncan give a tax cut to some of the most affluent in the country? The \nanswer, in my judgment, is no. That is not a choice that makes sense. \nThat is not a choice that will strengthen this country or advance our \ninterests.\n  We have about 2 or 3 months left in this session of Congress. The \nagonizing choices that all of us will make about what is important will \nbe made, finally, in these appropriations bills and in the \nreconciliation bill. I come from a town of 300 people. My background is \nfrom a very small, rural community. I have no interest in being \ndogmatic or being an idealogue about one issue or another. But I do \nhave a very significant interest in expressing the passion I have for \nthe choices which I think are good for this country.\n  This country has to get out of its present economic circumstances, \nbalance its budget, and make the right choices with respect to \ninvestments. I have not talked today about trade, but I will at some \npoint in the coming days. We have to solve our trade problem. We are \nsinking in trade debt, and we are getting kicked around international \nmarketplaces. We have to stand up for America's economic interests and \nchange that. All of those things need to be discussed, debated, and \nresolved.\n  A lot of people wring their hands and grit their teeth because we \nhave raucous debates about these things. These debates are good and \nnecessary. I hope we have more and more divergent views brought to the \nfloor of the Senate so we can understand the range of ideas that exist \nand select the best of them. Someone once said when everyone in the \nroom is thinking the same thing, no one is thinking very much.\n  I do not shy from debate. I do not think it is unhealthy. But at the \nend of the debate, let us try to find out what is wrong in this country \nand fix it, and advance the economic interests to give everybody in \nAmerica more opportunity in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14377-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, yesterday, in the New York Times, on page \n1, an article was written by Robert D. Hershey, Jr. I would like to \nextrapolate a few lines from this particular article, not only to bring \nit to the attention of our colleagues in the Senate, but also to bring \nit to the attention of the conferees who are now dealing with certain \nappropriations bills in conference at this time. That particular \nconference is certainly on the Treasury, Postal Service, and general \nGovernment appropriations bill.\n  There is stuck in this appropriation a sum of $13 million. It does \nnot sound like a lot when we start thinking about the billions and \nbillions that we discuss on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but a $13 \nmillion appropriation to initiate a program to utilize private counsel \nlaw firms and debt collection agencies in the collection activities of \nthe Internal Revenue Service, as we know it, the IRS.\n  The first paragraph of Mr. Hershey's article in the New York Times \nyesterday states:\n\n       Congressional Republicans are poised to pass legislation \n     requiring the Internal Revenue Service to turn over some debt \n     collection to commercial interests, thereby giving certain \n     private citizens access to confidential taxpayer information \n     for the first time. . .. The Republican initiative, which \n     would be limited initially to a pilot program, has raised \n     alarms throughout the agency. ``I have grave reservations \n     about starting down the path of using private contractors to \n     contact taxpayers regarding their delinquent tax debts,'' \n     Margaret Milner-Richardson, the Commissioner of the I.R.S., \n     said.\n\n  This was a statement written in a letter signed by Margaret Milner-\nRichardson, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  For the last several years I have been one who has complained, I \nthink fairly substantially and often, about some of the activities, and \nthe heavyhanded activities, of the Internal Revenue Service. But I can \nsay without reservation, this is an issue which Margaret Milner-\nRichardson, the Commissioner of the IRS, and myself, agree on 100 \npercent.\n  On the 12th of September, I, along with Senator Alfonse D'Amato of \nthe State of New York, wrote a letter to the conferees relating to this \nparticular conference, which is now in session. Senator D'Amato and \nmyself stated in the third paragraph, about this particular provision \nthat now exists in the debate between the conferees--we wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       We are writing to express our concern regarding the \n     possibility of inclusion of the House provision in the final \n     bill and respectfully request your assistance to eliminate \n     any provision allowing private bill collectors to collect the \n     debts of the American taxpayer.\n       For over 200 years, when the Federal Government has imposed \n     a tax, it has also assumed the responsibility and the blame \n     for collecting [that tax]. In fact, we have an obligation to \n     ensure that the privacy and the confidentiality of every \n     American taxpayer is protected. Contracting out the tax \n     collection responsibilities of government would be in \n     contradiction of that duty, and would no doubt put the \n     privacy of all American taxpayers in jeopardy.\n\n  Senator D'Amato and myself continue by stating to the conferees:\n\n       While we are very concerned about the impact of the House \n     provision on the rights of American taxpayers in their \n     dealings with these private bill collectors, the Commissioner \n     of the Internal Revenue Service has also raised serious \n     questions about the provision. We, therefore, urge you to be \n     persistent in your efforts to keep such a provision out of \n     the final conference report.\n\n  The article, written in the New York Times yesterday, further States:\n\n       Such concerns are in spite of the bill's requirement that \n     the private debt collectors must comply with the Fair Debt \n     Collection Practices Act and ``safeguard the \n     confidentiality'' of taxpayer data.\n\n   Mr. President, I have seen a lot of ideas in some 17 years in the \nSenate. But I have never seen a worse idea, an idea that was so \nmisdirected, in my 17 years of service, as one that is being proposed \nto become the law of the land.\n  I would like to pose, also--or at least to make an observation. This \nis not a new idea of basically farming out some of our tax collections \nto the private sector. But I would say, in over 200 years of our \nFederal Government, we have never turned over the business of \ncollecting taxes to the private sector. But I must point out, as I did \nin a floor statement on August 4, in the U.S. Senate, that this is a \ndubious practice and it is as old as the hills, and it dates back to at \nleast ancient Greece. This practice of private tax collection even has \na name. It is called, ``tax farming,'' and its modern history is \nchronicled in a book authored by Charles Adams, a noted lawyer and a \nnoted history professor. The book is named, ``For Good And Evil, The \nImpact of Taxes on the Course of Civilization.''\n  In this book, Charles Adams recounts many tales of how the world has \nsuffered under the oppression of tax farmers. He specifically describes \nthe tax farmers sent by the Greek kings to the island of Cos as thugs, \nand even the privacy of a person's home was not secure from them. He \nfurther notes that a respected lady of Cos around 200 B.C. wrote, \n``Every door trembles at the tax farmers.'' In the latter Greek and \n\n[[Page S 14395]]\nRoman world, no social class was hated more than the tax farmer. The \nleading historian of that period described tax farmers with these \nwords.\n\n       The publican keepers of the public house certainly were \n     ruthless tax collectors, and dangerous and unscrupulous \n     rivals in business. They were often dishonest and probably \n     always cruel. Tax farming flourished as a monster of \n     oppression in many forms in Western civilization for over \n     2,500 years, until it finally met its demise after World War \n     I. Tax farming brutalized prerevolutionary France. The French \n     court paid the price during the reign of terror when the \n     people were incensed. They rounded up the tax farmers, \n     tried them in the people's courts and condemned the tax \n     farmers to death. Accounts of this time tell of the \n     taxpayers cheering while the heads of the tax farmers \n     tumbled from the guillotine.\n\n  In the 17th century, Mr. President, under Charles II in England, the \nKing imposed a hearth tax assessing two shillings per chimney for each \nhouse. To collect it, the King did not have civil servants responsible \nto the King to collect from these private families. But he named \nindividual tax collectors. They called them ``chimney men.'' They went \nthroughout England. These chimney men were ruthless, and they were \nhated by the people of England. The hatred of the privately collected \ntax helped depose Charles' brother, James II. And as soon as the new \nmonarchs, William and Mary, were installed, the House of Commons \nabolished the tax ending a bond of slavery upon the whole people that \nallowed every man's house to be entered and searched and at the \npleasure of people unknown to him.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, history has taught us that contracting out \nthe tax collection responsibilities of a democratic government is not a \ngood idea.\n  These are the questions that I would like to respectfully pose to our \ncolleagues from the Senate and the House who now make up the conference \non this particular issue and who are now debating what issues to \ninclude and to exclude. These are the questions that I respectfully \nthink should be asked.\n  Who will these people be?\n  Which debt collection services will be hired?\n  How will they be hired?\n  Who will hire them?\n  Who will train them?\n  Who will oversee them?\n  Which taxpayers' cases will they work on?\n  What arena of confidentiality?\n  What standard, I should say, of confidentiality will be imposed upon \nthese private debt collectors as they search through our private tax \nrecords?\n  What type of taxpayer information will be made available to these tax \ncollectors?\n  How will that information be safeguarded, and how will the security \nand the privacy of these issues be retained?\n  How, Mr. President--and what a key question this is--are these \nprivate bill collectors going to be paid? Will they be paid 25 percent, \n50 percent, and will not this actually amount to a bounty hunter \nsituation that we are creating within the Internal Revenue Service?\n  In 1988, I sponsored, with the help of many of my colleagues, the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights. It was passed into law. One of the provisions \nthat we were proudest of in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights No. 1--and now \nwe hope to expand it this year into the Taxpayer Bill of Rights No. 2--\nin the Taxpayer Bill of Rights No. 1 was a provision that the Internal \nRevenue Service could no longer use quotas in which to promote or \ndemote collection agents within the Internal Revenue Service. We said \nyou have done it in the past but that day is over, and no longer can an \nIRS collection agent have his job or his salary or his position \nbasically based upon how much he is collecting.\n  So, Mr. President, what we have is we may be on the eve of making an \nenormous mistake. It could be a mistake that we could never fix. I am \nvery hopeful that the conferees on the Treasury, Postal, and general \nGovernment appropriations bill will take heed and will realize what \nhistory has to teach us about private tax collectors being hired to \ncollect Federal debt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated \nSeptember 12 sent by Senator D'Amato and myself to Senators Shelby, \nKerrey, and the other conferees be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey: Thank you for \n     accepting our amendment to the Treasury, Postal Service, and \n     General Government Appropriations bill which struck an \n     appropriation of $13 million to initiate a program to utilize \n     private counsel law firms and debt collection agencies in the \n     collection activities of the Internal Revenue Service.\n       A similar provision has been included in the final version \n     of the House Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government \n     Appropriations bill, which, as you know, will be a matter to \n     be considered by House and Senate conferees at conference.\n       We are writing to express our concern regarding the \n     possibility of inclusion of the House provision in the final \n     bill and respectfully request your assistance to eliminate \n     any provision allowing private bill collectors to collect the \n     debts of the American taxpayer.\n       For over 200 years, when the Federal Government has imposed \n     a tax, it has also assumed the responsibility, and the blame, \n     for collecting them.

Contracting out the tax collection \n     responsibilities of government would be in contradiction of \n     that duty, and would, no doubt put the privacy of all \n     American taxpayers in jeopardy.\n       While we are very concerned about the impact of the House \n     provision on the rights of American taxpayers in their \n     dealings with these private bill collectors, the Commissioner \n     of the Internal Revenue Service has also raised serious \n     questions about the provision. We, therefore urge you to be \n     persistent in your efforts to keep such a provision out of \n     the final conference report.\n       If we may assist you in any way, please do not hesitate to \n     call on us or our staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      David Pryor.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article \nwhich I made reference to a few moments ago dated Tuesday, September \n26, in the New York Times written by Mr. Robert D. Hershey, Jr., be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  G.O.P. Wants I.R.S. To Use Outsiders\n\n\n           bill collectors would have access to taxpayer data\n\n                      (By Robert D. Hershey, Jr.)\n\n       Washington, DC, Sept. 25--Congressional Republicans are \n     poised to pass legislation requiring the Internal Revenue \n     Service to turn over some debt collection to commercial \n     interests, thereby giving certain private citizens access to \n     confidential taxpayer information for the first time.\n       The agency's appropriations bill, now stalled in a Senate-\n     House conference over an unrelated issue, would provide $13 \n     million for the I.R.S. to test whether private bill \n     collectors could do a better job than the agency's own \n     employees, even though they would be denied such governmental \n     powers as the ability to seize property.\n       The bill suggests a regional experiment, which would be \n     likely to focus on individual returns, and directs that small \n     collection agencies--perhaps even individual lawyers--be \n     allowed to participate.\n       The Republican initiative, which would be limited initially \n     to a pilot program, has raised alarms throughout the agency. \n     ``I have grave reservations about starting down the path of \n     using private contractors to contact taxpayers regarding \n     their delinquent tax debts,'' Margaret Milner Richardson, the \n     Commissioner of the I.R.S., said.\n       In addition to privacy concerns, Ms. Richardson contends \n     that the use of private collectors could further undermine \n     public perceptions of the fairness of Federal tax \n     administration.\n       But Congressional Republicans, sensing a negative public \n     perception of the agency, are pressing the plan on a number \n     of fronts. They rejected the Clinton Administration's request \n     for an I.R.S. budget increase of nearly 10 percent, to $8.23 \n     billion, deciding instead to cut the I.R.S. budget almost 2 \n     percent.\n       By a widely accepted rule of thumb, additional enforcers \n     bring in five times their salaries. But Republicans, intent \n     on reining in a symbol of big government, do not accept the \n     argument of I.R.S. officials that spending more on the agency \n     would help meet the goal of a balanced Federal budget.\n       Citing findings of the General Accounting Office that \n     I.R.S. collections have slumped about 8 percent since 1990, \n     Republicans led by Representative Jim Lightfoot of Iowa, \n     contend that this reflects the I.R.S.'s ``lengthy and \n     inefficient collection process, which does not incorporate \n     techniques used by the private sector.''\n       Others have contended that a lack of diligence has allowed \n     uncollected debts to swell to more than $150 billion.\n       Farther down the Republican agenda are plans for an even \n     broader assault on the tax agency. ``The I.R.S. was never \n     meant to be such an intrusive, oppressive presence in \n     American life,'' Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, told \n     a Chicago audience recently in proposing a radical \n     simplification \n\n[[Page S 14396]]\n     of the tax law that ``would end the I.R.S. as we know it.''\n       The attack on its budget has already prompted the I.R.S. to \n     decide on a two-month delay in its Taxpayer Compliance \n     Measurement Program under which it had planned, beginning \n     next week, to select about 153,000 tax returns for intensive \n     audits in a periodic effort to gauge sources of cheating and \n     to develop countermeasures. Accurate targeting of enforcement \n     efforts is crucial since routine auditing has slipped well \n     below 1 percent of individual returns.\n       If the agency fails to get a bigger budget than the $7.35 \n     billion now scheduled, the I.R.S. will have to cut its \n     112,000-member staff by the equivalent of 7,000 employees; \n     much of this would be by attrition and shorter hours for \n     seasonal workers, Ms. Richardson said in an interview.\n       ``No sound business person would not spend money to make \n     money,'' she added, charging the Republican budget-cutters \n     with pound-foolish penny-pinching. ``I think you ought to \n     look differently at the side of the house that raises \n     money.''\n       Privatizing the collection of delinquent debt was first \n     proposed in early 1993 by the newly installed Clinton \n     Administration but the idea went nowhere in a Congress then \n     dominated by the President's fellow Democrats. However, many \n     states use private companies to help collect taxes, according \n     to the Federation of Tax Administrators. At least three \n     states--Minnesota, Nevada and South Carolina--already use \n     outsiders to collect money in person. And at least 10 other \n     states hire private agencies to make telephone calls to \n     delinquent taxpayers.\n       Moreover, some states, notably Pennsylvania, use private \n     companies routinely to collect current, as opposed to \n     delinquent, taxes.\n       The I.R.S. does use private companies for finding, say, the \n     addresses of delinquent taxpayers, spending about $5 million \n     a year for such information, but this does not lead to direct \n     contact with taxpayers by outsiders.\n       Frank Keith, an I.R.S. spokesman, said today that the \n     agency had not yet developed any plans to carry out a debt-\n     collection test, including what region might initially be \n     involved.\n       Among those objecting to the idea was Donald C. Alexander, \n     a Washington lawyer who served as I.R.S. commissioner from \n     1973 to 1977.\n       ``Contracting out anything dealing with enforcement is \n     absolutely absurd,'' he said, contending that it was improper \n     for people ``with a stake in the outcome'' to collect the \n     Government's taxes, whether on commission or under a contract \n     they would presumably have an incentive to extend.\n       Such concerns are in spite of the bill's requirement that \n     the private debt collectors must comply with the Fair Debt \n     Collection Practices Act and ``safeguard the \n     confidentiality'' of taxpayer data.\n       Passage of the legislation is being held up because of an \n     impasse over an amendment from Ernest Jim Istook Jr., an \n     Oklahoma Republican, to severely limit lobbying efforts of \n     nonprofit, and therefore tax-exempt, organizations that get \n     Federal grants.\n       The provision in the conference bill that would extend \n     debt-collection authorization to private law firms as well as \n     collection companies is backed by Senator Richard C. Shelby, \n     an Alabama Republican. An aide said the Senator believed that \n     many resources were needed to collect outstanding debt and \n     that privacy concerns ``are overblown by the I.R.S.''\n       Mr. Keith estimated that about half the $150 billion of \n     receivables on the books at the end of the fiscal year 1994 \n     was collectible; the rest has probably been lost because of \n     bankruptcy, death or other reasons.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent \nto me dated August 4 written by Margaret Milner Richardson, the \nCommissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, expressing her strong \nopposition and the Revenue Service's strong opposition to even \nconsidering this practice be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 4, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: I am writing to express my concern \n     regarding statutory language in the FY 1996 Appropriations \n     Committee Bill (H.R. 2020) for Treasury, Postal Service and \n     General Government that would mandate the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) spend $13 million ``to initiate a program to \n     utilize private counsel law firms and debt collection \n     activities . . . ''. I have grave reservations about starting \n     down the path of using private contractors to contact \n     taxpayers regarding their delinquent tax debts without \n     Congress having thorough understanding of the costs, benefits \n     and risks of embarking on such a course.\n       There are some administrative and support functions in the \n     collection activity that do lend themselves to performance by \n     private sector enterprises under contract to the IRS. For \n     example, in FY 1994, the IRS spent nearly $5 million for \n     contracts to acquire addresses and telephone numbers for \n     taxpayers with delinquent accounts. In addition, we are \n     taking many steps to emulate the best collection practices of \n     the private sector to the extent they are compatible with \n     safeguarding taxpayer rights. However, to this point, the IRS \n     has not engaged contractors to make direct contact with \n     taxpayers regarding delinquent taxes as is envisioned in H.R. \n     2020. Before taking this step, I strongly recommend that all \n     parties with an interest obtain solid information on the \n     following key issues;\n       (1) What impact would private debt collectors have on the \n     public's perception of the fairness of tax administration and \n     of the security of the financial information provided to the \n     IRS? A recent survey conducted by Anderson Consulting \n     revealed that 59% of Americans oppose state tax agencies \n     contracting with private companies to administer and collect \n     taxes while only 35% favor such a proposal. In all \n     likelihood, the proportion of those opposed would be even \n     higher for Federal taxes. Addressing potential public \n     misgivings should be a priority concern.\n       (2) How would taxpayers rights be protected and privacy be \n     guaranteed once tax information was released to private debt \n     collectors? Would the financial incentives common to private \n     debt collection (keeping a percentage of the amount \n     collected) result in reduced rights for certain taxpayers \n     whose accounts had been privatized? Using private collectors \n     to contact taxpayers on collection matters would pose unique \n     oversight problems for the IRS to assure that Taxpayers Bill \n     of Rights and privacy rights are protected for all taxpayers. \n     Commingling of tax and non-tax data by contractors is a risk \n     as is the use of tax information for purposes other than \n     intended.\n       (3) Is privatizing collection of tax debt a good business \n     decision for the Federal Government? Private contractors have \n     none of the collection powers the Congress has given to the \n     IRS. Therefore, their success in collection may not yield the \n     same return as a similar amount invested in IRS telephone or \n     field collection activities where the capability to contact \n     taxpayers is linked with the ability to institute liens and \n     levy on property if need be. Currently, the IRS telephone \n     collection efforts yield about $26 collected for every dollar \n     expended. More complex and difficult cases dealt with in the \n     field yield about $10 for every dollar spent.\n       I strongly believe a more extensive dialogue is needed on \n     the matter of contracting out collection activity before the \n     IRS proceeds to implement such a provision. Please let me \n     know if I can provide any additional information that would \n     be of value to you as Congress considers this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Margaret Milner Richardson.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have no further items to submit. I have \nno further statement to make. Therefore, I yield the floor.\n  I thank the President for recognizing me.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14394-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14396-S14401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, inasmuch as the Senate is in morning \nbusiness, I would like to say a few words about the subject of \ninternational trade.\n  I, along with several of my colleagues, today had lunch with Eamonn \nFingleton, the author of a new book called Blind Side, which describes \nin very interesting and provocative terms our trade strategy, our trade \nrelationships with Japan and others.\n  It reminded me again of what is happening this year with respect to \ntrade. Our fiscal policy deficit, the budget deficit this year will be \nsomewhere around $160 billion, we are told. Our merchandise trade \ndeficit, however, will be close to $200 billion, a new record, the \nhighest in the history of this country.\n  When you talk about international trade, the minute you discuss it \npeople begin to yawn. There is rarely thoughtful discussion about trade \npolicy in this Chamber, or in the other body; rarely any thoughtful \nnotion that I can discern in Washington, DC, about what our trade \npolicy ought to be.\n  The minute you start talking about the fact that our current trade \nstrategy is injuring this country, you get turned off. You are tagged \nas some sort of a protectionist, xenophobic stooge. There are two camps \nhere in trade. Either you are a free trader, you have a world view, you \nthink in global terms, or you are some sort of protectionist isolation \nxenophobic. Those are the two descriptions.\n  Let us evaluate that just a bit. What does a trade deficit mean? Why \ncould people care about it? I have a theory about the sour mood about \npolitics in this country these days. I have a theory that people are \nsour in this country because few in this Chamber, not Democrats nor \nRepublicans, are addressing the central core of the issue that affects \nmost families. \n\n[[Page S 14397]]\n\n  Sixty percent of the American families will sit down for supper \ntonight around the table and have their family there and talk about \ntheir circumstances. And 60 percent of the American families will \nunderstand they make less money now in real terms--as adjusted for \ninflation--than they did 20 years ago.\n  Why would that be the case? Why, if everything is going so well in \nthis country, are more than half of the American families suffering \nfrom a loss of income even though they work longer hours than 20 years \nago?\n  At least part of it, in my judgment, is the construct of \ninternational trade. Since the Second World War we had a foreign policy \nand a trade policy that were married. The Second World War left Europe \nand Japan in tatters. War-torn Europe needed to be rebuilt. We did \nthat. We pitched in a significant way and helped rebuild it. Japan was \ndecimated, and we helped to rebuild Japan, too.\n  In the first 25 years of the post-World War II period we could not \nonly help them rebuild but we could largely construct a trade policy in \nwhich we say, ``By the way, ship all your goods here. It is not a \nproblem.'' We were so strong and we were so big that we could compete \nwith one hand tied behind our back. We were the biggest. We were the \nbest. We won, and nobody could out-trade us and nobody could outproduce \nus. We won hands down.\n  All during that 25-year period after the Second World War incomes \nwere on the rise in this country. Our economy expanded and improved. \nAnd so did opportunity and incomes for the American family.\n  Then what happened? Europe became a competitor. The European \ncountries became tough and shrewd competitors. Japan grew up to be a \ntough economic competitor. And we still had the same old trade policy, \na foreign policy masquerading as a trade policy. We still allow the \ncircumstances to exist where we said our market is open to you but it \ndoes not matter that your market is closed to us.\n\n  That is a fine relationship. We do not want to offend them so we just \nkeep doing what we are doing. Meanwhile, corporations, many of which no \nlonger say the Pledge of Allegiance and no longer sing the national \nanthem, but have become international conglomerates responsible only to \nthe stockholders, have decided they would like, under the construct of \nthis trade policy, to decide what is good for them.\n  What is good for them? Well, what is good for them is to produce \nwhere it is cheap. Take your product and find a way to produce it in \nMalaysia, Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and then bring it \nback to the United States to an established marketplace where people \nhave money to spend and sell it in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Fargo, \nand Denver.\n  The problem with that is you disconnect. You move jobs away from \nAmerica, offshore, overseas, so corporations can maximize profits, then \nship the product back into our country. Then what you have is a \nwholesale loss of jobs in America and eventually a loss of income in \nthis country.\n  Manufacturing jobs are on the decrease in this country. Oh, the last \ncouple years we have seen a small increase. After having lost millions \nand millions of manufacturing jobs, we have seen several hundred \nthousand additional jobs over the last few years. That is fine. But it \ndoes not replace the manufacturing base we have consistently lost.\n  We have the folks who keep score down at the Federal Reserve Board \nand elsewhere in the Government. We have economists who are in the \nengine room or the boiler room of this ship of state and they read the \nlittle meters and gauges and dials, and they keep score by saying every \nmonth: Gee, America is really doing well. We are consuming this much; \nwe are consuming that much; we are buying this much.\n  All of it is consumption. All the indices of progress in this country \nare how much did we spend; how much did we consume.\n  These economists and others who sit down there--I have said before \nthey could sit in a concrete bunker. They need not ever see the Sun. \nThey could sit in a concrete bunker and read these little numbers of \ntheirs and give us all this nonsense about how healthy we are because \nof what we spend. It is not what we consume, it is what we produce that \nrepresents the economic base of progress in this country.\n  It is interesting; the economic model, the basis for what economists \ntell us. For instance, when Hurricane Andrew hit Florida and decimated \nthat State, guess what? Their model, of course, does not measure \ndamage. So they said that Hurricane Andrew contributed a one-half of 1 \npercent growth to the gross domestic product of America because all \nthey count is the repairmen who came in and rebuilt the houses, not the \ndamage that destroyed them.\n  Take another example; A car accident outside this building this \nafternoon. Somebody runs into another car. Economists call that \neconomic growth because somebody is going to get to fix the fender.\n  We do not need that sort of nonsense to tell us what is going on in \nthe country. They can talk about consumption until they are blue, these \neconomists. The fact is our country has lost economic strength because \njobs have moved offshore, overseas.\n  What has happened with the balance of trade as a result of all of \nthis going on? Let us take a look at it regionally.\n  First, let us look at Japan. We have a $65 billion trade deficit with \nJapan--$65 billion. That means things are produced in Japan and sold \nhere. Jobs that used to be here are now in Japan. It means income from \nthe American consumer goes to Japan in the form of profits.\n  Is that healthy for our country? Of course not. Should we have this \nkind of trade deficit with Japan? Of course, we should not. Then why do \nwe have it? Because we do not have the will to say to the Japanese: \nLook, if you want to ship your goods to America, God bless you; we want \nour consumers to have the widest range of choices from all goods \nproduced in this world, but we expect something from you in return. You \nmust have your markets wide open to American producers and American \nworkers as well. And if you do not, then you will not find open markets \nhere. We need reciprocal trade policies that say to other countries: \nstraighten up. If you want to access the American marketplace, then \nyour marketplace must be open to America. We insist, literally demand \nfair trade. We demand it. But we have not had the will or the strength \nor the interest to even begin talking in those terms with Japan.\n  It costs $30 a pound to buy T-bone in Tokyo, T-bone steak. The \nJapanese want a lot of it. They would like to buy a lot of it. Why is \nit so expensive? Because they do not have enough beef produced in \nJapan. So will they buy sufficient quantities of American beef? They \nare buying more now because we have a beef agreement with Japan. And \nall those folks who negotiated it almost jumped right out of their \ncowboy boots with the success. They almost thought they should demand a \nmedal because of the successful agreement with Japan.\n  Guess what? When the agreement is finally phased in over the years, \nthere will remain a 50-percent tariff on all American beef going into \nJapan. And we consider that a success because our expectations are so \nlow with respect to what Japan will allow into their marketplace.\n  We ought not consider those things success. We ought to demand of \ncountries like Japan that have such an enormous trade surplus with us \nthat their market must be open to us or we will take action. We ought \nnot accept this one-way trade anymore.\n  What about China? China now has a $30 billion trade surplus with us, \nor we a $30 billion deficit with them. We are a sponge for Chinese \nshoes and shirts and trinkets and goods. They move all their goods to \nAmerica and we are a cash cow for the Chinese, who need hard currency.\n  Now, China needs to buy some airplanes. Guess what? Does China go to \nthe American plane companies, Boeing, for example, and say: By the way, \nwe need to buy some planes from you. No, that is not what they do. They \ngo to Boeing and they say: We are interested in some airplanes, on the \ncondition, of course, that you manufacture those airplanes in China.\n  This country ought to say to China: Wait a second. You do not \nunderstand how this works. You want America to be a sponge for all you \nproduce. Then when you need something that we \n\n[[Page S 14398]]\nhave, you buy it here. That is responsibility. And that is what we \nexpect from you, China.\n  China needs grain. They need more wheat. They are off price shopping \nin Venezuela and Canada when they are running a $30 billion trade \nsurplus with us.\n  It is time for this country to have a little nerve and demand of \nother countries reciprocal trade policies that are fair.\n  Now NAFTA. We had people who had apoplectic seizures over this NAFTA \ndebate in the Senate in recent years. We had economists that were out \nwaving their arms on the steps of the Senate talking about 270,000 new \njobs if we would just construct a new trade agreement with Mexico--\n270,000 new jobs. What is the record?\n  The record is that the year before the free trade agreement with \nMexico was negotiated we had a $2 billion surplus with the country of \nMexico. We had a $2 billion trade surplus the year before the Mexican \nfree trade agreement. This year it will be a $18 billion deficit. I \nwould like to round up all of those disciples of this trade agreement \nsomewhere up near the Capitol and have them explain one by one what has \nhappened.\n  What has happened? We know what has happened. All the jobs are moving \nsouth, two or three plants every single day being approved. They are \nmoving to maquiladora plants over on the Mexican side because that is \nwhere you can get cheap labor; you can still pollute; and you can \nproduce and ship back to America. It is not the kind of goods that we \nwere talking about when NAFTA was developed.\n  You take a look at what is causing our trade deficit with Mexico. It \nis automobiles, automobile parts, electronics; it is high technology \ngoods, good jobs. And that is the problem. If you do not want to get \ntechnical with NAFTA, just travel across the United States-Mexican \nborder and you will find you cannot get a raw potato across the Mexican \nborder. Lord only knows why. You just cannot. Mexico will not allow one \nAmerican raw potato across the border. But guess what? Even as U.S. raw \npotatoes are stopped going south, just watch tons of Mexican french \nfried potatoes going north. I would like to get the folks who \nnegotiated that agreement in this building and ask them why.\n  The devil is always in the details, whether it is potatoes or \nairplanes or beef or cars. But in the aggregate, the question this \ncountry needs to start asking Mexico, Japan, China, and others is: Will \nyou not decide for a change that as a condition of trade, if you expect \nto enter the American marketplace, you will open your markets to \nAmerican goods, American workers, and American producers? If you do \nnot, then this country is going to reconstruct its trade model.\n\n  We as a country do not have to continue down this path. We do not \nhave to believe this corporate baloney that they need to produce in Sri \nLanka to be competitive. We can decide there is an admission price to \nthe American economy, the American marketplace. The admission price is: \nyou have to give a living wage, you cannot pollute the water, and you \ncannot hire 12-year-old kids to work 12 hours a day and work for 12 \ncents an hour. That is not fair trade. And we should not expect the \nAmerican worker or the American corporation to compete against that.\n  You say, ``Well, all that is abstract.'' Well, talk to the people who \ntestified before the Senate who described little kids making carpets, \nwith needles going through the carpet cutting all their fingertips, \ncausing them to miss work. What do you think the carpet-makers would do \nso these children do not miss days of work? They would take the \nfingertips of these 10- and 12-year-old kids, and they would put \ngunpowder on them and set them afire so that they eventually scar these \nfingertips. They do this so that eventually when these little kids who \nare working with needles on carpets it will not hurt because their scar \ntissue is so big it will not hurt. Then they will not lose time and cut \nthemselves on the needles.\n  The products made by those kids come to the American marketplace. We \nare told by economists this is a wonderful thing because it is cheap. \nThe American consumer can buy cheap foreign goods.\n  What about the two girls who testified not so long ago about the \ndesigner-label blouses made in Honduras by kids working 14 hours a day, \nare not permitted to go to the bathroom. Then the blouses are shipped \nto a shop in New York to be sold under a designer label to American \nwomen shopping for blouses.\n  Do you think someone shopping for a blouse in this country should \nexpect to buy the product made by a 12- or 14-year-old kept in a plant \nfor 16, 18 hours, who is paid less than 40 cents an hour, $1 an hour? \nYou think that? I do not think that is fair trade. I do not think we \nought to expect that in this country.\n  I am not suggesting that we build walls around our country and I am \nnot suggesting that we ought to develop a strategy in which we decide \nthe rest of the world does not matter. I am saying this country ought \nnot stand for being kicked around anymore. We are big enough and strong \nenough to insist that the central issue in this country still must be \njobs.\n  When we ask American workers to compete against others, it ought to \nbe fair. They cannot compete and should not compete if they are \ncompeting with 2 or 3 billion people that are willing to earn 20 cents \nor 60 cents an hour and work in unsafe conditions and work 16 hours a \nday. We have got to start caring about keeping jobs in this country.\n  There are dozens of ways to do that. We have a perverse little tax \nincentive in our Tax Code that I have been trying to get changed for \nyears which rewards companies who take their jobs elsewhere, close \ntheir plant in America, move it overseas to a tax haven, make the same \nproduct, and then ship it back to Nashville, TN. And we say, ``Guess \nwhat? We're going to reward you for shutting down your plant. You get a \ntax incentive and you get to defer income tax on the profits you make \nin that plant until repatriation. Just close your American plant, move \noverseas, hire foreigners rather than Americans, and we say, `Hosanna, \nhallelujah. You get a tax break.'\"\n  I mean, if you cannot fix that little thing and take the first step \non the road to saying that creating jobs is important in this country; \nthen, by taking that step saying that the production base is important \nto this country's future, there is not a chance, in my judgment, to \nrespond to the real concerns of Americans.\n  The real concern of American families I think is the opportunity for \nthemselves and their children to have a good job with decent income and \na future of hope and opportunity. It is time--long past the time, in my \njudgment--where Republicans and Democrats should decide together that \nwe need a new strategy.\n  We need a new Bretton Woods conference, a new set of designs on \ninternational finance and international trade relationships that does \nnot represent foreign policy. A strategy that represents some semblance \nof national interests for us in our country, not to the exclusion of \neverything else, but at least to stand up and say what happens in our \ncountry to our jobs and our productive sector matters.\n  I said last week that, you know, next year we are going to have an \nOlympics. And it is going be on American soil this time. You know what \nwill happen? We will put all these young athletes, trim and wonderful \nathletes, in these red, white and blue uniforms. The country will yell \nlike crazy in support of our athletes. I will be among them.\n  I love the Olympics. I want our team to do well. But is it not \ninteresting that we are willing to become so involved in national \ncompetition, in an international event on an athletic field, and we are \nso uninterested, as leaders, in the question of how well we compete in \nthe area of economic growth and jobs?\n  After all, this is a circumstance where there is international \neconomic competition and there are winners and losers. And the winners, \nwhich have been Japan, Germany, and others, will experience a future of \ngrowth, opportunity, and expansion. And the losers, subject to the \nBritish disease, which is long, slow, economic decline stemming from a \nphilosophy that what you consume is a reflection of future economic \nhealth. This is a philosophy rooted, in my judgment, in the most \nconfounding, confusing doctrine that I have ever heard. All the \neconomics I \n\n[[Page S 14399]]\nhave studied--I studied some and taught some economics in college--\ntells me that the source of long-term economic health in this country \nis our production.\n  If you lose a manufacturing base, if you lose your productive sector, \nif you lose your ability to produce real things, you will not long be a \nworld economic power. You will not long dominate in world commerce. And \nthat is why it is not too late for this country to decide it is time \nfor a new national economic strategy, not one of protectionism.\n  Although if you want to use the word ``protection'' in a pejorative \nway, I am not so interested in the typical debate. However, if you want \nto use the word ``protection'' to mean protecting the economic \ninterests of this country, count me in, because that is one of the \nreasons I am here. But we have to define some new economic strategy \nthat tries to preserve our manufacturing base and tries to decide that \nour marketplace and our manufacturing base are important national \nassets. Assets that represent the opportunity for expansion and hope \nfor the American family.\n  The course we are on, the path that led to the largest trade deficits \nin history, a wholesale loss of American jobs overseas, is a \ndestructive course, one that is wrong for our country. And I think it \nis part of the undercurrent of all the angst out there in the country \nwith families knowing this is not working. This is a model that might \nmake international corporations wealthy but people who do not have jobs \nare poor. It means a future of less opportunity for them. That is what \nI think is at work in this country. I know it is not quite as simple as \nall of that, but that, I think, plays a major role.\n  You know something? All the things we do in this Chamber, over all of \nthese months, all ignore that central fact. There has not been, in my \njudgment, one day of thoughtful, interesting debate about the central \neconomic tenant of our times, and that is the issue of what the global \neconomy means to the future of America, to the future of American \nfamilies and American workers.\n  Mr. President, there are some who will say that I am truly a broken \nrecord, and that is fine with me because I want to continue to repeat \nmonth after month what I think is one of the most serious problems we \nface in this country. And, along with recommendations, I want to be \nsure that we finally debate and we finally come to grips with the need \nfor a new economic national strategy that moves our country forward. I \nwant a strategy that gives our country an opportunity to win once \nagain.\n  Mr. President, having spoken for the full 10 minutes in morning \nbusiness, I now yield back the entire balance of my time.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is in order.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of S. 1278 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Howard Schroeder first encountered southern \nDelaware during his Army service in World War II. His job was to \nprotect the coast, which he did by applying his military training and \nmuscle to help lay mines in the bay, and by applying his artist's eye \nand talent to help record the landscape of the area.\n  Some of those first Schroeder landscapes remain on display today in \nthe Lewes, DE, public library and middle school, testaments to a love \naffair that lasted a lifetime.\n  Even beyond a lifetime--when he died at his Lewes home on Friday, \nSeptember 8, at the age of 84, Howard's family announced that, in \naccordance with his wishes, his ashes would be scattered over the sand \ndunes and in the water at nearby Cape Henlopen State Park.\n  The people of my State take great comfort in knowing that Howard \nSchroeder is still guarding our coast, not only in the resting place he \nchose but in the legacy of his love for the beaches, the small towns, \nthe fishing boats, the marshes, the old buildings, the people--\neverything that is the beauty and heart of Delaware's coastline.\n  It is a recorded legacy of work, literally thousands of sketches and \npaintings that, as one Delaware reporter wrote, ``virtually define our \nmental image'' of parts of our State. Howard said that he was always \n``looking for the unspoiled,'' and he was able to find it, and to share \nit, not because he knew where to look but because he knew how to look.\n  It is a living legacy of teaching, because Howard Schroeder was, \nalways, inspired to inspire others. He taught at the St. Andrew's \nSchool, at the Rehoboth Art League, which he had served as president, \nand in workshops that he founded in towns through Kent and Sussex \nCounties. He started the Artists' Sketch Group to help local artists \nbring out the best in each other, and he was a founding member of the \nSussex County Arts Council.\n  He was, as his friend and fellow artist Jack Lewis wrote, ``a \nchampion for the arts,'' and his drive to teach wherever there was \nsomeone willing to learn has left a permanent and deep imprint on the \nartistic community in and well beyond Delaware.\n  Howard Schroeder's personal legacy is rich in family and friends. His \nwife, Marian, was his partner in every way, including the years she and \nHoward sold his work at their Rehoboth Beach art supply and gift store. \nTogether, they raised six children, at a time when it was, as Jack \nLewis said, ``unheard of'' to make a family living on an artist's \nearnings. Marian and Howard succeeded in doing the unheard of.\n  Their son John, a Delaware State legislator, published a biography of \nhis father, and remembers Howard as working until late at night in his \nstudio but always making time for his children. Daughter Carole \nmemorialized her father in a poem, in which she wrote:\n\n     ``You showed me the beauty of life\n     Through your music and your art\n     Through history and words of prose\n     But mostly, by living it.''\n\n  Howard shared his life's lessons also with sons Stephen, Howard, and \nRobert and daughter Gail, with their families, and with countless \nfortunate friends and admirers.\n  Mr. President, Howard Schroeder worked all over the world, he was \nprofiled on national television, he was raised in the Bronx and in \nnorthern New Jersey. But he chose Delaware, and we remember him, \ngratefully, as a Delaware State treasure, a treasure that we were proud \nto share in his lifetime and that I am proud to share, and to honor, in \nthe Senate today.\n  Howard Schroeder was a neighbor with a special gift to see, and to \nteach us to see, the unspoiled in our own backyard. By his vision and \nhis talent, and by the sincerity of his love, he led us to the best in \nourselves, which may well be the greatest accomplishment and \ncontribution of all.\n\n\n                          ON THE NEW $100 BILL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Treasury Department is unveiling \na newly designed 1996 series $100 bill that incorporates many state-of-\nthe-art anticounterfeiting features. I commend Secretary Rubin and the \nTreasury Department. Today's unveiling at the Treasury Department \nstarts the process of reassuring the public, both here and abroad, of \nthe abiding strength and integrity of our currency. That process will \ncontinue through next year when the new $100 bills in the 1996 series \nare circulated for the first time.\n  This country faces a serious challenge from new technologies that \nenable counterfeiters to turn out excellent reproductions. \nUnfortunately, U.S. currency has been among the most susceptible to \ncounterfeiting in the world. Although updated in 1990 with a deterrent \nsecurity strip, our bills have not had the watermarks or sophisticated \ndying and engraving techniques that other countries use to defeat \ncounterfeiters. \n\n[[Page S 14400]]\n\n  In the past two Congresses, I have introduced, with Senator John \nKerry, legislation to address the growing problem of hi-tech \ncounterfeiting. I am delighted that the Treasury has adopted many of \nthe features we have been recommending.\n  According to the Secret Service, which has from its inception been \ncombatting counterfeiting, the counterfeiting of U.S. currency has \nincreased dramatically in recent years. Over the past 5 years, the \nSecret Service seized an average of $58 million annually within the \nUnited States. But in the first 4 months of 1995, alone, the Service \nseized more than $50 million in counterfeit U.S. currency. Likewise, \nseizure of counterfeit U.S. currency overseas has increased fourfold to \n$120.7 million in 1993 and $137.7 million in 1994.\n  I know from personal experience the impact that counterfeiting has \nhad on acceptance of our currency abroad. Over the summer, I took a \ntrip with my family to Ireland. I carried with me a few $100 bills just \nin case some places did not accept travelers' checks. To my surprise, I \nfound more places that refused to accept my $100 bills. Let there be no \ndoubt, counterfeiters undermine confidence in our currency.\n  Senator Kerry and I first introduced our legislation in May 1994, to \nstop counterfeiters from using fake American currency as a free meal \nticket. Our bill would have required the Secretary of the Treasury to \ndesign a new $100 bill that incorporates some of the counterfeit-\nresistant features, such as watermarks, multicolored dyes, and \nsophisticated engraving techniques.\n  We were encouraged last summer when then-Treasury Secretary Bentsen \nannounced plans for modernizing U.S. currency with new deterrence \nfeatures. The results of that modernization effort are reflected in the \nnewly-designed 1996 series $100 bill.\n  I examined one of these new bills earlier this week. To defeat hi-\ntech counterfeiting technology, this bill has a watermark, and color-\nshifting ink, new microprinting that requires a magnifying glass to \nsee, and concentric, fine-line moire patterns that are difficult to \ncopy.\n  I congratulate Secretary Rubin and the Treasury Department for \nputting this country in a better position to combat counterfeiting and \nprotect our currency. I commend the National Academy of Sciences and \nthe Secret Service for their efforts in connection with this project \nand thank the talented engravers, printers, and technicians who are \nbringing these changes to fruition.\n  I also want to highlight a related development: the establishment of \nthe Securities Technology Institute, a research facility with the Johns \nHopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, to assess emerging technology and \nevaluate features and additional protections for currency and other \nsecurity documents.\n  This is the most significant redesign of our currency in the last 70 \nyears, since the ``Big Bill'' was replaced by the ``Small William'' in \n1929. We have come a long way from the time when people could only tell \na good Continental Congress note by the misspelling of Philadelphia. On \nthe new $100 bill, the portrait of Benjamin Franklin, the father of \npaper currency in this country, and the familiar sight of Independence \nHall remain. But they are now joined by a number of improved security \nfeatures.\n  I am delighted that this day has come and look forward to working \nwith Secretary Rubin to serve our mutual goals of deterring currency \ncounterfeiting and increasing confidence in our currency and our \neconomy in Vermont, across the country, and around the world.\n\n                           REMINDERS OF HOME\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \npeople of my beloved home State of South Dakota. The daily grind of \nlife inside the beltway leaves me searching constantly for reminders of \nthe sights, the sounds, and the citizens of the State I love. I always \nenjoy those moments when South Dakotans from back home visit my \nWashington, DC, office. I also look forward to the times when I can \nreturn to the people and the places I hold dear.\n  As my colleagues know well, without the constant input I receive from \nthe folks back home, we could not do our jobs effectively here in \nCongress. I am very fortunate that my fellow South Dakotans keep me in \nfrequent touch with the issues of concern to them. I also enjoy the \nmany letters from, and conversations with, South Dakotans regarding the \ndiverse beauty of our home--the rolling fields of grain, the endless \nprairie, the majestic Black Hills, the sunsets against a backdrop sky \nof pink, orange, and purple hues, and the wide Missouri River.\n  These daily visits and the calls and letters from South Dakotans mean \na great deal to me. I cherish my home. I cherish the people of my \nState. Every day, through them, I feel a renewed pride in being South \nDakota's U.S. Senator. Every day, through them, I am proud to be a \nSouth Dakotan.\n  Mr. President, recently an article by Robert Pore appeared in the \nHuron, SD, Plainsman newspaper, describing many of the issues that are \npertinent to the people of South Dakota. I would like to share these \nconcerns and ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               The Mall Reminds Pressler of South Dakota\n\n                            (By Robert Pore)\n\n       Washington.--Every morning Sen. Larry Pressler starts his \n     day with a jog along The Mall in Washington.\n       The shrines, monuments and museums alongside The Mall from \n     the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial seem a million miles away \n     from the prairies of South Dakota.\n       But with a little imagination, as Pressler runs by the \n     grass and trees that line The Mall, he imagines his home \n     state and the people he represents who give meaning to his \n     job.\n       ``It makes me feel like I'm in South Dakota,'' Pressler \n     said during an interview Wednesday in his office in the \n     Russell Building. ``It gives me a little time alone.''\n       But along with running, Pressler seeks another form of \n     strength to cope with the rigors and demands of life in the \n     nation's capital.\n       ``I belong to a weekly Senate prayer group that gets \n     together to collect our thoughts and exchange ideas on the \n     problems and promises we experience in life,'' he said.\n       Pressler lives a couple of blocks from his Senate office, \n     which is located across the street from the Capitol. He said \n     work sometimes seems to be never ending, especially as he has \n     taken on the pressure of heading the Senate Commerce \n     Committee.\n       But he makes a point to go home every night he can to have \n     dinner with his wife.\n       ``It gives me a little time away from the Capitol,'' \n     Pressler said.\n       Because Pressler holds a position of power as a committee \n     chairman and he is from a rural state, he understands that \n     the insults and jokes about him are part of the political \n     game. But at times they are personal and they hurt.\n       Recent newspaper ads indicating Pressler needs to change \n     his opinion on Medicaid because it hurts people with \n     Alzheimer's disease went too far, he has said.\n       ``My father died of Alzheimer's disease, so I know first \n     hand the tragedy of an illness in a family,'' he said.\n       After serving South Dakota for more than 20 years in both \n     the House and Senate, Pressler always looks forward to going \n     home.\n       ``We have an acreage back in Hot Springs where we hope to \n     build a vacation home,'' he said. ``We are pricing logs right \n     now, which are pretty expensive. We also have a farm near \n     Humboldt.''\n       When he's not meeting with his constituents or spending \n     time with his family and friends in South Dakota, Pressler \n     also likes to ride his Harley-Davidson motorcycle or his old \n     Model D John Deere tractor, especially in small-town parades.\n       On his Senate office desk, Pressler has a model of his John \n     Deere tractor as a little reminder of home.\n       ``I get a little fun from that,'' he said with a smile.\n       What also brings a smile to Pressler's face is when he \n     meets with South Dakotans who have made their way to \n     Washington, either to vacation or to voice their concerns \n     about an important issue.\n       ``It means a lot to me,'' he said. ``They are helping me do \n     my job. Whether they talk to me, my staff or another senator, \n     their presence helps our cause.''\n       This week, Pressler visited with South Dakota farmers and \n     ranchers in Washington as part of the National Farmers Union \n     fly-in.\n       ``Agriculture is a big industry, but it is getting smaller \n     in numbers'' he said. ``A lot of farmers have given up. \n     Therefore, it is important that they come here and see how \n     the federal government works.''\n       Pressler's concern about the people who make up South \n     Dakota's No. 1 industry has deep roots going back to his \n     youth on a small family farm near Humboldt.\n       ``We have to be very careful to protect our smaller family \n     farms,'' he said. ``Growing up on a family farm, I showed \n     livestock in 4-H and at the State Fair. I consider myself a \n     farmer. I'm interested in the welfare of our family farmers \n     and ranchers.''\n\n[[Page S 14401]]\n\n       Pressler said instead of rushing through legislation that \n     he feels would be a detriment of the state's family farming \n     heritage, he would rather see a continuing resolution that \n     will extend the 1990 Farm Bill for another year if there's an \n     impasse on farm bill legislation.\n       ``Farm bills are always late because they are so \n     controversial and they require so much work,'' he said, \n     ``this year in particular because of the severe budgetary \n     crisis we are in.\n       ``We have producers in South Dakota who are not in the farm \n     program, such as many of our cow-calf operators. We have to \n     think about them in terms of international trade and exports. \n     But we also have to think about the impact the huge deficit \n     has on farmers. If the deficit stays as high as it is, it \n     will mean higher interest rates.''\n       ``While balancing the budget is a top priority for \n     Pressler, he doesn't want the numbers game to take priority \n     over the people he represents.\n       ``I come from a family farm and I have seen how farm \n     families struggle on the land,'' he said. ``We have to be \n     very careful, but on the other hand we have to be honest with \n     people. There's a lot of stuff floating around this year from \n     the inside-the-Beltway bureaucrats. Every time we have asked \n     the bureaucrats to reorganize they have threatened to close \n     some local offices or take away some local services.''\n       Pressler said the new farm bill must help producers make a \n     decent living and allow them flexibility about what and where \n     they can plant without all the hassle of government rules and \n     regulations.\n       But he said the most important thing lawmakers can do when \n     writing the farm bill is to provide a framework that assists \n     beginning farmers and provides opportunities for the next \n     generation of South Dakota agricultural producers.\n       During the 20 years Pressler has been in Washington, the \n     number of farms in South Dakota has dropped from 43,000 to \n     33,000 this year.\n       ``When I was in 4-H there was a lot of young farmers who \n     went into farming and that was their dream,'' he said. ``But \n     nowadays many of the young 4-H'ers I talk to don't go into \n     farming or ranching. They go out of state in many cases to \n     take jobs.''\n       He said technological changes are a big factor, making it \n     more expensive to get started in farming. But he said young \n     people also don't have the opportunity to borrow the seed \n     money they need.\n       ``We have to be constantly tailoring some of these loan \n     programs for young farmers, change the estate tax law (which \n     I'm trying to do as a member of the Senate Finance Committee) \n     and income averaging for farmers, so young producers can get \n     started,'' Pressler said.\n       Getting the message about the needs of South Dakota farmers \n     across to his colleagues is hard, especially when farmers \n     only make up about 2 percent of the nation's population of \n     700,000 plus is a mere drop in the bucket to the country's \n     260 million people.\n       ``It is very, very hard because people don't want to listen \n     sometimes,'' Pressler said. ``They think that our farmers are \n     doing OK and they read about the subsidies they receive. \n     There's a lot of disinformation out there that really makes \n     my job a challenge.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14396-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THANKS TO THE STAFF\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Thursday, the Senate passed the fiscal \nyear 1996 foreign operations bill. The vote was 91 to 9. That is the \nlargest number of Senators to vote for a foreign aid appropriations \nbill that I can recall. I want to congratulate Senator McConnell for \nhis efforts in getting the bill done, and for the overwhelming \nbipartisan vote. I think it shows that despite assertions to the \ncontrary, the Senate and the American people do support foreign aid.\n  I also want to thank a number of other people who contributed greatly \nto putting this bill together, and getting it passed.\n  In the Congress, the majority clerk of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, Jim Bond, was indispensable. Jim has been around here a \nlong time, and has gained the unqualified respect of both sides of the \naisle. Senator Hatfield could not have a more competent and dedicated \nadviser to the subcommittee. Jim was very ably assisted by Juanita \nRilling, who has also gained an expertise in the foreign assistance \nprograms.\n  On Senator McConnell's personal staff, Robin Cleveland was \ninstrumental in preparing the fiscal year 1996 bill, and in finding \ncommon ground with my staff in developing a product that Senator \nMcConnell and I could support and defend. Robin did a superb job in her \nfirst year as the subcommittee chairman's principal adviser on a wide \nrange of foreign aid issues. Robin also had the very able and tireless \nassistance of Billy Piper.\n  On my side, Tim Rieser, who was a member of the subcommittee staff \nduring my 6 years as chairman, gave me fine assistance throughout. Dick \nD'Amato, a member of the committee staff, expertly handled several \nimportant and difficult issues, including the compromise that was \nreached on the language concerning Korea and several amendments on the \nformer Yugoslavia. I want to thank him and Senator Byrd for his \ncontribution.\n  Janice O'Connell and Diana Olbaum of the Foreign Relations Committee \nstaff helped resolve several difficult issues. Pam Norick on Senator \nMurray's staff and Robin Lieberman on Senator Feingold's staff were \nvery helpful in preparing for the contentious debate on international \nfamily planning.\n  There are many people in the administration who deserve mention. \nWhile I cannot name them all, I do want to recognize Wendy Sherman, the \nAssistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the State Department. \nWendy has been a tireless advocate for the Secretary, and for the \nAmerican people. Her deputy, Will Davis, was an indispensable link \nbetween me and my staff, and the State Department. Will's good natured \nmanner and willingness to search for the answer to any question we had \nwas greatly appreciated.\n\n  At the Agency for International Development, Jill Buckley, Assistant \nAdministrator for Legislative and Public Affairs, with the assistance \nof Bob Boyer and Marianne O'Sullivan, and so many other people, made it \npossible for us to manage with a very difficult budget situation. I \nalso want to single out Bob Lester, whose extraordinary knowledge of \nthe Foreign Assistance Act prevented us from making any egregious \ndrafting errors. Without Bob, I hate to think what kind of laws we \nwould pass.\n  At the Treasury Department, Robert Baker and Victor Rojas did their \nbest to convince a skeptical Congress of the importance of maintaining \nU.S. leadership in the international financial institutions.\n  At the Defense Security Assistance Agency, Michael Friend and Vanessa \nMurray were always ready to help.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that I have left out people I should not \nhave. For that I apologize. let me simply conclude by saying that I \nhave greatly appreciated the help of all these dedicated people in \ngetting the foreign operations bill through the Senate. I often wish \nthat critics of the Federal Government would come to Washington and see \nwhat people like those I have mentioned do every day. They would see \nthat they are exceptionally intelligent, committed people who work \nextremely long hours at a fraction of the pay many of them could earn \nin the private sector. They deserve our respect, and our thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14401-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14401-S14402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PASSING OF CHRISTOPHER VAUGHN\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nremember Christopher Vaughn. A good man died on Sunday and he will be \nmissed by his friends, family, and loved ones. Christopher Vaughn was a \njoyful, fun loving, and giving person. Every time I had the chance to \nbe around him I felt lucky. I enjoyed our conversations and remember \nthe laughter and smiles that always accompanied those occasions.\n  Christopher Vaughn was an incredible talent. He was a scholar in \nRenaissance history, and he had a natural flair for the world of \nentertainment. It is a great thing for a person to use a natural \nability to its fullest, and that is what he did.\n  Chris began his career writing scholarly papers in Spain and then \nturned his literary skills to the entertainment industry when he joined \nthe Hollywood Reporter in 1987. It is clear why he was such a success. \nHe was smart, witty, and eloquent. His promotion to managing editor of \nspecial issues was a surprise to no one, I am sure. Working at \nNickelodeon as the director of talent relations, he brought great \ntalent to the network.\n  His work at Dolores Robinson Entertainment certainly paved the way. \nHe and Delores were the team who adopted me in the early days of my \neffort to be elected to the U.S. Senate. Of course, it was Chris who \nattended to the details. He understood that history is written from the \ndetails, and that each person can make a difference in the way that \nchallenges are resolved. Perhaps it was his appreciation for history \nthat made \n\n[[Page S 14402]]\nhim such an advocate for my election, but I like to think it was more \nhis vision for the future which so inspired him.\n  While his resume is impressive, it is the goodness of the man I will \nremember. His name was not in the headlines every day, but he touched \nthe lives of everyone he met. He was a man who did much to leave this \nworld a better place than he found it. The entertainment world will \nmiss him, his family will miss him, and together with all of his other \nfriends, I will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14401-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on the memorable evening in 1972 when I was \nfirst elected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I would \nnever fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who \nwanted to see me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the enormity of the Federal \ndebt that Congress has run up for the coming generations to pay.\n  The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the \nU.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that \nhas not been authorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate \nof the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Tuesday, \nSeptember 26, stood at $4,953,250,764,121.84 or $18,802.63 for every \nman, woman, and child in America on a per capita basis.\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY.

Mr. President, this morning, myself, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Nunn stood with an organization called \nthe Progressive Policy Institute to embrace some recommendations, an \noutline of recommendations they made to reform both the Medicare \nProgram--a $170 billion program that is funded with the combination of \na 2.9-percent payroll tax and a health insurance premium paid for by 37 \nmillion beneficiaries over the age of 65 with $46 or so a month, that \nfunds about 30 percent of the part B, the doctor's payment, as well as \n$80 billion program for Medicaid.\n  These are the most rapidly growing items in the budget. They are not \nthe most, but in terms of total dollars, this $250 billion collective \nprogram has gotten quite expensive. It has tormented a lot of Members \nwho have been trying to figure out what to do to control the growth, in \nparticular, of entitlements.\n  Last year, Senator Danforth, a former Senator from Missouri, and I \nmade some recommendations about what should be done to reform \nentitlements. The purpose of our recommendation was to say to Americans \nthat we should agree that no more than a certain percentage of our \nbudget would go to entitlements, plus net interest.\n  Looking at the future, given the current trend lines particularly \nwith the enormous demographic problem, mostly demographic not political \nproblem, of 60 million baby boomers starting to retire in 2008, look at \nthat problem and the cost of our entitlements not too long after the \nyear 2008--all of our budget will be consumed by entitlement spending.\n  When I say all, there are not very many things in Washington, DC, \nthat have stayed constant over the years. One that has stayed constant, \nexcept for two periods in this century, World War II and for a period \nduring the Vietnam war, the percent that has been withdrawn from the \neconomy to fund Federal programs, approximately 19 percent, about how \nmuch we withdraw from the economy, a fifth of the U.S. economy is used \nto fund Federal programs. That really has not changed except for two \nwartime situations.\n  It is likely that indicates that is about what Americans think we \nought to be withdrawing from the U.S. economy for the Federal \nGovernment. There may be some that would argue we ought to do more, not \nvery many; and maybe some would argue we should do dramatically less. \nProbably it means we will spend about 19 percent.\n  If that is the constant, Mr. President, it is very alarming to see \nthe growth of entitlements in net interest because as it grows it \ndecreases the amount of money available to defend our country, to keep \nour cities safe, educate our children, to build our roads, our sewers, \nour water system, space exploration--all those sorts of things.\n  This year's budget, 67 percent of our budget goes to entitlements and \nnet interest, and in the year 2002 at the end of the 7-year budget \nresolution that we are operating under, it will be 75 percent--an 8 \npoint increase in a span of 7 years. That is a lot of money, about $135 \nbillion or $140 billion increase in entitlements, if you do it in a \nsingle year.\n  As I said, Mr. President, that trend really rapidly accelerates when \nthe baby boomers retire some 6 years later. The entitlement commission \ntried to say to Americans, ``Let's make changes in our programs sooner \nrather than later.'' The sooner we do them the bigger the future impact \nand the more time we can give beneficiaries or recipients, in the case \nof Medicaid, with time to plan.\n  They can begin to adjust their own thinking about planning. If you \nhave to adjust the eligibility age, which we recommended over a period \nof time; or if you have to phase in some change in premium payments, or \nwhatever. Give people time to plan. It is more likely they can adjust.\n  There are tough recommendations, Mr. President. Contained inside of \nthe recommendations was another presumption which is that we are seeing \nthe marketplace work. It is a relatively recent change in health care.\n  When we debated health care 4 years ago, the facts as presented to \nthe American people would cause you to believe that actually the \nGovernment was doing a better job of controlling costs than the private \nsector. Private sector costs exceeded the public side.\n  Today not only is that reversed, but strikingly so. We are seeing in \nsome parts of the country where a high percentage of managed care, even \nsome declines in overall cost of health care, where the public sector \ncontinues to grow in double digits.\n  That sort of frames a little bit, in a preliminary fashion, why I was \npleased with the Progressive Policy Institute's proposal. It does \npropose to address the problem of growing entitlements, and it does \npropose to take advantage of the changes that are occurring in the \nmarketplace, to restructure Medicare and Medicaid to take advantage of \nthe changes that are occurring.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, one of the things I do when I am at home \nand talking about the current debate about Medicare and Medicaid is to \nsay I am pleased that Republicans are trying to preserve and protect \nthe program. Many Republicans were not, as you know. Some Republicans \nwere opposed to this over the years. Now what we have appears to be \nalmost unanimous--Republicans saying not only do we think Medicare is a \ngood idea, we want to preserve Medicare for our children and for our \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, let me point out that underneath the program is a \npresumption, an assumption that we have to believe before the program \nitself can stand, before we can reach the conclusion that we want to \npreserve and protect it. That assumption is this: No matter what we do \nwith the marketplace, no matter what happens with our economy, there is \napt to be some Americans that will not be able to afford to buy health \ninsurance, for whatever the reason. They may be disabled. In this case \nwith Medicare it is the elderly. Say they are over 65 and likely \n\n[[Page S 14403]]\nnot to be working. Their health costs have gone up. They are in a \nhigher-risk population. It costs more. They are not working any longer. \nThus, design a program to help them purchase insurance.\n  I point that out, Mr. President, because it basically means \nRepublicans and Democrats have agreed that there is a role for \nGovernment to help Americans who cannot purchase, who cannot afford to \npurchase health insurance. We have agreed on that.\n  In this case a rather expensive Government role--$170 billion for \nMedicare and $80 billion for the Medicaid program.\n  The proposal that the Progressive Policy Institute put forward this \nmorning, and I am here this afternoon to talk about it at great length, \ndoes not view Medicare as a source of money to fund deficit reduction \nalthough I believe we have to look because of the cost of the program \nto Medicare for deficit reduction.\n  It says, instead, that we need to transform the Medicare program from \nwhat is essentially a very maternalistic program into an instrument for \nempowering citizens to solve common problems. A rather simple but very \nimportant change in the policy.\n  Medicare today is run by the Federal Government, does not take much \nadvantage of what is going on out in the market, does not take much \nadvantage of competitive forces. It is much more of a maternalistic--we \nwill figure out what is good for you and tell you how the program is \noperated.\n  Their proposal, which I like very, very much, says we should move in \nthe direction of empowering Americans to make more of their own \ndecisions about this problem of acquiring health care and making health \ncare decisions.\n  Second, those of us who have spent a great deal of time with \nentitlements and who have long ago reached the conclusion that Medicare \nis a good program that deserves our support, know health care \nentitlements are very archaic. They no longer fit inside the context of \nwhat we see going on in the private sector. They are governed by \narbitrary political and budget goals. They are managed by command and \ncontrol regulation. And, very often, they tend to reproduce \ninefficiencies in other sectors of the health care system.\n  Third, and very important, if you buy into this idea the Republicans \nand Democrats now agree, since I believe most if not all Republicans \nnow say we should preserve and protect Medicare--that is what I am \nhearing, at least, from Speaker Gingrich and others--if that is the \ncase, underneath that is a presumption that we have Americans out there \nwho cannot afford to buy.\n  What we ought to be trying to do is fashion the program so those who \ncannot afford have the means to make the purchase and those who can are \nrequired to make the purchase on their own. It seems to me Medicare and \nMedicaid, as they are currently constituted, are an obstacle. I \nemphasize this. They have become an obstacle to getting to the point \nwhere every single American, just because he or she is an American, \nknows with certainty that they are covered and they are going to be \nrequired to pay according to their capacity to pay. But they do not \ndoubt, whether they are 65 or 25 or 55; they ought not doubt.\n  We spend $400 billion a year, direct and indirect--either direct with \ntax expenditures or indirectly with tax subsidies--on health care at \nthe Federal level every single year. That is plenty to get everybody \ncovered.\n  The way the current programs are designed, they are a structural \nbarrier, a fiscal barrier, and need I say, it ought to be obvious from \nthe current debate, a political barrier to getting ourselves to the \npoint where all Americans know with certainty they are covered, know \nwith certainty they have a responsibility to pay, have the information \nupon which they can make decisions about quality, about price.\n  One of the most powerful bumper stickers we had in the health care \ndebate is true, which was, ``If you think health care is expensive now, \nwait until health care is free.''\n  In short, Americans need to understand that there is a cost attached \nto demands. The current system, I believe, the way we have Medicare \nstructured and the way Medicaid is structured and the way the VA is \nstructured and the way our income tax system is structured, provides a \nbarrier, really, as I said, a political, a structural, as well as a \nfiscal barrier to getting us where I think most of us want to go, which \nis every American knows with certainty they are covered, knows that \nthey have responsibilities in the system, knows clearly what those \nresponsibilities are, and knows not to ask for more than what is, in \nfact, reasonable.\n  There are flaws in the Republican proposal. I will mention them \nbriefly. I do not want to dwell too long on them here because I am \nreally not trying this afternoon to attack the Republican proposal. \nMore, I am trying to see if it is possible to reach some consensus with \nRepublicans who indeed want to reform this system; to make sure, when \nwe take action that might be politically difficult, that we have an \nexciting and constructive improvement in the system.\n  I believe the proposal ignores the baby-boom generation. I have \nmentioned it before. This solution takes us out to 2002, maybe 2005. We \nhave not seen anything yet when the demographics of the baby-boom \ngeneration becomes apparent to us. We are, I think, going to be very \nsorry we did not take action sooner rather than later. It, in many \nways, continues the status quo. It does provide people with more choice \nin the private sector, but not in the kind of vigorous competitive \nenvironment that we need if we expect to see the forces of the \nmarketplace work the kind of, really, miracles that we have seen in the \nprivate sector. In other words, it tends to privatize but does not \nprovide a competitive environment.\n  The proposal we presented this morning, over the next 5 years does \nfour things that are very important. It does not get everything done \nover the next 5 years, but it does four things that are terribly \nimportant.\n  No. 1, it privatizes insurance for Medicare beneficiaries. We say the \nFederal Government ought to do a much more limited number of things \nthan they are doing today. It ought to make certain we have a market. \nIt ought to make certain Medicare can use its tremendous purchasing \npower to get cost savings from the private sector. There are lots of \nthings that Medicare can do, but it ought not try to micromanage the \nhealth care environment.\n  So that is Medicare. We ought to privatize it and move it in the \ndirection of becoming a privatized insurance for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In the area of Medicare, we need not only to cap the \nindividual amount for acute care, but we also need to deregulate the \nStates so they can continue to use the market at the State level, to \ncontinue to use the private sector to produce the kind of cost savings \nthat the private sector has produced in the last 2, 3, 4 years.\n  So capping the Medicaid entitlement, the individual entitlement is \ncritical. But deregulating the States for that acute care is equally \ncritical so they can begin to fashion programs.\n  I believe it will be a mistake to block grant Medicaid at this point. \nPerhaps 6, 7, 8 years down the road, after we have really seen this \nthing move more aggressively in the private sector. We have a bit of a \nproblem because of the Federal-State relationship. I think it would be \nfar--not think, I very strongly believe it would be far sounder for us \nto cap the entitlement and deregulate so the States could use the \nmarket much more as a consequence.\n  Long-term care is much more of a problem. As people who have looked \nat it know, the long-term piece, although it is a much smaller number \nof people covered, it is a very large part of the total Medicaid \nspending--the long-term piece. We are also, in my judgment, going to \nhave to have some capitation of payment. But we are going to have to \nencourage States to develop private sector solutions. We simply cannot \nprovide, through the Government, all the long-term care requirements \nthat are out there. We have to basically take the Medicaid Program, as \nwe were proposing to do with Medicare, move it as quickly as possible \ntoward a private sector solution.\n  The third thing that we are saying is, make health care subsidies \nfair. The most important thing we do there is to cap the income tax \ndeduction. Some will say, ``You are increasing taxes on my health \ninsurance.'' Our proposal caps it at a high enough level inside of the \nmarket that nobody is going to be \n\n[[Page S 14404]]\nable to say that they are paying taxes on normal health care. They are \ngoing to be paying taxes on that beyond what the market judges to be in \nthe median range.\n  It is very uncomfortable for upper-income people to have to consider \nthat one of the things that is going on if they are in the 40-percent \ntax bracket, let us say, is that if they are buying a health insurance \npolicy of $7,000 or $8,000 a year, they are receiving a $2,800 to \n$3,200 subsidy as a result of receiving that deduction, and very often \nreceiving that subsidy from people who do not have health insurance.\n  So this says, let us make it fair. Let us keep the deduction in place \nso you can encourage the individuals to purchase and encourage the \nemployers to provide it, but let us cap it out so those subsidies end \nup being not only fair but consistent with our desire to make sure that \nwe provide subsidies to people who need them but do not provide \nsubsidies to people who do not.\n  The fourth thing we are attempting to do--there are a whole series of \nthings that need to be done, including the creation of a health care \nnetwork and additional information provided to consumers--we are trying \nto create a universal health care marketplace. So the decisions and \nchoices that are made by individuals about price and the decisions and \nchoices made by individuals about quality will determine the nature of \nour delivery system, the nature of our payment system. Again, for \nemphasis, we want the negotiation for price to occur out there in the \nmarket.\n  We do not want the negotiations for price to occur here in \nWashington, DC. That kind of top-down, paternalistic system I think is \na recipe for either increased regulation or unsuccessful efforts to \ncontrol costs.\n  So the proposal in its early stages is relatively simple. It is not \neasy, but it is based upon a vision of a universal marketplace for all \nAmericans where everybody knows they are covered, where everybody knows \nwhat their responsibilities are, and where everybody knows the costs \nattached to their demand.\n  There are seven things I would like to emphasize inside trying to \ncreate this buyers' market for Medicare and Medicaid. Again, division \nfor me is removing from a paternalistic federalized system into a \nsystem where everybody knows that they are covered but their decisions \nare shaping both the delivery and the payer system for the kinds of \nproducts that companies offer for sale.\n  First, we use market mechanisms to determine proper levels of supply \nand demand. Let the market make that decision. If we try to make that \ndecision here in a political environment, it is very difficult for us \nto say no and very difficult for the majority of us, when appeal is \nmade, to say no. It is not altogether likely that we are going to be \nhonest and say to somebody, if we say yes, ``By the way, here is the \ncost, and we would like to have you pay for it.'' We typically try to \nspread the cost over somebody else's income.\n  Second, we should protect the value of the subsidy while avoiding an \nunlimited subsidy. It is a very important thing for us to do. We need \nto protect the value of the subsidy so that it moves with inflation. \nBut we cannot continue with a system that says the subsidy is \nunlimited, the sky is the limit, and whatever you need we will pay for \nit regardless of what contributions you have made, regardless of what \nyour income is, and regardless of your wealth status.\n  Third, we need to maintain the collective purchasing power of \nMedicare and Medicaid. That is extremely important. The Government can \nhelp drive down the cost if they use that purchasing power in a \nconstructive fashion instead of sort of laying back and saying we will \npay out whatever is submitted to us. The law currently does not allow \nHCFA to do that sort of thing. We are talking about not eliminating \nHCFA but moving HCFA in a direction where it does a different set of \nthings than it is currently being asked by our laws to do.\n  Fourth, we must enable beneficiaries--250 million to 260 million--to \nbecome more informed. At the end of the day we are the ones that create \nthe demand. We are the ones, as a consequence of our own evaluation of \nhealth and what we are willing to do, who create the demand. We have to \nbecome better informed both about cost and about quality.\n  Fifth, we have to align Medicare and Medicaid with trends towards \ncost-effective care in the private sector rather than again just \nengaging in a debate about, are we cutting too much, and are we cutting \ntoo little? We need to take advantage of what is going on in the \nprivate sector with the objective of getting every single American \ninside the system.\n  Next, we have to create a privately run, decentralized system to \ndeliver our health insurance as opposed to, again, a centralized system \nthat tends to be more paternalistic and not terribly creative, not \nnearly as creative as what the market can do.\n  Seventh, we should limit the Government role to the essential.\n  This gets me back where I was at the beginning. Mr. President, it is \nterribly important to argue and decide what do we want the Federal \nGovernment to do. It appears to me that we have achieved consensus that \nthere is a legitimate role for Government, at least for 37 million \nAmericans who are over the age of 65. It seems to me that we have \nreached consensus. The principle ought to be that the reason we are \nhelping people over 65 is they cannot buy. They are having trouble \nbuying. Let us limit the role of Government to help those who cannot \nbuy purchase it. But let us not subsidize--whether it is me or you, Mr. \nPresident, or anybody else--people that do not need to be subsidized. \nLet us not have the Federal Government commanding the system to do \nsomething that is going to cost the taxpayer more and perhaps end up \ndelivering lower quality care.\n  In closing, one of the most exciting areas of effort that is ongoing \nright now in the area of waste, fraud, and abuse is by Senator Graham \nof Florida and Senator Harkin of Iowa. A long time ago a rather clever \nfellow by the name of Willie Sutton said, ``The reason I rob banks is \nthat's where the money is.'' At $250 billion, if Willie were around \ntoday, he would be apt to be looking at Medicare and Medicaid. People \nare getting ripped off by a substantial amount. They know how to game \nthe system. They are well organized. I am not talking typically about \nindividuals. I am talking about people who are in it for the money, for \nthe dough.\n  I think we have an obligation to do everything that we can to use \ncompetition, not only to get the price down as low as possible, but to \nmake sure that we hold to a very high standard of accountability those \npeople who find themselves being qualified as providers.\n  Mr. President, again, I applaud what I see as essentially a \nRepublican conversion that Medicare is a good program, that we ought to \npreserve and save it. I think that is an awfully good piece of news. \nThe underlying principle that should enable us to make decisions, not \njust for the short term where in truth not much effort is needed to \nsave Medicare in the short term over the next 7 to 10 years--not that \nmuch change is required--but to take advantage of the marketplace and \nto solve the problem that is created when the baby boomers retire. A \ngood deal more than what I have seen thus far in the Republican \nproposal needs to be done.\n  So I am hoping that this statement--and others that I will make on \nthis issue of Medicare and Medicaid, if not this year in the budget \ndeliberations, throughout the next year as we begin to do next year's \nbudget deliberations--I am hoping that we can in fact build some \nbipartisan coalition around the need to control the rapidly rising cost \nof entitlements that is squeezing out our ability to make long-term \ninvestments in our future, and the increasing insecurity that all \nAmericans feel as a consequence, I think, of very inefficiently run \nFederal programs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14402-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14405-S14407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 14405]]\n\n\n     LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have been in a quorum call trying to \nwork out an arrangement on the bill on Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education, of which I am the manager for the majority as chairman \nof the appropriations subcommittee, and in the absence of any action on \nthe bill up to the moment--we are optimistic we will have agreement on \na procedure to move ahead--I thought it would be useful to take this \ntime to make what would in effect be an opening statement on the bill \nso that people will be aware of what this bill means.\n  The Labor, Health and Human Services and Education bill, which will \nshortly be before the Senate, totals $62.8 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority, including $65 million in funds from the Violent Crime \nReduction Trust Fund. Mandatory spending totals $200.9 billion, an \nincrease of $17.7 billion over the 1995 levels, but those are mandatory \nexpenditures over which we have no control, entitlements. These totals \nare within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation for both budget \nauthority and outlays, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \nThe allocation falls over $7 billion below the original appropriated \nfunds for fiscal year 1995 and $4.4 billion below the postrescission \nlevels.\n  That means we have an enormous cut this year, but this is on a trend \nline to have a balanced budget by the year 2002 so that we do not \nburden further generations with excessive spending in the present.\n  In structuring this bill, we have tried to deal with this budget with \na scalpel instead of a meat ax and very carefully approaching the \nallocations for the most important items, and I think we have succeeded \nin doing that.\n  This year has been an extremely difficult one for the subcommittee, \nand very many difficult decisions had to be made in order to stay \nwithin that allocation.\n  Senator Harkin and I have taken a careful look at all of the programs \nwithin the bill and have sought to make some modifications in some of \nthe proposals made by the House, particularly in education, workplace \nsafety, and also funding for programs to protect women against \nviolence.\n  I take this opportunity to thank my distinguished colleague, Senator \nHarkin, for his help and cooperation in bringing this bill forward to \nthis point. Senator Harkin and I have worked together on this \nsubcommittee. Last year, in the 103d Congress, he was the chairman, I \nranking; this year it is nicer to be chairman, and Senator Harkin has \nbeen a very cooperative ranking member.\n  The important programs funded within this subcommittee's jurisdiction \nprovide moneys to improve the public health, strengthen biomedical \nresearch, assure a quality education for America's children, and job \ntraining activities to keep America's work force competitive within \nworld markets.\n  The funds are not adequate, Mr. President, but they are the best that \ncan be done under the circumstances. The House budget was less than \nours. We had almost $1.6 billion additional funding, and we have put \nall of that money into education.\n  That is a subject, Mr. President, that I feel very strongly about \nfrom my days growing up where education was very heavily stressed in \nthe Specter household really because my parents had so little of it.\n  My father, as an immigrant from Russia, coming to this country as a \nyoung man of 18, had no formal education at all. My mother came with \nher family when she was 5 years old from a small town on the Russian-\nPolish border and she went to only the eighth grade. Her father, my \ngrandfather, died of a heart attack in his mid-forties, and she had to \nleave school in the eighth grade to help support the family. My \nbrother, my two sisters and I, having had excellent educational \nopportunities, have been able to share in the American dream.\n  I think in the long run education is the answer. If you take a look \nat virtually all of the problems that beset our society, problems of \nwelfare, problems of teenage pregnancy, problems of disintegration of \nthe family, problems of crime, education would be the long-range \nanswer.\n  Twenty-eight years ago, when I was an official in the city of \nPhiladelphia, working as district attorney and a candidate that year \nfor mayor, there was an impressive book written, ``Cities in a Race \nwith Time,'' and not a whole lot has changed because we really have not \ndug into the educational system in America.\n  One of the proposals in this bill which we have funded in the Senate \nbut was not funded in the House has been the Goals 2000 program, \ninitiated under a Republican President, President Bush, carried forward \nunder a Democratic President, President Clinton.\n  There are two States which have not taken funding under Goals 2000, \nthe State of Virginia and the State of New Hampshire, and one State, \nMontana, will not take funding next year.\n  It is my view, Mr. President, that Goals 2000 constitutes a very \nimportant step forward. They are voluntary goals. They are not \nmandatory. States may adopt other goals as they see fit There are some \nstandards. Terrel Bell, in 1983, was Secretary of Education when a book \ncame forward talking about the crisis in the American educational \nsystem, and still we have failed to deal adequately with that issue.\n  We held hearings in the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee, on September 12, looking for a way to eliminate some of \nthe Federal strings to satisfy all of the States, and we may have found \nchanges to pursue in an authorization bill.\n  Also, there is a possibility that funds might be given directly to \nlocal school districts subject to veto power by the State which has \nsovereignty. But it is my hope that states will use Goals 2000 to set \nthese standards to strengthen education in America.\n  On biomedical research, Mr. President, we have for the National \nInstitutes of Health nearly $11.6 billion, an increase of some $300 \nmillion over the fiscal year 1995 appropriations. These funds will \nboost the biomedical research appropriations to maintain and strengthen \nthe tremendous strides which have been made in unlocking medical \nmysteries which lead to new treatments and cures. Gene therapy offers \ngreat promise for the future. In the 15 years that I have been in the \nSenate, all those years on the appropriations subcommittee dealing with \nhealth and human services, where cuts have been proposed by Presidents, \nboth Democrat and Republican, we have increased funding for medical \nresearch, which I think it is very important.\n  Two years ago, I had a medical problem and was the beneficiary of the \nMRI developed in 1985, after I had come to the Senate, a life-saving \nprocedure to detect an intracranial lesion. So I have professional, \npolitical, and personal experiences to attest to the importance of \nhealth research funding.\n\n  On Alzheimer's disease, Mr. President, this last year the United \nStates spent over $90 billion to care for Alzheimer's patients. This \ndevastating disease robs its victims of their minds while depriving \nfamilies of the well-being and security they deserve.\n  We have been working to focus more attention and more money into the \ncauses and cures of Alzheimer's. To address this problem, the bill \ncontains increased funding for research into finding the cause and \ncures for Alzheimer's disease. The bill also includes nearly $5 million \nfor a State grant program to help families caring for Alzheimer's \npatients at home. The statistics are enormously impressive, Mr. \nPresident, that if we could delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease, we \ncould save billions of dollars.\n  On women's health, in 1995, 182,000 women will be diagnosed as having \nbreast cancer and some 46,000 women will die from the disease. The \ninvestment in education and treatment advances led to the announcement \nlast year that the breast cancer death rates in American women declined \nby 4.7 percent between 1989 and 1992, the largest such short-term \ndecline since 1950.\n  And while this was encouraging news, it only highlighted the fact \nthat the Federal Government investment is beginning to pay off. While \nit was difficult in a tight budget year to raise funding levels, the \nsubcommittee placed a very high priority on women's health issues. The \nbill before the Senate contains an increase of $25 million for breast \nand cervical cancer screening, increases to expand research on the \nbreast cancer gene, to permit the \n\n[[Page S 14406]]\ndevelopment of a diagnostic test to identify women who are at risk, and \nspeed research to develop effective methods of prevention, early \ndetection and treatment.\n  Funding for the Office of Women's Health has also been doubled to \ncontinue the national action plan on breast cancer, and to develop and \nestablish a clearinghouse to provide health care professionals with a \nbroad range of women's health-related information. This increase has \nbeen recommended for the Office of Women's Health, because of the very \neffective work that that office has been doing.\n  On Healthy Start, Mr. President, children born of low birthweight is \nthe leading cause of infant mortality. Infants who have been exposed to \ndrugs, alcohol or tobacco in utero are more likely to be born \nprematurely and of low birthweight. We have in our society, Mr. \nPresident, thousands of children born each year no bigger than the size \nof my hand, weighing a pound, some even as little as 12 ounces. They \nare human tragedies at birth carrying scars for a lifetime. They are \nenormously expensive, costing more than $200,000 until they are \nreleased from the hospital.\n  Years ago, Dr. Koop outlined the way to deal with this issue by \nprenatal visits. The Healthy Start program was initiated, and has been \ncarried forward, to target resources for prenatal care to high \nincidence communities; it is funded as well as we could under this bill \nwith increases as I have noted.\n  On AIDS, the bill contains $2.6 billion for research, education, \nprevention and services to embattle the scourge of AIDS, including $379 \nmillion for emergency aid to the 42 cities hardest hit by this disease.\n  When it comes to the subject of violence against women, it is one of \nthe epidemic problems in our society. The Department of Justice reports \nthat each year women are the victims of more than 4.5 million violent \ncrimes, including an estimated 500,000 rapes or other sexual assaults.\n  But crime statistics do not tell the whole story. I have visited many \nshelters, Mr. President, in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh and have seen \nfirsthand the physical and emotional suffering so many women are \nenduring. In a sad, ironic way the women I saw were the lucky ones \nbecause they survived violent attacks.\n  The Labor-HHS-Education bill contains $96 million for programs \nauthorized by the Violent Crime Reduction Act. The bill before the \nSenate contains the full amount authorized for these programs, \nincluding $50 million for battered-women shelters, $35 million for rape \nprevention programs, $7 million for runaway youth, and $4.9 million for \ncommunity demonstration programs, the operation of the hotline and \neducation programs for youth. These funds have been appropriated, Mr. \nPresident, after very, very careful analysis as to where the \nsubcommittee and the full committee felt the money could best be spent.\n  On the school-to-work program, the committee recommends $245 million \nwithin the Departments of Labor and Education, which is maintenance of \nthe level provided in 1995. We would like to have had more money, but \nthat was the best we could do considering the other cuts.\n  On nutrition programs for the elderly, for the congregate and home-\ndelivered meals program, the bill provides almost $475 million. Within \nthis amount is $110.3 million for the home-delivered meals program, an \nincrease of $16.2 million over the 1995 appropriation because there are \nsuch long waiting lists, so many seniors who really depend upon this \nfor basic subsistence.\n  On education, we have allocated the full amount of the increase that \nour subcommittee received, some $1.6 billion. The bill does not contain \nall of the funds we would like to have provided, but it is a maximum \neffort on this important subject.\n  As to job training, Mr. President, we know all too well that high \nunemployment means a waste of valuable human resources, inevitably \ndepresses consumer spending, and weakens our economy. The bill before \nus today includes $3.4 billion for job training programs. And again, \ncandidly, I would like to see more, Mr. President, but this is the \nmaximum that we could allocate.\n  As to workplace safety, the bill contains an increase of $62 million \nover the amount recommended by the House for worker protection \nprograms. While progress has been made in this area, there are still \nfar too many work-related injuries and illnesses, and these funds will \nprovide programs and inspect businesses and industry, weed out \noccupational hazards, and protect worker pensions within reasonable \nbounds.\n  LIHEAP is a program which is very important, Mr. President, to much \nof America. It provides low-income heating and fuel assistance. Eighty \npercent of those who receive LIHEAP assistance earn less than $7,000 a \nyear. It is a program which was zeroed out by the House, and we have \nreinstated it in this bill. We have effectively included a total of $1 \nbillion here, $100 million of which is carryover funds, as we \nunderstand the current state of affairs, although it is hard to get an \nexact figure, and an additional $900 million.\n  As the Congress consolidates and streamlines programs, Federal \nadministrative costs must also be downsized. In this bill, with the \nexception of the Social Security Administration, we have cut program \nmanagement an average of 8 percent. Many view administrative costs as \nwaste and others suggest that deeper cuts are justified. It is our \njudgment that any further reductions would be counterproductive.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank the extraordinary staffs \nwho have worked on this program. On the Senate side, Bettilou Taylor \nand Craig Higgins have been extraordinary and professional in taking \ninordinately complicated printouts and working through a careful \nanalysis of the priorities.\n  We received requests from many of our colleagues. And to the maximum \nextent, we have accommodated those requests. We have received many \nrequests from people around the country. We have accommodated as many \nrequests for personal meetings as we could, both with the Senators and \nwith their staffs. And we think this is a very significant bill.\n  There are people on both sides who have objected to provisions of the \nbill. When a motion to proceed is offered, it is my hope that we will \nproceed to take up this bill and that we will pass it. We are aware \nthat there has been the threat of a veto from the executive branch, and \nI invite the President or any of his officials to suggest improvements \nif they feel they can do it better.\n  There is a commitment in America to a balanced budget and, that is \nsomething we have to do. We have structured our program to have that \nbalanced budget within 7 years by the year 2002. The President talks \nabout a balanced budget within 9 years. I suggest that our targeting is \nthe preferable target.\n  To the extent people have suggestions on better allocations, we are \nprepared to listen, but this is our best judgment. We urge the Senate \nto proceed with this bill.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have been trying to figure out some way \nto move this bill out of the Senate. As the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas been explaining, it is a very important bill. We understand the \nPresident is going to veto it. We have been trying to determine how can \nwe get it to the President quickly.\n  Of course, one way to do it is to pass it without any amendments, \nhave him veto it, and then have the fight on all these different \namendments at a later time. Unfortunately, we do not seem to have an \nagreement on that procedure. But the two leaders have agreed to a \nrequest, and it has been signed off on by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, the chairman of the subcommittee, and \nSenator Harkin from Iowa, the ranking member on the subcommittee. I \nwill propound that request.\n  Let me first explain to all Senators that we have a problem here \nbecause we could not come together. There would have been a filibuster \non a motion to proceed. In order to have a motion to proceed, it takes \n60 affirmative votes to shut off debate so you can go to the bill. That \nalso requires that you set up getting a cloture motion signed. Then it \nmust be filed and there must be one intervening day of the Senate's \nsession. We are within a couple of days of completing our work on the \nappropriations bills prior to the end of the \n\n[[Page S 14407]]\nfiscal year. It seems to me the agreement I will ask for in a minute \nseems to achieve this 60-vote test without having to file cloture \nmotions to comply with all other provisions of rule XXII.\n  I will now make the request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14405-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2127\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that if the \nmotion to proceed does not receive 60 or more votes, there then be a \nsecond vote on the motion to proceed at 11 a.m. on Thursday, with the \ntime between votes to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that if the \nsecond vote on the motion to proceed does not receive 60 votes in the \naffirmative, the motion automatically be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think I have explained this. This, in \neffect, saves a couple of days going through the cloture route, \nintervening days and all these things. It seems to me we have so many \ndifferences on each side that this bill is in great difficulty, \nnotwithstanding the splendid efforts made by the managers, particularly \nthe chairman of the subcommittee.\n  But it also seems to me if we are not going to have any movement on \nthe bill, we at least ought to make the effort and then withdraw the \nmotion to proceed and lay the bill aside.\n  That would leave us one additional bill, State, Justice, Commerce \nappropriations to deal with yet this week, and also the continuing \nresolution, and also to complete in the Finance Committee and the \nAgriculture Committee our reconciliation obligations.\n  I think the other committees, as far as I know, have completed them. \nThe Finance Committee will meet this evening as soon as we recess, \nwhich will be in a few moments.\n  So I hope this procedure will expedite something. I am not certain \nwhat. Maybe it will expedite getting out this week.\n  Hopefully, this may not happen, but I have discussed this with the \nmanager, Senator Specter, after we have these two votes, if we do not \nreceive 60 votes, maybe then we can convince our colleagues on each \nside to let us pass this by voice vote, send it to conference, and get \nit down to the President. He already said he is going to veto it. There \nis no question about a veto. The veto cannot be overridden. Then we \ninitiate a new bill in the House, it will come back to the Senate, and \nthen we have our fight sometime probably late October. In the meantime, \nit will be wrapped in the continuing resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14407-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ FOR FIRST TIME--H.R. 927\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

A bill to permit agricultural producers to enter into market \ntransition contracts and receive loans, to require a pilot revenue \ninsurance program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 the farm income transition act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate Agriculture Committee \nbegan marking up the commodity title to the 1995 farm bill. Although I \nam no longer a member of that committee, the farm bill has as much \nimpact on my State as any other piece of legislation considered before \nthis body.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I have used my position on other \ncommittees to indirectly influence farm policy. I have also formed a \ngroup, the Farm Policy Coalition, that is cochaired by Senator Dorgan \nand consists of 52 Members of the Senate. In order to more directly \ninfluence the debate.\n  Today, however, the Agriculture Committee was not able to agree on a \nfarm bill to take to reconciliation. And there are rumors that the \nBudget Committee may have to act to make the necessary cuts in farm \nspending. As a member of the Budget Committee, I publicly stated that \nthe Agriculture Committee, and not the Budget Committee, is the best \nplace to write the farm bill.\n  But now with the Agriculture Committee deadlocked, I feel it \nnecessary to send a clear signal, as a Budget Committee member and a \nSenator interested in the future of agriculture, on how I believe we \nshould proceed on the 1995 farm bill; taking into consideration what is \nin the best interests of my State and American agriculture as a whole.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Farm Income \nTransition Act of 1995. This bill is similar to one introduced by the \ndistinguished chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Pat Roberts, \nknown as the Freedom to Farm Act.\n  My bill represents a transition to a new era of farm programs; an era \nthat will be characterized by limited Government intrusion in the \nmarket and the unleashing of the productivity of American agriculture. \nYet the Federal Government will still play a role in providing a \nsafety-net for the family farmer.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a dramatic departure from the farm \nprograms of the past. We all know that our current farm programs were \nestablished during the Great Depression of the 1930's.\n  The intent of the program then, as it is now, was to stabilize farm \nincome while ensuring a dependable, abundant, and inexpensive food \nsupply. This is accomplished mainly by making direct payments to \nfarmers when commodity prices are low, and implementing production \ncontrols to limit the supply of commodities.\n  To a large extent, the programs of the past have been successful. The \nAmerican consumer spends less than 10 percent of their disposable \nincome on food; the lowest of any Nation in the world.\n  Despite its success, the farm program has had many critics. Some \ncriticize the program for its high degree of Government intervention. \nOthers argue that the benefits go primarily to large, corporate farms. \nMany farmers, themselves, have grown tired of the endless amount of \npaperwork and redtape associated with the program.\n  Through all the criticism, however, the farm program has remained \nvirtually unchanged for the last 50 years. But times have changed. And \nthese changes mandate that a new direction be taken on farm programs.\n  The crisis of the 1930's was rampant unemployment and poverty. \nDrastic action was needed to support the income of ordinary Americans.\n  The crisis of the 1990's is rampant Government spending and \nintervention into the lives of ordinary Americans. The voters told us \nin no uncertain terms last November that they wanted the Government out \nof their lives and the budget deficit brought under control.\n  Mr. President, the Senate approved a budget resolution this spring \nthat will bring the Federal budget into balance in the year 2002. \nThis resolution contains a sense-of-the Senate calling for a cut in \nspending on agriculture commodity programs of about $9.6 billion over \nthe next 7 years.\n\n  During the debate on the budget, I voiced my strong opposition to \nfurther cuts in agriculture spending. I will not repeat all of the \narguments I made at that time, but it is clear to me that agriculture \nhas contributed disproportionately to deficit reduction in the past. \nAll I asked for at that time, Mr. President, was that agriculture be \ntreated equitably in the budget process.\n  I also argued during the budget debate that agriculture, more than \nany other sector of this economy, has much to gain by achieving a \nbalanced budget.\n  Agriculture is a capital-intensive business, its success dependent on \nlow-interest rates. Only by getting our fiscal house in order can we \nensure a sustained period of low-interest rates and the continued \nsuccess of the family farmer.\n  So although Federal spending on agriculture will be reduced, because \nthis reduction is within the context of a balanced budget, agriculture \nwill benefit greatly in the long run.\n  But, Mr. President, it is vital that as Federal spending on \nagriculture is reduced, the regulations and restrictions on individual \nfarmers are reduced accordingly. Because if farmers are getting less \nfrom the Government, they must have the tools to earn more income from \nthe marketplace.\n  This bill meets both of these goals: It reduces spending to meet the \nrequirements of my sense-of-the Senate in the budget resolution and it \ndramatically reduces the regulatory burden placed on farmers.\n  Mr. President, I will take a moment to describe how this bill \naccomplishes these goals. First, it mirrors the Freedom to Farm Act by \nproviding farmers with a 7-year contract consisting of annual payments. \nIn return, the farmer must maintain compliance with current \nconservation requirements. The total payments over the 7-year period \nare capped at $43 billion, which meets the requirements of the budget \nresolution.\n  Furthermore, the regulatory burden on farmers is significantly \ndiminished. For many years, the planting decisions of American farmers \nhave been dictated, in part, by the U.S. Congress and the Department of \nAgriculture. This limits a farmer's ability to maximize his profit from \nthe marketplace. These decisions must be removed from the hands of \nbureaucrats and put back into the hands of the farmers.\n  My bill provides for full planting flexibility. Farmers' planting \ndecisions will no longer be restricted by their historical crop base. \nThis will allow farmers to plant for the marketplace and not the \nFederal farm program.\n  The bill also eliminates the acreage reduction program. No longer \nwill farmers be required to leave a portion of their productive land \nunplanted because of a mandate imposed by Washington.\n  Furthermore, the bill maintains certain aspects of the current farm \nprogram while reforming others. For instance, nonrecourse loans will \ncontinue to be made available. This is a necessary and important \nmarketing tool for farmers that does not require direct Government \nspending.\n  On the other hand, the three-entity rule is eliminated. Payments will \nnow be directly attributed to farmers instead of corporations and other \nentities. \n\n[[Page S 14409]]\n\n  Last, the bill provides for a new era of farm programs based on risk \nmanagement. Specifically, it directs the Secretary to initiate a \nrevenue insurance pilot program as an alternative to the crop insurance \nprogram.\n  Revenue insurance will cost the Federal Government no more than the \ncurrent crop insurance program. But it will give the farmer a solid and \ndependable safety net.\n  The program will allow a farmer to pay a premium to protect himself \nfrom a significant decline in revenue, whether it is caused by crop \nloss or low prices. Thus unlike crop insurance, the farmer is protected \nfrom both natural disasters and from situations when too much grain on \nthe market causes extremely low prices.\n  This revenue insurance program truly represents a revolutionary new \nfarm program.\n  Mr. President, the future of American agriculture is not in \nGovernment payments and subsidies. The future of American agriculture \nrests on the ability of farmers to remain competitive in a world \nmarketplace.\n  The role of government consists of opening access to new markets for \nagricultural products, providing research for the development of better \ncrops and new uses for existing commodities, and providing a safety net \nfor the family farm structure.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that not only will American agriculture \nreach unprecedented levels of productivity and profitability in the \nfuture, but there will continue to be a vital role for the family \nfarmer.\n  The independent, family farmer is still the backbone of the \nagricultural economy in my State of Iowa. These farmers tell me that \nthey can compete with the large farms, if they only have a level \nplaying field and equal access to markets and information.\n  Government should do everything in its power to provide this level \nplaying field. I believe that the bill I have introduced today helps \nput all farmers on an equal footing as agriculture approaches the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an education satellite loan guarantee \nprogram for communications among education, Federal, State, and local \ninstitutions and agencies and instructional and educational resource \nproviders; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          the educational satellite loan guarantee program act\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduced a bill to establish an \neducation satellite loan guarantee program from communications among \neducation, Federal, State, and local institutions and agencies and \ninstructional and educational resource providers. Americans face many \nproblems and challenges in education. From Montana to Maine, local \nschool districts to large universities, educators are being asked to do \nmore with less. There is overcrowding in urban areas and a lack of \naccess to educational opportunities in many rural areas. We are being \nchallenged as a nation, and we must react as a nation with unity of \npurpose. We must marshall our resources and save our children's future. \nOver this Nation's history, we have used good old American creativity \nto conquer many challenges and force new horizons. I believe that \ntechnology plays a key role in making us world leaders. In the areas of \nspace and defense, our technological know-how has made us second to \nnone.\n  We should act now to apply our same know-how to education. Whether it \nbe through copper wire, glass, or satellites, distance learning can \nprovide access to the vast educational resources of our Nation, \nregardless of wealth or geographic location. There is a crisis facing \nAmerica's distance education providers and users at all levels of \nschooling due to shortages and price increases in satellite capacity. \nThis crisis in the distance education field has been noted and \ndocumented by the satellite and broadcasting industries and the \nNational Education Telecommunications Organization [NETO]. The crisis \nfacing the educators is a lack of availability of satellite capacity \nand dramatically escalating costs which puts an educational \ninstitution's ability to equitably transmit instructions at high risk. \nWe must start right here, right now, by taking advantage of the \nsatellite technology that exist today.\n  More than 90 American college provide education and instruction to K-\n12 school districts, colleges, libraries, and students in other distant \neducation centers, nationwide and internationally. In my own State of \nMontana and throughout the country from Washington State through Texas \nto Maine, teaches and students are receiving word that they will not \nhave access to instruction heretofore received in science, math, \nlanguage, and other special events. Rural and urban school districts, \nfamily health centers in hard-to-reach areas and rural hospitals will \nbe immediately impacted at the start-up of the fall 1995 semester. If \nnothing is done to ameliorate the crisis more than 200 small education \nentrepreneurial communications centers are at risk \n\n[[Page S 14412]]\nby the fall of 1996. These are communications centers in America's \ncolleges, school districts, and education consortia which include State \neducation and television agencies who have invested State and local \ntaxes to create cost-effective, equitable transmission using satellite, \ntelephone, and cable to deliver instruction and training in classrooms \nthroughout the Nation.\n  For an interim solution to the crisis, Congresswoman Constance \nMorella, Congressman Ceorge E. Brown, Jr., and I have asked NASA to \ndedicate unused satellite capacity to the education sector as the prime \nusers for a period up to 3 years. However, we must begin to create \nan adequate satellite system dedicated to education to meet the \neducational needs and demands of America's students, teachers, and \nworkers for the future.\n\n  The bill introduced today will facilitate the acquisition by an \nappropriate nonprofit, public corporation of a communications satellite \nsystem dedicated to the transmission of instructions, education, and \ntraining programming that is not subject to preemptive use by Federal \nGovernment for purposes of national security. The bill would authorize \nthe Secretary of Interior to carry out a loan guarantee program under \nwhich a non-profit, public corporation could borrow funds to buy or \nlease satellites dedicated to instructional programming. A dedicated \neducational satellite will allow us to address two barriers faced by \nthose involved in distance learning via satellite. First, it will \ninsure instructional programmers that they will be able to obtain \naffordable satellite transmission time without risk of preemption by \ncommercial users. Second, it will allow educators using the programming \nto have one dish focused on one satellite off which they can receive at \nleast 24 channels of instructional programming--every hour of the \nschool year.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that distance learning is a growth area \nand that there is a role for the Federal Government in facilitating \nthat growth. The Office of Technology Assessment's 1989 report, \n``Linking for Learning: A New Course for Education'' documents the \nrecent growth of distance learning, calling the growth in the K-12 \nsector dramatic. OTA anticipates this growth to continue. The National \nGovernors' Association in 1988 found that while fewer than 10 States \nwere promoting distance learning in 1987; 1 year later two-thirds of \nthe States reported involvement. The NGA passed a resolution in 1988, \nand revised it in 1991, expressing their support for a dedicated \neducation and public purpose satellite-based telecommunications \nnetwork. Following their 1989 education summit in Charlottesville, VA \nwhere former Governor Wallace Wilkinson of Kentucky and other Governors \nraised with President Bush the proposal for this dedicated system, the \nEDSAT Institute was formed to analyze the proposal. In 1991, they \nissued a report entitled ``Analysis of a Proposal for an Education \nSatellite,'' and they found as did the OTA report, that individual \nStates and consortiums of States are investing heavily in distance \nlearning technologies and that the education sector is a significant \nmarket.\n  The organization, the National Educations Telecommunications \nOrganization [NETO], was formed after the EDSAT Institute held seven \nregional meetings during the summer of 1991. Through these meetings, \nthey recognized the need to aggregate the education market for distance \nlearning and concluded that an education programming users organization \nwas needed. NETO has a distinguished board of educators, public policy \nofficials, State education agencies, and telecommunications experts who \nare committed to the goal of developing an integrated \ntelecommunications system dedicated to education. The first step is \nwhat we are facilitating through Federal loan guarantees.\n  If this legislation passes, the Federal Government will be setting a \nnational policy in support of a telecommunications infrastructure for \ndistance learning. A policy that will cost the government relatively \nlittle compared to the benefits our Nation will receive through \nimproved education and educational access. The risk to the Federal \nGovernment is minimal. The only risk the Government is assuming is the \nrisk that the distance learning market will dissipate. I think the \nfindings of the National Governors' Association, the OTA, and the EDSAT \nInstitute prove highly unlikely. But I also believe that with distance \nlearning, as with transportation and other infrastructure-dependent \nmarkets, once an infrastructure is in place the market will expand \nbeyond our current expectations.\n\n  A dedicated satellite system will bring instructional programming \nwhich is now scattered across 12 to 15 satellites into one place in the \nsky. This collocation will allow educators to receive a variety of \ninstructional programs without having to constantly reorient their \nsatellite dish. By making the investment in a dedicated system on the \nfront end, we are reducing distance learning costs for educators on the \nState and local levels. The programmers will benefit because they will \nbe able to market their programming to a wider audience and will be \nguaranteed reliable satellite time at an affordable rate. A rate that \nwill be equal no matter how much time they buy. Programmers include \npublic schools, colleges, universities, State agencies, private sector \ncorporations and consortiums, such as the star schools consortiums, and \nindependents. The users will benefit because their investment in \nequipment to receive instructional programming may be reduced because \nof the technological advantages of focusing on one point in the sky. \nUsers include primary and secondary students, college, and university \nstudents, professionals interested in continuing education, community \nmembers, and government bodies. The benefits far outweigh the costs in \nmy mind.\n  A dedicated educational satellite will allow our kids to benefit from \nequal access to quality education. This is really just the first step. \nBoth NETO and I believe that a telecommunications infrastructure for \nuse by the educational sector should not be technology specific. I plan \nto continue pushing for passage of S. 1200 to make a national broadband \nfiber-optic network a reality. NETO's vision is for an integrated, \nnationwide telecommunications system, a transparent highway that \nencompasses land and space, over which educational and instructional \nresources can be delivered. They envision bringing together the land-\nbased systems that are already in place, not replacing them. This is an \ninclusive effort, not an exclusive one. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in making this a reality.\n  Technology has transformed every sector of our lives. It can \ntransform education as well. It will not replace teachers, it will \nempower them with better teaching tools. It will inspire our young \npeople to actively engage in their education. It will expose them to \nthe world around them and broaden their horizons. Our Nation's children \ndeserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for appropriate remedies for prison \ncondition lawsuits, to discourage frivolous and abusive prison \nlawsuits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                THE PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senators Hatch, Kyl, Abraham, Hutchison, \nReid, Thurmond, Specter, Santorum, D'Amato, Gramm, and Bond, in \nintroducing the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n  This legislation is a new and improved version of S. 866, which I \nintroduced earlier this year to address the alarming explosion in the \nnumber of frivolous lawsuits filed by State and Federal prisoners. It \nalso builds on the stop-turning-out-prisoners legislation, championed \nby Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Spencer Abraham, by making it much \nmore difficult for Federal judges to issue orders directing the release \nof convicted criminals from prison custody.\n\n\n                           inmate litigation\n\n  Unfortunately, the litigation explosion now plaguing our country does \nnot stop at the prison gate. According to Enterprise Institute scholar \nWalter Berns, the number of ``due-process and cruel and unusual \npunishment'' complaints filed by prisoners has grown astronomically--\nfrom 6,600 in 1975 to more than 39,000 in 1994. These suits can involve \nsuch grievances as insufficient storage locker space, a defective \nhaircut by a prison barber, the failure of prison officials to invite a \nprisoner to a pizza party for a departing prison employee, and yes, \nbeing served chunky peanut butter instead of the creamy variety. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  These legal claims may sound far-fetched, almost funny, but \nunfortunately, prisoner litigation does not operate in a vacuum. \nFrivolous lawsuits filed by prisoners tie up the courts, waste valuable \nlegal resources, and affect the quality of justice enjoyed by law-\nabiding citizens. The time and money spent defending these cases are \nclearly time and money better spent prosecuting violent criminals, \nfighting illegal drugs, or cracking down on consumer fraud.\n  The National Association of Attorneys General estimates that inmate \ncivil rights litigation costs the States more than $81 million each \nyear. Of course, most of these costs are incurred defending lawsuits \nthat have no merit whatsoever.\n  Let me be more specific. According the Arizona Attorney General Grant \nWoods, a staggering 45 percent of the civil cases filed in Arizona's \nFederal courts last year were filed by State prisoners. That means that \n20,000 prisoners in Arizona filed almost as many cases as Arizona's 3.5 \nmillion law-abiding citizens. And most of these prisoner lawsuits were \nfiled free of charge. No court costs. No filing fees. This is \noutrageous and it must stop.\n\n\n                              garnishment\n\n  Mr. President, I happen to believe that prisons should be just that--\nprisons, not law firms. That is why the Prison Litigation Reform Act \nproposes several important reforms that would dramatically reduce the \nnumber of meritless prisoner lawsuits.\n  For starters, the act would require inmates who file lawsuits to pay \nthe full amount of their court fees and other costs.\n  Many prisoners filing lawsuits today in Federal court claim indigent \nstatus. As indigents, prisoners are generally not required to pay the \nfees that normally accompany the filing of a lawsuit. In other words, \nthere is no economic disincentive to going to court.\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act would change this by establishing a \ngarnishment procedure: If a prisoner is unable to fully pay court fees \nand other costs at the time of filing a lawsuit, 20 percent of the \nfunds in his trust account would be garnished for this purpose. Every \nmonth thereafter, an additional 20 percent of the income credited to \nthe prisoner's account would be garnished, until the full amount of the \ncourt fees and costs are paid-off.\n  When average law-abiding citizens file a lawsuit, they recognize that \nthere could be an economic downside to going to court. Convicted \ncriminals should not get preferential treatment: If a law-abiding \ncitizen has to pay the costs associated with a lawsuit, so too should a \nconvicted criminal.\n  In addition, when prisoners know that they will have to pay these \ncosts--perhaps not at the time of filing, but \n\n[[Page S 14414]]\neventually--they will be less inclined to file a lawsuit in the first \nplace.\n\n\n                           judicial screening\n\n  Another provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act would require \njudicial screening, before docketing, of any civil complaint filed by a \nprisoner seeking relief from the Government. This provision would allow \na Federal judge to immediately dismiss a complaint if either of two \nconditions is met: First, the complaint does not state a claim upon \nwhich relief may be granted, or second, the defendant is immune from \nsuit.\n\n\n                             other reforms\n\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act would also allow Federal courts to \nrevoke any good-time credits accumulated by a prisoner who files a \nfrivolous suit. It requires State prisoners to exhaust all \nadministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in Federal court. And \nit prohibits prisoners from suing the Government for mental or \nemotional injury, absent a prior showing of physical injury.\n\n  If enacted, all of these provisions would go a long way to take the \nfrivolity out of frivolous inmate litigation.\n\n\n                       stop turning out prisoners\n\n  The second major section of the Prison Litigation Reform Act \nestablishes some tough new guidelines for Federal courts when \nevaluating legal challenges to prison conditions. These guidelines will \nwork to restrain liberal Federal judges who see violations on \nconstitutional rights in every prisoner complaint and who have used \nthese complaints to micromanage State and local prison systems.\n  Perhaps the most pernicious form of judicial micromanagement is the \nso-called prison population cap.\n  In 1993, for example, the State of Florida put 20,000 prisoners on \nearly release because of a prison cap order issued by a Federal judge \nwho thought the Florida system was overcrowded and thereby inflected \ncruel and unusual punishment on the State's prisoners.\n  And, then, there's the case of Philadelphia, where a court-ordered \nprison cap has put thousands of violent criminals back on the city's \nstreets, often with disastrous consequences. As Pro. John Diiulio has \npointed out: ``Federal Judge Norma Shapiro has single-handedly \ndecriminalized property and drug crimes in the City of Brotherly Love * \n* * Judge Shapiro has done what the city's organized crime bosses never \ncould; namely, turn the town into a major drug smuggling port.''\n  By establishing tough new conditions that a Federal court must meet \nbefore issuing a prison cap order, this bill will help slam-shut the \nrevolving prison door.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to express my special thanks to \nArizona Attorney General Grant Woods and to the National Association of \nAttorneys General. Their input these past several months has been \ninvaluable as we have attempted to draft a better, more effective piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nPrison Litigation Reform, as well as a letter from the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General and a section-by-section summary, be \nreprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Highlights \n     include appointment of a special 3-judge panel to consider \n     any order that would impose a population cap on a prison or \n     jail.\n       Prospective relief in prison conditions cases would not be \n     allowed to extend any further than necessary to correct the \n     violation of a federal right of an identifiable plaintiff. \n     Federal courts would have to ensure that the relief is \n     narrowly drawn and that it is the least intrusive means of \n     correcting the violation, giving substantial weight to any \n     adverse impact the relief might have on public safety.\n       Preliminary injunctive relief would expire after 90 days, \n     unless made final before that date.\n       No prison population cap could be imposed unless:\n       (a) the court had previously entered an order for a less \n     intrusive remedy that, after sufficient time for \n     implementation, failed to correct the violation of the \n     federal right; and\n       (b) a 3-judge panel finds by clear and convincing evidence \n     that crowding is the primary cause of the violation and no \n     other relief will remedy it, and finds by a preponderance of \n     the evidence that crowding has deprived an identifiable \n     plaintiff of an essential human need.\n       Public officials whose function includes the prosecution or \n     custody of persons who could be released from, or not \n     admitted to, a prison or jail as a result of a population cap \n     would have standing to challenge the imposition or \n     continuation of such a cap.\n       Prosective relief granted in conditions of confinement \n     cases may be terminated on the motion of either party \n     unless the court finds, based on the record, that the \n     relief remains necessary to correct a current, ongoing \n     violation of a federal right, and that the relief extends \n     no further than necessary, is narrowly drawn, and is the \n     least intrusive means to correct the violation of the \n     right.\n       Federal court approval of consent decrees would be subject \n     to the same limitations. Private settlements and remedies \n     under state law would be unaffected.\n       The court would be required to rule promptly on any motion \n     to modify or terminate prospective relief. After 30 days, an \n     automatic stay on the prospective relief would apply during \n     the pendency of the motion.\n       Courts would be authorized to employ an impartial special \n     master for the preparation of proposed findings of fact in \n     the remedial phase of complex prison conditions cases. The \n     special master would be appointed from lists submitted by \n     both parties, and would be compensated at a rate no higher \n     than that for federal court-appointed counsel. The \n     appointment would be reviewed every 6 months, and would lapse \n     at the termination of the prospective relief. The special \n     master's findings would be required to be on the record, and \n     no ex parte findings or communications would be permitted.\n       Section 3: Amendments to Civil Rights of Institutionalized \n     Persons Act (CRIPA):\n       Subsections (a) through (c): Technical amendments \n     concerning references to the Attorney General.\n       Subsection (d): Suits by Prisoners.\n       This subsection rewrites Section 7 of CRIPA (42 U.S.C. \n     1997e), which is currently limited to provisions related to \n     administrative remedies in connection with inmate lawsuits, \n     to establish broader standards to govern suits filed by \n     prisoners.\n       Requires inmates' administrative remedies be exhausted \n     prior to the filing of a suit in federal court; removes \n     requirement that state administrative remedies be certified \n     by the Attorney General of the United States. Retains \n     provision of current law stating that the absence of \n     administrative remedies by itself does not provide the \n     Attorney General with grounds to bring or intervene in a suit \n     against a state or local prison.\n       Permits the court to dismiss, without hearing, inmate suits \n     that are frivolous or malicious.\n       Limits attorney's fees that may be awarded to successful \n     inmate plaintiffs. Fees must be directly and reasonably \n     incurred in proving an actual violation of a plaintiff's \n     rights, and would be based on an hourly rate no higher than \n     that for other federal court appointed counsel. Also requires \n     that up to 25% of a plaintiff's monetary judgement be applied \n     towards attorney's fees.\n       Limits prisoner suits in federal court for mental or \n     emotional injury to instances where the plaintiff shows \n     physical injury as well.\n       Provides that in civil suits brought by a prisoner, any \n     pretrial proceedings in which the prisoner must or may \n     participate may be conducted at the prison or jail, by \n     teleconference, or by videoconference whenever practicable.\n       Permits the defendant in a prisoner-initiated suit to waive \n     reply without default, unless the reply is required by the \n     court.\n       Subsections (e) and (f): Technical amendments concerning \n     references to the Attorney General.\n       Section 4: Proceedings In Forma Pauperis:\n       This section reforms the filing of suits in forma pauperis \n     by prisoners.\n       Requires an inmate seeking to file in forma pauperis to \n     submit to the court a certified copy of the inmate's prison \n     trust fund account.\n       Requires prisoners seeking to file in forma pauperis to \n     pay, in installments, the full amount of filing fees, unless \n     the prisoner has absolutely no assets.\n       Provides for appointed counsel for indigent in forma \n     pauperis litigants, and requires the court to dismiss a suit \n     filed in forma pauperis if the allegation of poverty is \n     untrue, or if the suit is frivolous or malicious.\n       Requires payment of costs by unsuccessful prisoner \n     litigants in the same manner as filing fees, if the judgment \n     against the prisoner includes costs.\n       Prohibits, except in narrow circumstances, the filing of an \n     in forma pauperis suit by a prisoner, who, on at least 3 \n     prior occasions, has brought a suit that was dismissed \n     because it was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state \n     a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n       Section 5: Judicial Screening:\n       Requires judicial pre-screening of prisoner suits against \n     government entities or employees; requires dismissal of suits \n     which fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, \n     or which seek monetary damages from an immune defendant.\n       Section 6: Federal Tort Claims:\n       Limits prisoner suits against the federal government for \n     mental or emotional injury under the Federal Tort Claims Act \n     to instances where the plaintiff shows physical injury as \n     well.\n       Section 7: Earned Release Credit or Good Time Credit \n     Revocation:\n       Reforms provisions governing the awarding of ``good time'' \n     credit in the federal prison system.\n       Subsections (a) and (b): Permits a federal court to order \n     the revocation of a federal prisoner's good time credit as a \n     sanction for the filing of malicious or harassing claims, or \n     for the knowing presentation of false evidence to the court.\n       Subsection (c): Revises present ``good time'' statute.\n       Requires exemplary adherence to prison rules by all \n     prisoners in order to qualify for good time credit and \n     permits Bureau of Prisons to award partial credit at its \n     option.\n       Provides that progress toward a high school equivalency \n     degree should be a factor for consideration in awarding good \n     time credit.\n       Provides that future awards of good time credit will not \n     vest prior to the prisoner's actual release date. Returns to \n     the standard that applied prior to the enactment of the \n     Sentencing Reform Act of 1986.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1995.\n     Re Frivolous Inmate Litigation: Proposed Amendment to the \n         Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: We write on behalf of the Inmate \n     Litigation Task Force of the National Association of \n     Attorneys General to express our strong support for the \n     Prison Litigation Reform Act, which we understand you intend \n     to offer as an amendment to the Appropriations Bill for \n     Commerce, Justice, State and Related Agencies. As you know, \n     the issue of frivolous inmate litigation has been a major \n     priority of this Association for a number of years. Although \n     a number of states--including our own--have enacted \n\n[[Page S 14418]]\n\n     state legislation to address this issue, the states alone \n     cannot solve this problem because the vast majority of these \n     suits are brought in federal courts under federal laws. We \n     thank you for recognizing the importance of federal \n     legislation to curb the epidemic of frivolous inmate \n     litigation that is plaguing this country.\n       Although numbers are not available for all of the states, \n     33 states have estimated that together inmate civil rights \n     suits cost them at least $54.5 million annually. \n     Extrapolating this figure to all 50 states, we estimate that \n     inmate civil rights suits cost states at least $81.3 million \n     per year. Experience at both the federal and state level \n     suggests that, while all of these cases are not frivolous, \n     more than 95 percent of inmate civil rights suits are \n     dismissed without the inmate receiving anything. Although \n     occasional meritorious claims absorb state resources, \n     nonetheless, we believe the vast majority of the $81.3 \n     million figure is attributable to the non-meritorious cases.\n       We have not had an opportunity to discuss the specifics of \n     the amendment with every Attorney General, however, we are \n     confident that they would concur in our view that this \n     amendment will take us a long way toward curing the vexatious \n     and expensive problem of frivolous inmate lawsuits. Thank you \n     again for championing this important issue, along with \n     Senators Hatch, Kyl, Reid and others, as it is a top priority \n     for virtually every Attorney General. Your leadership on this \n     issue and your continued commitment to this common sense \n     legal reform is very important to us and our colleagues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Frankie Sue Del Papa,\n       Attorney General of Nevada, Chair, NAAG Inmate Litigation \n     Task Force.\n     Daniel E. Lungren,\n       Attorney General of California, Chair, NAAG Criminal Law \n     Committee,\n     Grant Woods,\n       Attorney General of Arizona, Vice-Chair, NAAG Inmate \n     Litigation Task Force,\n     Jeremiah W. Nixon,\n       Attorney General of Missouri, Vice-Chair, NAAG Criminal Law \n     Committee.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the majority \nleader and Senators Kyl, Abraham, Reid, Thurmond, Specter, Hutchison, \nD'Amato, Santorum, and Gramm in introducing the Prison Litigation \nReform Act of 1995. This landmark legislation will help bring relief to \na civil justice system overburdened by frivolous prisoner lawsuits. \nJailhouse lawyers with little else to do are tying our courts in knots \nwith an endless flood of frivolous litigation.\n  Our legislation will also help restore balance to prison conditions \nlitigation and will ensure that Federal court orders are limited to \nremedying actual violations of prisoners' rights, not letting prisoners \nout of jail. It is past time to slam shut the revolving door on the \nprison gate and to put the key safely out of reach of overzealous \nFederal courts.\n  As of January 1994, 24 corrections agencies reported having court-\nmandated population caps. Nearly every day we hear of vicious crimes \ncommitted by individuals who should have been locked up. Not all of \nthese tragedies are the result of court-ordered population caps, of \ncourse, but such caps are a part of the problem. While prison \nconditions that actually violate the Constitution should not be allowed \nto persist, I believe that the courts have gone too far in \nmicromanaging our Nation's prisons.\n  Our legislation also addresses the flood of frivolous lawsuits \nbrought by inmates. In 1994, over 39,000 lawsuits were filed by inmates \nin Federal courts, a staggering 15 percent increase over the number \nfiled the previous year. The vast majority of these suits are \ncompletely without merit. Indeed, roughly 94.7 percent are dismissed \nbefore the pretrial phase, and only a scant 3.1 percent have enough \nvalidity to reach trial. In my State of Utah, 297 inmate suits were \nfiled in Federal courts during 1994, which accounted for 22 percent of \nall Federal civil cases filed in Utah last year. I should emphasize \nthat these numbers do not include habeas corpus petitions or other \ncases challenging the inmate's conviction or sentence. The crushing \nburden of these frivolous suits makes it difficult for courts to \nconsider meritorious claims.\n  In one frivolous case in Utah, an inmate sued demanding that he be \nissued Reebok or L.A. Gear brand shoes instead of the Converse brand \nbeing issued. In another case, an inmate deliberately flooded his cell, \nand then sued the officers who cleaned up the mess because they got his \nPinochle cards wet.\n  It is time to stop this ridiculous waste of the taxpayers' money. The \nhuge costs imposed on State governments to defend against these \nmeritless suits is another kind of crime committed against law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, this legislation enjoys broad, bipartisan support from \nState attorneys general across the Nation. We believe with them that it \nis time to wrest control of our prisons from the lawyers and the \ninmates and return that control to competent administrators appointed \nto look out for society's interests as well as the legitimate needs of \nprisoners. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and look forward \nto securing its quick passage by the Senate.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, special masters, who are supposed to assist \njudges as factfinders in complex litigation, have all too often been \nimproperly used in prison condition cases. In Arizona, special masters \nhave micromanaged the department of corrections, and have performed all \nmanner of services in behalf of convicted felons, from maintaining \nlavish law libraries to distributing up to 750 tons of Christmas \npackages each year. Special masters appointed to oversee prison \nlitigation have cost Arizona taxpayers more than $320,000 since 1992. \nOne special master was even allowed to hire a chauffeur, at taxpayers' \nexpense, because he said he had a bad back.\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act, introduced as an amendment to the \nCommerce/Justice/State appropriations bill, requires the Federal \njudiciary, not the States, to foot the bill for special masters in \nprison litigation cases. Last July the Arizona legislature and Governor \nSymington cut off funds to special masters. It's time we take the \nArizona model to the rest of the States.\n  The amendment also addresses prison litigation reform. Many people \nthink of prison inmates as spending their free time in the weight room \nor the television lounge. But the most crowded place in today's prisons \nmay be the law library. Federal prison lawsuits have risen from 2,000 \nin 1970 to 39,000 in 1994. In the words of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals, suing has because, recreational activity for long-term \nresidents of our prisons.\n  Today's system seems to encourage prisoners to file with impunity. \nAfter all, it's free. And a courtroom is certainly a more hospitable \nplace to spend an afternoon than a prison cell. Prisoners file free \nlawsuits in response to almost any perceived slight or inconvenience--\nbeing served chunky instead of creamy peanut butter, for instance, or \nbeing denied the use of a Gameboy video game--a case which prompted a \nlawsuit in my home State of Arizona.\n  These prisoners are victimizing society twice--first when they commit \nthe crime that put them in prison, and second when they waste our hard-\nearned tax dollars while cases based on serious grievances languish on \nthe court calendar.\n  In Arizona, Attorney General Grant Woods, who is here with us today, \nused to spend well over $1 million a year processing and defending \nagainst frivolous inmate lawsuits. But Grant successfully championed a \nreform bill, which went into effect last year, and the number of prison \nlawsuits was cut in half. Arizona prisoners still have the right to \nseek legal redress for meritorious claims, but the time and money once \nspent defending frivolous suits is now used to settle legitimate claims \nin a timely manner.\n  But the States alone cannot solve this problem. The vast majority of \nfrivolous suits are brought in Federal courts under Federal laws--which \nis why I introduced the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 last may \nwith Senators Dole and Hatch. We are incorporating that legislation \ninto the Commerce/Justice/State amendment.\n  Federal prisoners are churning out lawsuits with no regard to this \ncost to the taxpayers or their legal merit. We can no longer ignore \nthis abuse of our court system and taxpayers' funds. With the support \nof attorneys general around the country, I am confident that we will \nsee real reform on this issue.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today \n\n[[Page S 14419]]\n  will play a critical role in restoring public confidence in \ngovernment's ability to protect the public safety. Moreover, it will \naccomplish this important purpose not by spending more taxpayer money \nbut by saving it.\n  I would like to focus my remarks on the provisions addressing the \nproper scope of court-ordered remedies in prison conditions cases.\n  In many jurisdictions, including my own State of Michigan, judicial \norders entered under Federal law have effectively turned control of the \nprison system away from elected officials accountable to the taxpayer, \nand over to the courts. The courts, in turn, raise the costs of running \nprisons far beyond what is necessary. In the process, they also \nundermine the legitimacy and punitive and deterrent effect of prison \nsentences.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about how this works.\n  Under a series of judicial decrees resulting from Justice Department \nsuits against the Michigan Department of Corrections, the Federal \ncourts now monitor our State prisons to determine.\n  First, how warm the food is; second, how bright the lights are; \nthird, whether there are electrical outlets in each cell; fourth, \nwhether windows are inspected and up to code; fifth, whether prisoners' \nhair is cut only by licensed barbers; and sixth, and whether air and \nwater temperatures are comfortable.\n  This would be bad enough if a court had ever found that Michigan's \nprison system was at some point in violation of the Constitution, or if \nconditions there had been inhumane. But that is not the case.\n  To the contrary, nearly all of Michigan's facilities are fully \naccredited by the American Corrections Association. We have what may be \nthe most extensive training program in the Nation for corrections \nofficers. Our rate of prison violence is among the lowest of any State. \nAnd we spend an average of $4,000 a year per prisoner for health care, \nincluding nearly $1,700 for mental health services.\n\n  Rather, the judicial intervention is the result of a consent decree \nthat Michigan entered into in 1982--13 years ago--that was supposed to \nend a lawsuit filed at the same time. Instead, the decree has been a \nsource of continuous litigation and intervention by the court into the \nminutia of prison operations.\n  I think this is all wrong. People deserve to keep their tax dollars \nor have them spent on projects they approve. They deserve better than \nto have their money spent, on keeping prisoners in conditions some \nFederal judge feels are desirable, although not required by any \nprovision of the Constitution or any law. And they certainly don't need \nit spent on defending against endless prisoner lawsuits.\n  Meanwhile, criminals, while they must be accorded their \nconstitutional rights, deserve to be punished. Obviously, they should \nnot be tortured or treated cruelly. At the same time, they also should \nnot have all the rights and privileges the rest of us enjoy. Rather, \ntheir lives should, on the whole, be describable by the old concept \nknown as ``hard time.''\n  By interfering with the fulfillment of this punitive function, the \ncourts are effectively seriously undermining the entire criminal \njustice system. The legislation we are introducing today will return \nsanity and State control to our prison systems.\n  Our bill forbids courts from entering orders for prospective relief \n(such as regulating food temperatures) unless the order is necessary to \ncorrect violations of individual plaintiffs' Federal rights. It also \nrequires that the relief be narrowly drawn and be the least intrusive \nmeans of protecting the Federal rights. And it directs courts to give \nsubstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the \noperation of the criminal justice system caused by the relief.\n  It also provides that any party can seek to have a court decree ended \nafter 2 years, and that the court will order it ended unless there is \nstill a constitutional violation that needs to be corrected.\n  As a result, no longer will prison administration be turned over to \nFederal judges for the indefinite future for the slightest reason. \nInstead, the States will be able to run prisons as they see fit unless \nthere is a constitutional violation, in which case a narrowly tailored \norder to correct the violation may be entered.\n  This is a balanced bill that allows the courts to step in where they \nare needed, but puts an end to unnecessary judicial intervention and \nmicromanagement. I thank all my colleagues for their interest in this \nmatter and hope we will be able to get something enacted soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, as we move toward consideration of \nthe Senate Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, which \nincreases funding for State prison construction by $250 million and \nallocates not one penny for crime prevention programs, it is important \nto take time to examine our current policies and consider our \ndirection.\n  The Justice Department recently released a survey of our Nation's \nprisons, jails, parole, and probation services. According to the \nreport, a record 5.1 million Americans--2.7 percent of all adults--were \nbehind bars, on probation or on parole in 1994. Last year the Justice \nDepartment reported that we passed the mark of having 1 million people \nin prison. That puts the United States in the dubious position of \nhaving the second highest incarceration rate in the industrialized \nworld. As our prison population has soared, our crime rate has been \nunaffected. Before we allocate scarce resources on more prisons, it \nmakes sense to consider our alternatives and consult with experts.\n  Last December, I sponsored a survey of wardens and inmates in eight \nStates in an effort to inform this debate. Rather than an all-or-\nnothing distribution of funds, when asked how they would spend an extra \n$10 million to fight crime in their communities, wardens split the \nmoney evenly: 43 percent on prevention and 57 percent on punishment. \nEven the 1994 crime bill fell far short of this equation, spending 75 \npercent of its funding on punishment and a mere 25 percent for \nprevention programs. This appropriations bill would further the \nimbalance by denying any funds for the crime bill's prevention \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a Chicago Sun-Times article on the Justice \nDepartment survey be included in the Record at this point.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Aug. 28, 1995]\n\nPrison, Probation Rolls Soaring: Total Hits 5.1 Million, 2.7 Percent of \n                               All Adults\n\n                          (By Alan C. Miller)\n\n       Washington.--A record 5.1 million Americans--2.7 percent of \n     the nation's adult population--were behind bars, on probation \n     or on parole last year, the Justice Department reported \n     Sunday.\n       Since 1980, state and federal prison populations have \n     increased by 213 percent, and probation rolls have jumped by \n     165 percent. The average annual rate of growth has been 7.6 \n     percent; the figure for 1994 was 3.9 percent.\n       Nearly 3 million people were on probation as of last Dec. \n     31, a Bureau of Justice Statistics study found.\n       Half of those on probation were found guilty of committing \n     a felony; one in seven had been convicted of driving under \n     the influence of alcohol.\n       Another 690,000 people were on parole, or conditionally \n     released under supervision, after serving a prison term. \n     Parolees can be returned to prison for violating a set of \n     rules or committing another offense. All but 5 percent had \n     served time for felonies.\n       The Justice Department survey found that 82 percent of \n     those on probation and parole had maintained regular contact \n     with a supervising agency as required. Another 9 percent had \n     failed to report or could not be located. The rest were not \n     required to maintain regular contact.\n       Texas had the most people on probation and parole, \n     503,000--more than 3.8 percent of the state's adults. \n     California followed with 370,000.\n       Illinois had about 103,000 people on probation and parole.\n       Twelve states and the federal probation system showed a \n     decrease in the number of people on probation. The biggest \n     decrease was in South Dakota, down 6.2 percent, followed by \n     California, down 5.8 percent.\n       The figures show that a higher percentage of men and white \n     people are on probation than are in the prison system. Women \n     make up 21 percent of all probationers and only 6 percent of \n     all prisoners. Blacks make up 32 percent of those on \n     probation and 50 percent of the prison population.\n       Half of those in prison have committed a violent crime; 80 \n     percent have previous convictions.\n       Prisons are running at 20 percent over capacity, and thus \n     more than 4 percent of those sentenced to prison terms are \n     being held in local jails despite considerable prison \n     construction, forcing the early release of some inmates, said \n     Lawrence A. Greenfeld, a deputy director of the Bureau of \n     Justice Statistics.\n       Criminal justice experts said the sharp increases reflect \n     tougher sentencing on a range of crimes as well as a greater \n     proportion of drug arrests involving longer prison terms.\n       At the same time, they said the consequent pressure to ease \n     congestion in packed prisons and jails has led to expanded \n     use of alternatives to incarceration or early release.\n\n[[Page S 14428]]\n\n       Alfred A. Blumstein, a criminologist at the Heinz School of \n     Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University in \n     Pittsburgh, Pa., said he believes the criminal justice system \n     ``may be overextending itself'' and that increased emphasis \n     on such programs as drug treatment and prevention may be more \n     effective in the long run than meting out harsher sentences.\n       ``Just by locking away more people, we do avert crimes, but \n     at a cost,'' Blumstein said. ``We have no good estimates of \n     how much benefit we get for . . . the cost of $25,000 per \n     person per year in prison or jail.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14427-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GREEN LIGHTS, MONTREAL PROTOCOL\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the amendment I offered yesterday \nwill restore the EPA Administrator's ability to fulfill our obligations \nunder the Montreal Protocol. In addition, it will authorize the EPA \nAdministrator to fund the successful Green programs, including the \nGreen Lights Program and Energy Star Buildings Programs.\n  I need not go into detail on the importance of the Montreal Protocol. \nLast year, the Congress appropriated $119 million for these important \nprograms--$101 million for the Green programs and roughly $17 million \nfor the Montreal Protocol multilateral fund. This amendment will allow \nthe Administrator to spend up to $100 million on these programs, a 13-\npercent cut from last years levels.\n  Negotiated and signed by President Reagan and expanded and \nimplemented by President Bush, the Montreal Protocol is working to \nreduce the production and use of ozone-depleting substances. President \nReagan believed it was vital that we fulfill our commitments under this \nimportant treaty. President Bush took a leadership position and urged \nthe rest of the world to agree to a complete phase out of a number of \nozone depleting substances. President Bush also concluded the \nnegotiations, begun by President Reagan, to establish the multilateral \nfund.\n  Now, let me explain the fund, because this is what we are debating \ntoday. The multilateral fund was created in 1990 in order to assist \ndeveloping countries in their efforts to phaseout ozone depleters. \nSince the development of the fund, 100 developing countries have \nratified the protocol and agreed to the protocol's strict reduction \nrequirements. They did this with the understanding that the fund would \nassist these developing countries in transferring the technology \nnecessary to end this use of ozone-depleting substances. Most of this \ntechnology comes from the United States.\n  Failure to pay our share of the fund would force developing countries \nto end their protocol obligations. This would lead to increased use of \nozone-depleting substances in developing countries and offset the tens \nof billions of dollars spent by the developed countries to phase them \nout.\n  Let me summarize.\n  No money to the fund.\n  Violation of our commitment to the treaty.\n  Greater use of CFC's by developing countries.\n  Faster depletion rates of the ozone.\n  More negative health effects, such as skin cancer and cataracts.\n  We must maintain our commitment to protect the ozone layer.\n  My colleagues may argue that funds for the Montreal protocol belong \nin the State Department budget, not the EPA budget. As a member of the \nForeign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I am continuing to work \nto ensure that the protocol has adequately funded the State Department \nbudget. However, I believe that funding for international programs is \nso limited, that offsetting the loss in this bill would be impossible.\n  Since 1991, almost one-third of the money for the fund has come from \nEPA. We made the decision, in 1990, to require EPA to assist the State \nDepartment. Let me read from section 617b of the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990, which many of us here today voted for. Quote:\n\n       The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     State, shall support global participation in the Montreal \n     protocol by providing technical and financial assistance to \n     developing countries.\n\nAnd at that time we authorized $30 million to be spent for the fund.\n  The phaseout of CFC's is not just an international political issue, \nit is a technical, industrial, and environmental issue, on which EPA is \nrespected globally. Further, through its experience in the United \nStates of ridding the country of ozone-depleting substances, EPA has a \ngood understanding of the benefits of U.S. technologies, and has been \nable to promote those technologies in other countries.\n  This is no time to end this progress.\n  Let me spend a minute on the Green Lights Program. I remember \nPresident Bush searching for alternatives to the overregulation, \ncommand and control policies of the 1970's and 1980's. He longed to \nfind a way to control pollution in a nonregulatory, free-market manner. \nHis legacy to the environment is his success in developing just such a \nprogram.\n  The Green Lights Program, and Energy Star Programs, are a testament \nto the type of innovative programs we must implement if we wish to \nreduce the regulatory burden faced by industry today. The programs are \nvoluntary, reduce energy use, decrease our dependence on foreign \nenergy, save business money, and stimulate markets for clean, \nalternative energy technologies and services.\n  Green Lights is simple. EPA provides technical assistance to help a \ncompany survey its facilities and upgrade its lighting. That's it. \nSince its inception, Green Lights has saved companies hundreds of \nmillions of dollars and dramatically reduced air pollution emissions. \nAll this without one regulation.\n\n  This is the most successful public-private partnership running. Just \nask companies in my own State, such as IBM, our largest utility--Green \nMountain Power, Jay Peak Ski area, and others.\n  Ask the Mobile Corp., who points out in this article in Time magazine \nthat with the help of EPA Green Lights they have reduced their lighting \nenergy costs by 49 percent.\n  Eliminating this program now would be unwise. This program reduces \nthe need for regulation. Without Green Lights we might need more \nregulation to accomplish what is now being done with a voluntary \npartnership.\n  I believe one of the reasons this program is slated for elimination \nis that it is considered corporate welfare. Let me tell you why it is \nnot.\n  EPA does not give any grants or financial assistance to Green Lights \npartners.\n  All funds are spent for information dissemination and communication.\n  The resulting investment by participants is more than 50 times the \nFederal investment.\n  Green Lights participants represent a wide range of entities, \nincluding 360 schools, 193 hospitals, numerous churches, local \ngovernments, small businesses, and nonprofit groups.\n  Overcoming market barriers is valuable to many, but beyond the reach \nof individual organizations. Many businesses cannot afford to keep on \nhand the technical expertise that EPA has assembled to help business \nsucceed in reducing their energy costs in this manner.\n  Green Lights is a successful public-private partnership. It creates \njobs and opportunities for sound energy use and savings, while at the \nsame time preventing pollution. This is a model, nonregulatory program.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to seriously consider the \nconsequences of ending these two vital programs. My amendment does not \nincrease spending, nor does it cut from other areas of the bill. The \namendment simply requests that the EPA Administrator be allowed to \nspend, within available funds, enough funds to keep these important \nprograms up and running.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14428-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14428-S14429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ABRAHAM SACKS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat citizen of the State of Michigan, Abraham Sacks. On October 7, \n1995, 50 years to the month when 1st Lt. Abraham Sacks returned to the \nUnited States from Europe, civilian Abraham ``Abe'' Sacks will receive \nhis World War II medals. Fifty years--for some people that is a \nlifetime; in many families that is two generations. For Abe Sacks, it \nhas not even been something to think about.\n  Abe served five years in the U.S. Army from 1941 until his discharge \nin January 1946. And since then, he has not had the time to think about \nthe medals he never received. Abe and his wife Bea have been too busy \nliving their lives. They settled into their new \n\n[[Page S 14429]]\nhome in Huntington Woods, MI. They were blessed with two children, and \nhave since watched their children grow and start families of their own. \nThey have become involved in their community by volunteering at their \nlocal synagogue and for political campaigns. Although they have now \nretired, they have continued to volunteer at the synagogue and with \nSCORE. Has Abe had time to think about medals he earned but never \nreceived? That was not Abe's style and still is not.\n  Several months ago when Bea discovered some papers in Abe's Army \nchest showing that he never received his medals, she took it upon \nherself to correct this oversight. She contacted the powers that be, \nand on October 7, 1995, at a gathering of family, friends, and other \nveterans, 1st Lt. Abraham Sacks will receive the medals he earned \nfighting for his country in World War II. Abe will be the recipient of \nthe European-African-Middle Eastern Medal with Silver Star, the African \nCampaign Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the World War II \nVictory Medal, the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany, and the Good \nConduct Medal. On behalf of a country that is grateful to the men and \nwomen of our military forces, I want to congratulate 1st Lt. and dear \nfriend Abe Sacks. It is never too late to honor someone of his caliber, \ngoodness, and integrity. I know Abe will display these medals with the \nsame pride he exhibited when he served his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14428-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THOMAS L. AYRES ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                            VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like for the Senate to \nrecognize the retirement of Thomas L. Ayres from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs after more than 41 years of exemplary service in \nproviding health care to the armed service members and veterans of our \nnation. On September 30, 1995, Mr. Ayres will retire from his position \nas the Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in \nAugusta, GA.\n  Tom Ayres began providing health care during his service with the \nUnited States Army from 1955 until 1959 at the 279th Station Hospital \nin Berlin. After his service in the Army, he started his career with \nthe Veterans Administration by becoming a nursing assistant at the \nVeterans Administration Hospital in Marion, Indiana. From 1962 until \n1969, Tom Ayres worked as a supervisory recreation specialist at the \nVeterans Hospital in Brecksville, OH. From 1969 until 1972, he served \nas a voluntary services officer at Veterans Administration Hospitals in \nboth Madison, WI and Gainesville, FL. In 1972, Tom Ayres became a \nmedical administration assistant at the Veterans Hospital in Madison, \nWI.\n  Since 1972, Tom Ayres has earned appointments to positions of \nincreased responsibility within the Department of Veterans Affairs. In \n1976, he became a hospital administration specialist and soon \nthereafter was transferred to the Veterans Affairs central office and \nserved as the executive assistant to the Associate Chief Medical \nDirector for Operations.\n  Tom Ayres received an appointment to the position of Medical Center \nDirector of the Veterans Administration Hospital in Salisbury, NC in \n1981. Nine years later, he became the Director of the two-division \nVeterans Administration Medical Center in Augusta, GA. He also serves \nas the Associate Administrator for Veterans Affairs at the Medical \nCollege of Georgia and as a member of the Medical College of Georgia's \nClinical Enterprise Executive Committee.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career in providing health \nservices for U.S. veterans throughout our great Nation, Tom Ayres has \nreceived numerous awards based on the exemplary performance of his \nduties. His awards include the National Daughters of American Veterans \nCommander Award, the Award for Valor from the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, three Superior Performance Awards, and five consecutive \nExecutive Performance awards. In 1990, he received the Presidential \nRank Award from the President of the United States.\n  It is important to note that his compassion and sense of civic \nresponsibility does not start and end with his job. Tom Ayres is an \nactive participant with the local United Way, Kiwanis Club, American \nLegion, Senior Executive Association, and the American College of \nHospital Administrators. In addition, he serves on the administrative \nboard of Trinity on the Hill Church and is a life member of the \nDisabled American Veterans and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Thomas L. \nAyres for his outstanding career spent in service to our Nation's \nveterans. He is a model citizen in every sense of the term. We wish \nhim, his wife Christa, and their children and grandchildren Godspeed \nand every success for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14429-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14429-S14430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OUT OF PRINT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, Bob Samuelson had a column \nin the Washington Post on the scarcity of various Government statistics \nin printed form.\n  Mr. Samuelson wrote that some of the reports published by the Census \nBureau are going out of print. He cited the fact that the Census Bureau \nissued only 635 printed reports in 1994 as opposed to over 1,000 the \nBureau printed in 1992.\n  His concern over the scarcity of printed statistics led him to \ncontact the Census Bureau. Mr. Samuelson learned that the Census Bureau \nis still researching and compiling all of the same data and information \nit has in the past. Only now, rather than publishing its reports in \nprinted form, the Census is circulating statistics on the Internet.\n  Lately there has been a great deal of attention surrounding the \nInternet and the information superhighway.\n  I have to confess that my knowledge of the Internet is limited. \nAlthough, I do understand that a large and varied amount of information \nmay be accessed by using the system.\n  I join Mr. Samuelson in his concern that those who do not have access \nto the Internet, or choose not to use the information superhighway, \nwill not have the same access to the vital statistics published by the \nCensus Bureau that they have had in the past.\n  While I do not dispute the benefits that accompany the Internet and \nother similar technological advances--especially in the field of \neducation--I am concerned that we might overlook the usefulness and \npracticality of printed materials in the name of progress.\n  Having access to a wide range of information at our fingertips is \ndefinitely an advantage of the Internet. We must be mindful, however, \nthat there is no substitute for the printed word.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Robert Samuelson's column entitled ``Out of \nPrint'' be printed in the Record at this point.\n  The column follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                              Out of Print\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       My name is Robert, and I am a numbers junkie. I \n     compulsively scour the Statistical Abstract for intriguing \n     indicators of our national condition--the fact, for example, \n     that state lotteries collect $25 billion annually. Naturally, \n     I am also a big fan of the Census Bureau, which publishes the \n     abstract and conducts surveys on everything from our incomes \n     to our housing patterns. So it pains me to report that Census \n     is now committing a colossal blunder. It is slowly going out \n     of print. Literally.\n       The Statistical Abstract momentarily seems safe, but scores \n     of other printed reports are simply being eliminated. In 1992 \n     Census issued 1,035 reports; last year the number was 635, \n     and the retreat from print has only begun. Gone are, among \n     others: ``Earnings by Occupation and Education,'' ``Poverty \n     Areas in the United States'' and ``Language Use in the United \n     States.'' This is absurd. We go to great trouble to collect \n     this information, and now Census is suppressing it.\n       The losers are not just statistics addicts. Our public \n     conversations depend heavily on these dry numbers. The shape \n     our concept of who we are, of how society is performing and \n     of what government should or shouldn't do. Political speeches \n     routinely spit out statistics that can be made to tell \n     stories: some true, some not so true. Keeping the \n     conversations honest requires that the basic data be easily \n     accessible to anyone who wants them.\n       When I say Census is ``suppressing,'' I don't mean that \n     it's deliberately hiding its surveys. As a reporter, I've \n     asked Census for information hundreds of times; I can't \n     recall an instance when answers, when available, weren't \n     provided quickly. The culture of the place is to release \n     information. By its lights, \n\n[[Page S 14430]]\n     Census isn't abandoning print so much as it's shifting its data to the \n     Information Superhighway. Statistics are being distributed by \n     CD-ROMs and the Internet. Already, Census brags that its \n     World Wide Web site is receiving 50,000 hits a day. Sounds \n     amazing.\n       It isn't. Those 50,000 daily hits are a lot less \n     breathtaking than they seem, even if the figure is accurate \n     (and I have my doubts). In May, Interactive Age, a trade \n     publication, surveyed Internet sites. It reported that \n     Pathfinder (the site for Time Warner publications, such as \n     Time and People) had about 686,000 daily hits, Playboy had \n     about 675,000, and HotWired (the site for Wired magazine) had \n     about 429,000. I mention these popular sites because they \n     belong to magazines. As yet, none is forsaking the printed \n     page for the glories of the Internet.\n       There are good reasons for this. One is that the number of \n     daily hits on a Web site exaggerates how many people use it; \n     the same person may hit the same site repeatedly. Another \n     reason is that the Internet hasn't yet evolved into an \n     effective platform for advertising. But the main reason is \n     that, for many purposes, the printed page is still superior \n     to the computer screen. You can flip pages faster than you \n     can search computer files. You can read a magazine standing \n     in a subway or lying in a hammock.\n       Census's shift from print clearly discriminates against \n     people (including me) who don't surf the Internet or use CD-\n     ROMs. We remain the vast majority. American Demographics \n     magazine recently reported a number of surveys that tried to \n     measure U.S. Internet use in 1994. The surveys put usage of \n     the World Wide Web between 2 million and 13.5 million people, \n     which is at most about 5 percent. The average income of \n     Internet households was $67,000, which is the richest fifth \n     of Americans. But it's not just computer clods or the \n     unaffluent who will suffer.\n       Carl Haub is a demographer at the Population Reference \n     Bureau in Washington. He's a big user of Census statistics \n     and is comfortable cruising in cyberspace. ``It's going to be \n     a disaster for the average analyst,'' he says. Downloading \n     and printing data from the Internet can take hours. Getting a \n     number from a CD-ROM is often a lot harder than getting it \n     from a book. To Haub, Census is transferring a lot of the \n     cost--in time and money--of making statistical information \n     useful to people like him.\n       Martha Farnsworth Riche, director of the Census Bureau, \n     admits as much. ``If someone else can do it, let's shift it \n     to the outside,'' she says. ``We've had a hiring freeze since \n     at least 1992, and those [printed] reports take an enormous \n     amount of time from professionals.'' They need to concentrate \n     on doing surveys of ``an economy and population that are \n     changing dramatically. Our statistics have fallen behind.'' \n     Only Census can collect much of this data, she says. Let \n     academics and analysts prepare reports.\n       Up to a point, Riche has my sympathies. The Constitution \n     created the census (Article 1, Section 2), and social and \n     economic surveys are a basic function of modern government. \n     Some congressional proposals to cut the agency's budget \n     sharply are stupid beyond words. But that said, the new \n     approach is misguided. The danger of over-relying on \n     outsiders to organize and analyze basic data is that \n     statistics may fall hostage to special pleaders or \n     incompetents. Printed Census reports provide an easy way to \n     check self-interested or faulty claims.\n       Print's other great virtue is that it guarantees a historic \n     record. Computer technology is changing so rapidly that data \n     committed to one technology may no longer be easily \n     accessible if that technology vanishes. ``The CD-ROMs that \n     we're so excited about today--20 years from now, no one will \n     use them,'' says Richard Rockwell, director of the Inter-\n     University Consortium for Political and Social Research. \n     ``The book is a highly advanced technology for preserving \n     some kinds of information.'' Exactly.\n       Let's not become too infatuated too soon with the \n     Information Superhighway. Census should be issuing its data \n     in computer-friendly ways, but not as a substitute for \n     printed reports. A jaunt on the Internet--piloted by my \n     friend Steve--only affirmed my skepticism. Steve typed the \n     Census Web address (http://www.census.gov), and up popped the \n     ``home page'' designating me as the 567,352nd visitor. Unless \n     the count began 10 days earlier (and it didn't), that was a \n     lot fewer than 50,000 daily hits. I informed a Census \n     official. He was mystified. After checking, he said there \n     were other ways of accessing the Web site that didn't raise \n     the count. Hmm. Could be. But it also shows how, on the \n     Information Superhighway, we're still navigating in the \n     dark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14429-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SPARKY ANDERSON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, ``It was the best of times. It was \nthe worst of times.'' It was 1984, and the Detroit Tigers won it all, \nfrom opening day in April until the final game of the World Series in \nOctober, a perfect season, never out of first place, with Sparky at the \nhelm. It is 1995, a not so perfect season; in fact, a bummer of a \nseason, with Sparky at the helm, getting a look at the new, young \nplayers, and most likely closing out the 1984 era.\n  On Sunday, October 1, in Baltimore, the Orioles play the Tigers in \nthe last regular game of the season. But to me, what is most poignant \nis that I believe we will be seeing Sparky Anderson in a Detroit Tigers \nuniform for the last time. And when he leaves the field that day, along \nwith Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker, the last of the 1984 Tigers' team \nwill be gone.\n  Sparky Anderson is baseball. As a kid, his dream was to be a player, \nbut from all early indications--he played only 1 year in the majors--he \nwas meant to be a manager. He studied the game constantly from boyhood \nto this day. When he sits in the dugout, you can see those eyes darting \naround the field, taking in every movement of everyone on the field and \nat the plate, incessantly studying and instructing his players, both \nveterans and rookies.\n  Sparky Anderson has a remarkable record as a manger. He is the third \nwinningest manager in big league history--only Connie Mack and John \nMcGraw won more games. But he is the only manager to win a World Series \nin each league, with the Cincinnati Reds and the Tigers, and he is the \nfirst to win 100 games in each league. He is, without question, headed \nfor the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  Every indication is that Sparky will be leaving the Detroit Tigers \nand will announce this shortly after the season ends on October 1. But, \nI do not think Sparky will leave baseball. He will be in some baseball \nuniform next year. I am sure that we will turn on the television some \nday and see Sparky going to home plate to hand the umpire the starting \nlineup, we will see him sitting in the dugout, chewing his bubblegum or \nhis sunflower seeds, and his eyes will be darting around the field, and \nwe will see him walk to the pitcher's mound in the late innings, with \nthat familiar skip to avoid stepping on the third base foul line.\n  Maybe we will get to see one of those nose-to-nose arguments with the \numpire, and we will certainly look forward to hearing a post-game \nanalysis, and in spite of that fractured English of his, we will get a \nfirst rate lesson in the way this great game of baseball works, for \nmore than anything else, Sparky is a baseball purist, a lover of the \ngame and totally loyal to the institution we call baseball.\n  Detroit will miss Sparky Anderson, but we hope he will hang around \nthe game long enough to break John McGraw's record, and maybe even, \nsomeday, overtake the record of the great Connie Mack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/27/senate-section/article/S14430-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Therefore, the Senate could \nbe asked to be in session late into the evening on Thursday in order to \ncomplete the appropriations process prior to the end of the fiscal \nyear.\n  I also will indicate that I think the House will take up the \ncontinuing resolution tomorrow. I talked with Speaker Gingrich this \nmorning.
