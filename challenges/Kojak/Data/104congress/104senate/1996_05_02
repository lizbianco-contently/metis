Mr. President, 3 years ago, President Clinton raised \nAmerica's taxes in the misguided effort to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit. He claimed that it was time for the rich to ``pay their fair \nshare,'' but as usual, the middle class felt the brunt of his tax \nhikes.\n  Mr. President, with the gas prices soaring to record levels, I rise \ntoday with America on my mind to call for the immediate repeal of the \npunitive and regressive gas tax hikes that you put in place and the \nDemocratic Congress in 1993 forced on America in the name of \n``fairness.''\n\n  You see, I do not believe that it is fair to force families, and \nespecially families that have to have a certain product or item for \nagriculture, who are in charge of producing the food and fiber, the \nvery necessity of America, to get the taxes hiked on them around 30 \npercent just to pay for programs like AmeriCorps while ignoring the \nreal problems like welfare reform, saving Medicare, or our criminal \njustice system.\n  Since 1992, his 4.3-cents-per-gallon tax increase has generated over \n$11 billion for the Federal Government. It has come directly out of the \npockets of America's families. I believe it is time to put that money \nback.\n  President Clinton is inconsistent. In 1993, he raised America's taxes \nclaiming he cared about the deficit, but\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\nwhen it came around to 1995, he vetoed a budget that would have \nbalanced the budget. The President's plan is more taxing, more \nspending, more rhetoric. It is time to stop taxing, time to stop \nspending, and it is time to stop the rhetoric and help America's \nfamilies keep more of their take-home pay in their back pocket.\n  In the State of Montana, we have quite a lot of dirt between light \nbulbs in that part of the world--148,000 square miles, 850,000 people. \nPeople rely on their automobiles in Montana as much as those who live \nin a big city, maybe more so. We also have a very healthy tourist \nindustry that thrives there. That is based on fuels and the \navailability of fuels. So families and agriculture suffer from the high \ngas tax, and so do businesses. The price of processing, the price of \ntransportation for all the products that are produced in rural America, \nsignificantly adds to the expenses. They cannot always be passed on to \nthe consumer. America's families and businesses are hurt by this tax.\n  The truth is that President Clinton raised the gas tax for purely \npolitical reasons. He had a choice of cutting spending, but he chose \nnot to do it. He had an opportunity to forgo a regressive and punitive \ntax on the middle and lower class, but he chose not to do it. I believe \nit is time to fix this political mistake by not only eliminating the \n4.3-cents-per-gallon gas tax, but also increasing the family's take-\nhome pay with a $500 per child bonus. We need other tax cuts for \nfamilies.\n  We are in a time when the cattle market is really low. We have \nfarmers suffering. And, of course, yes, the grain market is very high. \nBut if you want to do something for agriculture and take out the sort \nof ``pockets of pain,'' we should look at income averaging again, allow \nagriculture at the production level to keep some of their money in \ntheir pockets during the time when it is profitable so they can ride \nout the rough years that will come--always come--in agriculture.\n\n  We promised to do that for the middle class. That was vetoed. All \nrhetoric. It is time to lessen that tax burden, not only to working \nfamilies, but all Americans. In an era when he proclaimed big \nGovernment is over, Government keeps on growing.\n  So with America on my mind this morning, I call upon all of us to \ntake a look at this gas tax, to cut Government spending, and to get our \ncountry back on a budget that will keep us fiscally responsible and \nfiscally solid.

Mr. President, today is a very special day for Texans this \nyear because as of today, May 2, working men and women in Texas are for \nthe first time in 1996 working for themselves. To this point in 1996, \nevery single day from January 1 until today, every penny earned by the \naverage working family in my State has gone to government, and only \nbeginning today are the working families of Texas working for \nthemselves and for their families.\n  Let me share these numbers with my colleagues because I think they \nare very revealing of a fundamental problem in America.\n  By the estimates of the U.S. census the average family of four in \nTexas today earns $42,570. This year that average Texas family will pay \n$9,522 in Federal taxes, payroll taxes, and income taxes being taken \nout of their pocket and being brought to Washington and spent. They \nwill also pay $4,781 in State and local taxes. In total, the average \nfamily of four in Texas this year will pay $14,303 in taxes out of an \nincome of $42,570.\n  If in 1950, someone had predicted that the day would come when \nworking families in Texas would be sending $1 out of every $3 they earn \nto government, no one in 1950 would have believed that could be \npossible. I remind my colleagues that in 1950 the average family in \nAmerica with two children sent $1 out of every $50 it earned to \nWashington, DC. Today the average family in America is sending $1 out \nof every $4 it earns to Washington, DC. And the sad, and to a certain \ndegree, untold story is that, even if we do not start a single new \ngovernment program during the next 20 years but simply pay for the \ngovernment we have already committed to, the average family in America \nwill send $1 out of every $3 to Washington within 20 years, and $1 out \nof every $2 in 30 years. That is a future that, at least standing here \ntoday, it is hard for me to imagine. But I think the sobering lesson is \nwho could have imagined in 1950, when the average family in America \nwith two children was sending $1 out of every $50 to Washington, DC, \nthat today, 46 years later, the average family in America would be \nsending $1 out of every $4 it earns to Washington, DC.\n  I will leave it to each American to try to answer the question as to \nwhether they are getting their money's worth from our government, \nwhether, if they got to keep more of what they earned, they could do a \nbetter job spending it on their own family and investing it in their \nown future, than the government is now doing. I believe that the answer \nthat most Americans would give is that, if they got to keep more of \ntheir own money to invest in their own children, that they could make a \nsounder investment both for themselves and for their children than \ntheir Government is now making.\n  Texas is a blessed State in many ways. But one of the ways we are \nblessed is that our tax burden at the State and local level is lower \nthan the national average. So it will be on May 7 that the average \nAmerican family will work for itself for the first time in 1996. But \ntoday is the first day of 1996 that working families in Texas will be \nworking for themselves. From this point on during the year of 1996 they \nwill be able to keep what they earn to invest in their future and their \nfamily.\n  I believe it is a national crisis that the average working family in \nTexas has worked from January 1 until May 2 simply to pay tribute to \ngovernment. I do not believe the government we are giving them is worth \nwhat they are paying for it. I think we need to dramatically revise \ngovernment spending, and cut it. I think we need to let working \nfamilies keep more of what they earn.\n  There is one institution in America that is more effective and more \nimportant than any other. And that institution is the family. It is the \ninstitution that provides cohesion to our society, it is the \ninstitution that passes on our values and our traditions to our \nchildren, and yet it is the one institution that we consistently starve \nof the resources they need to do this job.\n\n  So I just simply wanted to join the people of my State in celebrating \nthe fact that as of today they are working for themselves. For the last \n3 years the tax burden on the average Texas family and the average \nAmerican family has\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nrisen, and risen at an alarming rate. I believe this trend has to stop, \nand I am dedicated to the principle that we need less government and \nmore freedom, that government is too big, too powerful, too expensive, \nand spends too much of the money of working families, and as a result \nthey have the opportunity to invest too little of what they earn.\n  I want to see this changed, and I think the real debate that we face \nhere in Washington, a debate that is very seldom defined here on the \nfloor of the Senate, is a choice between unlimited government and \nunlimited opportunity. And we have to choose. I want to make it clear \non the first day of this year that Texans have worked for themselves \nthat I choose opportunity because I know that if the average working \nfamily in America could represent itself in the U.S. Senate for one day \nand could cast a vote as to whether we need more government, or whether \nwe need more freedom in America, they would cast their vote in favor of \nless government and more freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was intrigued by listening to the \nSenator from Texas, and I wanted to make a couple of observations about \nit before I discussed what I came to discuss.\n  This issue that the American people have paid taxes to a certain day \nand somehow after that it does not affect them escapes me. I know the \nSenator from Texas taught economics for some while. He would understand \nI think that the four largest areas of public spending are education, \nState and local and Federal, mostly State and local, defense, Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  When the American people pay taxes to build schools to send their \nchildren to schools, I wonder if the Senator is suggesting that somehow \nthey have not made an investment in themselves in January, February, \nand March to build those schools, to pay those teachers, and give their \nkids an education. I do not think he would believe that.\n  If he is believing somehow that the Social Security checks will go \nback to help senior citizens, that Medicare Program that helps pay \nmedical bills for senior citizens in January, February, and March does \nnot represent an investment in themselves when people pay taxes and get \nback both an education system and an opportunity to defend our country, \nincluding jobs in Texas in defense plants, and Social Security checks \nfor senior citizens, and Medicare payments for health care for senior \ncitizens, I think not. I think not.\n\n  I agree with the Senator from Texas. I would like to see lower taxes \nfor everybody. We are trying to reduce the size of Government. In fact, \nthere are 200,000 fewer Federal workers now than at the beginning of \n1992. We are reducing the size of Government. He will not find an \nargument from me about that. But when someone suggests somehow that all \nof the money paid goes to Government and has no relationship to the \nindividuals, they are suggesting that the investment parents make in \nthe school system that benefits their children--because I think parents \nhave pride in building a school system that works and being able to \nsend their kids to good schools--I think the Senator misunderstands \nthat there are a whole lot of the American people who think it is a \ngood investment for them to send their kids to good schools and do not \nmind paying taxes for schools that work.\n  I did not come to the floor to talk about that, but I am always \nintrigued by the discussions about tax issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4572-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4573-S4575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RESCINDING THE GAS TAX\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the things I wanted to talk about \nthis morning was the gas tax.\n  I voted for the provision in 1993 that was the largest deficit \nreduction act in history. I am still pleased I voted for that. We did \nnot get one vote on the other side of the aisle even by accident. All \nof us on this side of the aisle had to vote for that and pass it by one \nvote. We did not get one vote even by accident. But I am still glad I \nvoted for it.\n  Did I like everything in it? No, I did not. But the Federal deficit \nhas decreased by nearly 50 percent since that was enacted.\n  We have had some folks come to the floor recently saying let us \nrepeal the 4.3-cent gas tax. I guess the motivation for coming to the \nfloor to do that is to say that gas prices have spiked up in this \ncountry from 20 to 25 cents a gallon. The American people are anxious \nand concerned about that, so some people come to the floor and say let \nus repeal the 4.3-cent gas tax. I ask why the 4.3 cents? Why not the \n4.3 cents and the 10 cents that Senator Dole has proposed previously \nand voted for. Why not decrease the whole thing if you want to do it? \nBut if you decrease it a penny, if you decrease the gas tax at all, I \nam going to be here with an amendment insisting that that reduction go \ninto the pockets of consumers who are now spending more money at the \ngas pumps, not into the pockets of the oil industry.\n  I took a look at some figures yesterday when we were talking about \nthis subject. Let me tell my friends what has happened in the oil \nindustry. God bless them; I think profits are fine, and I am happy they \nare doing well. Chevron posted gains of 34 percent last year, an \nincrease in profits; Amoco, a 39-percent increase in profits; Texaco, \nprofits up 30 percent; Mobil, profits up 16 percent; Exxon did just \nfine as well, up 14 percent; Shell, up 42 percent in the first quarter \nof this year.\n  Those are oil company profits. Now, if somebody comes to the floor of \nthe Senate and says, let us cut gas taxes, if they do not support a \nprovision that requires a cut in the gas tax to be ratcheted down in \nthe price at the pumps and therefore go into the pockets of the \nconsumers, guess who is going to pocket the reduction of the 4.3-cent \ngas tax? The oil industry.\n  Frankly, I am pleased that the Federal deficit has decreased, and I \nam willing to cast votes to decrease it all the way. We ought to \nbalance the budget. That is why I say I am still proud I cast that vote \nin 1993, and that included some tough issues, including a gas tax. But \nthe plain fact is we are probably going to deal with a gas tax repeal \nhere of some type where the majority has the right to bring that to the \nfloor and not with respect to the merits of the issue.\n  I will also, in this Chamber, when we deal with the gas tax, propose \nan amendment that says, if we cut the gas tax, let us make sure it goes \nin the right pocket. The oil industry has some deep pockets, and they \nare doing just fine, thank you. The consumer is paying 20 or 25 cents a \ngallon more, and the question is, why? Because of the gas tax? No. The \nindustry decided because of supply and demand, they say, that the price \nhad to spike up, so the price spiked up and American drivers take it in \nthe pocketbook.\n\n  If someone wants to relieve the American drivers of a 20- or 25-cent \nprice spike, the first thing we ought to do is launch an investigation \ninto what caused that price to spike up 20 or 25 cents a gallon. Who \ndecided to do that? There was no debate about that. We had a debate \nabout the gas tax. There was no debate by the public on this issue of a \n20-, 25-cent increase in the gas prices. That is done in a room \nsomeplace, I assume. They say, well, the supply and demand relationship \nhas changed. Therefore, let us charge the drivers 20 or 25 cents more a \ngallon.\n  I say to the folks who come to the floor of the Senate that, if we \nwant to do something for American drivers, for those who are paying the \nbills, let us investigate what has caused this spike in gas prices, No. \n1. No. 2, if you do offer proposals to reduce the gas tax, I am going \nto offer an amendment to insist that that reduction go into the pockets \nof the taxpayers in this country, not into the pockets of the oil \nindustry.\n  How do we do that? It is not very easy to do that because you have to \nmake sure that that decrease finds its way to the price at the pump so \nthat it is lowered for the American consumer. But if folks come here \nand say, let us ratchet down the gas tax and do not do that, you know \nexactly where that money is going. It is not going into the pockets of \nsomebody who is going to fill their tank tomorrow. It is going to go \ninto the deep pockets of the large multinational corporations that \ndecide they are going to profit because of what the Congress has done.\n  So those are issues, I think, we will work our way through, Mr. \nPresident, in the coming week or two. When we do, I think Members ought \nto understand that some of us will absolutely\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\ninsist that if you reduce the gas tax, that money must go into the \npockets of the American taxpayer, not the pockets of the big oil \ncompanies in this country.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend from North Dakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, I hear talk about a \ngas tax being repealed. What gas tax are they talking about repealing?\n  Mr. DORGAN. There have been proposals on the floor of the Senate and \nin the House to repeal a 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax that was imposed \nin 1993.\n  Mr. REID. My question I guess is, since there have been a number of \ngas taxes that have been passed in recent years--is that not true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The 4.3 cents is only a small fraction of the taxes on gas \nthat have been increased over the past decade or so in this body. Is \nthat not true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator know of any reason why the 4.3 cents was \nchosen as compared to any other tax increases that occurred when the \nRepublicans controlled the White House?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I assume it is politics. I do not understand why they \nchose the 4.3-cent gas tax. If gas prices spike up 20 or 25 cents a \ngallon, why not ask the question: Where has the price increase come \nfrom? And roll back the price increase if they really want to help the \nAmerican driver.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask my friend from North Dakota this question. I \nhave been watching very closely since the prices, especially in the \nwestern part of the United States, have gone up. They have gone up a \nlot in the State of Nevada, not as much as in the State of California, \nbut they have gone up in the State of Nevada. I have been watching very \nclosely, and I have not seen the oil companies come forward with an \nexplanation of why the costs of gasoline and fuel have gone up. Has the \nSenator seen an explanation?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The explanation that has been given is supply and demand \nrelationships and difficulties with refineries in California and some \nother imbalances that have occurred. As the Senator from Nevada knows, \nPresident Clinton has, I think, properly asked for an investigation. \nLet us find out exactly what has caused this price spike. Is the spike \nin prices temporary or will it last some time? Is it justifiable or is \nit not?\n  I think the President has moved in the right direction, saying let us \nget to the bottom of this and find out who has done what and take \naction if action is appropriate.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I have been advised that in the State \nof New Mexico in recent years the gasoline tax was decreased and the \ncost of gasoline in that State went up. Has the Senator heard that? Has \nthe Senator heard that story?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have not heard that, but that is my fear. If someone \nwere to bring a bill to the floor of the Senate that says, let us cut \nthe gas tax 4.3 cents per gallon and provide no assurance that that is \ngoing to go into the pockets of the American drivers and American \ntaxpayers, guess what. We might very likely have a circumstance where \nthat 4.3 cents per gallon would go into the pockets of the oil \nindustry. I do not think that advantages this country. All that does is \nincrease the debt, enrich the oil companies, and leave the drivers and \ntaxpayers in exactly the same position they are in now.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the Senator from North Dakota, in the \nform of a statement he can respond to or not, it is my understanding in \nrecent years in the State of New Mexico the gas tax was decreased. And \nsurprisingly, in the State of New Mexico, immediately the prices went \nup and, in effect, the oil companies received the benefit of the tax \nbeing decreased. The consumer did not. That is a fear that I have, that \nhere in America today, if we repeal this gas tax, rather than the \nAmerican consumer getting the benefit of it the oil companies, which \nhave had record profits the last few years--record profits--the oil \ncompanies would be able to pay their executives even more than they \nhave as a result of making 4.3 cents more per gallon. Does the Senator \nfrom North Dakota fear the same?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is my concern and that is why there will be an \namendment, if there is a gas tax proposal on the floor to reduce the \ntax, to make sure it goes to the right pockets.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Nevada, I do not like the gas taxes. I \nnever have. And I worry about high gas prices. Why? Because I come from \na State that is a very large State with not too many people; 640,000 \npeople living in 70,000 square miles in North Dakota. We pay about \ntwice as much gas tax per person as they do in New York City or New \nYork State. Why? Because we drive more than they do. To do almost \nanything we drive much longer distances than they do in New York.\n  A friend of mine once told me he had a cousin in New York who was \ngoing to go to Bayonne, NJ, to visit some relatives. They got an \nemergency kit in the trunk and some blankets, to go 60 miles, because \nthat is a big trip in the east coast, I think.\n  In North Dakota, 60 miles is absolutely nothing. We drive 60 miles at \nthe drop of a hat, often in a snowstorm. In good weather or bad weather \nwe drive great distances. That is why I never particularly liked the \ngas tax, because the gas tax imposes a higher premium for taxpayers in \nNorth Dakota than it does taxpayers in New York. We drive twice as much \nper person.\n  The same is true with gas prices generally, not just the tax. When \nthe price goes up 20 or 25 cents a gallon and someone says that is \nbecause of a 4.3-cent charge put on 3 years ago, I say, ``Wait a \nsecond. No, no, the price went up 20 or 25 cents a gallon because \nsomething has happened in recent weeks to do that. We ought to find out \nwhat has happened and find out whether it is justified.''\n  But I guess, again, the bottom line here is if we are going to have \npeople come to ratchet down the gas tax I am going to make certain the \nright people get the benefit of that. That is the American taxpayer, \nnot the oil industry.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend from North Dakota yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. In the State of Nevada we have, of course, the seventh-\nlargest State in the Union areawise, but the State of Nevada has \nchanged in recent years. We have had a huge population explosion. Mr. \nPresident, 90 percent of the people, approximately, live in the \nmetropolitan areas of Reno and Las Vegas. But those two cities, those \ntwo metropolitan areas, are separated by 450 miles. So the people of \nthe State of Nevada, to get to the metropolitan areas and to get to the \nmany rural communities that we have throughout the State of Nevada, \nhave to drive very long distances. The loneliest road in America has \nbeen designated, a road in Nevada.\n  The point I am making to my friend, and I want to see if he agrees \nwith this, is the Democrats in the U.S. Senate are not trying to block \na repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. The Senator from North Dakota and the \nSenator from Nevada, we would like to get rid of all the gas taxes \nbecause people in our States, our rural States, depend on automobiles \nto get around. There are no subways in Nevada. There is no mass \ntransit, basically, other than a bus, anyplace in Nevada.\n  So, I say to my friend, does he agree that the Democrats are not \ntrying to stand in the way of repealing the gas tax, what we are trying \nto do is to make sure, if it is repealed, the consumer benefits and not \nChevron, not Shell, not Exxon, and all these massive multinational \nmultilevel companies? Would the Senator agree with the Senator from \nNevada?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think Senator Reid states the case. I do not want to \nincrease the Federal deficit. We have it coming down. I want to keep it \ncoming down. And I am not afraid of making hard choices--we have done \nthat before--in order to get it down, including taxes I do not like. I \nwould much prefer a lower gas tax. I would much prefer lower gas \nprices, period.\n  My intention is to say only this. If people come here to try to \nreduce the gas tax, which will increase the deficit, I am going to say \nto them: That is OK, but I want to make sure the benefits of that gas \ntax reduction go to the drivers, who are the taxpayers out there, not \nthe oil industry, No. 1; and, No. 2, you need to find a way to make \nsure\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\nwhat you are doing does not further increase the Federal deficit, \nbecause that is not moving in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I believe we had 30 minutes reserved. I ask, because \nwe did not start until 9:40, unanimous consent the Senator from \nMassachusetts be given 5 minutes, and the Senator from Montana, Senator \nBaucus, be given 5 minutes following the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in just a few moments we will return to \nthe unfinished business on the illegal immigration legislation. There \nis every prospect that that legislation will be concluded sometime in \nthe afternoon. As Members of this body know, we are operating under the \nprocedures of cloture, which has foreclosed the opportunity for me and \nfor our minority leader, Senator Daschle, or others, to raise the issue \nof the minimum wage, to offer that as an amendment to the underlying \nlegislation. I have indicated that I would offer it at the earliest \nmoment on any other legislation that comes before the Senate, including \nthe possibility we would offer it this afternoon.\n  But now we are, under the procedures, foreclosed. During the course \nof the morning, and with the consent agreement and the cloture on the \nunderlying bill, we have been effectively foreclosed from any \nopportunity to address that issue. I am hopeful still, sometime during \nthe day, we will have the opportunity to begin the debate. I think it \nis an issue that is well understood in the Senate. But we might be able \nto establish a short time period where we would have that debate and \nhave a vote by the Members on that issue, which is of central \nimportance to working families, families who are working 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks of the year, trying to make ends meet and are still \nfaced with the hard realities that the minimum wage is at the lowest \npurchasing power it has been in 40 years. All Americans basically \nunderstand we should reward work with sufficient compensation so \nfamilies can provide for themselves, can provide for their children, \nput food on the table, pay the rent and the mortgage.\n  This issue is an old issue. It has been debated and discussed each \ntime Congress has acted to increase the minimum wage. It is quite \nironic that this issue was before the U.S. Congress 35 years ago \ntomorrow, that would be in 1961. The issue of the increase in the \nminimum wage in the 1960 campaign was debated extensively during the \ncourse of that campaign. President Kennedy, in the course of that \ncampaign, spoke about the importance of raising the minimum wage. It \nwas considerably lower at that period of time. But in the course of the \ncampaign then Senator Kennedy sat in front of a camera and said:\n\n       Mr. Nixon has said that a $1.25 minimum wage is extreme. \n     That's $50 a week. What's extreme about that? I believe the \n     next Congress and the President should pass a minimum wage \n     for a $1.25 an hour. Americans must be paid enough to live.\n\n  Really, the rest is history. Senator Kennedy was elected in the fall \nof 1960. One of the earliest messages that he sent to the Congress in \nFebruary the next year was urging Congress to take action. The Congress \naddressed this issue 35 years ago tomorrow.\n  On Friday, May 3, which is tomorrow, that will be the 35th \nanniversary of Bob Dole's vote against President Kennedy's legislation \nraising the minimum wage from $1 to $1.25. Bob Dole and Richard Nixon \nwere wrong to oppose President Kennedy's minimum wage hike 35 years \nago--and Bob Dole and Richard Armey are wrong to oppose President \nClinton's minimum wage hike today.\n  This issue is before us. We will have an opportunity to address it. \nJust as the Republican leadership was opposed to moving from $1.25 35 \nyears ago, we find opposition now to increase the minimum wage to make \nit a livable wage to honor work in our society.\n  The overwhelming majority of the people in our society are for it. \nAmericans should not be denied it. The illegal immigration bill is \nimportant, but we have a responsibility to meet the needs of those \nAmericans who are out there working on the bottom and next to bottom \nrung of the economic ladder trying to provide for themselves and \nworking hard at it.\n  Mr. President, we will continue the battle to increase the minimum \nwage, and I do not believe for a moment that we will be defeated. This \nis an issue whose time has come again and again and again. It came in \nearly 1961. I believe it will come again in 1996.\n  We have to ask why it has taken us so long, but we will continue to \npersevere today and every opportunity to have the Senate address and \nvote in favor of the minimum wage. The American people need it; they \nare entitled to it. And we will continue that struggle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Was leaders' time reserved, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it was. Leaders' time was reserved. The \nChair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4575-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM VETO\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Later this afternoon, President Clinton is expected to veto \nthe product liability reform bill--a bipartisan measure to curb \nabusive, predatory lawsuits.\n  This bill passed the Congress overwhelmingly, with the support of \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. And for good reason: In 1994, lawsuits \ncost the American consumer a staggering $152 billion--a price tag that \nexceeds the entire Federal budget deficit.\n  Lawsuit abuse hurts consumers by raising the costs of goods and \nservices. It limits employment opportunities for those seeking jobs. It \nhurts the competitiveness of U.S. businesses overseas. And, perhaps \nworst of all, it can prevent new, lifesaving drugs and medical devices \nfrom ever reaching the market.\n  As Linda Ransom of Phoenix, AZ explained to us earlier this week, \nabusive lawsuits have forced manufacturers to stop selling the \nmaterials that are needed to make the medical device that is keeping \nher 9-year-old daughter, Tara, alive. This is truly a life-and-death \nissue.\n  It is time to stop lawsuit abuse before lawsuit abuse stops America.\n  So, why will President Clinton veto this important legislation? The \nanswer can be summed up in three words: The trial lawyers. President \nClinton vetoed the securities litigation reform bill because of the \nstrong-arm tactics of the trial lawyers. And he will veto the product \nliability bill because he believes what is good for the trial lawyers \nis also good for America.\n  America's legal system is broken and fundamental reforms are needed--\nand need now. Our legal system must be reformed to encourage people to \nbe responsible for their own actions. And it should quickly and \nefficiently compensate victims--not lawyers. Quite simply, legal reform \nis a key ingredient of any serious plan to promote job creation and \neconomic growth.\n  Unfortunately, with today's veto, the President will be confirming \nwhat we already suspected: It is the trial lawyers who are calling the \nshots at the White House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4575-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4575-S4576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 NOTICE\n\n  Financial disclosure reports required by the Ethics in Government Act \nof 1978, as amended and Senate Rule 34 must be filed no later than \nclose of business on Wednesday, May 15, 1996.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss a subject of great \nimportance to Montana, my home State, and also to me personally. That \nis the subject of the proposal to cut the gas tax by 4.3 cents over the \nrest of the year.\n  I am reminded of a comment made by the great Irish conservative \nthinker, Edmund Burke, in reflections on the revolution of France where \nhe said:\n\n       Among an infinite number of acts of violence, of folly, \n     some good may be done. They who destroy everything certainly \n     will remove some grievance. They who make everything new have \n     a chance that they may establish something beneficial.\n\n  That is about where we stand today with the 104th Congress. The \nCongress is approaching its close. The present-day revolutionaries are \ngetting ready to put on their hot tar and feathers and mount up on the \nrail to be ridden out of town. Behind them will remain a rather weird \nlegacy: Government shutdowns, attempts to repeal the Clean Air Act, \nweaken protection of our lakes and streams, slash student loan programs \nand cut school lunches, and radical experiments with $270 billion \nMedicare cuts.\n  But hidden away in this mess are a few good things--a few grievances \nremoved, a small number of beneficial things established. They are hard \nto find, but over the next 5 months or so, we need to dig them out, \npass them and get them up to the President to sign. It is a tough job, \nbut today we have found one of them, and that is repeal of the gas tax.\n\n  Folks are hurting at home. Wages are stagnant, cattle prices are \ndown, but the cost of housing and the cost of college and a lot of \nother necessities are going up, and we should be here to do something \nabout that.\n  Some of these problems are pretty complex. But we can start with a \nfew simple solutions that will put some more money in an ordinary \nworking man's or woman's pocket. That is what repealing the gas tax \nwill do.\n  Probably that should be enough reason to repeal it, but fairness and \nprinciple also say that a gas tax that is not devoted directly to \ntransportation funding is a bad idea and ought to be repealed.\n  The price of gas in Montana is up from $1.29 a gallon in March to \n$1.42 today, as reflected by this chart: $1.29 March 26 and up in just \na short period of time, over 1 month, up to $1.42 a gallon. Who knows \nwhere it will be tomorrow, the third line on this chart.\n  As part of this, Montanans already pay 27 cents a gallon under a gas \ntax in our State--that is the State gasoline tax--and 14.1 cents a \ngallon for transportation under the Federal gasoline tax. The rest, 4.3 \ncents a gallon, is an excise tax that goes to general revenues. Like \nall single-product excise taxes, this 4.3-cent tax is unfair, it is \nnarrowly based, and it is grossly unfair to the West where we have to \ndrive a long way to work, to the grocery store, or to the hospital.\n  That is why I have opposed gas taxes. I opposed the gas tax hike in \n1990. I remember back in 1993, the administration proposed a gas tax of \n9.3 cents a gallon. I spent nearly a month fighting them down, a tenth \nof a cent by a tenth of a cent to the present 4.3-cent level.\n  As I said then, and I will quote, ``I will vote for the $500 billion \ndeficit reduction plan because I don't want to let perfection be the \nenemy of the good. The deficits we have run up have already laid a $4 \ntrillion debt on the backs of our children, and fast action on the \ndeficit is the best way to increase business confidence and keep \ninterest rates low so jobs will be created by expanding business and \npeople can refinance their mortgages. But make no mistake about it, the \ngas tax is a weak point in this package.''\n  The majority leader's proposal is a relatively modest proposal. It \ndoes not cure the weak point in the 1993 package completely by \nrepealing the gas tax; instead, it is a temporary 7-month reduction, \nessentially a limited constructive response to an emergency caused by \nthe sudden increase in gas taxes last month.\n\n  There is a little work ahead. We need to balance the budget, so we \nneed to make sure that the gas tax cut is offset and does not widen the \ndeficit. That is critical. The offset needs to be a fair one and does \nnot simply put a new burden on working people, and we need to be sure \nthat oil companies do not simply use the gas tax cut to raise prices \nagain.\n  With that aside, it is a good idea. As historians mull over the \nGovernment shutdowns and otherwise pick through the debris left by the \nrevolutionary Congress, they will be able to say, ``At least they got \none thing right.''\n  We ought to be able to do this quickly, to take a few cents a gallon \noff at the pump, and at the same time we ought to be able to raise the \nminimum wage. I was on the phone yesterday with some minimum wage \nworkers in Bozeman. A raise of 90 cents an hour will let them stay \nahead on electric bills and on water bills. It will let a single-\nworking mom give the kids a night at the movies every once in a while, \ngive a donation to a church, maybe buy a couple of books, and that is \nnot asking a lot.\n  So these are the right things to do. We ought to get the gas tax \nrepealed by Memorial Day, and we ought to get the minimum wage raised \nby Memorial Day.\n  I hope people in both parties will take a fair, independent look at \nthese ideas because they are good ideas, and they help ordinary people \nmake ends meet. They deserve the Senate's support. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I join with Senator Simpson in urging our \ncolleagues to come over and consider these amendments. We have been \ngoing on through the evening the last two nights, and we are always \nasked at the end of the day if we cannot conclude it so that we can \naccommodate Members' schedules. Here we are at 10 o'clock, ready to do \nbusiness.\n  There are a limited number of amendments out there. The particular \nSenators know the amendments have been listed. We are prepared to move \nahead and dispose of these amendments. It is better for us to have the \ndebate at the present time. So we ask, just out of consideration for \nthe other Members of the Senate, that those Members come over so we can \ndispose of those amendments and we can accommodate our other friends \nand colleagues here. We will go into a quorum call, but we hope those \nSenators will come to the floor and address those amendments. Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am going to proceed with a discussion \nof an amendment which I believe I will send to the desk because Senator \nGraham and Senator Chafee apparently will not be here until \napproximately 11 o'clock. So we will proceed with the amendment. I will \nsend it to the desk in a moment and proceed with the debate on the \namendment.\n  The amendment would modify section 112 of the bill relating to pilot \nprojects on systems to verify work authorization and eligibility to \napply for public assistance.\n  It has three parts. The first part would require that at a minimum \nthree particular pilot projects--remember, these are pilot projects. \nRemember, whatever one is selected has to have a second vote in this \nChamber years down the line. This is not tomorrow. This is not next \nyear. The purpose of the amendment is to require these to be pilot \nprojects rather than the present language which makes it somewhat \noptional.\n  The three parts are: The first part would require that at a minimum \nthree particular pilot projects be conducted; one providing for \ntelephone verification of Social Security numbers; one providing for \nuse--pilot projects again--for use of a counterfeit-resistant driver's \nlicense with a Social Security number on it, but only in a State that \nalready issues such a license. We are not imposing this as a national \nstandard. But if the State of Wyoming has a driver's license with a \nSocial Security number on it, which they do, that State will have the \npilot on a counterfeit-resistant driver's license.\n  Then the final one involves the confirmation of the immigration \nstatus of aliens, but with regard to citizens only, an attestation only \nfor citizens, which people have said in the debate--I think it is a \ngood debate--``Why should a U.S. citizen have to go through these \nprocedures?'' The answer is, we will have a pilot project to find out. \nBut I certainly hope that we could do that and require eventually, \nthrough the pilot project, only an attestation by persons who are \nclaiming to be citizens.\n  Under the present bill, current bill in its present form--after the \namendment yesterday, this is in the bill--there are seven different \ntypes of pilot projects that are specifically authorized, but none is \nrequired. Senator Kennedy and I have concluded that it is especially \nimportant that the three projects I have specified are conducted, at \nleast these three. The other four, making up the seven, that is fine, \ntoo. I think we need to study every possible aspect of this.\n\n  The first type of pilot project providing for the telephone \nverification of the Social Security numbers of all new employees was a \nrecommendation of the Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by \nformer Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, and is and was the most frequently \ndiscussed option as it was in the House of Representatives.\n  The second type providing for use of a counterfeit-resistant driver's \nlicense with a Social Security number on it in a State that already \nissues such a license--please hear that--would have the major advantage \nthat employers would be required only to check a single document, one \nthat is already in existence. There would be no new documents, no new \ndatabase, no new procedure such as a telephone call verification.\n  The third type involving confirmation of the immigration status of \naliens but only an attestation by persons claiming to be citizens. That \nwould also have a major advantage, in our mind. Employers would not \nhave to verify employees. They would have nothing to do in that \nsituation. Of course, in that situation, the obvious weakness in such a \nsystem is the potential for false claims of citizenship. That is why I \ndid offer a separate amendment which was accepted, I think, in the \nmanager's amendments, creating a new disincentive for falsely claiming \nU.S. citizenship, which will be a new ground of exclusion and of \ndeportation. I think that will be very effective in reducing that \nobvious weakness. Because of the potential advantages of these three \napproaches to verification, I believe that the Attorney General should \nbe required to conduct pilot projects on those.\n  Mr. President, the second part of the present amendment provides that \nif the Attorney General--and this is very important for employers--\nagain, if the Attorney General determines that a pilot project \nadequately satisfies accuracy and other criteria such as those relating \nto privacy, precious privacy, discrimination and unauthorized use, two \nresults can follow. First, the project's requirements will supersede \nany verification requirements under current law for participating \nemployers. In addition, the Attorney General will be authorized to make \nthe participation mandatory for some or all employers in the pilot \nproject's area of coverage for the remaining period of its operation.\n  Here is what the intent of this portion of the amendment is. It is \nthat no employer be subject to requirements of doing both the current \nlaw and the pilot project in which participation is mandatory. Of \ncourse, an employer can voluntarily participate in any project without \nany preliminary determination by the Attorney General, or anyone, that \nthe criteria are adequately met. If there is no such determination, the \nrequirements of both the project and the current law will be required, \ntrying to assure there is not a double burdening upon the employer.\n\n  The third and final part of this amendment defines words ``regional \nproject.'' That was thoroughly discussed in committee and I believe \nreferred to here yesterday and the day before. This amendment defines a \n``regional project'' as a project conducted in an area which includes \nmore than a single locality but which is smaller than an entire State. \nThis definition is included because section 112 of the bill directs the \nPresident, acting through the Attorney General, to conduct several \nlocal or regional pilot projects.\n  The reason the amendment is so crafted is that some persons have \nexpressed concern that the reference to ``regional projects'' could be \ninterpreted to mean projects involving several States. Then this could \ncreate something close to a de facto nationwide system, especially if \nthere were a number of multistate projects. Thus, the reason for the \namendment. Yet, such a system would not have been the subject of a \nPresidential recommendation or report and subsequent enactment of the \nlegislation as would be required in the bill before a pilot project can \nbe implemented nationwide.\n  Let me say that again. Before any project, whether regional--and this \ndefines regional--whether national, and this will take years to do, \nbefore the recommended pilot project--the ``preferred alternative,'' I \nsuppose, would be the phrase--in some future year would be presented to \nthe Congress, and then\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\na second vote would take place with regard to which of the pilot \nprojects would eventually come into the statutes of the United States.\n  That is the essence of the amendment. I look forward to the \ndiscussion of it.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3853 and 3843, en bloc\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I now send to the desk the amendment I \nhave described. By previous unanimous consent, amendments 3753 and 3754 \nwere combined to be considered as a single amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments en bloc are before the Senate.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have no further comments with regard to \nthe amendment, but I emphasize to our colleagues that we are going to \nproceed and try to accommodate each and every one of the Members who \nare involved in the amending process. We are certainly not going to cut \noff debate, but let all be aware we are going to finish this bill today \nin the morning hour or the darkening color of evening.\n\n  I must relate to the occupant of the chair that the Senator from \nMassachusetts handed me a tattered document from some calendar of some \nkind that says, ``What State is home to more pronghorn antelope than \npeople?'' I believe the occupant of the chair and I know the answer. It \nis our native State of Wyoming.\n  But we also have a story we tell of the old cowboy out fixing his \nfence and doing a nice job. A tourist lady came by--I think \nMassachusetts plates--and she said, ``I understand you have more cows \nthan people out there. Why is that?'' He looked at her with steady \ngaze, hooked his thumb in his belt, and he said, ``We prefer 'em.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On that note, Mr. President, let me just say a very \nbrief word about the modification of the verification proposal.\n  The development of studies that would help and guide policy has been \ncontroversial over some period of time. The Senate now is on record in \nsupport of those pilot programs. I strongly support them. We will have \nmaximum flexibility to see at the time when the report comes back to \nthe Congress, what has been recommended or suggested along the \nguidelines that have been included in the bill and which I referenced \nyesterday.\n  This amendment effectively ensures mandates that those programs are \nactually going to go ahead. It was always our assumption they would go \nahead. I believe this Justice Department is well on the road toward \nassuring they would go ahead. A number of us have been briefed on what \nprogress has been made, and has been impressive in terms of the design \nof these programs. I think they offer some very, very important, \nhopeful indications that many of the abuses we have seen currently \nwould be addressed with either these types of programs or those that \nare closely related to those programs.\n  Effectively, what this amendment does, as the Senator has pointed \nout, it defines the term ``region'' as an area within a State. This \nproposal limits the verification to local and regional pilots only. \nThere was some question about what the region might be. We know about \n80 percent of illegals are in seven States. Some are bunched into \nregions of the country. We wanted to make it very clear that we were \nnot talking about regions of the country, but we are talking about an \narea within a State. That is an improvement, and I think it is a \nworthwhile statement to ensure that the purposes of this pilot program \nwill be defined as an area within a State.\n\n  Second, it mandates the INS to conduct the three types of programs \nwhich are listed in the bill. These three had been selected after the \nconsideration of a number of other suggestions. And, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think they are worthy of pursuing. We are making sure that \nthey will be pursued. There is one pilot project where employers have \nto verify an employee's Social Security number over the phone; one \nwhich tests the effectiveness of the State identification card, and \nthat includes a readable Social Security number; and one where \nemployers have to verify employment eligibility, only for employees who \nare noncitizens. These three mandates of the INS cannot require \nemployers to participate in a pilot program, unless the Attorney \nGeneral certifies it is anticipated to meet the privacy and accuracy \nstandards of the bill.\n  We have outlined in very careful detail the privacy provisions, and \nwe are strongly committed to ensuring that privacy will be realized and \nachieved. We will work closely with the INS to make sure that that \nhappens.\n  As has been pointed out in the course of the debate, we wanted to \ninsist on accuracy. If you have just programs that are maybe 80 \npercent, or 85, or even 90 percent accurate, you are still 10, or 15, \nor 20 percent inaccurate, and you are still talking about tens of \nthousands of people who would be unfairly treated. And so that aspect \nof the pilot program--to insist on the accuracy standards which have \nbeen outlined--is 99 percent in this bill and is enormously important.\n  So I think questions had been raised after we had determined that the \npilot program would be instituted in the Judiciary Committee, and from \nthe Judiciary Committee to the floor, and even during the course of the \ndebate, we have been asked to clarify these particular measures, and \nthe Simpson amendment does that. These modifications make good sense. \nThis amendment ensures that pilot projects can be no larger than an \narea within a State. It means that a pilot that covers an entire State \nwould be too large. The amendment requires the INS to conduct the three \nprojects, and these projects are listed as optional pilots in the bill. \nThe amendment simply requires the INS to test these three projects. If \nany of these work, it will mark a major improvement in denying jobs to \nillegal immigrants.\n  Once again, this is where the focus ought to be on the issue of the \njob magnet, the fact that jobs are what bring people here to the United \nStates illegally. As we know, those individuals who are the illegals \nbasically are low-skill or no-skill workers, and they are the ones \nwhich add the least, obviously, to the economy and still are involved \nin displacing other Americans and driving wages down.\n\n  So if we are able to address the issues of the job magnet--and this \nlegislation attempts to do that in a variety of ways, which have been \nspelled out earlier in the course of the debate, both from trying to \naddress the issues of the fraud documents and trying to strengthen the \nBorder Patrol, trying to develop these other kinds of proposals to \nlimit the--and make it less likely that illegals will enter the job \nmarket, I think we are on the road to trying to take meaningful steps \nto deal with the problems of illegal immigrants coming to this country \nand still ensure the protections for American workers that may speak \nwith a foreign language or may have a different appearance.\n  I do not know of any opposition to this amendment. Members have known \nabout it for some period of time. Perhaps we will be willing to set \nthis aside. We are personally contacting Members who have indicated an \ninterest to find out whether they either want to address it or require \na rollcall vote. It seems to me that we will pursue that. But we, \nagain, hope that our other colleagues who have other amendments will \ncome forward. I am sure when they do, we will set this aside. At some \ntime later, I suppose, we will ask, when we stack the votes, that this \nbe one that we stack.\n  If Members have differing views on this issue, we are here now to \ndebate it. After a reasonable period of time, we will assume that those \nMembers, unless they notify us, are willing to let us move forward and \naccept this amendment. We intend to do that in a reasonable period of \ntime.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to read a letter \nthat I have today as the Senator from Minnesota sent out to a number of \noil companies in our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                      May 2, 1996.\n       Much has been said recently about the rise in the price of \n     gasoline, attributing this rise to a number of factors. As \n     you may know, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee, of which I am a member, will be holding a hearing \n     to look into this matter on May 9, 1996.\n       My understanding of the industry position on this question \n     is that several unrelated factors have led to the recent \n     increase of gasoline prices: high demand for heating oil due \n     to the long winter, seasonal refinery maintenance practices, \n     refinery shutdowns, and the failure of Iraqi oil to enter the \n     market as expected. Although all of these are credible \n     explanations, there is an argument that runs counter to this \n     position which I would like you to address.\n       The crux of my concern relates to the industry practice of \n     ``just-in-time'' inventory management. It appears that the \n     inventories of crude oil and petroleum products are now being \n     held by the industry at significantly lower levels than have \n     historically been the practice. In fact, a particularly \n     significant drop in inventories seems to have occurred during \n     the summer of 1995, not during the winter as one might \n     expect. As you know, when inventory levels are so low as to \n     impact the availability of gasoline, consumers and the \n     economy can be exposed to the risk of price spikes by \n     otherwise unremarkable increases in demand. My fear is that \n     while oil companies may use this management technique to save \n     money, the result is that the consumer may end up paying the \n     price.\n       I would hope that the oil industry would not use this \n     management technique to ring up huge profits on the backs of \n     the American consumer.\n       In helping me prepare for any upcoming action in the Senate \n     Energy and Natural Resources Committee, please explain why \n     industry inventories of crude oil and petroleum products have \n     been maintained recently so far below the usual level, and \n     what effect ``just-in-time'' inventory management may have \n     had in contributing to or aggravating the current price \n     increase. In crafting your response, please explain why \n     inventories were reportedly decreased so drastically in June \n     and July of 1995. In addition, I would appreciate knowing \n     whether the matter of low inventories or any other issues \n     relating to the recent increase in the consumer price of \n     gasoline have been the subject of discussions between \n     representatives of your company and other officials in the \n     industry. Finally, please provide any further information you \n     feel may be useful to me and to the Committee in our review \n     of this matter.\n       Thank you for your prompt reply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Paul D. Wellstone,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will quote from sections of the \nletter:\n\n       Much has been said recently about the rise in the price of \n     gasoline, attributing this rise to a number of factors. As \n     you may know, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee, of which I am a member, will hold a hearing to \n     look into this matter on May 9, 1996.\n\n  That is next week.\n\n       My understanding of the industry position on this question \n     is that several unrelated factors have led to the increase of \n     gasoline prices: high demand for heating oil due to the long \n     winter, seasonal refinery maintenance practices, refinery \n     shutdowns, and the failure of Iraqi oil to enter the market \n     as expected. Although all of these are credible explanations, \n     there is an argument that runs counter to this position which \n     I would like you to address.\n\n  This letter is in the spirit of all of us having the information we \nneed to make responsible decisions.\n  Mr. President, what I am talking about is what ways this low \ninventory may have affected this spike in the prices that consumers are \nexperiencing. Since there has been a lot of information that has been \ncoming around, or at least a lot of speeches given, it seems to me one \nof the things we want to do as Senators, whether we are Republicans or \nDemocrats, is get to the bottom of this and try to really understand \nthe why of this spike, the why of this rather dramatic increase in \ngasoline prices.\n  These low inventories, really record low inventories, are something \nthat I think we ought to look at. Undoubtedly, this saves money for the \ncompanies. But on the other hand, what happens if demand goes up at all \nwith the inventory, the supplies, kept down by the oil companies? Then \nyour supply-and-demand curve is such that it could lead to the very \nspike in prices that we are now experiencing in the country.\n  I have sent this letter to the oil companies. I am hoping that they \nwill be forthcoming with the requested information. On May 9, in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, I will put the questions to the \noil companies. I hope they will be accountable. Those of us in the U.S. \nSenate, Democrats and Republicans alike, will have this information. I \nthink it is a very important issue. I think it is extremely important \nthat we understand what is now happening to consumers that we \nrepresent. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Florida, wishes to speak shortly, but that he \nneeds a little more time. If there is no objection from the floor \nmanagers, I will make some general comments about the bill at this \ntime, if I may.\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate at this time, as we are, \nhopefully, nearing the conclusion of our debate on this important piece \nof legislation, to make some general observations and comments. First, \nto acknowledge the leadership of Senator Simpson. What has been \naccomplished, in my judgment, could not have been accomplished in \nearlier Congresses. I commend his leadership. Although the \ndistinguished ranking member of the subcommittee has not been in \nagreement on all parts of the piece of legislation, I believe that \nSenator Kennedy's role in this has been a constructive part of a \nprocess which, in my judgment, will make major changes in our \nimmigration enforcement efforts.\n\n  Some time last year, I had the pleasure of testifying before the \nImmigration Subcommittee in support of S. 269, Senator Simpson's \nillegal immigration reform bill. I am pleased that the legislation that \nwe have been debating these past few days essentially deals with the \nscope and the manner which the bill that I testified on last year \ncovered.\n  I want to preface my remarks by reemphasizing a point that I made at \nthe time, which I think is valid in the context of the debate this \nyear. That is, that there are those who are critics of our attempts to \nreform the immigration laws in this country who suggest that our \nefforts are somehow mean-spirited or even ``xenophobic.'' In my view, \nthat is not only an unfair characterization; it is an opinion that is \ncompletely out of touch with the realities of our time.\n  The Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late Honorable \nBarbara Jordan, responded to this in the 1994 report to the Congress in \nwhich she and the members of the Commission concluded:\n\n       We disagree with those who would label efforts to control \n     immigration as being inherently anti-immigrant. Rather, it is \n     both a right and a responsibility of a democratic society to \n     manage immigration so that it serves the national interest.\n\n  Mr. President, first and foremost, it is and it has always been the \nprovince, and indeed the responsibility, of the Congress to establish \nand to provide the means of enforcing our country's immigration laws \nand to do so in the national interest.\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\n  Since the Immigration Act of 1882, Congress has recognized the need \nto fashion immigration policy to fit the various public policy \ninterests of the time. In the 19th century, our country depended on \nimmigrants to build the railroads, to defend our unstable borders, and \nto populate the new frontier.\n  At the turn of the century, our immigrant population helped to fuel \nthe Industrial Revolution and to promote economic expansion. As a \nconsequence, immigrants were allowed nearly unfettered access to our \nshores during that same period of time.\n  As the needs of our country changed over the course of the early part \nof the 20th century, so, too, did our immigration policies. Although \nsome of these policies were clearly the result of a racial animus, our \nlegal immigration system has evolved into one that primarily is based \non family unification and needed skills.\n  In spite of the Congress' best intentions, U.S. immigration laws have \nbeen violated on a massive scale over recent years. The Immigration and \nNaturalization Service estimates that nearly 300,000 undocumented \naliens enter and remain in the United States permanently each year. \nThat figure includes a substantial number in my own State of Nevada, \nestimated to be nearly 20,000.\n  The proposition 187 ballot initiative in California last year is an \nexample of the frustration felt by many in that State over the failure \nof the Federal Government to enforce our immigration laws. The \nconsensus that has emerged in this Congress and in the White House \nconcerning the need to balance the Federal budget in 7 years has placed \nsevere constraints on discretionary spending in the foreseeable future. \nAs that discretionary pie continues to shrink, we must constantly \nreprioritize the spending allocations for many worthwhile spending \nprograms that in whole or in part the Federal Government has been asked \nto support.\n  While rational people may disagree as to the overall societal cost \nassociated with illegal immigration, it seems rather fundamental to me \nthat limited Federal resources are better spent on those persons who \nhave played by the rules and reside in our country legally.\n  I want to mention another aspect of unlawful immigration, one that is \nmore difficult to quantify, yet clearly carries a price tag for us as a \nsociety. That is the cost to our environment. In many parts of the \ncountry, but particularly in the Southwest, the burgeoning population \nhas placed tremendous strains on our natural resources. The quality of \nthe air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land on which we live \nand recreate is directly related to population levels. Our ability to \nmaintain a safe and healthy environment is constantly being challenged \nas those growth levels continue to increase. Unlawful immigration \nexacerbates these challenges in areas ranging from solid waste disposal \nto maintenance of our city parks.\n  Mr. President, I have cited several of the realities we face as a \nnation in order to put in context the need for the legislation that we \nhave debated and, hopefully, we will pass later on today.\n  Quite simply, we must do a much better job of curbing the flow of \nillegal immigration, and that means both preventing illegal aliens from \nentering our country and deporting those who remained within our \nborders unlawfully. The legislation that we debate addresses both of \nthese problems. It contains strong law enforcement provisions to assist \nin detaining and removing illegal immigrants, and, more importantly, it \nincludes strong provisions relating to employer sanctions and \nverification systems.\n  I might just parenthetically acknowledge the support of Senator \nSimpson and Senator Kennedy with an amendment which I added which has \nbeen included in the managers' amendment that deals with juvenile \noffenders who are here illegally and commit crimes that, if committed \nby adult offenders, would be serious felony offenses.\n  The fact that this provision has been accepted in the legislation, I \nthink, will strengthen the hand of law enforcement and give us an \nadditional tool to deal with those violent juvenile offenders who are \nhere unlawfully who currently are protected under the provisions of the \nFamily Unity Act and who now may be subject to the provisions which \nwill enable a stronger effort to be made to return them to the country \nof their own origin when these serious felony offenses are committed.\n  The bill incorporates many of the recommendations of the Commission \non Immigration Reform, as I alluded to earlier. It recognizes, as did \nthe Commission, that the primary factor motivating people to enter our \ncountry illegally is the availability of jobs, jobs that pay more, \noften much more, than that in which an individual could expect to make \nin his or her native country.\n  While this legislation reflects the need to enhance our border \nsecurity efforts by nearly doubling the authorized level of Border \nPatrol agents over the next 5 years, it also recognizes the fiscal and \ngeographical constraints of patrolling the entire U.S. border.\n  Mr. President, the fact that more than half of all of illegal \nimmigrants currently in the United States entered our country legally \nand subsequently overstayed their visas evidences the need to do much \nmore than just to improve border security to stem the tide of illegal \nimmigration.\n  The Commission on Immigration Reform found that the ineffectiveness \nof employer sanctions, prevalence of fraudulent documents, and \ncontinued high numbers of unauthorized workers, combined with confusion \nfor employers and reported discrimination against employees have \nchallenged the credibility of current work site enforcement efforts.\n  This bill recognizes an improved system to verify eligibility to work \nin this country must be developed. It includes provisions to reduce the \nlist of documents that may be accepted by employers, and directs the \nPresident to conduct local or regional pilot projects on improved \nverification systems. The recommended system could not be implemented, \nhowever, until it was authorized by Congress.\n  The bill also contains provisions related to another recommendation \nof the commission, and that is the availability of public benefits to \nlegal immigrants. The current law in this area, a version of which has \nbeen on the books for more than a century, provides that an immigrant \nmay be admitted to the United States only if the immigrant provides \nadequate assurance that he or she is not likely at any time to become a \npublic charge. The bill provides if an alien within 5 years of entry \ndoes become a public charge that immigrant may be subject to \ndeportation.\n\n  This policy is consistent with the Commission's recommendation and \nwith the philosophy we as a Nation admit legal immigrants, with the \nexpectation they will reside permanently in the United States as \nproductive residents. In addition, the bill provides sponsors should be \nheld financially responsible for the immigrants they bring into this \ncountry. In making the affidavits of support signed by sponsors legally \nenforceable, the bill indemnifies the Federal Government and seeks to \nhold the taxpayers harmless of their current responsibility for \nproviding for support.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I recognize the \ncontribution immigrants have made to our society. With the exception of \nnative Americans, we are all a product of our Nation's immigration \nsystem. That is why it is so important for us as a nation to establish \nand to enforce our immigration laws so that those who have played by \nthe rules and followed the law are rewarded for their efforts. We can \nno longer allow aliens who enter or remain in the United States in \nviolation of our immigration laws to effectively take immigration \nopportunities that might otherwise be extended to those potential legal \nimmigrants whose presence would be more consistent with the public \npolicy determinations made by this Congress about what is in our \nnational interests.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I commend Senators Simpson and Kennedy for \ntheir efforts in producing this piece of legislation. I look forward to \nsupporting its enactment and its final passage. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

UNFUNDED FEDERAL INTERGOVERNMENTAL MANDATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 90 days after the beginning of fiscal \n     year 1997, and annually thereafter, the determinatons \n     described in subsection (b) shall be made, if any such \n     determination is affirmative, the requirements imposed on \n     State and local governments under this Act relating to the \n     affirmative determination shall be suspended.\n       (b) Determination Described.--A determination described in \n     this subsection means one of the following:\n       (1) A determination by the responsible Federal agency or \n     the responsible State or local administering agency regarding \n     whether the costs of administering a requirement imposed on \n     State and local government under this Act exceeds the \n     estimated net savings in benefit expenditures.\n       (2) A determination by the responsible Federal agency, or \n     the responsible State or local administering agency, \n     regarding whether Federal funding is insufficient to fully \n     fund the costs imposed by a requirement imposed on State and \n     local governments under this Act.\n       (3) A determination by the responsible Federal agency, or \n     the responsible State or local administering agency, \n     regarding whether application of the requirement on a State \n     or local government would significantly delay or deny \n     services to otherwise eligible individuals in a manner that \n     would hinder the protection of life, safety, or public \n     health.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before I commence my remarks on this \nspecific amendment I will provide some context. I strongly support the \nefforts that have been made and that are being made in this legislation \nto stem the tide of illegal alien entry and continued presence in the \nUnited States of America. Clearly, it is a national responsibility \ndelegated singularly to the Federal Government under our U.S. \nConstitution to protect our borders and assure that in all areas, \nincluding immigration, that we live by the rule of law and not by the \nrule of the jungle.\n  What concerns me, from the State which has experienced the adverse \neffect of illegal aliens to a greater extent that any other State in \nthe Nation has done so, and who feels so passionately about the \nnational responsibility to enforce our laws and protect our borders, \nwhat concerns me is that in this legislation which is labeled, which \nhas on its book jacket the phrase ``illegal immigration,'' when you \nopen the book, look at the individual chapters, there are significant \nprovisions that do not relate to illegal immigration.\n  We dealt with one of those provisions earlier this week when we \neliminated the provision in the original bill that would have \nessentially terminated immediately the Cuban Adjustment Act, an act \nfrom 1966 to today which only is available to people who are in this \ncountry with legal status. That is not the only example in a book which \nhas in its title ``illegal immigration.'' Its chapters have provisions \nrelating to people who are in here, having followed the law, having \nfollowed the rules, paying taxes, doing all the things that we expect \nof law-abiding residents within the United States. Most particularly, \nMr. President, those provisions that affect legal aliens come into play \nin the aspect of the eligibility of those legal aliens for a variety of \nprograms which have some degree of Federal financial involvement.\n  I support, also, the principle that the sponsors of this legislation \nhave articulated on repeated occasions that we should look first to the \nperson who sponsored the alien into the country as being the \nfinancially responsible partner, for their needs to avoid the necessity \nof that individual becoming a public charge. That is a desirable and, \nfrankly, too-long ignored principle. Our courts have ruled as recently \nas 2 years ago that the current affidavit of sponsorship is not legally \nenforceable. This legislation will hope to breathe the fire of \nenforceability into that affidavit.\n  My concern, Mr. President, is not only that we are dealing with legal \naliens in a bill described as illegal immigration, and carries with it \nall of the momentum and all of the emotion and passion that that title \nbrings, but also that we are placing the Federal Government in a \nposition of being the deadbeat dad of immigration. And how is that? The \nFederal Government determines how many legal aliens can come into this \ncountry. The Federal Government determines under what conditions they \ncan come and under what conditions they can stay. None of those \ndecisions can be influenced by the local community, whether it is \nDayton, OH, or Dade County, FL. None of those can be influenced by a \nState. They are totally national judgments, and we made several of \nthose judgments in the past few days here on the Senate floor.\n\n  We are now saying that we are going to look primarily to the sponsor \nto pay the cost of that sponsored alien. But what happens if that \nsponsor is unable, unwilling, or cannot be found to carry on that \nresponsibility? The way the structure of this bill is, you determine \nthe financial condition of the sponsor, and since this bill says nobody \ncan sponsor an alien unless they are at least 125 percent above the \npoverty level, and since for most of the programs of eligibility you \nhave to have less than 125 percent in order to qualify--for instance, \nMedicaid--in most States, unless you are in a special category such as \na pregnant woman or a child, you have to be substantially less than 100 \npercent of poverty in order to qualify. So, by definition, almost every \none of these legal aliens with a sponsor's income is going to be \nrendered ineligible for needs-based programs in which the Federal \nGovernment is a participant.\n  But what happens when the reality is that the sponsor is unable or \nunwilling to meet the obligations of the sponsored legal alien? The \nmost likely area in which that is going to occur is going to be health \ncare. Most sponsors will be able to meet their obligations in terms of \nproviding food, or shelter, or other basic necessities of life, but \nwhat happens when that alien is diagnosed as having cancer? What \nhappens when that legal alien is seriously injured? That is when that \nsponsor, at 125 percent of the poverty level, is not going to \nrealistically be able to meet those needs.\n  We have a Federal law that says that any American person--not just a \ncitizen--any person can go to a hospital and get emergency treatment \nregardless of their financial condition. That is exactly what is going \nto happen with that legal alien with cancer, or a serious accident, or \nif they become pregnant and they cannot afford the cost of delivery. \nThey are going to end up at a hospital with their medical condition and \nunable to pay and the sponsor being unable to pay.\n  Now the Federal Government has washed its hands of that \nresponsibility. We are the ``deadbeat dad'' of obligations of legal \naliens. But somebody is going to pay. That somebody is going to be the \nhospital or, more likely, the local community and the State and their \ntaxpayers in which that hospital is located.\n\n  So the issue is not should the sponsor be responsible. Yes, the \nsponsor should be responsible, and we are helping to make that more \nlikely. But the question is, what happens when the sponsor, for a \nvariety of reasons, is not there when the bill comes due? The fact is, \nwhat is going to happen is that there will be a new unfunded mandate \nimposed upon the communities in which the legal alien lives.\n  We also have some unfunded mandates, Mr. President, that you spoke to \neloquently yesterday relative to new responsibilities on businesses. We \nare not willing to pick up all of the cost that it is going to take to \nimplement many of these programs, including the verification programs. \nSo we have said, in addition to asking local governments and States to \nhave to pick up additional costs, we are going to shift some of these \ncosts off to the private sector and let them pay for it. I do not think \nthis is a fair allocation of what is\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\na constitutional Federal responsibility for our immigration laws.\n  So, Mr. President, as I begin my comments on this specific amendment, \nI want to make it clear: I think we ought to have the strongest laws \nand commitment to enforce those laws against illegal immigration that \nare available to us. I think that it is appropriate to ask sponsors to \nbe primarily responsible for legal aliens. I do not think we ought to \nbe doing it in this bill. As a matter of policy, it is a desirable \nobjective, but I do not think that we ought to be setting up a \ncircumstance in which the Federal Government essentially shirks its \nfinancial obligation and adds that obligation to the communities in \nwhich legal aliens are living and to the business sector which is now \ngoing to carry new responsibilities for verification.\n  Mr. President, the first priority of the Senate during this 104th \nCongress was S. 1, the very first bill filed at the desk, S. 1, and the \ntitle of that was the unfunded mandate reform bill of 1995. It was also \nincluded as a top priority in the House of Representatives, and it \npassed both bodies in the first 100 days of the 104th Congress. At the \ntime we considered that legislation, the majority leader of the Senate \nsaid, and I quote:\n\n       Mr. President, the time has come for a little legislative \n     truth-in-advertising. Before Members of Congress vote for a \n     piece of legislation, they need to know how it would impact \n     the States and localities they represent. If Members of \n     Congress want to pass a new law, they should be willing to \n     make the tough choices needed to pay for them.\n\n  I strongly concur in the statement of our majority leader.\n  What does that statement now have to say about the legislation that \nis before us this morning? The Congressional Budget Office, in the \nlimited time available to it to review the legislation's broad, \nsweeping impact on State and local governments, has determined that \nthis bill, S. 1664, does in fact violate the $50 million threshold for \ntripping into effect the unfunded mandate procedure. That $50 million \nis found just in two areas: the requirements governing increased \nexpenses for birth certificates, and driver's licenses. Although the \nbill would impact literally hundreds of programs run by State and local \ngovernments, just these two--birth certificates and driver's licenses--\nwould have an unfunded mandate on State and local governments in excess \nof $50 million.\n  With respect to all of the encompassing requirements imposed under \nthis legislation, the Congressional Budget Office states:\n\n       Given the scope and complexity of the affected programs, \n     however, the Congressional Budget Office has not been able to \n     estimate either the likelihood or magnitude of such costs at \n     this time. These costs could be significant, depending on how \n     strictly the deeming requirements are enforced by the Federal \n     Government.\n\n  Let me repeat. ``These costs could be significant.''\n  Mr. President, S. 1664 fails the majority leader's truth-in-\nadvertising test. We are prepared to vote on a bill that we truly have \nnot the foggiest idea what its impact will be on State and local \ngovernments. We certainly are extremely concerned and strongly \nsupportive of raising the issue of unfunded mandates.\n  As a result, I have offered the amendment which is currently before \nthe Senate that would waive the imposed and mandated bureaucratic \nrequirements if the Federal, State, or local administering agency makes \none of these three determinations: a determination that the cost of \nimposing the requirement exceeds the benefit; second, that Federal \nfunding is not sufficient to cover the cost of the imposed requirement; \nor, third, that the application of the requirement would delay or deny \nservices to the otherwise eligible legal immigrant in a manner that \nthreatens life, safety, or public health.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter dated April 24 from the National \nConference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, \nand the National League of Cities. This letter strongly supports the \npending amendment. In it, these three organizations write:\n\n       This assures that new deeming mandates are cost effective \n     and not unfunded mandates. This is a critical test of your \n     commitment to preventing cost shifts to, and unfunded \n     administrative burdens on, State and local governments.\n\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors also supports this amendment. In short, \nthis bill, once again, creates a large unfunded mandate on State and \nlocal governments. Once again, I repeat the quote from the \nCongressional Budget Office:\n\n       Given the scope and complexity of the affected programs, \n     CBO was not able to estimate either the likelihood or the \n     magnitude of such costs at this time. These costs could be \n     significant.\n\n  Mr. President, the only study as to what these costs may be comes \nfrom the National Conference of State Legislatures. These are our \ncolleagues, fellow legislators in State capitals across the land. Many \nof us had the privilege, at a previous time, to have served in a State \nlegislature. We know the difficult choices that they must make in terms \nof balancing limited resources at the State level, because they do not \nhave the option, as we do, to deficit finance their programs. So they \nare very concerned about unfunded mandates that distort priorities.\n  The CBO had a limited time, as did the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, to do its study. But the NCSL developed a report on 10 \naffected programs. This study, incidentally, did not include Medicaid \nand did not include 40 other Federal means-tested programs which will \nbe covered by this legislation. But what did it find in the 10 programs \nthat were studied? After contacting more than 10 States of varying \nsizes, the study concludes that:\n\n       Regardless of the size of the immigrant population, all \n     States and localities will have to implement these unfunded \n     mandates.\n\n  In other words, this bill impacts Sioux City, IA, and Billings, MT, \njust as it does Los Angeles, CA, or Miami, FL. This bill requires all \nFederal, State, and local means-tested programs to have a new \ncitizenship verification bureaucracy imposed upon them--even those \nareas which have very few aliens. As a result, what are the estimated \ncosts being imposed on State and local governments, even for just the \n10 programs that the NCSL has studied? According to the study, ``The \ncost of these requirements for 10 selected programs would result in a \n$744-million unfunded mandate.'' A $744-million unfunded mandate.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat that the NCSL study indicates that the \nunfunded mandate cost of 10 programs will be $744 million. Once the \nother multitude of programs are analyzed, the cost on State and local \ngovernments could far exceed a billion dollars. It could be several \nbillion dollars. Nobody has the foggiest idea.\n  However, there are no provisions in the pending legislation to \nreimburse State and local governments for the administrative costs and \nthe cost shifts that will be imposed upon them. As the majority leader \nsaid, again, in debating the unfunded mandate bill:\n\n       We do not have all the answers in Washington, DC. Why \n     should we tell Idaho, or the State of Kansas, or the State of \n     South Dakota, or any State, that we are going to pass this \n     Federal law, and we are going to require that you do certain \n     things, but we are not going to send you any money? So you \n     raise taxes in the local communities or in the State. You tax \n     the people, and when they complain about it, say, ``Well, we \n     cannot help it because the Federal Government passed this \n     mandate.'' So we are going to continue our drive to return \n     power to our States and our people through the 104th \n     Congress.\n\n  Those words were a ringing declaration of purpose in January 1995, \nwhich I think we should now recall in May 1996. All programs in all \nplaces, regardless of whether the new bureaucratic costs exceed the \nbenefit, regardless of whether it imposes a very large unfunded mandate \non State and local government, are impacted by this bill.\n  Some examples: Foster grandparents in Bismarck, ND, or a van to check \nthe blood pressure of poor, pregnant mothers in Topeka, KS, using \nalternative child care health funding. These are examples of programs \nthat have Federal funding that would now be subject to the verification \nrequirements of this legislation. The local jurisdictions with few if \nany aliens would have to verify immigration status and sponsorship \ninformation, regardless of that fact.\n  My amendment would allow the State or local administrative agency, or \nthe Federal agency, to certify and waive out of the bill's requirement \nin such a case where the cost of implementation clearly exceeds the \nsavings that are contemplated. This amendment recognizes that one-size-\nfits-all policies do not work and are not cost\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\neffective--a recognition of a basic tenet of this country's federalism.\n  This amendment would also recognize that this may be virtually no \nsavings--something that the Congressional Budget Office has verified in \nits scoring of the bill's savings in certain programs. For example, the \nmaternal child health block grant funding is often used to augment \nservices provided by the public health department for preventive health \ncare services aimed at pregnant women. However, since the maternal \nchild care program is capped--that is, there is a maximum expenditure--\nthere would be no Federal savings by imposing any additional \nadministrative requirements. Again, CBO estimates no cost savings by \nimposing deeming in the maternal child care program. But administrative \ncosts would certainly increase substantially for public health units \nacross America.\n\n  In such a case, despite the fact that the Federal funding to the \npublic health department would account for as little as 1 percent of \ntotal funding, all of this new bureaucracy would be imposed. The added \ncost of administering deeming, for example, in such a program could \nexceed all of the Federal funding that goes into the program. This is \nneither prudent nor something which I believe our colleagues would \nthink is sufficient government.\n  Moreover, this amendment is entirely consistent with statutory \nlanguage, which provided that the implementation of the system of alien \nverification--the SAVE Program--was administered. Under the SAVE \nProgram, States could be waived from the program upon a determination \nthat implementing SAVE would cost more money than the savings that \nwould flow from such implementation. So we already have, in the \nimmigration law itself, an example of recognizing a cost-benefit \nrelationship, and that cost-benefit relationship will differ from one \ncommunity to another.\n  In addition, the amendment would allow the appropriate Federal, \nState, or local agency to suspend the application of the bill's \nadministrative requirements upon the determination that the application \nrequirement would significantly delay or deny services to otherwise \neligible individuals in a manner that would hinder the protection of \nlife, safety, or public health.\n  For example, the determination could be made that the alien sponsor's \ndeeming requirement should not be applied on a temporary basis with \nrespect to short-term disaster relief, because it could delay essential \naid to citizens and aliens alike who are disaster victims. In the case \nof a major natural disaster, which could occur with little or no prior \nwarning, a person's home can be destroyed in short notice. One's lost \npossessions could include proof of immigration, citizenship status, or \nfinancial information.\n  Without this amendment, emergency food or housing vouchers could not \nbe provided to a disaster victim until the alien's citizenship status \nand sponsorship information has been verified, which can take weeks. It \nwould also relieve an undue administrative burden on disaster relief \nagencies that would presently have to verify immigration status and \nsponsorship information during the course of dealing with the disaster \nin its aftermath. The ultimate victims of such administrative burdens \nwould be the disaster victims themselves, who would have to wait longer \nto receive services.\n  Mr. President, we passed the unfunded mandate bill as our first \npriority. The National Conference of State Legislatures, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National League of Cities, and the United \nStates Conference of Mayors have said, ``This is a critical test of our \ncommitment to the unfunded mandate law we passed.''\n  To be against this amendment would be to argue that we should impose \ncosts that exceed the benefit, to impose unfunded mandates on State and \nlocal governments and to deny or delay services even if they threaten \nlife, safety, and public health. I cannot believe that anyone in this \nChamber believes that those would be wise or prudent courses of public \npolicy.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this is like a symphony. We are returning \nonce again to the central theme: This is about deeming, and it is about \nthe sponsor paying what the sponsor promised to pay.\n  I hear every one of those remarkable and compassionate examples that \nthe Senator from Florida portrays. I know him well. He believes deeply \nin this. He is a caring person, and he obviously is receiving a great \ndeal of information from his State and from those who administer health \ncare in his State. I understand that. I understand it all.\n  However, I understand something even more clearly, and that is this. \nWe are talking about legal immigrants, and a legal immigrant cannot \ncome to this country, cannot get in until the sponsor has promised and \ngiven an affidavit of support that the person coming in will not become \na public charge and that whatever assets the sponsor has or income that \nthe sponsor has are deemed to be the assets of the legal immigrant.\n  Too bad we have come to the word ``deem.'' The word ``deem'' seems to \nconfuse people, but I think with the votes we have had the last few \ndays, or 2 or 3 days on this same issue, they are not confused.\n  Deeming means that if your sponsor has money, his money is considered \nyour money when you go down to get relief from the taxpayers. I do not \nknow how that seems to escape the debate. When you walk up to get money \nfrom the Federal Treasury, from the rest of us, why should the rest of \nus cough up the money when the sponsor has not done it yet, or has not \nrun out of money himself or herself?\n  That is the issue. There is no other issue.\n  Now, what if the sponsor is in trouble? What if the sponsor cannot \ncut the mustard? What if the sponsor says: I did agree to bring this \nperson to the United States and I did agree that they would not become \na public charge, and I did agree to sign an affidavit of sponsorship, \nand I promised to do that, but I cannot do it. I have had a bankruptcy. \nI have lost my job. I cannot do it.\n  And what happens then? That is it. The sponsor is off the hook, and \nthe taxpayers pick up the load. Nobody is saying that these people \nwander around in the streets; that they do not make it; that they are \nnot going to make it. All we are saying is whatever the program, if the \nsponsor has the assets and the income stream and can afford to pay, \nthat sponsor will pay before the taxpayers of the United States pay \nanything, regardless of what it may be, with the exception of what was \nin the managers' amendment, which was in the committee amendment, which \nwas about soup kitchens--that is in there. We do provide that--and \nthere were several other items, and Senator Kennedy will recall what \nthose are.\n  If this is one that I guess our colleagues do not understand, then I \nthink we have failed in the debate, and people may vote it certainly \neither way. But I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment. It is \none more amendment on deeming. The amendment would allow State welfare \nagencies to avoid the requirement to deem if the State agency itself--\nnow listen to that--it is the State agency itself determining that, \none, the administrative costs would exceed the net savings or, two, \nthat Federal funds are insufficient to fund the administrative costs, \nor, three, that deeming would ``significantly delay or deny services in \na manner that would hinder the protection of life, safety, or public \nhealth.''\n  The enactment of the bill itself would create a congressional \nrequirement for deeming, for Federal and all federally funded programs, \nand that requirement is based on the basic belief that after immigrants \nare admitted to the United States they should be self-sufficient. It is \nbased on the belief that when immigrants need assistance, such \nassistance should be provided, first, by the immigrant's sponsor who \nmade the initial promise, and if they have not made the initial \npromise, these people would not have been admitted to the United \nStates. That was the sponsor's promise. That was a condition of the \nimmigrant's admission to our country, a very generous country. And I do \nnot feel it should be up to a State welfare agency or even a Federal \nwelfare agency to decide that such deeming should not be required.\n\n  Let us face the real basic fact. You have some agencies in some \nStates and,\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\nboy, they have a tremendous drain--I am sure Florida is one--created by \na legal and illegal immigrant population, created by parolees, created \nby Cubans and Haitians. I understand that. I do understand that. And \nthat is why we provide and always have provided in this work for extra \nmoney, extra money always for Florida, California--I remember that in \nthe original bills. I remember that. But let us face the facts. Those \nagencies, for the best of motives, are far more interested in spending \nmoney than in saving it.\n  Mr. President, if the Congress decides that deeming is not \nappropriate for particular programs or particular classes of \nimmigrants, I think then and only then the deeming should not be \nrequired, but it should not be done by State fiat.\n  Let me just say a few words about the issue of administrative costs. \nThe Senator from Florida mentions the administrative costs to the \nStates of the deeming requirements. I remind my colleagues the deeming \nrequirements only apply to programs that under current law are means \ntested.\n  The effect of deeming is that when an immigrant applies, as I say, \nfor assistance, he or she must report to the provider not only his or \nher income and assets but also that of the sponsor. That just adds \nanother line or two to the application form. So to be told that this is \na terrible administrative burden, here is how I foresee it. You fill \nout the form, and it says on there your assets and your income. You \nfill it out, and you add two new lines: Do you have a sponsor in the \nUnited States of America? If the answer is yes, you say, what are the \nassets of your sponsor in dollars? And you enter it. And the second \nline: What is the income of the sponsor? And you enter that.\n  That does not seem to me to be a great administrative burden. But, \nhow deeming is enforced, and I hear that argument, how agencies \ndetermine whether applicants are telling the truth, of course is \nanother matter, as we all know.\n  I assume various agencies will have different enforcement policies, \nas they do today. Some may require verification of income levels from \nevery applicant. Some may adopt an audit-type approach similar to that \nof the IRS. I do not understand why the bill would lead to any change \nin that situation. Enforcement policy would be determined by the agency \ninvolved. It appears likely to be similar to current practices. If an \napplicant's own income must be verified, and I assure my colleague that \nis always the case, then the income of the applicant's sponsor also is \nlikely to be verified also. That is the extra administrative burden, \nand the purpose of it is to find out what they have, and if they have \nit you make them pay it before the rest of us pick up the tab for \npeople who promised to pay for them when they came here or they could \nnot have come here unless they made the promise.\n  I do not know--and I respect greatly my friend from Florida, and \ncertainly consistency and persistency are his forte--but I just think \nthe American public has a lot of difficulty wondering why the general \ntaxpayers have to pick up the tab for anything on someone who came here \non the sole promise that their sponsor would take care of everything \nand that they would not become a ``public charge.'' Now, under the \npresent bill, if they become a public charge for 12 months out of the \n5-year period they can be subject to deportation, with certain clearly \nexpressed exclusions.\n  I regret being in a position where one would have to be portrayed as, \n``Why are you doing this?'' We are doing it only because I think \nAmericans understand something about taking care of others. Our budget \nthis year is $1,506,000,000,000 so we must be taking care of someone in \nthe United States of America; $1,506,000,000,000. Food stamps, cash, \nnoncash, I vote for those things and will continue to do so. But I do \nnot know why I should do it if someone agreed to pay it before I had to \npay it. I guess I have enough regard for my own promises, that if I \npromise to bring people to the United States and pay for them and they \nwent down to get some kind of means-tested assistance or welfare, I \nwould be embarrassed that I could not cough up the money to do it \nbecause they are probably relatives of mine and I promised they would \nnot become a burden on the taxpayers. I would keep that promise. I have \ndone that with relatives of mine. I do not know why that should be the \nresponsibility of others. And that is where we are and that is what \ndeeming is and there is a reason for it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Florida is \nreally putting his finger on a different issue, and it is a very real \nissue for anyone who considers, in this instance, large public \nhospitals. I think all of us understand the real crisis public \nhospitals have in serving the needy in all of our great communities and \ncities.\n  As I understand the point of the Senator from Florida, if someone is \na legal immigrant and has a sponsor and arrives at the Boston City \nHospital, that person is going to be treated right away. As the Senator \npointed out, we are required to treat him, but it is the hospital \npolicy, in any event, to treat that individual. So they get treated \nright away. Their emergency is attended to. Now the hospital goes about \nsaying, ``How are we going to recover the payments for it?'' It goes to \nthe individual. That person happens to be needy, happens to be poor, \nand happens to be a legal immigrant.\n  The point, No. 1, Mr. President, is that the foreign-born immigrants \nin the United States represent 6 percent of the population and only 8 \npercent of the utilization in the Medicaid Program. We do not find the \nabuses in the Medicaid Program. We do in the SSI, which has been \naddressed in this with effective measures over the period of the next \n10 years. But this program we are talking about is not more heavily \nused by legal immigrants than it is by American citizens. We have to \nunderstand that.\n\n  We are not going to take the time of the Senate to demonstrate how \nlegal immigrants pay in billions of dollars more than they ever benefit \nfrom in terms of taxes, which they are glad and willing to do.\n  We are talking about that individual who has fallen on hard times and \nhas some kind of unforeseen accident. All right, that person goes in \nand they are attended to. Then the hospital has to set up some process \nand procedure--which is going to cost them something, which is not \ngoing to be reimbursed by this bill--to go on out and find out who that \nsponsor is. That sponsor may be in a different part of the country. He \nor she may be glad to participate and pay for those medical bills.\n  But, on the other hand, that sponsor may have died, may be bankrupt, \nmay be in another part of the country and refuses to respond. Our \nconcerns are what is going to happen to that city hospital? What is \ngoing to happen to that city hospital when that city hospital does not \nget paid by the individual, does not get paid by the sponsor, and has \nto go to court? Who is paying the court fees to try to get the money?\n  I am sure the Senator from Wyoming would assume the responsibility \nthat they have assigned. But suppose that individual is in some \nfinancial difficulty. That would have been very easy, in my part of the \ncountry, during the 1980's, when we were having a serious, serious \nrecession. That person comes in and the hospital cannot recover. So, \nwhat do they do? They serve primarily the poorest of the poor, the \nuninsured. Even though there is not overutilization of the Medicaid \nProgram, there are many hospitals like the public hospitals, like a \ngood hospital that serves--particularly city hospital, in Cambridge, \nthat serves about half our foreign born--that would have very \nsubstantial additional costs.\n  Over the 6-year period, the Boston City Hospital estimates that the \nadditional costs will be $26 to $28 million. We cannot say that to an \nabsolute certainty. But looking over their lists, and at a quick \nreview, they estimate that is the additional cost to the Boston City \nHospital. And there is not going to be any additional help and \nassistance for Boston City Hospital.\n  Senators can say we do not want the taxpayers to pay. They are going \nto end up paying in that local community, the taxpayers are going to \nend up paying. All we are saying is, unless we are going to provide at \nleast some recognition of this problem, if that is going to be the \ncase, then do not jam it\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\nto the health institutions that are providing for the neediest people \nin our society. That is, effectively, an unfunded mandate, as far as I \ncan see. It might not fall within the particular scope of the \nlegislation that was passed. I understand that. And perhaps technically \nit does not. But the idea that we around here some months ago were \nsaying that at least the Federal Government is not going to do \nsomething to States and local communities, or in this instance the city \nof Boston and the Boston City Hospital--``We are not going to give you \nsomething that you cannot afford to pay for''--is not so, with regard \nto this particular provision.\n  You can ask any administrator at any public hospital in this country. \nThey have an interest in trying to, No. 1, provide health services. \nBut, also, to be able to provide them, they are going to have at least \nsome kind of financial assurance they are going to be able to do it.\n  They are going to end up either trying to pass the costs on to others \nwho have insurance, and most of them in the inner cities--many of the \nclinics in rural areas just are not going to do it. We are going to see \na deterioration in the quality of health care. People ought to \nunderstand it. That is what is going to happen. We can say it is not \ngoing to happen, that that hospital in Boston is just going to pick up \nthat piece of paper and say, ``Oh, it is John Doe, he has $25,000 in a \nsafety deposit box and he just cannot wait to pay that hospital.'' That \nis unreal.\n  We are talking about the real world in many of these urban areas, \nwhether it is in Florida or the hospitals in Los Angeles or Boston City \nHospital, Chicago, San Francisco--any of them. They are in crisis, in \nany event. Given the additional kinds of responsibilities that they \nhave had to treat people who have preexisting conditions, or who are \nthe subject of violence and battering, which has grown and exploded, or \nsubstance abuse in those communities, or HIV infections--all of these \nproblems fall on the inner-city hospitals. That is the reality of it.\n  To think these overtaxed medical professionals are going to be able \nto run through this gamut to find that person who is deeming and bring \ncourt cases and recover those funds, good for them when they can do it. \nBut the purpose of this is to recognize you are still going to insist \nthese hospitals are going to end up holding the bag, and that is \nunfair.\n  As I understand the amendment, it says if that is the case, after \nthey made every effort to try and recover and that is the case, that \nthis is going to be at least suspended until we address that particular \nissue. It seems to me that happens to be fair.\n  Finally, as I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, if this looks like a \nduck and this quacks like a duck, it is a duck. This is a requirement \non State and local communities and local institutions to take actions \nfor which we are not providing the resources. There is not a nickel in \nhere to either try to help the State of Massachusetts or Suffolk County \nor the public hospitals in Boston to help relieve them when we are \ntightening the belt.\n  I think the point is well taken on this issue. I think we should \nrecognize that and support the amendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, just a query. What is the plan here? Is it \nto stack votes? What is the arrangement going to be?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have not visited with our majority \nleader, but the plan is to conclude the debate on the pending \namendments. So I am ready to set aside the pending amendment and go \nimmediately to the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island, if that \nis appropriate.\n  I believe there is one other amendment to be offered by Senator \nDeWine. There is a Senator Chafee amendment. There is the Graham \namendment. The Simpson-Kennedy amendment is pending. We would like to \ncomplete the debate.\n  So, if the Senator from Rhode Island would like to offer his \namendment at this time--we can set aside and continue debate later on \nthe Graham amendment with no time agreement. We will try to get a time \nagreement on these various measures. If the Senator wishes to enter \ninto a time agreement, I would enjoy that opportunity.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am willing to enter a time agreement of \n20 minutes equally divided, with the understanding that if I do need a \ncouple more minutes, the Senator will be good enough to let me have \nthat. I will sure appreciate it.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island offer an amendment with a time agreement of 20 \nminutes equally divided, and if the Senator should require more time, I \nwill yield sufficient time from what little time I have left. What is \nthe status with regard to my time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will answer the question of the \nSenator from Wyoming. He has 34 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Under the system of the stacking, will there be the usual \nsystem of when we do vote, we will have a minute to each side to \nexplain?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, when we eventually enter that unanimous-\nconsent request, indeed there will be the usual provision and assurance \nthat there will be 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has already been ordered. The Senator has \nasked unanimous consent for 20 minutes equally divided. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGraham's amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3840\n\n (Purpose: To provide that the emergency benefits available to illegal \nimmigrants also are made available to legal immigrants as exceptions to \n                       the deeming requirements)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have a very simple amendment. Some will \nsay we have been over this ground before. I do not think that is quite \naccurate in that this is far narrower--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Rhode Island calling up \nhis amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Amendment No. 3840, and I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Mack be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself and \n     Mr. Mack, proposes an amendment numbered 3840.\n       On page 201, line 4, strike ``(vii)''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I say, this is an amendment that is far \nnarrower than any other amendment that has been brought up in \nconnection with this matter that we have been discussing.\n  I hope that the floor managers of this legislation will accept this \namendment. What it does is it says in those areas where illegal \naliens--illegal--who have come in unauthorized into the country are \nentitled to certain benefits in four categories--emergency Medicaid, \nprenatal and postpartum Medicaid services, short-term emergency \ndisaster relief, and public health assistance for immunizations, all of \nthese are emergency health matters--all of these are granted to illegal \naliens, and I am saying they ought to be granted to legal aliens.\n  If we let those who have come into the country illegally have these \nservices, then certainly they ought to be available for legal aliens \nwho properly came in under all the right procedures.\n  There will be considerable discussion, I suspect, about deeming, \nabout saying, ``Well, their sponsors ought to pay for these things.''\n  First of all, in a straight matter of equity, if you are illegal, you \nget them for free or you are able to qualify under whatever the \nqualifications are under these programs, and it seems to me if you are \nlegal, you should be entitled to the same thing.\n  You do have situations where a legal immigrant is reluctant to go to \nhis or her sponsor for support in certain matters. We have determined \nby the fact we are granting these privileges to illegal aliens, we are \ndoing it not because we have great big good hearts, but because we \nthink it is good for the country. We think it is good that illegal\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\naliens get immunization shots, and certainly if that is true, for the \nbenefit of the Nation, for the benefit of the public health, then the \nsame ought to apply to legal aliens.\n  So there it is, Mr. President. It is strictly an equity matter, if \nyou will. It is strictly a public health matter, likewise. We think it \nis worthwhile for illegal aliens to get proper prenatal care, and if we \nthink that is true for illegal aliens, certainly it ought to be true \nfor legal aliens.\n  This is not a budget buster. This is not going to drive the national \ndebt through the sky. These are very narrow, very limited matters, far \nmore limited than any of those that have been brought up in past \namendments.\n  This is not replaying an old record. This is a very, very defined \ngroup of benefits, and I hope that the floor managers will accept it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, there is no one more sincere in his \nbeliefs than my friend from Rhode Island. He is a man of great \nintegrity and courage, and I admire his strength as he does his work. \nHe is good at it.\n  This is another one of those amendments--this is my view of it, which \nI get to express--this is exactly what this is, another form of this \namendment, of what we have done before in six previous votes and will \ndo again.\n  We are considering an amendment which would have the effect of \nshifting cost from the persons who sponsor immigrants, usually their \nrelatives. We are shifting that to the American taxpayers.\n  This argument of how could we possibly do this for illegal aliens and \nnot do it for legal aliens who are paying and doing their share is a \ngreat argument. The reason we allow illegal aliens to receive certain \nbenefits, if the alien is needy, is because most Americans are like \nSenator John Chafee of Rhode Island or Senator Al Simpson of \nWyoming. The issue is, they should have that basic support system if \nthey are needy.\n\n  I have voted for that consistently. There were some in the House of \nRepresentatives who did not want to consistently stay with that support \nlevel. I have never been of that category. Most Americans, almost all \nAmericans, would agree that that is a wonderful thing to do for illegal \naliens who are here and who are needy.\n  The immigrants, the legal immigrants, can also receive all of those \nbenefits, too, if they are needy. I hope you hear this. I think I will \nnever make it through any more of it. If a legal immigrant is needy, \nthey will get everything in the left-hand column. I hope you hear that.\n  But if they have a legal sponsor who said that he or she was bringing \nthese people here only on the condition that they would not become a \npublic charge, then when that legal immigrant goes in to get a means-\ntested program, cash or noncash, they say, ``Are you needy?'' and he \nsays, ``I am.'' They say, ``Do you have a sponsor?'' ``I do.'' ``Does \nyour sponsor have any money?'' ``Yes.'' ``How much? List it.'' If that \nsponsor has funds, that sponsor will pay the bill and not the rest of \nus.\n  It is then a confusion, I guess, for people. It is deemed that the \nsponsor's income and assets are the assets and income of the legal \nimmigrant. So when they go to get those benefits, they are not going to \nget them if the sponsor has money. If the sponsor does not have money--\nand I want this very clearly heard, because the Senator from \nMassachusetts is saying, what will happen, what will happen if the \nsponsor does not have the money, cannot meet the obligation?\n  Ladies and gentlemen, it is very clear what will happen if the \nsponsor cannot cut the mustard and something has happened to the \nsponsor, the sponsor is sick or ill or bankrupt or whatever, then the \nsponsor is off the hook. That is listed in this bill; a determination \nthat, if the sponsor cannot meet the obligation that they assumed in \nthe promise, once that determination is made, then the U.S. taxpayers \nwill pick that up.\n  That is the purpose of our effort. The issue is just as simple as it \nalways was: Sponsor or taxpayer; take your choice.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. There are two points I would like to make.\n  First, Mr. President, why in the world do we provide these benefits \nfor illegal aliens if we do not think they are important for the \nnational health and benefit of the Nation? I mean, we have decided as a \nnation that it is important that any woman have proper prenatal care \nbecause we want that baby that is born to be healthy, healthy when \nborn, healthy throughout its life.\n  So we do not argue, we do not say, ``You're here illegally. Go back \nto where you came from.'' We say, ``You're here illegally, and we're \ngoing to see that you get proper prenatal care. We're going to see you \nare immunized.'' That is one of the provisions we have made here.\n  So, if it is that important that we are going to pay for that person, \nthen it seems to me likewise for the person who is here legally--\nwithout going through a lot of song and dance about the sponsorship or \ndeeming or tracing that person down, making sure that sponsor pays for \nit--get it over with, give them the immunization.\n  I say, Mr. President, that this is not something new I am bringing up \nhere. In two of these categories, as you note on this sheet here, that \nthe managers of the legislation in committee or on the floor, or \nsomeplace, have agreed to, is the fact that the legal alien should \nindeed get two of these benefits.\n  What are they? Nutrition programs. We say the illegal alien is \nentitled to the nutrition programs. And we say the legal alien is \nlikewise entitled. You do not have to go to your sponsor or get \ninvolved with this deeming business. You just get it. \nNutrition programs. If a nutrition program is important, it seems to me \nan immunization program is just as important.\n\n  So, Mr. President, to me this is not any budget buster. This is very \nnarrow. This is not your entitlement for all of Medicaid. It is very, \nvery limited. I hope, Mr. President, that the managers of the bill will \naccept the amendment. I want to thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will make a statement. But first, I \ninquire from the managers if we are making any progress on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, after serving as this leader's assistant \nfor some 10 years, I do know that he does desire to move things along \nrather adroitly. We are ready to do that.\n  Let me share with my respected leader where we are. No one has come \nover to debate on the Simpson-Kennedy amendment, so I think we are \nready to proceed with that. I think we are nearly concluded with regard \nto the Graham amendment--I think maybe another 5 minutes or so. The \nDeWine amendment is an amendment about coerced abortion in China. I \nthink it is out of order. Respectfully I say that. A point will lie \ntoward that. I do not know if the Senator will be coming to address \nthat. I think he will.\n  Then we have the Chafee amendment under a time agreement which is \nnearly expired. That is it. So I am sure that that is cheerful news for \nthe leader. There is a point of order, too, I share with Senator Dole.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think a point of order by Senator Graham. So do the \nmanagers anticipate when we might be voting on some of these \namendments? I know we have a conflict this afternoon. I know from 2 to \n3 there is a ceremony honoring the Reverend Billy Graham. Then I think \nat 4:30--unless that is going to change.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. At 3:45 we go down.\n  Mr. DOLE. At 3:45, a number of our Members need to go to the White \nHouse. I guess my point is whether we can have all those votes between \n3 and 3:45. There will be an effort to move that White House meeting to \na later time, because I assume the managers would like to finish this \nbill, too, so we would not have to come back at 6 o'clock after the \nWhite House meeting and have votes to 7, 8, 9 o'clock. We are just \ntrying to be helpful to the managers. I know you have done an \noutstanding job, and it has taken a great deal of time to move action \non the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the leader.\n  I think that would be an appropriate scenario. I hope that might be \npart of\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\na unanimous-consent request, with that time set, with a 15-minute first \nrollcall vote, and 10-minute votes thereafter. There will be four votes \nand a point of order, with a 1-minute explanation on each side of the \nthree following votes, not the first one. We would be ready, I think, \nto propose that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me have drafted a consent agreement. I will show it to \nboth Senator Kennedy and Senator Simpson. Perhaps if we could somehow \narrange to move the White House meeting 45 minutes, we could do all the \nvotes between 3 and 4:30 and then move on to the next item of business.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are prepared to accept that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time on \nthis.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I will just take another 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto the Chafee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The pending business is the Chafee amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, in this rather unique 2 minutes, I want \nto go back to the chart of Senator Chafee, if I may. I have been given \nthis stick. I want to tell you in 2 minutes that these people here, \nunder the category ``legal immigrant,'' ``no, no, no,'' that these \npeople are taken care of. They receive emergency Medicaid, they receive \nprenatal postpartum Medicaid services, they receive short-term \nemergency disaster relief, public health assistance, and the sponsor is \npaying for them--not the taxpayer. These people are not deprived.\n  When we say how can they be receiving something that the illegal is \nreceiving, they are receiving it, but we are not paying for it because \nthe sponsor that agreed to bring them here and pay for them to not \nbecome a public charge is paying for them. The reason we do this for \nillegal immigrants is because we are a very generous nation. I have \nvoted for all of that. I am not generous to somebody who brings someone \nhere and says they will pay the whole tab and they do not.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to stress once again that these are \nall emergency or health-oriented measures. Emergency Medicaid, prenatal \nMedicaid services, short-term disaster relief, nutrition programs, \nimmunization. We do not want these legal aliens hesitating to apply for \nthose because they are reluctant to go to their sponsor, because they \nare a long distance from their sponsor, because their problems might \ninvolve with just going to their sponsor to start with. We want them \nimmunized. We want them to have prenatal care.\n  We will not spend a lot of time asking a lot of questions. We have \ndecided as a nation, not just out of generosity, but for the rest of us \nwho are here, that we want illegal aliens, immigrants, immunized so \nthat we will not have a whole series of infectious diseases passed \naround. Certainly we ought to have the same requirement or hope that \nthe same thing will apply to the legal aliens.\n  Mr. President, that is the argument. On the basis of fairness and the \nbasis of public health protection, I hope we support the amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think at this point we will say debate \non this amendment is concluded and it will be voted on in accordance \nwith the unanimous-consent request which will be propounded shortly. I \nthank the Senator from Rhode Island very much.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. May I ask the Chair, is now the time to ask for the yeas \nand nays?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Perfectly appropriate. You require one person from the \nother party, if I am not mistaken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is correct.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. We do now have a Senator from the other side.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3759\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I direct my comments now to the amendment \nof Senator Graham. I conclude in my remarks, I do not believe that the \nFederal Government is going to be a deadbeat dad in this situation. In \nfact, I am reminded of the old road sign, the picture of the very \ndapper-looking Uncle Sam that says, ``He's your uncle, not your dad.''\n  We are a very generous nation. Medicaid has been picked to bits by \nthe States. Medicare has been picked to bits and will go bankrupt in \nthe year--originally we were told 2002; now we are told it will be \n2001; now the other day it will be 2000. We can talk about this all day \nand there will not be enough to do anything unless we deal with the \nentitlements programs. You will not want me to give that pitch again--\ndeal with Social Security, deal with Medicare, Medicaid, Federal \nretirement. Nothing will get done. We can pick through these piles \nforever.\n  Then, of course, remember how this is happening. You are talking \nabout legal immigrants. I did not see much activity on this floor to do \nmuch about legal immigrants. There will be a million of them next year \nand they will all be fitting right here, and nobody, at least the vast \nmajority, decided to do nothing with the flow of legal immigrants.\n  I hope that those colleagues who have already voted to keep legal \nimmigration at its historically highest levels in the history of our \ncountry at least will know what is happening when we find the resources \nof this country, where they are and where they go, for legal \nimmigration. But remember this: If the sponsor is unable to provide the \nsupport, loses his job, dies, whatever, the Federal Government will \npay. The Federal Government is here to support those people --and it \nshould.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to read the bill. We provide an exception \nfor indigent immigrants whose sponsors cannot be located. We have it in \nthere. If you cannot find their address, cannot hunt them down, or if \nthey refuse to pay, the Graham amendment--let us be clear what the \namendment does--allows the States to exempt themselves from the new \nwelfare restrictions and forces the U.S. taxpayers to pick up the tab.\n  I want to be perfectly clear here. CBO says that this bill, as \nmodified by the Simpson-Dole amendment, does not have any unfunded \nmandates. There are no unfunded mandates in the Simpson amendment, \nwhich is the bill. There were unfunded mandates in the original \nlegislation which underlies. So when the point of order comes, it will \nlook strange to you because it will say that there was an unfunded \nmandate--and there was--but it is corrected when we get to the final \nproduct. We have already removed the unfunded mandate portion of those \nprovisions. I think that should be made quite clear.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4579-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4587-S4590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNICODEMUS NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE AND THE NEW BEDFORD NATIONAL HISTORIC \n                                LANDMARK\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President. I want to express my strong opposition \nto the passage of this legislation. This legislation would establish a \nnew unit of the National Park System without the benefit of any \nconsideration by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during \nthis Congress. I will continue to oppose the creation of any new units \nthe committee and the Congress come to grips with the reality of what \nwe are doing to the National Park System by continually adding new \nunits and ignoring the responsibility for funding. If there had been a \nrecord vote on this measure, I would have voted ``no.''\n  I understand that the committee reported similar legislation during \nthe last Congress, but it was not acted upon by the Senate. The \ncommittee also agreed that this Congress we would consider the effect \nof wanton additions to the National Park System on the ability of the \nNational Park Service to adequately fulfill its responsibilities under \nthe 1916 Organic Act. The committee is in the process of trying to come \nto grips with this insatiable appetite to simply add more and more \nunits, some of limited merit, to a System already overburdened by past \nactions.\n  I want the Record to indicate that I promised the Senator from \nMassachusetts that the committee would consider the New Bedford whaling \nlegislation this Congress, and we would have done so had he allowed the \nprocess to work. As it is, we are faced with another drain on the \nlimited resources of the National Park Service without benefit of \ncommittee consideration. The superintendent and the other personnel \nwill have to be stolen from other units of the System and the funding \nwill come out of the already over stained budgets of existing units.\n  The era of the clipper ships and the days of the whalers is certainly \nan important part of the history of this Nation. That history is not \nrestricted to Massachusetts, but was an important part of the west \ncoast and Alaska. Given the opportunity, the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources could have worked with the Senator from Massachusetts \nand crafted workable legislation. It is particularly ironic that it is \nthe Senator from Massachusetts who seeks to end-run the committee \nprocess since it was his totally nongermane amendment on minimum wage \nthat held up the omnibus parks package a few weeks ago. The single most \nimportant conservation package in over a decade was held up for \npolitical purposes and then the Senator seeks passage of legislation in \nthe dead of night.\n  I frankly am getting tired of the repeated chorus from the \nadministration and the other side of the aisle on how insensitive \nRepublicans are to the environment when all they can show is opposition \nto major conservation legislation. Secretary Babbitt proposes to give \naway three units of the National Park System as part of his Reinventing \nGovernment and then has the gall to accuse Republicans of trying to \ndismantle the National Park. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nproximately responsible for holding up a major park and conservation \nmeasure and then casually adds a new unit to an already overburdened \nSystem.\n  Mr. President. There is a reason for the committees of the Senate and \nI want to express my strong opposition to this procedure. I committed \nto the Senator from Massachusetts and to several other of my colleagues \nthat our committee would consider their legislation and we would \nattempt to come to some resolution on the toll that new areas add to \nthe National Park System and to the idea of ``heritage'' areas. The \nSubcommittee on Parks has been very active and the Senator from \nMassachusetts can have no complaint over the sympathies of the \nsubcommittee chairman.\n  I have tried for over a year to move important park and conservation \nmeasures reported by the committee only to have my efforts blocked by \nopposition from the other side of the aisle. I find it particularly \ntroubling that those who have spent so much time blocking passage of \nimportant legislation like the Presidio would take this opportunity to \nmove the New Bedford legislation without benefit of committee review \nand recommendation.\n  At some point Congress must come to the realization that this \ninsatiable appetite for adding new units to the National Park System is \nnot benefiting the environment, it is threatening existing units. No \none would come to the floor with legislation to cut the funding and \npersonnel for the Grand Canyon, Everglades, Yosemite, Yellowstone, \nIndependence Hall, or any other unit, yet that is exactly what \nenactment of the New Bedford whaling measure will do. We are loving the \nSystem to death. I will continue to oppose the creation of any new \nunits until Congress and the administrative are willing to assume the \nresponsibility for their actions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate approved \nthis legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that a joint statement by \nSenator Kerry and myself be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\nJoint Statement by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Senator John F. Kerry on \n        the Whaling National Historical Park in New Bedford, MA.\n\n       We are grateful that the Senate is about to approve these \n     provisions to establish a Whaling National Historical Park in \n     New Bedford, Massachusetts.\n       This is an important measure that is well-deserved and \n     historically long overdue. The\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\n     history of whaling deserves a place among the major \n     historical themes represented in the National Park System. \n     The federal designation will also mean a significant boost to \n     the economy of the region as more and more visitors come to \n     New Bedford to learn about its extraordinary history.''\n       The bill authorizes an estimated $4 million over the next \n     five years in federal funds for the Park, with a ceiling of \n     $2 million on the amount of federal funds that can be used \n     for construction and rehabilitation.\n       In addition, in an innovative feature of the bill that may \n     become a model for future park funding in the era of limited \n     federal resources, the bill requires a 1-to-1 private-sector \n     match for construction and rehabilitation funds, and a 4-to-1 \n     private-sector match for other projects related to the Park. \n     The goals of the Park can be achieved with modest federal \n     funding, because substantial local resources have already \n     been dedicated in New Bedford, and the community has a strong \n     commitment to maintain these efforts in years to come.\n       Passage of this bill will make the New Bedford National \n     Historical Park one of only a handful of new national parks \n     to be approved by the Senate in the current Congress. In this \n     era of limited federal resources, Congress is rightly \n     skeptical of new park proposals, but the designation of New \n     Bedford is highly appropriate.\n       New Bedford won early renown for its whaling expeditions in \n     the Atlantic, and later became a key base for whaling voyages \n     to the Arctic. The whaling industry became so prosperous that \n     by the mid-1800s, New Bedford was the wealthiest city, per \n     capita, in the world.\n       The Whaling National Historical Park will preserve and \n     restore dozens of New Bedford's historic buildings, which are \n     being restored to appear as they did in the whaling \n     industry's heyday.\n       The Park will include the Seamen's Bethel--the church in \n     ``Moby Dick'' where Ishmael heard Father Mapple offer prayers \n     for sailors before setting out to sea. It will also encompass \n     the restored, century-old National Historic Landmark vessel \n     ``Ernestina,'' the oldest Grand Banks schooner in existence, \n     which is now moored in New Bedford's port.\n       The crown jewel of the Park will be the Whaling Museum, \n     which houses the world's premier whaling archives and art \n     collection. The library contains thousands of ship logs, \n     charts, maps, photos and other records that document the \n     history of whaling in America. The museum also houses a half-\n     size model of the whaling bark ``Lagoda,'' which can be \n     boarded by visitors.\n       60,000 visitors from the United States and over 40 foreign \n     countries come to the museum each year and participate in its \n     programs. It also receives thousands of requests for \n     information from historians, scientists, educators, \n     photographers, and museum professionals.\n       The Whaling National Historical Park has been endorsed by \n     numerous national organizations, including the American \n     Institute of Architects, the American Museum Association, the \n     National Trust for Historic Preservation, the National \n     Melville Society, the New England Council, and the Portuguese \n     American Leadership Council of the United States.\n       We have worked closely on this bill with Senate Majority \n     Leader Bob Dole, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, Senate \n     Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Frank \n     Murkowski, and Senate Parks Subcommittee Chairman Ben \n     Nighthorse Campbell, and we commend them for their assistance \n     and support.\n       We also commend the tireless dedication of the business \n     community and citizens of New Bedford and their deep \n     commitment to make this Park a reality. We have also worked \n     very closely with Congressmen Barney Frank and Peter Blute of \n     Massachusetts. Their effective work in the House of \n     Representatives laid the best possible groundwork for today's \n     successful Senate action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4587-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

SGT. RUBEN RIVERS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if you happened to have read the current \nedition of U.S. News & World Report, there is a front page story about \nsome very heroic people. One of those persons is from Oklahoma.\n  Many years ago, back in 1944, when we were trying to push the Germans \nout of France and the Alsace-Lorraine area, it was the 761st Tank \nBattalion that was sent over to try to remove, to extract the Germans \nfrom that area.\n  There is one thing that was unique about the 761st Tank Battalion. \nAll of the soldiers in that battalion were black. They called them the \n``Black Panthers.''\n  One of the bright young soldiers was a staff sergeant by the name of \nRuben Rivers. Ruben Rivers was born in Tecumseh, OK, a very quiet, \nsoft-spoken person, the kind who everybody liked. When he went into the \nservice, his desire was to see combat. Back then, even though we had \n1.2 million blacks serving in World War II, less than half of them saw \ncombat, and not one of them got the Congressional Medal of Honor, in \nspite of the fact that they had performed all kind of heroic acts.\n  Back in 1990, I was serving over in the House, and it was called to \nmy attention by some surviving members of his family some of the things \nthat he had done. When I heard this story, I called his commander, \nwhose name is Capt. David Williams, retired, who was getting quite \nelderly, and I asked him to verify the story. This is what Ruben Rivers \nhad done.\n  He was a tank driver. He had won a Silver Star by walking through a \nminefield and putting a chain on fallen chains and backing out with \nthis tank to detonate all of the mines, taking great personal risk in \ndoing this.\n  A few weeks later--it was November 14, 1944--Ruben Rivers was driving \nthe lead tank, as he always wanted to do. He went through a minefield \nin order to detonate the mines so that the 761st Tank Battalion Group A \ncould get through.\n  When he did this, he went over several mines. One mine went off, and \nit blew up the undercarriage of his tank and severely wounded Ruben \nRivers. In fact, the bone in his right leg was penetrated all the way \nthrough. You could see the shiny white bone.\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\n  Of course, Captain Williams came over, and he, with the medic, tried \nto extract him and said, ``Take the morphine. You have done enough for \nAmerica. We're sending you back.'' He said, ``No, my job isn't done \nyet.'' He got out of the tank and got in another tank, hobbling over \nwith some help, with one leg, got on the turret and went out into the \nclearing. The Germans surrounded them from the north. They had our tank \nbattalion completely pinned down where they could not penetrate. Ruben \nRivers, in order to find out where they were, drew fire from them. He \ndrove this tank out into the opening. All of them fired, and we were \nable to go in with our artillery and wipe out the German tank \nbattalion. Of course, Ruben Rivers was dead.\n  Right after that Capt. David Williams went to the Army and put him up \nfor the Congressional Medal of Honor. I will not go into detail as to \nwhat some of the responses were, but they kind of laughed. They said, \n``Well, I don't think that's going to happen.'' In fact, the paperwork \nmysteriously disappeared, not once, but twice, so that nobody had the \nrecord on record of Ruben Rivers.\n  Capt. David Williams, as I mentioned, is getting quite elderly. He \nsaid, ``I'm going to live long enough to see that Ruben Rivers is \nposthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.''\n  Back in 1990, I introduced a bill in the House of Representatives and \ntold the same story I am telling today, except in perhaps a little more \ndetail, to waive the statute of limitations past 1952 so the President \ncould make that award. The medal has to come from the President of the \nUnited States. Then-President George Bush said he would do it, after he \nhad read about the case. But I was unable to get it passed.\n  I tried it again in 1991, 1992; and until finally in 1995 the Army \nsaid, ``If you don't introduce any more, we'll go ahead and conduct a \nstudy of blacks in the military in World War II to see if any of them \nhad been deserving of the Congressional Medal of Honor who had not \nreceived it only because they were black.''\n  That report, I am very happy to say, has come out just a few days \nago. They have nominated seven blacks--one is still living today--to \nreceive the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President of the United \nStates, Bill Clinton, had said whoever they recommend, he would go \nahead and allow them to receive that medal--their families to receive \nit. So that is exactly what is going to happen. So, I am very happy to \nsay--we hear a lot of negative things that are going on--that something \nwonderful has happened. A great Oklahoman from Tecumseh, OK, will be \nawarded posthumously the highest honor to be given for valor in battle, \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have a lot of conversation going on \naround the country these days about the economy and what it is people \nwant to have happen and what it is people are searching for in terms of \nthe Federal approach to the economy.\n  I will suggest several guideposts that I think we need to follow when \nwe talk about the economy. If I may, Mr. President, I want to put them \nin terms of the individual lives and the individual economies of each \nAmerican.\n  I think the American people want to do three things with their \neconomy. No. 1, they want to earn more. That is a fairly natural thing. \nI think we all identify with that. We want to earn more. Then we want \nto keep more, hang on to more of what it is we do earn by the sweat of \nour brow. Then we do that, earn more, keep more so that we can do more, \nnot just to pile up the money somewhere, but to use it to do things \nwith.\n  Let me give you some examples on these ideas, Mr. President. First, \nearning more. That comes as a function in our economy of the growth of \nthe economy. We want to earn more because the economy is growing, not \nbecause we are taking it away from somebody else--I earn more because \nyou earn less; we don't want that kind of approach--but growth, more \njobs, more economic activity is the way we earn more.\n  In my home State of Utah, we are currently enjoying a tremendous \neconomic boom. More growth is occurring, and, as a result, perhaps the \nsweetest result for most people's ears, is that now in Utah jobs are \nplentiful. People can find work in Utah, whereas as recently as a dozen \nyears ago, it was very tough to find a job. But as the economy grows, \njobs are available and everyone can earn more, keeping more.\n  I will talk again about my own experience in Utah. In our company, \nwhich was an S corporation--I know a lot of people turn off because \nthis sounds technical--but an S corporation is simply, for tax \npurposes, a corporation where the earnings are allowed to flow through \nto the tax returns of the owners. So the corporation does not pay any \ntax. The whole earnings of the corporation are added on to the \nindividual tax returns of the owners. The owners pay the taxes.\n  When we had a corporation like that in Utah, we were paying a top tax \nrate of 28 percent during the 1980's. Today, that tax rate, as a result \nof the tax increases that have occurred, is 42 percent, a 50 percent \nincrease, Mr. President, that occurred over a period of just 3 years. \nSo even though we may have been earning more, we were not able to keep \neven as much as we had been earning. We were not able to keep that \nwhich was coming in to our company, and our activity, with the taxes \ngoing up, as I say, from 28 percent to 42 percent.\n  Why is it important if we are earning more to keep more? Back in the \ndays when we could keep all but 28 percent of that, we could do more. \nWe were able to create jobs. The particular company that I was involved \nwith, when I became involved, had just four employees. We were creating \njobs for four people. I was the fifth one hired and put on the payroll.\n  Today that company employs close to 3,000 people. We earned more \nbecause we were in a growth industry. We were able to keep more because \nthe tax rate was at 28 percent. We were able to do more with the money \nthat we kept in the form of creating job security and a better \nlifestyle for nearly 3,000 people, new jobs created that did not exist \nbefore.\n  One point I think we need to understand very clearly as we talk about \nthe jobs that were created during the Reagan years--President Clinton \ntalks about the jobs that have been created during his administration--\nwe must understand that the Federal Government does not create a single \njob. No government does. The only government jobs that are there are \nthose jobs that are created to be paid for with somebody else's taxes. \nAll of the new jobs that represent earning more and growth come out of \nthe private sector.\n  All the Federal Government can do is create an atmosphere in which \nthat growth can take place. It cannot, by passing a law, create a job, \nunless, as I said, it takes somebody's tax money to create a job. Your \nsalary, Mr. President, my salary, the salary of everyone here comes out \nof somebody else's taxes. All Government jobs do.\n  So the Government should focus on creating an environment, an \natmosphere, where the entrepreneurial energy of private Americans can \ncreate growth. Then the Government should say, ``Let's look at our own \nexpenditures to hold down the spending on the Government side so that \nthose who are creating the jobs, allowing people to earn more, are \nallowed to keep more of that which they create.'' If we do that, we \nknow from experience they will then do more with the money they are \nallowed to keep that will benefit the economy and all Americans as a \nwhole.\n  But what it really comes down to, Mr. President, is this. It is a \nquestion of trust. Does the Government trust its citizens to go out in \nthe economy and take care of their own problems? Does the Government \ntrust its citizens to hang on to the money that they earn and make \ntheir own decisions with it? Does the Government trust its citizens\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\nto take the kinds of actions that will cause the economy as a whole to \ngrow and create prosperity for all of us?\n\n  I am one who does trust the American people. I am one who thinks we \nneed to roll back the tax increases that have occurred, allow people to \nkeep more of their hard-earned money. I believe when we do that we will \nsee the threefold result I have been talking about here, Mr. President. \nPeople will be able to earn more--if they are allowed to keep more, \nthey can then do more.\n  I call upon all of us to support policies that move in that \ndirection. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4591-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4592-S4610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3759\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I see my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Ohio, is on the floor, I assume, for purposes of offering \nhis amendment. Before he commences I would like to take a few moments \nto comment on some statements that have been made about the amendment \nwhich I offered earlier and which will be the first amendment that will \nbe voted on at 2:40 this afternoon. This amendment is about unfunded \nmandates.\n  It is about the reality that the legislation before us represents a \nstaggering transfer of administrative costs and cost shift of programs \nfrom the Federal Government to the States and local communities in \nwhich legal aliens are resident.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures, in examining just 10 \nof the literally scores of programs that will be covered by this act, \nhas found that the cost to the States in those 10 programs is $744 \nmillion per year. The total cost could be into the billions.\n  The amendment that I have offered is a modest attempt to deal with \nthat. It basically says, first, that if a Federal agency, State, or \nlocal government can make a determination that the cost savings of \nfollowing the procedures of S. 1664 are less than the costs to \nadminister the program, it would not be necessary to implement the \nprogram. We have done exactly this in a very analogous program called \nthe SAVE Program, which is an employer verification program in which \nthere is the capacity to waive out of the SAVE Program if it can be \ndemonstrated that the benefits do not equal the costs of the program.\n  Assume, Madam President, that the issue were reversed. Would we \naffirmatively vote to say to a State, to a local community, that you \nmust administer this federally mandated program even if the cost of \nadministration can be shown to exceed the savings or the benefits of \nthe program itself? I think not. And so our amendment would create such \nan opportunity.\n  I might just add one final point. We are requiring exactly the same \nadministrative structure in a community such as Topeka, KS, as we are \nin Tampa, FL, although the number of legal aliens in Tampa, FL, \nprobably substantially exceeds those in Topeka, KS. There should be \nsome capability to adjust the level of burden to the reality of the \ncircumstance in that particular community.\n\n  Second is the provision that if the Federal Government thinks this is \nsuch a good idea, then the Federal Government ought to pay for it. I \nthought that was the fundamental premise behind the unfunded mandate \nprogram that we passed as S. 1, as one of the first acts of the 104th \nCongress. I used the phrase ``deadbeat dad'' to describe what the \nFederal Government is about to do here. The Federal Government is about \nto say: ``We are going to put all of our reliance on the sponsor, but \nincidentally, if, in fact, the sponsor does not come through with the \nhealth care financing or the other sources of financing that will be \nnecessary to maintain this legal alien, we, the Federal Government, are \noff the hook. It is now going to be up to the local community to pay \nthose hospital costs for that legal alien or to pay the cost of \nprenatal care for the pregnant legal alien, poor woman.''\n  I think the phrase ``deadbeat dad'' properly describes what the \nFederal Government is trying to do: to shift an obligation to States \nand communities. If we think this is such a good idea and if we are \nfaithful to our constitutional responsibility as the only level of \nGovernment that has jurisdiction over immigration, we ought to pay \nthose costs, not ask the local government to do so.\n  Finally, in this amendment we recognize the fact that there are \nunusual emergency circumstances. We had one of those in my State in \nlate August 1992 with Hurricane Andrew. I was there. I saw what \nhappened as the emergency and disaster preparedness and response teams \nattempted to deal with an enormous natural disaster. The very idea of \nhaving to subject people who had seen their homes, their documents, \ntheir jobs, their lives wrecked by this hurricane, to then have to go \nthrough a tedious verification process to determine what their status \nwas and what the income of a sponsor who may well have just been \nsubjected to the same thing that they were, puts the public health at \nrisk. If you cannot vaccinate people against a potential outbreak of \ntyphoid after a natural disaster until you have gone through the \nbureaucratic steps of verification, just pure common sense tells you \nthere has to be some capability to waive these in an emergency \nsituation. This amendment provides that opportunity.\n  I believe this is a prudent amendment. Members of this Congress, \nMembers of this Senate, who wish to deal effectively with the issue of \nillegal immigration should not have that tide of passion and emotion \nerase our basic sense of common sense and fairness and rational justice \nto preclude a community from making a judgment as to the cost-benefit \nanalysis of implementing these programs to avoid the Federal Government \nassuming its responsibility to pay as well as it imposes new \nresponsibilities and to be able to respond to unexpected emergency \nsituations. That is the essence of the amendment which is before us, \nMadam President. I urge my colleagues at 2:40 to support it.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. May I inquire as to the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment 3759 offered \nby the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent to set aside for a moment the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3835 to amendment No. 3745\n\n  (Purpose: To make persecution for resistance to coercive population \n          control policies a basis for the granting of asylum)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I call up my amendment numbered 3835.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself and Mr. \n     Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered 3835 to amendment No. \n     3745.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment to the instructions to the \n     motion to recommit, insert the following new section:\n       The language on page 177, between lines 8 and 9, is deemed \n     to have the following insertion:\n\n     ``SEC. 197. PERSECUTION FOR RESISTANCE TO COERCIVE POPULATION \n                   CONTROL METHODS.\n\n       ``Section 101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following: `For purposes of determinations under this Act, a \n     person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy, or to \n     undergo such a procedure, or for other resistance to a \n     coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have \n     been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person \n     who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to \n     undergo such a procedure or subjected to persecution for such \n     failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a \n     well founded fear of persecution on account of political \n     opinion.' ''\n\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, as we discuss far-reaching immigration \nreform, I think it behooves us to try to make our immigration laws as \njust and as fair as absolutely possible. If there are terrible \ninjustices going on, we should definitely make use of this rare \nopportunity--a fundamental reform effort on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, going on now--make use of this opportunity to correct those \ninjustices.\n  Madam President, there is a provision in current immigration \npractice--not in law but in practice--that must, in my opinion, in the \ninterests of justice, be changed. There are women in repressive \ncountries who are forced to undergo coerced abortions and \nsterilizations. Until 1994, these women were offered asylum under the \nsame standard as others fleeing persecutions. However, starting in 1994 \nand since that date, they have been forced to meet a tougher standard, \nas if the procedures they face somehow did not qualify as prima facie \nevidence of persecution. That is just wrong. My amendment is very \nsimple. It would change the policy back to what it was before 1994.\n  My amendment is not controversial. It is supported by groups on the \nright and groups on the left, by pro-choice groups and pro-life groups. \nIt is supported by the Clinton administration, and it was passed by the \nU.S. House of Representatives. However, because the specific issue I am \ndiscussing is not mentioned in the bill we are considering, my \namendment would, of course, be ruled nongermane under standard \npostcloture procedures. If no Senator objected to proceeding with this \namendment, a unanimous consent would override the germaneness issue and \nallow us to move on the amendment. This amendment, I might add, is \nsupported by Amnesty International, it is supported by the Center for \nReproductive Law and Policy, it is supported by the U.S. Catholic \nConference, the Council of Jewish Federations, by the National Right to \nLife Committee--the list goes on and on and on.\n  But the Senator from Wyoming said on the floor earlier today that he \nwould object to consideration of this amendment. Certainly this is his \nright to do this, and I fully understand that under the rules of the \nSenate the point of order of the Senator from Wyoming would be \nsustained because the amendment is, in fact, not germane. I will, \ntherefore, in a moment, withdraw my amendment. But before I do, I would \nlike to spend just a few minutes discussing a problem that I believe it \nwould solve if we were allowed to go forward.\n  Think of a college teacher in China who is forced to have not one, \ntwo, three, but four abortions by her government. Many of her coworkers \nwere forced to have six or seven abortions. That is a true story. It \nwas told in compelling testimony at a hearing last year in the House \nCommittee on International Relations, a hearing on the subject of \n``Coercive Population Control in China.'' I have the transcript of that \nright here. That is the story, a true story.\n\n  That woman, under current procedure, would not be considered as \nhaving a per se reason to fear persecution. Madam President, I am not \nalone in believing that this is unjust. All the groups I have \nmentioned, from the Catholic Conference to abortion rights advocates, \nall of them agree that when a woman is forced by her government to \nundergo these procedures, her human rights are being violated. That is \nnot a tough call. That is a fact.\n  How hard would it be, in practical terms, for us to recognize this \nfact in our national policy? Would it mean, as some have suggested, \nthat we would face a deluge of millions of people flooding our shores? \nNo, Madam President, it would not. The number of people granted asylum \nunder the old policy, which we are asking to go back to, the policy my \namendment would simply restore, that number of people who were granted \nasylum was actually very small every year. The number of people we let \nin because they were protesting China's coerced population control \npolicy was averaging between 100 and 150 people every year. Each \napplicant of the kind we are discussing would not suddenly move to the \nfront of the line. She would not get automatic asylum. She would not \never get special treatment. All she would get is the same chance as all \nother asylum seekers, the same judicial process and the same set of \nrules--what I would call simple, basic human justice.\n  Think of a woman who has just had her second child; another example. \nShe gets a notice from her local commune sterilization committee, \nsaying she has to report in and get sterilized.\n  Think of a woman who sees a baby girl, 7 days old, lying abandoned on \nthe road. None of the bystanders want to rescue the baby. They are \nafraid of the government. The woman takes the baby home herself, and \nsure enough, then the sterilization police show up and see the new baby \ngirl. They say this woman has too many children and she has to be \nsterilized, even though the new baby girl is not her own child. She has \nto escape to a distant and barren place to get away from the \nsterilizers.\n  Even years later--this is a true story--she was brave enough to go \nhome, and she was sterilized. This is a true story, Madam President, \nyet another story that emerged in the hearings held by the House \nCommittee on International Relations. It is a story of barbaric \npersecution in our own day and times; a crime against women and a crime \nagainst our common humanity.\n\n  I am not seeking, with this amendment, a special break for these \nwomen. All I ask is they receive the same treatment as anyone else who \ncomes to America to seek asylum. Here is what my amendment, a \nnoncontroversial amendment based on the people who support it, this is \nwhat it says--and then I will conclude because I know our time for a \nvote is shortly at hand. Let me read it.\n\n       For purposes of determinations under this Act, a person who \n     has been forced to abort a pregnancy, or to undergo \n     [involuntary sterilization or who has been persecuted for \n     failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure] or for other \n     resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be \n     deemed to have been persecuted on account of political \n     opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or \n     she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subjected \n     to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance, \n     shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on \n     account of political opinion.\n\n  That is the substance of this amendment. It is supported by the \nClinton administration, it was passed by the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and it will be an issue in the conference.\n  Madam President, at this time I do withdraw my amendment. I \nappreciate the courtesy of my colleague from Wyoming for the time.\n  The amendment (No. 3835) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I deeply thank the Senator from Ohio. \nWith the remaining minute, let me just say I am very pleased it was \nwithdrawn. I, too, have read the language, and the very troubling part \nis the part that says ``resistance to a coercive population control \nprogram'' deems that that person then fits the status of refugee.\n  We are dealing with China, a country with a population of 1.2 billion \npeople. We are also dealing in this amendment with India, again with \none of the largest populations in the world. We are dealing with an \namendment that would apply, as of course it should, to all the \ncountries in the world. When we do this, we should bear in mind that \nthere are already young Chinese single--unmarried--males who are even \nnow claiming asylum on the basis that one day they will want to have a \nfamily and more than one child and thus come under this coercive birth \npolicy.\n  But if you are going to make a blanket application for refugee \nstatus, it reminds me so much of an American Secretary of State who \nvisited China several years ago. He raised issues about their policies \nand slave labor and coercive birth policies and their immigration \npolicies, which were very strict.\n  When he finished, the Premier asked the Secretary, ``How many \nmillions do you want?''\n  I can tell you, if this amendment, in any form or this form, were to \ncome to pass--and I deeply appreciate the withdrawal because it was not \nin order--I suggest that there will be millions of people who, under \nthis language, will qualify.\n  We should remember that this amendment would also apply to tens of \nmillions of persons--male and female--in India, who have undergone \npopulation control procedures--vasectomies\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\nand tubal ligations. That program began in the 1950's. Many of those \nmillions of persons bear the marks and scars of those procedures. I \nwould expect that it would be very difficult for INS to prove that \nthose procedures were not coerced. So this amendment would appear to \nmake eligible for asylum in this country millions of persons--both male \nand female--in China, India and many other countries.\n  I understand the necessity to make foreign policy statements, but I \nthink that they should not be made on an immigration measure.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield for 20 seconds? Let me, if I can, \nbriefly respond to that. We did not have this flood of the old policy \nand the old law, and the fact is, even with this amendment, we will \nstill have to prove the facts. Then once you have established the \nfacts, those facts, those compelling facts, we would then deem that \nmeets the law.\n  So it is still a factual question that would have to be proved. The \nburden would still be there to prove. I am sure we will have another \nopportunity to talk about this in the future. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I sincerely thank the Senator from \nOhio. It makes our work much less difficult.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \n30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for raising this \nissue. I think it is important to note that at the present time, a \nnumber of individuals who have applied for asylum on the basis of this \nkind of action have already been granted asylum and had deportation \ndelayed. But I think it is something that we ought to get into in much \ngreater degree.\n  I welcome the fact that this issue has been brought up, and we will \nwork with the Senator from Ohio to try and find out how all of us can \nfind an adequate solution to what is a barbaric practice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3759\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on amendment No. 3840 offered by \nthe Senators from Rhode Island and Florida.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I hope everybody will listen to this \nbecause we think it is important. Illegal immigrants now are entitled \nto a series of limited benefits, such as emergency Medicaid, prenatal \nMedicaid services, nutrition programs, and public assistance for \nimmunizations. Illegal aliens are entitled to this. This is not the big \nbroad scope of things. This is limited. What we are saying is legal \nimmigrants should be entitled to the same thing. It is a little odd to \nsay that the illegals can get these. Why do we give them to those \nindividuals, the illegals? It is for the benefit of public health \noverall. It seems to me that the legal immigrants should likewise be \nentitled to immunization, prenatal, and postpartum Medicaid services. \nThat is what it is all about. It is a limited group. It is not going to \nbreak the budget, but certainly the legals under equity should be \nentitled to what the illegals are entitled to.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Give me your attention just for a moment, please. This \namendment is about welfare reform for legal immigrants--the same issue \nyou have already voted on seven separate times now. The reason that \nlegal immigrants are in the situation they are in is because the person \nwho brought them here promised to pay for their support. All we are \nsaying is that sponsors should pay for these benefits if they have the \nmeans to do so. That is what deeming is. No legal immigrant will \nreceive any fewer benefits than an illegal immigrant, but the legal \nimmigrant's sponsor will have to pay for the benefits before the \nAmerican taxpayers do. Should the financial burden be on the \nimmigrant's sponsor or on the U.S. taxpayers? Take your pick.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me say for the information of all Senators it is my \nunderstanding that a rollcall will not be necessary on the underlying \nDole-Simpson\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\namendment. Therefore, Senators can expect two additional votes that \nwill start within a minute, and it will be a 10-minute vote, and then \nwe will start the other vote. The first will be on cloture on the bill. \nThe second vote, if cloture is invoked, will be on final passage of the \nimmigration bill.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be vitiated on \namendment No. 3743.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays on those two votes and that the \nvotes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, that disturbance is certainly in spirit \nwith the last 10 days.\n  I did not realize I had such support up there in that quarter, and I \nmust say I am very pleased.

Mr. President, let me say this. I have two amendments \nfiled by Senator Snowe, Nos. 3873 and 3874, as modified.\n  Mr. President, these two noncontroversial amendments relate to \nproblems that have developed in recent years with the movement of \npersons along Maine's border with the Canadian province of New \nBrunswick. The amendments address issues that are critically important \nto the economic health and livelihood of many small communities in \nnorthern Maine. These communities have suffered severe economic harm \nfrom the discriminatory application of New Brunswick's provincial sales \ntax and other actions taken by Canadian officials to inappropriately \nimpede crossborder movement.\n  I am not aware of any objections to the amendments, and I understand \nthat they have been cleared on the other side.\n  I ask that the amendments be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3873, and 3874) as modified, were agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n                           amendment no. 3873\n\n(Purpose: To require a study and review of allegations of harassment by \n   Canadian Customs agents for the purpose of deterring cross-border \n   commercial activity along the United States-New Brunswick border)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I thank Senator Simpson and Senator \nKennedy for accepting this amendment providing for a prototype \ncounterfeit-proof Social Security card.\n  It was 18 years ago that I first proposed we produce a tamper-\nresistant Social Security card to reduce fraud and enhance public \nconfidence in our Social Security system. The amendment accepted today \nis very simple. It would require the Commissioner of the Social \nSecurity Administration to develop a prototype of a counterfeit-proof \nSocial Security card. The prototype card would be designed with the \nsecurity features necessary to be used reliably to confirm U.S. \ncitizenship or legal resident alien status.\n  The amendment would also require the Commissioner to study and report \nto Congress on ways to improve the Social Security card application \nprocess so as to reduce fraud. An evaluation of cost and workload \nimplications of issuing a counterfeit-resistant Social Security card is \nalso required.\n  Let me point out that Congress adopted this provision last year as \npart of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (H.R. 4), \nthe welfare legislation vetoed by the President. Senator Dole \ncosponsored the amendment, and it passed the Senate by a voice vote. \nThe Senate also included it in its version of the budget reconciliation \nbill, but the provision was dropped in the conference committee.\n  When the Social Security amendments were before us in 1983, we \napproved a provision to require the production of a new tamper-\nresistant Social Security card. The law, section 345 of Public Law 98-\n21, stated:\n\n       The Social Security card shall be made of banknote paper, \n     and (to the maximum extent practicable) shall be a card which \n     cannot be counterfeited.\n\n  What a disappointment when late in 1983 the Social Security \nAdministration began to issue the new card, and it became clear that \nthe agency simply had not understood what Congress intended. The new \ncard looks much like the old, much like the first ones produced by \nSocial Security in 1936. It has the same design framing the name and \nnearly the same colors. It feels the same. An expert examining a card \nwith a magnifying glass can certainly detect whether or not one of the \nnew ones is genuine, but therein lies the problem. We should have a \nnew, durable card that can hold vital information and can be \nauthenticated easily.\n  A new Social Security card--one very difficult to counterfeit and \neasily verified as genuine--could be manufactured at a low cost. The \nmajor expense, if we were to approve new cards, would be the cost of \nthe interview process, and that is why the amendment requires a study \nto include the cost and workload implications of a new card.\n  A Social Security card could be designed along the lines of today's \nhigh technology credit cards. The card could be highly tamper-\nresistant, and its authenticity could be readily discerned by the \nuntrained eye. The card must be seen as a special document; one which \nwould be visually and tactilely more difficult to counterfeit than the \ncurrent paper card.\n  The magnetic strip would contain the Social Security number, encoded \nwith an algorithm known only to the Social Security Administration. A \nso-called watermark strip could be placed over it, making it nearly \nimpossible to counterfeit without technology that currently costs $10 \nmillion. The decoding algorithm could be integrated with the Social \nSecurity Administration computers.\n  The new cards will not eliminate all fraudulent use of Social \nSecurity cards. But it will close down the shopfront operations that \nflood America with false Social Security cards.\n  That is what the Congress intended in the 1983 legislation.\n  Let us try again. We have seen that it can be done. It is what the \nClinton Administration intended last year when they introduced the \nHealth Security card. As many of you remember, it had a magnetic strip \nto hold whatever information may be necessary.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has adopted this amendment, and I again \nthank the managers of the bill for their support.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is in order.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3951) was agreed to.\n\n\n               Worker Verification/Identification System\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly an amendment I had \noffered to S. 1664, the Immigration and Financial Responsibility Act of \n1996 but have subsequently withdrawn in the interest of completing \naction on the underlying bill without unnecessary delay at this time. \nThis amendment was designed to ensure the consideration of innovative \nauthentication technology as we develop a new verification system for \nalien employment and public assistance eligibility.\n  There is a large and important debate before us. Should we implement \na national verification system in the United States? Well, we already \nhave one, but it's failing America. It allows illegal immigrants to \nskirt the system--to take jobs away from Americans and immigrants who \nhave played by the rules. Moreover, the current system also allows for \nabuse of our pubic assistance programs that were established to provide \na safety net for those who have contributed to our society and deserve \nhelp in a time of need. We need to update the current verification \nsystem--and 53 Senate colleagues agree as evidenced by their votes to \nreject the Abraham amendment to strike the verification system from the \nbill.\n  The system in place now requires employers to check two forms of \nidentification from a list of 29 acceptable documents. We know that \nthese documents are far from being tamper-resistant and we know that \nemployers are unfairly held accountable for hiring illegal aliens.\n  The bill before us sets out the goals and objectives for a new \nverification system and also provides for pilot projects to determine \nthe costs, technology, and effectiveness of a new program. Contrary to \nwhat many believe, the bill's provisions address the concerns that have \nbeen expressed regarding privacy, the potential for discrimination, and \ncost. All of these provisions supplement the protections of the U.S. \nConstitution and anti-discrimination laws. And regarding cost, the \nunfunded federal mandates law and the recently-passed improvements to \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act will help insulate businesses and State \nand local governments against the imposition of exorbitant costs from a \nnew verification system.\n  Looking at the inventive programs that businesses, universities, \nhospitals and other institutions are using to monitor human resources, \nit seems only appropriate that we consider the feasibility of upgrading \nour current system.\n  My amendment is simple. It would allow for the consideration of \ninnovative authentication technology such as finger print readers or \nsmart cards to verify eligibility for employment or other applicable \nFederal benefits in a pilot program.\n  Already, the INS has begun to investigate the feasibility of creating \na new generation of smarter employment authorization cards, border-\ncrossing cards, and green cards. And the Federal Government is also \nexamining the uses of electronic benefits transfer. My amendment would \nsupplement these activities.\n  Smart cards are credit card-sized devices containing one or more \nintegrated circuits. They are information\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\ncarriers like ATM cards, that can hold bank account data, school ID \nnumbers, benefit enrollment status, Social Security numbers and \nbiometric data, such as photographs. Unlike ATM's, which give you \naccess to accounts or information, smart cards actually hold the value \nof money and information.\n  I know that some of our colleagues are concerned about the use of \nbiometric data such as DNA samples, blood types, or retina scans. My \namendment does not anticipate the use of these types of biometric data. \nBut the use of biometric data has already found its way into our daily \nlives. We use credit cards with photographs and driver's licences that \ndetail our height, weight and gender. If we are to reduce document \nfraud, we must incorporate the limited use of biometric data. That is \nthe only way to securely connect a document to an individual.\n  Setting aside the merits of my amendment, I understand the hesitance \nof many Members to embrace innovative authentication technologies. \nWhile the future is uncertain and change is difficult, we have to look \nahead. We had a full debate on the issue of the so-called national ID \ncard yesterday. And while I am not now promoting a national ID, nor did \nmy amendment require the use of biometrics or smart cards, the concerns \nraised yesterday are similar. My amendment sought only to ensure the \nconsideration of these tools in the development of the pilot programs.\n  While my amendment has been withdrawn, I will continue to work toward \nbroadening the debate on smart cards and other forms of authentication \ntechnology with our Senate colleagues.\n  In utilizing the most up-to-date technology in these demonstration \nprojects, we can ensure that the President will have the most efficient \nand the most cost-effective alternatives to scrutinize. If we take \ndeliberate care to develop a new identification system, then we can all \nbenefit: American workers can be further protected; Employers can be \nrelieved of the burden of sanctions; the jobs magnet will be shut off; \nand most importantly, we will be able to clearly view the benefits of \nimmigration and diversity in our society.\n\n\n             ins practices concerning student visa holders\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am told by colleges and universities that it is \ncommon for foreign students and scholars temporarily to drop out of \nstatus during the course of their studies. For example, a student might \nbe told by a professor to drop a particular course, thereby \ninadvertently dropping below the 12 credits per term required by INS \nregulations to remain a bona fide student. INS currently allows such \nstudents to be reinstated to their previous status. Such reinstatement \nmight not occur until later in the semester, however, when INS-\ndesignated school officials notice the problem\n  Does the Senator intend our visa-overstayer provision to alter the \nINS's practice in such cases?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. No. In the situation you described, where the student \ncontinues to work in good faith toward his degree, the professor's \ndirective to the student would constitute good cause for the student \nfalling out of status temporarily.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. There are many other situations that might cause a \nstudent to fall out of status. For example, a teaching assistant might \nhave to devote an unusual amount of time to grading papers, or a \nforeign government's tuition payment might be delayed. As I said, I \nunderstand that the current practice of the INS in such circumstances \nis to reinstate such students and scholars to a valid status so that \nthey may continue their studies.\n  Does the Senator intend that these and similar INS practices should \ncontinue?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. My intention is not to displace current INS \npractice with respect to students who continue to work in good faith \ntoward their degree but who temporarily fall out of status because of \ncircumstances beyond their reasonable control.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Finally, some concern has been expressed about the \npossibility that the 60-day threshold might be reached if the student \naccumulates 60 days out of status over the course of several years. Do \nyou intend our visa-overstayer sanctions apply in such cases?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. No, I do not intend the sanctions to apply in cases \nwhere, for reasons like those described in the examples you've cited, a \nstudent has accumulated a total of 60 nonconsecutive days out of status \nover the course of his studies. I expect the 60-day period will \nnormally be continuous for purposes of our visa-overstayer provision.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I had planned to \noffer, along with Mr. DeWine, Mr. Roth, and Mr. D'Amato that would have \naddressed the enormous problem this country has with deporting aliens \nwho commit violent and other felonious acts against Americans. Because \nthe amendment is not germane at this time, I will not be offering it, \nbut plan to raise this issue again at another time.\n  Let me start by outlining the problem we have right now with criminal \naliens in this country.\n  Noncitizens in this country who are convicted of committing a variety \nof serious crimes are deportable and should be deported. These are not \nsuspected criminals: These are convicted felons. And there are about \nhalf a million of them currently residing on U.S. soil. More than \n50,000 crimes have been committed by aliens in this country recently \nenough to put the perpetrators in State and Federal prisons right now.\n  The reason these criminal aliens are here, despite their \ndeportability under U.S. law, is that they are able to manipulate our \nimmigration laws by requesting endless review of their orders of \ndeportation. These are convicted criminals obstructing the operation of \nlaw by abusing unduly generous provisions of judicial and \nadministrative review. As long as a petition for review is pending, \nthey cannot be deported. Meanwhile, because there is nowhere to put \nthem, many of them are released into the general population, never to \nbe seen again. Thus, at present, aliens who are convicted felons are \ndeported at a rate of about 4 percent a year.\n  Parenthetically, I would like to note that the study from which most \nof these figures are drawn--a Senate report on criminal aliens in the \nUnited States dated April 7, 1995--was conducted under the auspices of \none of the cosponsors to the amendment I am offering today--my \ndistinguished friend and colleague from Delaware, Mr. William Roth.\n  The bill presently before the Congress does a great deal to address \nmany of the obstacles to ensuring that these individuals are in fact \nexpeditiously deported. As introduced, it included provisions adding a \nvariety of serious offenses to the crimes that constitute aggravated \nfelonies; providing that aggravated felons are not permitted to sue the \nGovernment on the grounds that their deportations were not expeditious; \nproviding for regulations to be issued by the Attorney General \npermitting INS officials to enter final orders of deportation \nstipulated to by the alien; providing that Federal judges are \nauthorized to order deportation as a condition of probation; and \nrequiring the Attorney General to report to Congress once a year on the \nnumber of and status of criminal aliens presently incarcerated.\n  While these provisions were helpful, they were not enough to prevent \na criminal alien from using the key dilatory tacits presently used by \nthese individuals to avoid deportation.\n  Accordingly, during Committee consideration of this bill, I sponsored \na package of four amendments addressing the criminal alien problem. My \namendments were cosponsored in whole or part by four Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee and all were accepted by the committee in lopsided \nvotes. The package of amendments adopted by the Judiciary Committee and \nnow part of the pending bill will do the following: First, prohibit the \nAttorney General from releasing convicted criminal aliens from custody; \nsecond, end judicial review for orders of deportation entered against \nthese criminal aliens--while maintaining their right to administrative \nreview and the right to review the underlying conviction; third, \nrequire the Attorney General to deport criminal aliens within 30 days \nof the conclusion of the alien's prison sentence--with exceptions made \nonly for national security reasons or on account of the criminal \nalien's cooperation with law enforcement officials; and fourth, permit \nState criminal courts to enter conclusive findings of fact, during \nsentencing, that an alien\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\nhas been convicted of a deportable offense.\n  These amendments, now part of the bill, will go a long way toward \nending the procedural chicanery by which criminal alien's make a \nmockery of our laws.\n  Still, loopholes remain, especially during the administrative review \nprocess. The amendment I had planned to offer to the illegal \nimmigration bill would have sought to close these loopholes by doing \nthe following: First, criminal aliens would be required to raise all \nclaims for relief from deportation in a single administrative process \nincluding one appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n  The problem is this: While we have eliminated judicial review for \norders of deportation entered against most criminal aliens, we have not \neliminated their capacity to request repetitive administrative review \nof the deportation order. We have shortened the process, but it could \nstill take, literally, a decade or more to complete the administrative \nprocedures.\n  For example, criminal aliens will still be able to: First receive a \nhearing on their deportability from the immigration judge and then \nappeal that to the Board of Immigration Appeals; second, return to the \nimmigration judge, this time requesting asylum, and then appeal that to \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals; third, request 212(c) relief from the \norder of deportation and appeal that to the Board of Immigration \nAppeals; fourth, since several years will frequently have passed during \nthe first rounds of administrative review, make a motion to reopen on \nthe basis of changed circumstances, such as the connections to the \ncommunity the criminal alien has formed, and frequently, the children \nthe criminal alien has had while these other requests for relief were \npending; fifth, continue to make additional motions to reopen.\n  Criminal aliens should be allowed only one bite at the apple. What \nneeds to be done is this: Require that criminal aliens submit all \nclaims for relief from deportation to the immigration judge and to the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals the first time around. The amendment I am \nwas going to offer does just that.\n  Second, judicial review for orders of exclusion entered against these \ncriminal aliens would end.\n  This is a delaying tactic, much abused by excludable criminal aliens. \nExtensive--even repetitive--judicial review of orders of exclusion may \nbe tolerable for other excludable aliens. There is no justifiable \nreason to tie up the system with such requests by criminals.\n  Third, the number of immigration judges, members of the Board of \nImmigration Appeals, and lawyers handling deportation cases at the INS \nwould be doubled.\n  There are not enough judges within the INS to expeditiously dispose \nof deportation hearings with or without the streamlining provided by \nthe other criminal alien provisions in this bill and the Terrorism \nPrevention Act. This amendment will double the number of members of the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals, double the number of immigration judges--\nspecial inquiry officers, and double the number of INS attorneys \nhandling deportation proceedings.\n  The criminal alien amendments I offered during the committee mark-up \nof the illegal immigration bill require the AG to deport criminal \naliens within 30 days of the later of their release from incarceration, \nor issuance of the final order of deportation.\n  Such a requirement will be of no avail if the INS does not have \nenough judges and members of the Board of Immigration Appeals to \ndispose of these deportation proceedings. In 1995, the number of board \nmembers of the BIA was increased--to 12 members in all.\n  Meanwhile, it is conservatively estimated that there are almost half \na million criminal aliens currently residing in this country. If only a \nquarter of those criminal aliens now on U.S. soil request deportation \nhearings and an appeal to the BIA--which is probably an extremely \nconservative estimate--12 board members will have to process over \n100,000 appeals only to get through the deportations of these criminal \naliens.\n  We will never reduce this backlog without adding much-needed \npersonnel to handle these deportation proceedings fairly and \nexpeditiously. Doubling their number is a modest increase if we are \nserious about deporting deportable criminal aliens.\n  Fourth, criminal aliens who have been convicted of serious crimes \nwould be added to the list of aliens ineligible for naturalization.\n  Naturalization already requires that the alien demonstrate good moral \ncharacter and have resided in the country for at least 5 years, among \nother things. Yet aliens who have been convicted of serious crimes are \nable to delay their deportations for many years allowing them to, \nfirst, achieve the 5 year requirement for naturalization, and, second, \napply for naturalization 5 years after their conviction.\n  This not only injects into the deportation process an extremely \npowerful incentive for criminal aliens to delay their deportations, but \nrewards those who have not only been convicted of serious crimes to \nbecome citizens, but rewards the criminal aliens who have been able to \nmanipulate the system in order to avoid being deported.\n  There are already various types of aliens that are foreclosed from \nnaturalization. This amendment adds convicted criminals to the list. It \nis not unreasonable for the Congress to conclude that aliens who have \nbeen convicted of serious crimes while guests in this country cannot be \ndeemed to have demonstrated good moral character for purposes of \nnaturalization.\n  These are all reasonable reforms--reforms, I believe, that would \nshock most Americans only by their absence from current law.\n  Let me give just one example of why these reforms are needed. This \nexample is not hypothetical. It is a real case of what happens when \nthis country tries to deport noncitizens who are convicted of \ncommitting serious crimes in this country.\n  The case of Lyonel Dor is typical in all but one respect. Dor was an \nillegal alien, whereas the great majority of the criminal aliens in \nthis country are lawful permanent residents.\n  Lyonel Dor entered the United States illegally in 1972. Six years \nlater he was convicted of first degree manslaughter for participating \nin the murder of his aunt and served 6\\1/2\\ years in prison.\n  Illegal immigrants are deportable. Legal immigrants who help murder \ntheir aunts are deportable.\n  Yet Dor remained in this country for at least another 5 years after \nserving his prison sentence. He accomplished this by requesting and \nreceiving unending review of the order of deportation against him. Dor \nwas first ordered deported in March 1985. As of late 1989, Dor had not \nbeen deported. I do not know whether Lyonel Dor was ever deported or \nwhether he is still here, requesting still more review.\n  But I do know that during that 5 years, Dor received 13 \nadministrative proceedings and 4 judicial proceedings for review of the \norder of deportation against him. Every one of these proceedings \nconcerned this country's attempt to deport Dor--an illegal immigrant \nand murderer. In two of the four judicial proceedings, Federal courts \nordered that Dor not be deported--so that the order of deportation \nagainst Dor could be subjected to yet more review.\n  It is important to note that, although Dor's multiple requests for \nreview of the deportation order were granted--upon review, not one of \nhis claims was found to have any merit. Dor requested asylum, this was \ndenied. Dor requested withholding of his deportation, this was denied. \nDor requested adjustment of status, this was denied. Dor again applied \nfor adjustment of status, and it was again denied. Dor applied for a \nwrit of habeas corpus, this was denied. Each one of these requests for \nwaiver of deportation was appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals \nand sometimes to the courts, as well. Five times throughout these \nproceedings, Dor requested that his case be reopened. These requests, \ntoo, were denied. And these denials, he appealed.\n  This example is far from unique. To the contrary, it is rather \ntypical. I could cite many, many others. It is time for this to stop.\n  Some reforms Senator Hatch included at my suggestion in the anti-\nterrorism bill that was recently enacted will go a long way toward \nstopping it. The reforms contained in the legislation now before the \nCongress, including those from the original bill and those added \nthrough the amendments I offered at markup, would go still further in \nthat direction. I am sorry that on account of the procedural posture\n\n[[Page S4600]]\n\nwe are in, made necessary by the effort of some Members to bring up \nmatters entirely extraneous to reforming illegal immigration, we will \nnot have the opportunity to consider this additional amendment. I \nexpect, however, to find an occasion in the near future to ensure its \nconsideration.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to commend my able colleague \nfor this excellent suggestion. Unlike some of the rest of what he has \nproposed in connection with this legislation, I wholeheartedly commend \nhis untiring efforts with respect to criminal aliens, which I believe \nhave improved the bill. I think this most recent proposal is likewise \none I would support, and I do hope to have occasion to consider it \nfurther.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I very much appreciate the kind words of my colleague \nand friend from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of this bill, \non which Senator Simpson and others have labored so hard and for so \nlong. The bill will do much to stem the tide of illegal immigration \ninto this country.\n  During the Judiciary Committee's mark up of the bill in March, \nseveral provisions were added that address the problem of criminal \naliens in this country. I want to draw my colleagues' attention in \nparticular to these provisions, because they significantly strengthen \nthe Federal Government's ability to deport and exclude aliens who have \ncommitted serious crimes in our country. Senator Abraham pushed for \nthese provisions in committee, and he is to be commended for that \neffort.\n  I would like to offer a brief historical perspective on the nature of \nthe criminal alien crisis, based on my past investigative and \nlegislative work in this area. Criminal aliens represent a problem of \nenormous proportions, and a problem, regrettably, that our present \ncriminal and immigration laws do little to address.\n  In simplest terms, criminal aliens are noncitizens who commit serious \ncrimes in this country. Currently, aliens who commit certain serious \nfelonies are deportable or excludable. The problem is that at present \nwe permit such aliens to go through two completely separate systems--\none for their crimes, and one for their immigration status--in a way \nthat invites abuse and creates confusion. The results are dismal.\n  At my direction during the previous Congress, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations conducted an investigation and held 2 \ndays of hearings regarding criminal aliens in the United States. The \nsubcommittee's investigation found that criminal aliens are a serious \nand growing threat to our public safety. They are also an expensive \nproblem. Under even the most conservative of estimates, criminal aliens \ncost our criminal justice system hundreds of millions of dollars each \nyear.\n  No one, including the INS, knows for sure how many criminal aliens \nthere are in the United States. A study by our subcommittee staff \nestimated that there are about 450,000 criminal aliens in all parts of \nour criminal justice system including Federal and State prisons, local \njails, probation, and parole. Incredibly, criminal aliens now account \nfor an all time high of 25 percent of the Federal prison population.\n  Under current law, aliens who commit aggravated felonies or crimes of \nmoral turpitude are deportable. But last year only about 4 percent of \nthe estimated total number of criminal aliens in the United States were \ndeported. The law is not being enforced in part because it is too \ncomplex with too many levels of appeal. It needs to be simplified.\n  The law is also not being enforced in part because INS does not have \nits act together. The INS is unable to even identify most of the \ncriminal aliens who clog our State and local jails before these \ncriminals are released back onto our streets.\n  As things now stand, many criminal aliens are released on bond by the \nINS while the deportation process is pending. It is not surprising that \nmany skip bond and never show up for their hearings, especially in \nlight of the fact that the INS makes little effort to locate them when \nthey do abscond. In 1992 alone, nearly 11,000 aliens convicted of \nserious felonies failed to show up for their deportation hearings. It \nis safe to assume that many of them walk our streets today.\n  A frustrated INS official described the current state of affairs \naptly when he said of criminal aliens--and I quote--``only the stupid \nand honest get deported.'' The others abuse the system with impunity.\n  Ironically, criminal aliens who have served their time and are \nfighting their deportation routinely received work permits from the \nINS, which allow them to get jobs while their appeals are pending. One \nINS deportation officer told the subcommittee staff that he spends only \nabout 5 percent of his time looking for criminal aliens who have \nabsconded, because he must spend most of his time processing work \npermits for criminal aliens with pending deportation proceedings. This \nis an outrageous situation.\n  Although, our investigation found that the INS is not adequately \nresponding to the criminal alien problem, the INS does not deserve all \nthe blame. Congress has made it far too difficult for the INS and law \nenforcement officials to identify, deport, and exclude criminal aliens.\n  In response to these problems, I introduced legislation last Congress \nand again during this one that would simplify the task of sending \ncriminal aliens home. I am gratified that through the work of Senator \nAbraham and the Judiciary Committee, S. 1664 contains some of the \nprovisions in my legislation, as well as some additional improvements. \nAmong them are the following: First, the bill broadens the definition \nof aggravated felon to include more crimes punishable by deportation. \nSecond, it prohibits the Attorney General from releasing criminal \naliens from custody. Third, it requires the Attorney General to deport \ncriminal aliens--with certain exceptions--within 30 days of the end of \nthe aliens' prison sentence, and mandates that such criminal aliens \nordered deported by taken into custody pending deportation. Finally, it \ngives Federal judges the ability to order deportation of a criminal \nalien at the time of sentencing.\n  To be sure, during the floor debate on this bill, many colleagues \nhave expressed sharp differences in how they wish to go about reforming \nour immigration laws. However, it is my hope that all Senators would \nagree that deporting and excluding aliens convicted of committing \nserious crimes ought to be a top priority. Because fixing existing laws \nto accomplish this goal ought to be an equally high priority, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n\n\n                            Asylum Amendment\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate adopted the asylum \namendment that I offered along with Senators DeWine, Hatfield, Kerry, \nand Wellstone to preserve our asylum law for those seeking refuge from \noppression. In addition to our colleagues who voted for the amendment, \nthere are a number of people to thank for this important change in the \nSenate bill.\n  Three of our House colleagues, Representatives Diaz-Balart, Ros-\nLehtinen, and Smith felt so strongly about these provisions that they \ntook the extraordinary step of sending ``Dear Colleague'' letters to \nthe Senate urging that others join us ``in protecting human rights \naround the world'' and in supporting this amendment.\n  I would like to thank Alan Baban and Ana X. who appeared with me on \nApril 30 in advance of the vote and retold their experiences with \noppression and asylum. Without them and the refugees who came forward \nto make the case, we could not have succeeded in amending this bill and \nthe antiterrorism law.\n  I want to thank all of those from around the country who wrote to me \nand my colleagues about the importance of this amendment. I know that \nthe correspondence and calls that I received from Patrick Giantonio of \nVermont Refugee Assistance; Gerry Haase of the Tibetan Resettlement \nProject; David Ferch and Philene Taomina of Groton; Bob Rosenfeld, Jane \nBradley, Jean Lathrop, and Helen Rabin of Plainfield; Brenda Torpy and \nDr. Jennifer Heath of Burlington; Barbara Buckley of Worchester; \nValerie Mullen of Vershire; Helen Reindel, Joanna Messing, Sylvia Terry \nand Charles Ballantyne of Montpelier; Margaret Turner of Belmont; Don \nKizer of Cavendish; Roald Cann of Springfield; Dr. A. Joshua Sherman of \nMidd; Pinelope Bennett of Norwich; Richard Moore of Putney; Sydney Liff \nof Attamount;\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nAbbas Alnasrawi of Shelburne; Robert and Mary Belenky of Marshfield; \nand other Vermonters about the asylum provisions of the bill were most \nmeaningful. They understand what the disastrous impact of the changes \nin our asylum law, which would have been imposed by this bill, would \nhave meant to real people facing oppression around the world.\n  I want to thank the Committee to Preserve Asylum, which has worked \ndiligently from the beginning to focus needed attention on these \nprovisions of the bill. Earlier this week I met with a number of \nrepresentatives of organizations who support this effort, including Eve \nDubrow of UNITE; John Fredicksson of the Lutheran Immigration and \nRefugee Service; Richard Foltin of the American Jewish Committee; \nRichard Li Albores of the National Asian Pacific American Legal \nConsortium; Michelle Pistone of the Lawyers' Committee for Human \nRights; John Swenson of the U.S. Catholic Conference, Carol Wolchok of \nthe American Bar Association; and Patricia Rengel of Amnesty \nInternational USA. I thank them all for their efforts on behalf of the \nasylum amendment and in connection with serving refugees in need from \naround the world.\n  I am grateful for the letters of support from the U.S. Catholic \nConference, the American Bar Association, the American Friends Service \nCommittee, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the American \nJewish Committee, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the Asian Law \nCaucus, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Lutheran Immigration and \nRefugee Service, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, \nthe Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal \nChurch, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the \nUnited Church Board for World Ministries, the ACLU, the National Asian \nPacific American Legal Consortium and the Women's Commission for \nRefugee Women and Children.\n  At the risk of offending others, I want publicly to commend Carol \nWolchok of the ABA, Michelle Pistone of the Lawyers Committee for Human \nRights, Michael Hill of the U.S. Catholic Conference, Professor Philip \nSchrag of Georgetown, and Dr. Allen Keller of N.Y.U. for their tireless \nefforts on behalf of this amendment. They and those working with them \nlive their commitment to justice and freedom every day. They help make \nAmerica the great country that it is and must remain.\n  I am also especially grateful for the support of Bishop Cummins, the \nchairman of the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Catholic Conference. \nI had received an earlier letter from Cardinal Law in which he noted \nhis opposition to the provisions in the bill that would have virtually \neliminated the United States' commitment to help refugees seek \nprotection from persecution. I am proud that the U.S. Catholic \nConference supported the Leahy amendment, even though our amendment \ndoes not get as far as they would like.\n  I want to thank Anne Willem Bijleveld, the Representative of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for all her support on \nthis matter.\n  In signing the antiterrorism law last week, the President included \nthe following in his message: ``The bill also makes a number of major, \nill-advised changes in our immigration laws having nothing to do with \nfighting terrorism. * * * The provisions will produce extraordinary \nadministrative burdens on the Immigration and Naturalization Service.'' \nI believe that the President was referring to the requirements for \nsummary exclusion that the Senate immigration bill would amend.\n  In a February letter the President sent to Congressman Berman, he \nnoted his concern that ``we not sacrifice our proud tradition of \nrefugee protection and support for the principles of the Convention \nRelating to the Status of Refugees.'' The President noted: ``This \ncritically important Treaty, which responded to the displacement that \nfollowed the Second World War, has enjoyed broad bipartisan support in \nthe Congress. Moreover, our efforts to urge other governments to comply \nwith its provisions has been a major element of our diplomacy on \ninternational humanitarian issues.''\n\n  Specifically on the matter of summary exclusion, the President favors \na ``carefully structured stand-by authority for expedited exclusion.'' \nThat is what our amendment, in contrast to the bill, now provides.\n  With regard to the overall proposals for summary exclusion, the \nPresident wrote that they were ``too broad and would also result in \nconsiderable diversion of INS resources.'' He noted that: ``These \nprovisions seem particularly unnecessary in view of the successful \nasylum reforms we have already initiated.''\n  Human rights organizations have documented a number of cases of \npeople who were ultimately granted political asylum by immigration \njudges after the INS denied their release from INS detention for not \nmeeting a credible fear standard. Under the summary screening that was \nproposed in the bill, these refugees would have been sent back to their \npersecutors without any opportunity for a hearing. I included many such \nexamples in the Record on April 17. I now have collected many, many \nmore.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider how the bill will impact refugees \nseeking asylum here and not just consider the theoretical possibility \nthat they might be treated as the exceptional case.\n  Furthermore, the bill would have denied the federal courts their \nhistoric role in overseeing the implementation of our immigration laws \nand review of individual administrative decisions. The bill would have \nallowed no judicial review whether a person was actually excludable and \nwould have created unjustified exceptions to rulemaking procedural \nprotections under the Administrative Procedure Act. These proposals \nwould have signaled a fundamental change in the roles of our coordinate \nbranches of Government and a dangerous precedent.\n  I urge my colleagues, especially those who did not support the asylum \namendment, to think further about these important matters. While doing \nso, please do not continue to confuse asylum with illegal immigration. \nDo not vote with regard to circumstances that no longer exist after the \nrecent reforms of the asylum process.\n  Refugees who seek asylum in the United States are not causing \nproblems for America or Americans. They come to us for refuge and for \nprotection. Let us not turn them back. Let us not abandon America's \nvital place in the world as a leader for human rights.\n  I want to thank and commend the Managers of the bill. Both Senator \nKennedy, who supported the asylum amendment, and Senator Simpson, who \ndid not, have been exceptionally fair to me and to all of us on this \nissue and on every aspect of the bill. Immigration is a complicated \nissue and one that evokes emotions and strongly held feelings. They \nhave been exceptional managers of this legislation and are \nextraordinary members.\n  I want to pay special tribute to my friend from Wyoming. On the \nasylum issue I might call him a worthy opponent, except that I do not \nbelieve that we are opponents. I believe that we both are working \ntoward the same goal and both want America to remain a beacon of hope \nand freedom to the oppressed, wherever they may be.\n  He has announced that he will not be seeking reelection. That will be \nthe Senate's loss. He is a dedicated, respected and productive member \nof this body. There are not many like Alan Simpson and I will miss his \ncounsel and his humor. I look forward to our continuing to work \ntogether on this important bill and many other matters in the days \nahead.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Immigration Subcommittee--Senators Simpson and Kennedy--\nfor their dedication and commitment to the issue of illegal \nimmigration. They have steered the Senate through a difficult process, \nand we are all appreciative of their efforts this time, as we have been \non numerous occasions past.\n  I will vote against final passage of this bill. The bill contains \nmuch that I support. I am gratified that the Senate has voted to retain \nthe verification pilot programs that were adopted as a compromise in \ncommittee. These pilot programs are essential to combating the job \nmagnet that lures illegal immigrants to the United States, and will \nalso make immigration-related job discrimination less likely.\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\n  I am also gratified that the Senate passed the Leahy asylum amendment \nyesterday. This amendment, by preserving our Nation's commitment to \nproviding safe haven for victims of persecution abroad, was a \nsubstantial improvement in this legislation, and one that corrected one \nof the major problems with this legislation as it came out of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Finally, unlike the House immigration bill, the Senate bill does not \ncontain any provision allowing States to deny undocumented alien \nchildren primary or secondary education. Adoption of such an amendment \nwould have been an imprudent response to the problem of illegal \nimmigration, and would have cost the Nation far more than it would have \nsaved it.\n  Despite the virtues of this legislation, I am compelled to vote \nagainst it because it still suffers from some serious problems--in \nparticular, the provisions of the bill that serve to deny legal \nimmigrants Government assistance. While I support the idea of \ntightening current deeming requirements, the bill will deny legal \nimmigrants assistance that will prevent, not encourage, legal \nimmigrants from receiving welfare, such as higher education and job \ntraining assistance. The bill makes a sieve out of the safety net that \nis essential for the most vulnerable of our society--children, pregnant \nwomen, and the disabled. Finally, this bill retroactively expands \ndeeming requirements for those immigrants who are in the country today, \nwithout the benefit of a legally binding affidavit of support. There is \nno question that sponsors should be primarily liable for the well-being \nof the immigrants they bring in. At the same time, this bill lacks the \nflexibility that is necessary if we are to ensure a balanced and fair \napproach to the issue of immigrants and public assistance.\n  I am concerned about much of the rhetoric about immigrants and public \nassistance that has accompanied this debate. While we have heard much \nabout the pressures immigrants place on our system of public \nassistance, the fact is that the overwhelming majority of immigrants--\nover 93 percent--do not receive welfare, and that working-age \nnonrefugee immigrants use Government assistance at the same levels as \nnative-born Americans. While specific programs--in particular, SSI--\nreceive disproportionate use by immigrants, we should address such \nproblems specifically, without cutting off access to resources that \nwill help immigrants avoid the welfare dependency that concerns us all.\n  Having set out my objections to the bill, I hope that I will be able \nto support a conference agreement on illegal immigration. The House \nimmigration bill has several provisions in the public assistance area \npreferable to the Senate bill--in particular, the exemption from \ndeeming for higher education, and the limitation on programs that can \ngive rise to deportation as a public charge. Adoption of these \nprovisions in the conference will substantially improve this \nlegislation.\n  On the other hand, any illegal immigration conference agreement \nshould not include any provision allowing States to deny primary or \nsecondary educational assistance to undocumented aliens. Such a \nprovision, while not in the Senate bill, is in the House bill. \nInclusion of such a provision in the conference agreement would cause \nmany of those who support the Senate bill to oppose the conference \nreport.\n  We are close to having an illegal immigration bill we can all be \nproud of, but we are not there yet.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1664, the \nImmigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996. It cannot \nbe disputed that our immigration system is currently fraught with \nserious problems, including a flood of illegal immigrants, criminal \naliens, undesirable burdens on public services, and many other \nconcerns. These problems weaken our country as a whole, and erode \npublic support for basic principles which are central to our Nation. \nAmericans are a generous people, but they do not like to have their \ngenerosity abused. I am pleased that we have confronted these hard \nissues with both compassion and resolve, and that the Senate is now \ngiving consideration to final passage of this immigration reform bill.\n  Among the many notable provisions in this immigration bill are those \ndesigned to increase enforcement of our borders; limit ineligible \naliens' public benefits; improve deportation procedures; and reduce \nalien smuggling. There is no serious disagreement over the pressing \nneed to strengthen our laws against illegal immigration, but there has \nbeen much debate over the details of how this can best be achieved. I \nam committed to enacting this legislation in order to sharply reduce \nthe flow of illegal aliens into our Nation, by ensuring adequate \nenforcement along our borders, among other things.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Simpson for his leadership on \nimmigration issues, and particularly on his role in bringing this \nimportant legislation to this point today. Although we have not agreed \non every issue, the commitment and expertise of Senator Simpson have \nbeen invaluable in moving needed reform forward.\n  Immigration matters are complex and tend to be divisive. It is my \nbelief, however, that illegal immigration is among the most serious \nproblems confronting our Nation today. We should pass this legislation \nto address these problems, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this \nmeasure.\n\n\n          relax naturalization requirements for HMONG patriots\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for an \nimportant provision in the House version of S. 1664, the illegal \nimmigration bill, which I had intended to offer as an amendment to this \nbill. This House provision, authored by Congressman Vento, would help \nexpedite the naturalization of Hmong patriots recruited by the CIA who \nserved alongside U.S. military forces during the Vietnam war. Earlier \nthis week, I submitted a corresponding amendment in this Chamber. The \nWellstone amendment No. 3872, would have relaxed the naturalization \nrequirement for permanent residents who served in these guerrilla units \nin Laos, and their spouses or widows, by waiving the language \nrequirement and the residency requirement aliens normally must meet. I \nstill believe these steps are necessary to address the unique situation \nof the Hmong, and I will continue to press for their enactment.\n  Let me describe what has happened over the past few days. I was \nprepared to offer the amendment, but after discussion with numerous \ncolleagues on and off the committee, it has become clear that a number \nof Senators had concerns about the reach and scope of the changes being \nproposed, and thus would likely be unwilling to support my amendment in \nits current form. While I intend to continue to press hard for these \nchanges, I do not want to endanger the chances for these provisions in \nthe conference committee by pushing this to a premature vote, the \noutcome of which is in doubt, and so I will not offer the amendment. \nInstead, I will continue to work with Senator Simpson, Senator Kennedy, \nthe other Senate conferees, and Congressman Vento to craft a provision \nthey will find acceptable.\n  I was surprised and disappointed that there were concerns expressed \nabout this amendment. I had thought it would be noncontroversial. \nDuring the Vietnam war, the CIA recruited tens of thousands of Hmong \npeople to serve in special guerrilla forces, to fight against the \nCommunist government in Laos. Between 10,000 and 20,000 of them are \nestimated to have lost their lives in this struggle, and thousands more \nwere forced to flee to refugee camps or to other nations when the war \nended to avoid the persecution that many feared would follow. Many came \nto the United States, concentrating in California, Minnesota, \nWisconsin, New York, and several other States.\n  These men and women, many of whom were very young when they served, \nhave sacrificed a great deal in defense of our Nation, and they deserve \nan improved chance to become citizens. The waivers I have proposed are \nconsistent with our long tradition of recognizing the service of those \nwho come to the aid of the United States during wartime.\n  Normally, under current law, aliens or noncitizen nationals who \nserved in U.S. forces are eligible for naturalization regardless of \nage, period of residency, or physical presence in the United States. \nThe Hmong patriots, however, fall through the cracks because the units \nwith which they served\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\nwere not technically U.S. units, despite the fact that in many cases \nthey were recruited, trained, and funded by the intelligence services \nof the U.S. Government, and coordinated closely with U.S. forces in the \nregion. Many served as scouts for U.S. forces, and there are many \nstories of their extraordinary heroism in helping to rescue downed U.S. \npilots during this period.\n\n  The most serious obstacle these Hmong patriots face in obtaining \ncitizenship is the language barrier. The Hmong language has not existed \nin written form until very recently, so it has been enormously \ndifficult, especially for older Hmong, despite their best efforts, to \nlearn to read and write in English.\n  The House bill would waive the residency and language requirements \nfor naturalization. These steps are necessary to address the unique \nsituation of the Hmong. By far the most serious problem facing this \ncommunity is their difficulty with learning English. While for some \ncurrent law waiver regulations applying to residency are sufficient, \nthis authority does not cover all of them.\n  Mr. President, there is a long-established precedent for granting \nwaivers to groups who fought bravely on the side of U.S. forces in \ndefense of freedom all over the world. U.S. law has allowed those who \nfought with us in WWI and II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war to be \nnaturalized, regardless of age, period of residence, or presence in the \nUnited States. It has also been allowed for those who served with us, \nbut were not technically part of U.S units. In the 1990 immigration \nbill, Congress adopted a waiver for Filipino scouts who served in World \nWar II. Many of them have now become full-fledged citizens who \nparticipate in the democratic process.\n  No one appreciates the value of the democratic process more than Seng \nThao, who fought for 7 years against the Communists in Laos and was \nwounded twice. When he began his training, he was only 14. Although his \nmilitary service ended in 1975, he stayed in Laos to defend his family \nand his village until 1979. It was in 1979 that his family made the \nvoyage to Thailand, where they were sent to a ``re-education'' camp. \nThere they were reportedly physically abused, and coerced to give up \neverything they had. They were later moved to Ban Vanai Refugee camp.\n  Seng Thao came to the United States in 1980, and now works at \nRiverview Packaging in Minneapolis. He is a productive member of \nsociety, and has earned the right to be called a U.S. citizen. He \nwrites, ``I would like to be a citizen of this great country * * * \nbecause this is my home now.''\n  Another Hmong patriot, Wa Chi Thao, was recruited in 1961 when he was \n11 years old. During his 14 years of fighting, he suffered a wound in a \nbomb explosion, came to the aid of two downed American pilots, and saw \nhis wife die in combat. Before coming to live in St. Paul, MN, Thao and \nhis family spent 10 miserable years in refugee camps.\n  Mr. President, however we feel about the legacy of the Vietnam war, \nlet us recognize the service of these patriots who came to the aid of \nthe United States in a time of war, and honor the memories of those \nthey left behind, with this modest step. It would not open the \nfloodgates for new immigration by creating a new category of \nimmigrants, nor would it make Hmong patriots eligible for veterans \nbenefits. It simply recognizes the service of Seng Thao and other Hmong \nlike him, who served in U.S.-recruited units during the Vietnam war, by \ngranting them a waiver of the English residency requirements and a \nwaiver of the residency requirement. It does not automatically extend \nthem citizenship, but acknowledges their contributions by easing the \npath to citizenship.\n  As the immigration bill moves to a House-Senate conference committee, \nI urge my colleagues who will serve on the conference to recede to the \nHouse language on this important provision. I am confident that we can \nwork together to provide these critical benefits to Hmong veterans who \nserved or Nation during wartime.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the Senate considers S.1664, the \nImmigration Control and Fiscal Responsibility Act, I want to take this \nopportunity to explore and comment on a number of the key issues.\n  Immigration reform has always been a controversial issue for our \nimmigrant based society. As our Nation continues to develop and grow, \nit is appropriate for the Senate to debate these issues. Therefore, I \nwant to complement the members of the Judiciary Committee, both the \nmajority and the minority, who have labored to bring this bill to the \nfloor.\n  The bill does do much to address the problems associated with illegal \nimmigration. I support the bill's provisions to add several thousand \nnew border patrol agents between now and the year 2001. Additionally, I \nsupport the language to add new INS investigators to enforce alien \nsmuggling and employment laws. Illegal immigration along our Southern \nborder is a serious and costly problem. We have a responsibility to \nmeet the needs of our Southern States and to ease the financial burdens \nassociated with illegal immigration.\n  It is important to note that many of the bill's provisions dealing \nwith illegal immigration are similar, and in some cases identical, to \nlegislation proposed by President Clinton. Despite the ongoing problems \nwith illegal immigration, the Clinton administration has waged an \nunprecedented campaign against illegal immigration. The administration \nhas increased the number of Border Patrol agents by 40 percent since \n1993. The administration is on target to meet its goal of 7,000 Border \nPatrol agents, trained and deployed, by the end of fiscal year 1998. I \ncommend the administration for committing the financial resources and \npolitical capital to fight illegal immigration.\n  Despite laudable attempts to combat illegal immigration, this \nlegislation threatens to become a punitive vehicle aimed directly at \nchildren and families. My objections are numerous; I will detail a few \ntoday. If the Senate chooses to follow our House colleagues down the \nroad of punishing children and families as well as abandoning our \nhistorical and cultural acceptance of legal immigrants, I will oppose \nthe legislation.\n  My objections begin with any effort to combine legal immigration \nrestrictions and cutbacks with S. 1664, the bill before the Senate to \ncurb illegal immigration. The effort to combine the two issues will \ndoom passage of illegal immigration reform this year.\n  Legal immigrants have long been a source of strength for our Nation. \nMy own family has an immigration story to tell. My husband's family \nimmigrated to Washington State from Norway and settled in the Ballard \nsection of Seattle. Even today, the Ballard community remains the focal \npoint for Scandinavian culture in Seattle. Flags from Norway dot most \nof the storefronts, school children can learn to speak Norwegian and \nsummer festivals highlight our shared cultural heritage. My husband's \nfamily came to Seattle as the shipping and fishing industries first \nbegan to shape the Pacific Northwest economy. Today, these industries \ngenerate thousands of jobs for Washingtonians and more than $1 billion \nin annual economic activity.\n  Just as early immigrants boosted the growth of the shipping and \nfisheries industries, today's immigrants are instrumental to the growth \nof Washington's high-technology sector. My Washington State colleague, \nSenator Slade Gorton, and I wrote to Chairman Simpson in late November \nto express our opposition to language that would severely restrict the \nability of the high-technology industry to access global talent when \nnecessary to facilitate economic growth in the United States. Tens of \nthousands of Washington State residents are employed in the high-\ntechnology industry at high-skill, high-wage jobs. Senator Gorton and I \nboth believe in the historic record of the United States in attracting \nand keeping the best international talent and harnessing this talent \nfor the benefit of all residents of our State and our country.\n  I also want to take a moment to express my strong personal and moral \nobjection to any amendment to deny educational benefits to any child. \nThis in my mind is perhaps the most troubling language associated with \nthis bill. I simply cannot understand this attempt to punish innocent \nchildren as well as turn our classrooms into interrogation rooms, and \nour teachers into INS agents. This language is veto bait; both\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\nthe Secretary of Education and the Attorney General have indicated this \nlanguage will generate veto recommendations for the President.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court in Plyler versus Doe ruled that States may \nnot, consistent with the 14th amendment, deny undocumented children the \nsame free public education they provide to other children living in the \nState.\n  The language barring children from school is mean-spirited. I am \nsaddened the House of Representatives chose to include this language in \nits version of illegal immigration reform. I implore on the Senate, \nplease reject this cruel attack on innocent children. The language is \nin reality a massive unfunded mandate upon our schools and upon the \nState and local government entities that will be forced to pay costs \nassociated with these barred children in the community on a daily \nbasis.\n  This legislation proposes to allow States to base a legal immigrant's \neligibility for a host of public assistance programs on their income, \nand that of their sponsor. I am particularly concerned about this \nlegislation's impact on children.\n  Here are just some of the services children now have access to that \nStates could deny them under this proposal: Maternal and Child Health \nServices, Preventive Health and Health Services, public health \nassistance for immunizations and testing and treatment to prevent the \nspread of communicable diseases, services from Community Health \nCenters, Child Care and Development Block Grant services, Child \nNutrition Act Programs, including Women and Infant Children [WIC], and \nHead Start.\n  All these programs help children. All could be denied to certain, \nlegal immigrant children. I would like to remind the proponents that \nchildren's needs are not different, just because their paperwork is \ndifferent. And what could be more noble or of greater benefit to the \nNation than giving a child--any child--every opportunity to succeed in \nlife?\n  Mr. President, I remain committed to combating the problems \nassociated with illegal immigration, particularly in the Southern \nStates where our problems are most severe. It remains my hope that this \nlegislation will not lose focus on this objective.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of S. 1664. I do \nso with reservations, however, because the Senate rejected a number of \nvery good amendments, which, if adopted, I believe would have \nstrengthened this bill. As it stands, this bill will achieve some \nneeded reforms in immigration policy. However, I feel it dances a bit \ntoo close to the line in terms of humanitarian treatment of individual \npeople.\n  I can say with confidence that if the Senate bill is altered in any \nway to reflect the House-passed bill during conference, I will not \nsupport it. Specifically, I cannot in good conscience support any \nprovisions that would deny basic human services, such as education and \nhealth care, to children. Likewise, I cannot support any conference \nreport that places new onerous restrictions on legal immigration. I do \nnot believe this would be in the interest of the Nation's economy or \nculture.\n  By sticking close to the Senate mark, a conference committee on \nillegal immigration reform can show the American people that Congress \nis occasionally capable of putting aside fundamental differences and \ncrafting consensus legislation that serves the public interest. I \nsincerely hope this happens.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of our \nefforts to address the problem of illegal immigration. It is shameful \nand, frankly, embarrassing that the strongest nation in the world has \nhad such difficulty controlling its own borders. This bill will help us \nmake progress in this crucial area.\n  The administration has already begun to make headway. Commissioner \nMeissner and the INS have strengthened the Border Patrol and targeted \nagents and equipment to the areas with the highest number of illegal \nentries. They've improved the asylum process, reducing asylum claims by \n57 percent and clearly restoring integrity to the system. And they \ndeported a record number of criminal and noncriminal illegal aliens in \n1995.\n  But with almost 4 million illegal aliens residing in this country, we \nobviously need to do more. Mr. President, this legislation is a good \nstart. With broad bipartisan support, S. 1664 was voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee. This bill is not perfect and the proposed reforms \nnot foolproof, but the American public has sent a clear message. They \nwant us to act against those who break our laws to come here, who take \njobs at the expense of hardworking Americans, and who surreptitiously \nbenefit from the generous safety net provided by our tax dollars.\n  We approved a number of good amendments during the Judiciary \nCommittee markup, as we have done these past weeks during floor debate. \nWe have worked together in a bipartisan manner and moved forward, \nrecognizing that this issue is too important, and this problem too \nserious, for us to have let progress be indefinitely delayed by \nperipheral debates.\n  Mr. President, let me address a number of the contentious issues that \narose during our debate on this bill.\n  First and foremost, I am pleased that we kept separate the illegal \nand legal immigration measures. Simply put, illegal and legal \nimmigration are fundamentally different issues. And Congress must not \nlet our common frustration with illegal immigrants unfairly color the \ncircumstances of legal immigrants: The risk of injustice is too great.\n  Mr. President, we put our minds to it and effectively debated the \nprovisions of S. 1664, and we can do the same with regard to the legal \nimmigration bill. If the majority of the Senate agrees that problems \nexist in both areas, then combining legal and illegal reform packages \nwould only have impeded fair and deliberative treatment of either \nissue.\n  Second, we should be pleased that we maintained the guts of this \nbill: The proposed verification pilot projects. Those who oppose the \npilot projects have legitimate concerns about the accuracy of data, the \nuses to which that data is put, and whether it will really decrease \nemployment discrimination and the employment of illegal aliens. But the \nresponse to these concerns should not be to throw out the idea \naltogether. I am pleased that the Senate voted to uphold the reasonable \ncompromise adopted by the committee. That is, conduct extensive \ndemonstration projects, see if they work and then ask Congress to take \na look at the results and decide whether a national verification system \nis a good idea. If the verification system is ineffective or, worse, \ncivil liberties are compromised, we can junk the system. And we should. \nBut if pilot projects could move us down the road toward a workable \napproach, one which stops illegal aliens from getting jobs, then at the \nvery least it deserves a try.\n  Third, with regard to the summary exclusion provisions, we all agree \nthat the United States must uphold its obligation to provide refuge for \npeople legitimately fleeing persecution. And obviously the challenge \nlies in balancing our desire to provide a safe haven with the need to \nprotect our borders and avoid fraud.\n  As mentioned earlier, INS has begun to move us toward achieving this \nbalance. And the Judiciary Committee added its help by adopting a 1-\nyear post-entry time limit for filing defensive asylum claims. However, \nS. 1664's provisions establishing new grounds for the exclusion of \nimmigrants who arrive at our borders without proper documentation and \nclaim asylum were troubling. Senator Simpson's bill would have \nessentially left the determination of whether that claim is credible to \na Border Patrol agent. These changes would have placed the United \nStates at serious risk of sending legitimate asylees back to their \npersecutors. Indeed, the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees had told us \nas much, all in the name of solving a problem that does not exist. \nFortunately, Senator Leahy's amendment to remove the summary exclusion \nprovisions succeeded.\n  Fourth, the issue of deeming and the related obligations of an \nimmigrant sponsor are extremely complex. Persuasive arguments can be \nmade on both sides but, overall, this bill's provisions strengthening \nan immigrant sponsor's obligations are fair and prudent. It is \nreasonable to ask that the sponsor's affidavit of support be legally \nenforceable and that deeming extend to more public assistance programs. \nWhen legal immigrants come to this country they take a vow not to \nbecome a public\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\ncharge. And it is the sponsor, not the taxpayer, who should foot the \nbill when a legal immigrant needs help. However, I must express regret \nthat the Senate voted down the Chafee amendment. At a minimum, the \nSenate should have ensured that illegal aliens are not afforded more \nprivileges than legal immigrants and approved this provision in the \ninterest of public health.\n  Finally, I am pleased that S. 1664 includes my amendment on the \ninternational matchmaking business. This amendment launches a study of \ninternational matchmaking companies, heretofore unregulated and \noperating in the shadows. These companies may be exploiting people in \ndesperate situations. The study is not aimed at the men and women who \nuse these businesses for legitimate companionship. Instead, it is a \nvery positive and important step toward gathering the information we \nneed so that we can determine the extent to which these companies \ncontribute to the very troubling problems of domestic violence against \nimmigrant women and immigration marriage fraud.\n  Mr. President, my own parents were immigrants. There is no doubt that \nour Nation has benefited immensely from the hard work and ambitions of \nthe generations of legal immigrants that have chosen to start new lives \nin America. This bill, by cracking down on illegal immigration, will \ncontinue this rich tradition. I commend the hard work and commitment of \nthe managers of the bill, Senators Simpson and Kennedy.\n  Our current immigration policies, though not perfect, stand as strong \nevidence that the United States is fundamentally a generous and \ncompassionate nation. Though we sometimes differ over the best way to \ncontinue that strong tradition, we all share a common desire to stem \nthe tide of illegal immigration to this country. With our minds on the \ncommon goal, let us approve this legislation on behalf of the American \npublic.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of this \nbill to curb illegal immigration.\n  Since its first days as a nation, the United States has always been a \nrefuge for those seeking to escape political and religious persecution. \nAmerica has consistently provided limitless economic, political, and \nsocial opportunities for those who come to our Nation and are intent on \nworking hard and improving their lives and those of their children.\n  It is this influx of immigrants from diverse cultures and distant \nlands that has made America a shining example to the world. That's why \nmillions of people across the globe look to the United States as a land \nof opportunity. It's why they come to our borders in the hopes of \nentering our Nation and achieving a better life.\n  It was the promise of the American Dream that brought my family to \nthis country from Ireland. And it was the desire for a better life that \nbrought millions of other immigrants to America, whether they came over \non the Mayflower or if they came to our land in just the past few days.\n  As Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded us more than 50 years ago, with \nthe exception of native Americans, ``All of our people all over the \ncountry. * * * are immigrants or descendants of immigrants, including \neven those who came over here on the Mayflower.''\n  Nearly every Senator in this body is a descendant of immigrants. And \nI believe that we should provide the same opportunities for those who \ncome after us as our forefathers accorded to those who came before us.\n  However, while I strongly support continued immigration to our \nNation, there are proper rules and procedures to be adhered to. If you \nplay by the rules and follow the laws of our country than the \nopportunity to live in America should be available.\n  But, the opportunity to come to America does not give people the \nright to enter our Nation illegally. It does not give them the right to \nbreak the law. Nor does it give companies or businessman the right to \nhire illegal aliens and take away jobs from hard-working Americans who \npay their taxes and play by the rules.\n  Let me just say that I commend this administration for all it has \ndone in curbing illegal immigration. Since 1993, the Clinton \nadministration increased the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nbudget by 72 percent. More than 1,000 new Border Patrol agents have \nbeen deployed. Additionally, more than 140,000 illegal and criminal \naliens have been deported since 1993.\n  What's more, this administration is helping more eligible immigrants \nbecome citizens. In fact, in fiscal year 1995 more than half a million \ncitizenship applications were completed.\n  These are substantial gains, but there is more to be done and this \nbill takes important steps in the right direction.\n  This legislation increases the size of the Border Patrol. It \nauthorizes voluntary pilot projects to test improved employee \nverification system. It forces sponsors to take greater responsibility \nfor the immigrants they bring into the country. And it increases the \npenalties for alien smuggling and fraud.\n  These are all necessary steps and I believe they are necessary to \ncurb illegal immigration in our country. What's more they were strongly \ninfluenced by the bipartisan Jordan Commission on Immigration Reform.\n  While, I do remain concerned about the benefit provisions in this \nlegislation, there are enough positive aspects of this bill to make it \nworthwhile.\n  I am particularly pleased that this body decided to defer taking up \nthe issue of legal immigration. It is essential that we do not confuse \nthe two issues.\n  Legal immigrants play by the rules that this government has \nestablished. What's more, legal immigrants have an overwhelmingly \npositive benefit for this Nation.\n  Legal immigrants pay nearly 95 percent more in taxes then they \nreceive in benefits. More than 93 percent do not receive welfare \nbenefits. In fact, native-born Americans are more likely to receive \nwelfare then poor immigrants.\n  Legal immigrants are not the problem. They play by the rules and they \ndon't deserve to have their benefits or their rights cut.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes the Leahy amendment, which \nprevents barriers from being placed in front of those who seek \npolitical and humanitarian asylum.\n  We must avoid putting those who come to our country seeking asylum, \ninto a position where their political beliefs could cause them to face \nthe possibility of imprisonment, injury, or even death if they return \nto their homeland.\n  We must never forget as a nation that America has and will continue \nto be seen as a beacon of hope and freedom for those who are oppressed \nor maltreated. We must not shirk our role as a haven for those fleeing \npersecution.\n  Unfortunately, I think those facts have sometimes been lost in our \nrecent national debate on immigration. They should always be our core \nconcern when discussing immigration reform measures.\n  Our Nation was founded on the concept of taking in the downtrodden \nand persecuted. And throughout our history, America has prospered \nbecause we have kept the doors open for new immigrants.\n  Today, we must continue to maintain our obligation to immigration as \na nation and as a people. While not perfect, I believe this bill takes \nus in the right direction toward upholding our commitment to an \ninclusive and common-sense immigration policy.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the U.S. Government has a duty to control \nimmigration, and it is failing miserably. Passage of this bill will \nhelp halt the large migration of illegals into our country.\n  But, due in part to the service rendered by the able Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] on this bill, S. 1664, ``The Immigration Control \nand Financial Responsibility Act of 1996'' the Federal Government will \nhave meaningful tools to discourage illegal immigration and better \nhandle illegal aliens in our country. We are grateful for the enormous \namount of time and expertise Al Simpson has devoted throughout his \ntenure in the Senate to the formulation of a workable, credible \nimmigration policy. All of us have benefited from Senator Simpson's \ntireless efforts.\n  Mr. President, immigration is an especially important issue to the \nAmerican people, and it is important that we not forget that ours is a \nnation of\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nimmigrants. America has always had a very generous immigration policy. \nBut while it is politically correct in some circles to call for an open \nimmigration policy--allowing in all who seek admission--it would be a \nserious mistake of judgment to fail to assess the consequences of an \nout-of-control influx of immigrants, legal or illegal.\n  During the 1985 consideration of immigration reform, some Senators \ncautioned against granting amnesty to the illegal aliens pouring across \nour borders. I was among those who stated such an apprehension. It was \nenvisioned that such amnesty would establish a dangerous precedent \ncertain to encourage even more illegal immigration. Another concern in \nthe 1985 debate was the potential for an enormous increase in Federal \nwelfare spending. Both concerns were valid and both have come to pass.\n  The National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc., has compiled \nstatistics showing that from 1984 to 1990, the percentage of welfare \nbenefits distributed to immigrant households has risen from 9.8 to 13.8 \npercent. There is no indication that the percentage will decrease in \nthe years ahead.\n  The abuse in the Supplemental Security Income Program alone is \nstartling. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 25 percent of \nthe growth in SSI between 1993 and 1996 is due to immigrants--an \nastounding number because of the percentage of immigrants among SSI \nrecipients--2.9 percent of the general population are immigrants and 29 \npercent of the SSI-aged beneficiaries are immigrants.\n  Thousands of North Carolinians, and others across the Nation, have \ncontacted me to describe their problems with the current U.S. \nimmigration system. Most often, citizens express disgust at the numbers \nof noncitizens receiving welfare benefits almost from the day they slip \nover the borders into the United States.\n  Mr. President, it is impossible to suggest to my fellow North \nCarolinians that there is any wisdom or common sense to an immigration \npolicy that allows noncitizens to receive welfare checks or any other \nFederal benefits and services. Sponsors of this bill agreed. The bill \ncorrectly changes the current system which aliens can sign up for a \nlong list of welfare benefits including Aid to Families With Dependant \nChildren, Supplemental Security Income, and food stamps. With mention \nseldom, if ever made, of the U.S. law these aliens are violating--a law \nwhich clearly states that nobody may immigrate to the United States \nwithout demonstrating that he or she is not ``likely at any time to \nbecome a public charge.'' Hard-working taxpayers should not be required \nto shell out funds to aliens who have broken the promise they made when \nentering the country.\n  North Carolinians will be relieved to learn that many attempts--\nthrough the amending process--to lessen the impact of the bill's rigid \nenforcement of this law were soundly defeated. In addition, the bill \nfurther forbids receipt of any Federal, State, or local government \nbenefit by noncitizens.\n  Mr. President, it is virtually impossible to estimate the total \nnumber of illegal immigrants in our country--in 1983, the Immigration \nand Nationalization Service estimated that there were 3.4 million in \nour country. Some have crossed our borders illegally while others have \noverstayed their visas and permits. The National Immigration Forum has \ngiven what is perceived as a conservative estimate that the number of \nillegals in the United States is about 3.2 million, pushed downward by \nthe amnesty of 1987-88 which has resulted in a 200,000 to 300,000 \naddition to America's population each year.\n  At a time when the Federal Government is wrestling with its $5 \ntrillion debt, it is the responsibility of Congress to find out where \nthe taxpayers' funds are being used. It is our duty to take a position \non the doling out of the taxpayers' funds to people not legally in our \ncountry and aliens who should not be in line for welfare benefits.\n  As of Tuesday, April 30, the debt stood at $5,102,048,827,234.22, \nmeaning that every man, woman, and child in our Nation owes $19,271.23 \non a per capita basis.\n  Mr. President, the bill before the Senate tightens the enforcement \nand improves the effectiveness of our immigration law by: First, adding \nadditional Border Patrol and investigative personnel; second, creating \nadditional detention facilities; third, increasing penalties for alien \nsmuggling and document fraud; fourth, reforming asylum, exclusion and \ndeportation law and procedures; and fifth, by ending distribution of \nwelfare to noncitizens.\n  I support this measure because it will make it more difficult for \nimmigrants to enter this country illegally. This is a bold step to \nprotect the rights and best interests of citizens of the United States.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to explain my opposition to S. \n1664, the illegal immigration bill approved by the full Senate today.\n  There are several provisions in the bill that I strongly support and \nthat I believe will significantly improve our ability to curb illegal \nimmigration. For example, providing additional personnel and resources \nto the Border Patrol marks an unprecedented effort to provide law \nenforcement agencies with the tools to maintain the integrity of our \nborder. And the tough new penalties authored by the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Abraham, and myself for those who come here legally \nand fail to depart when their visas expire is the first time ever \nanyone has proposed cracking down on the visa overstayer problem--a \nproblem that represents up to one-half of our illegal immigration \nproblems.\n  In addition, I am also pleased that we were able to ensure that this \nlegislation does not dramatically reduce current levels of legal \nimmigration. As I have consistently said, we should focus on those who \nare breaking the rules, not those who are abiding by them.\n  Unfortunately, the bill contains very troubling provisions relating \nto the establishment of a national worker verification system that I \nremain strongly opposed to and that I believe violate the principle I \nhave just outlined.\n  Some believe that a massive new national verification system to \nverify the identity of all U.S. citizens and alien residents is a \nmeasured response to the illegal immigration problem. I could not \ndisagree more. INS tells us that less than 2 percent of the U.S. \npopulation is here illegally. I do not understand why some believe it \nis a measured response to verify the identity of 98 percent of the \npopulation--that which is residing here legally--to root out the small \npercentage that is here illegally.\n  Moreover, the cost to employers of complying with this Federal \nmandate and navigating this complex new Federal bureaucracy cannot be \nunderstated. Will employers be required to buy expensive computers and \nthe necessary software so they can communicate with a Federal \nbureaucrat in Washington, DC?\n  I do not understand how some of the same Senators who so vocally \nsupported regulatory relief for small businesses last year can be so \nenthusiastic about passing yet another Federal mandate and more Federal \npaperwork onto our Nation's employers.\n  Finally, I joined the Senators from Michigan, Senator Abraham, and \nOhio, Senator DeWine, in a bipartisan attempt to remove the bill's new \nand onerous requirements relating to birth certificates and driver's \nlicense.\n  S. 1664 would mark an unprecedented Federal preemption of every \nState's right to fashion and issue their birth certificates and \ndriver's license. Under this bill, local and State agencies must comply \nwith federally mandated regulations relating to the composition and \nissuance of these identification documents. I oppose the federalization \nof these documents, and am gravely concerned that such an act puts us \nsquarely on the road to having some sort of national ID card.\n  Moreover, the bill does not contain one word about how the States and \nlocal governments are to pay for these changes. Again, this provision \nstands in direct contradiction to one of the 104th Congress' few \nbipartisan successes--the enactment of unfunded mandates legislation. \nThese provisions represent an enormous unfunded mandate, and is \nprecisely why they are opposed by the National Conference of State \nLegislatures and the National Association of Counties.\n  Mr. President, I do want to take a moment to commend the senior \nSenator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson, and the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy. They have\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\ntaken on a tremendously difficult task and they are to be recognized \nfor their hard work and dedication to reforming our immigration laws.\n  I do regret that I have some fundamental disagreements over how we \nshould go about reforming those laws, but I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to modify these provisions during the duration of \nthe legislative process so as to minimalize the bill's impact on our \nNation's employers, workers, legal immigrants and State and local \ngovernments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to express my deep \nappreciation to the managers of S. 1644, Chairman Simpson and Senator \nKennedy, for their support for my two amendments that have been adopted \nen bloc. These are amendments Nos. 3873 and 3874, as amended.\n  Mr. President, these two noncontroversial amendments relate to \nproblems that have developed in recent years with the movement of \npersons along Maine's border with the Canadian province of New \nBrunswick.\n  The first amendment expresses the sense of Congress on New \nBrunswick's discriminatory application of its Provincial sales tax only \non those Canadians crossing the border with the United States and not \non Canadians crossing the border from other Canadian provinces. The \nsecond amendment calls for the U.S. Customs Service to conduct a study \nof reports of harassment by Canadian Customs officials of Canadians \nreturning to New Brunswick from Maine.\n  Mr. President, nearly 3 years ago, in July 1993, Canadian Customs \nofficers began collecting an 11 percent New Brunswick Provincial sales \ntax on goods purchased in the United States by New Brunswick residents. \nIt immediately became clear that this tax collection at the United \nStates-New Brunswick border was intended to discourage Canadians from \nshopping in Maine. This is evidenced by the fact that New Brunswick \ncollects the tax only along its international border with the United \nStates, not along its border with other Canadian provinces. Thus, the \ntax is being administered by Canadian authorities in a manner uniquely \ndiscriminatory to Canadians shopping in the United States.\n  I would like to make it clear that while I regret such cross-border \nimpediments to the movement of people and goods, New Brunswick's right \nto attempt to collect its sales tax on the purchase of goods outside \nthe province by New Brunswick residents has never been questioned. The \nissue is the discriminatory application of New Brunswick's sales tax \nonly on goods purchased in the United States, an application that runs \ndirectly counter to the letter and spirit of the North American Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  Mr. President, this impediment to the cross-border movement of \npersons and goods not only violates Canada's NAFTA obligations, but it \nhas severely damaged the economies of a number of communities in \nnorthern Maine who formerly provided services to significant numbers of \nNew Brunswick residents.\n  Soon after the imposition of the New Brunswick Provincial sales tax, \nI began working with the U.S. Trade Representative to seek redress \nunder the then-existing dispute mechanism available under the United \nStates-Canada Free Trade Agreement. But before that dispute mechanism \ncould be engaged, Congress approved the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, which required an entirely new dispute mechanism to be \ncreated.\n  In February 1994, more than 2 years ago, the United States Trade \nRepresentative publicly stated that the United States would seek \nredress from Canada for the discriminatory application of New \nBrunswick's Provincial sales tax under the dispute resolution process \ncontained in chapter 20 of the NAFTA. Trade Representative Kantor said \nthat he would seek such redress as soon as the dispute resolution \nprocess was established.\n  Mr. President, the dispute resolution process contained in chapter 20 \nof the NAFTA has now been in place for a year, but the USTR has still \nnot submitted this case. Therefore, my first amendment simply states \nthe sense of Congress that the United States should move forward \nwithout delay in bringing the Provincial sales tax issue before the \nNAFTA dispute resolution process. The people of Maine deserve their day \nin court.\n  Mr. President, my second amendment would address disturbing reports \nof harassment by Canadian Customs officials of New Brunswick residents \nupon their return to Canada from northern Maine. The amendment asks the \nU.S. Customs Service to investigate these allegations, and to report \nback to Congress. If Customs officials find that such harassment has \noccurred, the amendment calls on the U.S. Customs Service to recommend \nactions that could be taken to address the problem.\n  The amendment also calls on the Customs Service to consult with \nrepresentatives of the State of Maine, local businesses, and any other \nknowledgeable persons who might be able to assist Customs in the \ncompletion of the study. This will ensure that the Customs Service has \nfull access to all those in Maine who have received reports of Canadian \nCustoms harassment of New Brunswick residents.\n  Mr. President, these two amendments may seem minor to many of my \ncolleagues, but they address issues that are critically important to \nthe economic health and livelihood of many small communities in \nnorthern Maine. These communities have suffered severe economic harm \nfrom the discriminatory application of New Brunswick's Provincial sales \ntax and other actions taken by Canadian officials to impede cross \nborder shopping by Canadians in the United States. Before we move \nforward on this important bill to better control our own borders, I \nbelieve that these issues simply must be resolved.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Simpson and \nSenator Kennedy for their critical support for these important \namendments.\n\n\n                            f-1 visa holders\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to bring an important issue to \nthe attention of my colleagues, INS regulations at 8 CFR sec. \n214.2(f)(10) preclude practical training during the first 9-months of a \nfull-time undergraduate student's enrollment in a Service-approved \ncollege or university. In other words, an F-1 visa holder lawfully \nenrolled as an undergraduate student in a college or university with an \napproved curriculum may not participate in practical training or an \ninternship program without completing 9 full months of classroom time. \nThis restriction applies to undergraduate students but does not apply \nto graduate students. I might add that there is no legislative history \nto support such a distinction.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I was not aware of that regulation. Has my colleague \ninquired as to the position of the INS and the agency's reasoning for \nwriting the regulation in this manner?\n  Mr. BOND. I sent a letter to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner \nrequesting her to advise me of the official position of the INS and any \nactions the agency may take to remedy the situation. Unfortunately the \nINS Commissioner must not have felt that the issue was of the \nimportance for her to respond personally. I did receive a letter from \nthe Office of Congressional Affairs stating that the rationale for the \nregulation is the well-established fact that the initial academic year \nof an undergraduate curriculum is focused around introductory \ncurriculum rather than paid practical training outside the classroom. \nThe agency representative said this position is consistent with \ncongressional intent.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Is this response acceptable to my colleague?\n  Mr. BOND. I say to my colleague that I remain unconvinced that this \nregulation is consistent with the intent of Congress. This situation \nconcerns me because a liberal arts college in Missouri that offers a \nfull-time undergraduate curriculum includes practical training. For a \nnumber of reasons, the foreign students are rotated along with the \nAmerican students through the program and a number of students begin \nthe internship training in their first year of school. This is an \nimpressive program. The school ensures that all the foreign students \nare lawfully enrolled. Finally, the college values the enrollment and \nparticipation of the F-1 visa holders. It is important to the future \nand the success of the program to have the flexibility to rotate the \nstudents through the practical training as needed.\n  Would my colleague agree that this is a matter that deserves the \nattention\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\nof the INS? Should the INS find that the program is a valid program and \nthe students are lawfully admitted, I believe these students should be \npermitted to participate in the practical training in this manner.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I agree with my colleague that this situation deserves \nthe attention of the INS. I would have thought that the INS \nCommissioner would have responded to you personally. Are the students \nin these programs completing their course of study? Are they receiving \na liberal arts degree? I would be interested in those questions. I \ncommend you for your interest in this issue.\n  Mr. BOND. The students in this program are lawfully enrolled, they \ncomplete their course of study and they receive a liberal arts degree. \nI have prepared an amendment to correct this situation, but I am going \nto withhold introducing the amendment at this time and attempt to work \nthrough this situation with the INS. However, should this situation not \nbe addressed I will consider offering the amendment when the Senate \nconsiders the appropriate future legislation.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I would be willing to give such an amendment the \nconsideration it deserves at that time.\n  Mr. BOND. Will my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, agree that this situation warrants the full \nattention of the Immigration and Naturalization Service?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with my colleague, the INS should give the issue \nthe attention it deserves. Should my colleague offer such an amendment, \nI will also be willing to consider supporting the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleagues for their consideration and will keep \nthem apprised of the disposition of this important issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I applaud the hard work of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on this immigration reform legislation. This bill \ncontains many important provisions that will help stem the rising tide \nof illegal immigration to the United States and reduce the costs to \ntaxpayers from any continued illegal immigration.\n  I take this opportunity to emphasize that I voted against an \namendment offered by Senator Leahy that would have stricken summary \nexclusion provisions from this bill and the recently passed \nantiterrorism bill because we must curtail asylum abuse in order to \nfully address our Nation's serious problem of illegal immigration.\n  I also want to address a provision in the immigration bill that would \nallow an employer to ask an employee or potential employee for \nadditional documentation to establish the employee's authorization to \nwork. This provision creates an intent standard which provides that an \nemployer does not violate fair labor standards in requesting additional \ndocumentation from an employee unless the employer intended to \ndiscriminate on the basis of race or national origin.\n  Under current law, an employer may not request any documents in \naddition to those contained on a prescribed list of documents when \nverifying an employee's eligibility to work. At the same time, \nemployers fearing sanctions for hiring an illegal alien often feel \ncompelled to request additional documents from individuals, especially \nwhen they have constructive knowledge that an individual is not \nauthorized to work.\n  I understand that some have expressed concerns that changing the law \ncould make it more difficult to prove discrimination in document abuse \ncases. However, cases decided before current law was enacted show that \nour immigration laws protect against such discrimination even without a \nharsh strict liability standard. Thus, I believe this change in the law \nstrikes a proper balance between the need to protect against \ndiscrimination and the need not to punish employer's who reasonably \nsuspect that an employee or applicant is not authorized to work.\n  Again, I commend the Senate Judiciary Committee on their excellent \nwork in crafting this immigration reform legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2202, the \nImmigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996.\n  It has been said before, but it bears repeating that as a nation we \nmust close the back door to illegal immigration if the front door of \nlegal immigration is to remain open. This landmark legislation \nrepresents a major step toward that goal.\n  Mr. President, as passed by the Senate, H.R. 2202 significantly \naugments the Nation's Border Patrol. The bill also provides the \nDepartment of Justice with important new legal tools to fight alien \nsmuggling and document fraud. In addition, H.R. 2202 enhances the \nability of the Justice Department to secure the prompt deportation of \ncriminal aliens.\n  Equally important, H.R. 2202 protects the taxpayers by taking \nnumerous steps to assure that legal immigrants come to the United \nStates to work, not to go on welfare.\n  The one major provision of H.R. 2202 with which I disagree is the one \nthat establishes pilot programs for various systems to verify the \nemployment eligibility of new workers. Some have called this part of \nthis bill the beginning of an eventual ``national identification \nsystem'' or ``national identification card.'' I share this concern. \nDuring the Senate's consideration of this illegal immigration bill, \ntherefore, I voted to support the Abraham-Feingold amendment to strike \nthe national identification pilot programs provisions from the \nlegislation.\n  On balance, though, H.R. 2202 is a strong bill. It will strike a \npowerful blow against illegal immigration. In the majestic words of the \npoet Emma Lazarus, America still lifts her ``lamp beside the Golden \nDoor'' for legal immigrants. With this bill, however, we are now moving \nto put a new padlock on the back door to keep out those who seek to \nviolate our laws against illegal immigration.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we consider this legislation, I ask my \ncolleagues to focus on this fact: According to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, there are approximately 4 million illegal \nimmigrants permanently residing in this country today, and that number \ngrows by an estimated 300,000 each and every year. Clearly, such \nnumbers should be a siren song to this Congress.\n  That is why I will support this final, amended version of S. 1664, \nthe Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act. It is, in my \nopinion, a positive step in our overall effort to improve our Nation's \nimmigration policies. The bill makes much-needed and substantive \nreforms in the current law by focusing on the problem of illegal \nimmigration without unfairly punishing law-abiding employers and those \nwho come to this country and play by the rules.\n  This bill concentrates on better enforcement, both at our borders and \nin dealing with those who overstay their visa, by increasing the number \nof Border Patrol agents and investigative personnel over the next 5 \nfiscal years. It provides for 4,700 new Border Patrol agents, a total \nincrease of 90 percent above current levels. It authorizes the hiring \nof 300 full-time INS investigators who will concentrate on alien \nsmuggling and enforcing employer sanctions. And it authorizes 300 new \nINS officers to investigate aliens who entered legally on a temporary \nvisa, but have overstayed that visa and are now in the United States \nillegally.\n  This bill also works to streamline current exclusion and deportation \nprocesses for anyone attempting to enter the United States without \nproper documentation, or with false documentation. No longer will such \nindividuals be able to stay on indefinitely while their case is \nendlessly adjudicated. While genuine refugees are still offered \nimportant protections, abuse of the system will be largely curtailed \nthrough a new system which allows specially trained asylum officers at \nports of entry to determine if refugee seekers have a credible fear of \npersecution. If they do, then they can go through the normal process of \nestablishing their claim. But if they cannot establish a proper claim, \nthen the new provisions in this bill will prevent them from simply \nbeing released into the streets.\n  Mr. President, S. 1664 also contains new language that will \neffectively deal with criminal aliens. For those individuals who come \nto this country and commit crimes--and there are an estimated 450,000 \nsuch criminal aliens in our jails and at large throughout the Nation--\nthere are tough new provisions\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\nin this bill that will keep them off our streets and deport them more \nquickly. For example, under this bill, criminal aliens will no longer \nhave the luxury of deciding whether they will serve their sentence in \nthis country or their home country. On the contrary, this bill allows \nfor the renegotiation of prisoner-transfer treaties that will take away \nthat decision from the criminal alien.\n  In addition, this bill places new restrictions--much-needed \nrestrictions--on the use of welfare by immigrants. For the first time, \nself-sufficiency will be the watchword for those coming to the United \nStates. By making noncitizens ineligible for Federal means-tested \nprograms, and by ``deeming'' a sponsor's income attributable to an \nimmigrant, the American taxpayer will no longer be financially \nresponsible for new arrivals.\n\n  Mr. President, currently, individuals who sponsor an immigrant's \nentry into the United States must pledge financial support for that \nimmigrant by signing an affidavit. But those affidavits, as it turns \nout, are not legally binding, and therefore not enforceable. \nConsequently, they are simply not worth the paper they are printed on. \nUnder this bill, though, the sponsor's affidavit of support will be a \nlegally binding document, thereby creating a legal claim that the \nFederal Government or any State government can seek to enforce. \nMoreover, the affidavit remains enforceable against the sponsor until \nthe immigrant becomes a naturalized citizen, or has worked 40 \nqualifying quarters in this country.\n  Mr. President, each of the provisions that I have noted are, I \nbelieve, good provisions. Each will be effective in combating the \nproblem of illegal immigration. But on their own, these reforms cannot \nstem the root of the problem. They cannot get at the underlying cause \nfor why the United States has such a large illegal alien population, \nnow estimated by the INS at some 4 million persons.\n  On the contrary, the only way to effectively halt the flow of illegal \nimmigrants into the United States is to take away the biggest magnet of \nall: the magnet of jobs. Pure and simple, we must do more to deny jobs \nto those who are in the country unlawfully than we are presently doing. \nAnd I believe that the most realistic way to turn off the jobs magnet \nis through the new worker verification system provided for in this \nbill.\n  This provision, jointly crafted by Senators Simpson and Kennedy, will \nrequire the President, acting through the Justice Department, to \nconduct several local or regional pilot programs over the next 3 years \nto test new and better ways of verifying employment eligibility. These \npilot programs will test the feasibility of implementing electronic or \ntelephonic verification systems that will reduce employment of illegal \nimmigrants, while at the same time protecting the privacy of all \nAmericans.\n  The verification systems that will be tested in these demonstration \nprojects will be required to reliably determine whether the person \napplying for employment is actually eligible to work, and whether or \nnot such individual is an imposter, fraudulently claiming another \nperson's identity. Under the terms of the Simpson-Kennedy amendment, \nany system tested would be required to reliably verify employment \nauthorization within 5 business days, and do so in 99 percent of all \ninquiries. The systems must also provide an accessible and reliable \nprocess for authorized workers to examine the contents of their records \nand correct errors within 10 business days. And any identification \ndocuments used in these demonstration projects must be resistant to \ntampering and counterfeiting.\n  Mr. President, as I noted at the start of my comments, I believe S. \n1664 is a good bill, with many tough provisions. In my opinion, this \nlegislation will make significant strides toward reducing the number of \nillegal immigrants in the United States, and in helping to lift the \nfinancial burden for these people from the shoulders of the American \ntaxpayer.\n\n  At the same time, however, I am disappointed that the Senate did not \nsee fit to address the entire issue of immigration, both illegal and \nlegal. I do not believe, as I know some do, that the issues neatly \nseparate into distinct matters. I do not believe, as some apparently \ndo, that we can have a coherent, integrated policy in this area when we \nchoose to ignore necessary reforms in legal immigration.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the time is way overdue for all of us \nto take a fresh, cold, hard look at our total national immigration \npolicy and its impact on our society. It is clear to me that such an \nevaluation is badly needed and that a new consensus about the kind of \nimmigration policies we need to enhance our particular goals must be \nformulated by the Congress. It seems indisputable to me that any \nnation's overall immigration policy must first and foremost seek to \nenhance the survival and integrity of that nation's culture as a whole \nby encouraging a broad consensus and shared beliefs. Simply put, our \nNation must put its own citizens' concerns above the laudable goal of \nhelping people from other nations. We must consider our own national \npriorities and the needs of our own citizens first.\n  As Alexander Hamilton said on January 12, 1802, ``The safety of a \nrepublic depends essentially on the energy of a common national \nsentiment; on a uniformity of principles and habits; on the exemption \nof the citizens from foreign bias, and prejudice; and on the love of \ncountry which will almost invariably be found to be closely connected \nwith birth, education and family.''\n  But what we are beginning to see in our country is the fragmentation \nof peoples into groups who tend to put the group above the Nation. This \ntrend toward Balkanization of America into ethnic enclaves is a \nslippage we need to take positive steps to curtail.\n  The extreme result of Balkanization of course is the ethnic bloodshed \nwe have witnessed in the former Yugoslavia. When we think of \nimmigration in America, I believe most of us draw an image of America \nas a melting pot where ethnic differences are subordinated for the \nbenefit of the greater whole. Recent evidence throws this imagery into \nsome question. The process of assimilation into a common language and \nbelief system, and shared values, is no longer occurring as it has in \nthe past with the waves of new immigrants now washing into our country. \nRather than melting into one people, we seem to fragment and separate \nin warring groups.\n  The recent history of immigration into America shows that it is \ngoverned by, first, the laws which we write, and second, the \nimplementation of those laws. Obviously when we write new law, we must \nthen look to our own employment needs, to the effects on our welfare \nrolls, and to the impacts on the resources we dedicate to our schools \nand health system as we proceed. We obviously have an obligation to put \nour own people, their standard of living, and their opportunities for \neducation, employment and health first. So we here in Congress must \ntake responsibility for the effect of the immigration laws which we \nwrite on the continued health of our Nation. We cannot shirk or shift \nthis responsibility.\n\n  The American people tell us in convincing polls, some 70 percent, \nthat they think we are taking in more immigrants--legal and illegal--\nthan we can properly absorb and assimilate. The Immigration Act of 1965 \napparently triggered huge increases in immigration, and not necessarily \nby design. Various estimates, including those of the INS, project an \naverage of well over 1 million immigrants per year, both legal and \nillegal, will settle in the United States in the current decade, with \nno subsidence of that flood in sight unless we in the Congress take \naction to do something about it.\n  To really get to the heart of the problem, we have to be willing to \nexamine and debate the newly developing demographic dynamics among all \ncultural and ethnic groups including developing trends in regional and \nurban concentration, and our own national racial mix on a basis which \nis dispassionate, fair and not prejudicial. Perhaps this is difficult \nfor many, but we cannot treat such practical analysis as taboo because \na changing cultural mix in a locality, a city, a State or a region can \nhave profound social, economic, and political consequences on us all \nwhich cannot be ignored. For instance, should we not be looking at the \nparticular impacts of immigration in specific geographic concentrations \nand make an effort to reduce the possibilities of Balkanization and the \ncreation\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nof enclaves? There is already some documentation of demographic \nmovements of some ethnic groups away from, and in reaction to, such \nenclaves. We need to take steps to better understand the demographic \nshifts that are occurring in our country and the consequent economic \nand political results of those shifting tides.\n  There is one area of abuse which starkly highlights the need for \nthorough dispassionate review of certain practices which have reached \nnear ridiculous proportions. It is time we re-examined our policy of \nrewarding family preferences automatically to the children of illegal-\nimmigrant mothers. The practice of coming to the United States, \nillegally, solely to have a child which is then automatically an \nAmerican citizen with right to preference in bringing in other family \nmembers has reached epidemic proportions in California particularly. \nMost of the births, according to the Los Angeles Times of January 6, \n1992, in Los Angeles County are reported to have been of this variety. \nSomething is clearly wrong with our policy in this regard and I support \naddressing the problem.\n  One fundamental issue which ought to be discussed is the primacy of \nour national language. There is nothing more fundamental to an \nintegrated state and culture than a common language. The trend toward \nbilingualism in some areas, I contend, may not be productive at all, \nbut instead may simply delay the mastering of English for many \nimmigrants. Any policy or law which encourages the use of other \nlanguages at the expense of learning English naturally erodes our \ntraditional national identity in a most direct and important way. \nRequiring education to be in English is the best way I know of to keep \nthe melting pot melting.\n\n  Second, we seem to have shifted away from employment-oriented \nimmigration, designed to fill particular gaps in our work force, and \ngravitated instead to an emphasis on family reunification. The \nJudiciary Committee has debated the numbers allowed for family \nreunification, but I would question the emphasis on this priority above \nemployment tests for potential citizens. It seems to me to be simple \ncommon sense to encourage immigration to the United States among \napplicants who can help the United States meet certain needs that might \nstrengthen our workforce and help us be better able to compete in a \nglobal economy.\n  Third, even when we review those employment-oriented visa programs \nwhich are now on the books, we find them to be wrongly implemented. The \nLabor Department Inspector General has recently found two key programs, \nthe Permanent Labor Certification [PLC] program and the Temporary Labor \nCondition Application [LCA] program to be approaching a ``sham.'' These \nprograms, allowing a combined ceiling of some 200,000 worker entry \nvisas per year, were designed to bring in workers for jobs that could \nnot be filled by Americans, allowing us to hire the best and the \nbrightest in the international labor market so Americans can remain \ncompetitive in the world economy. But instead of protecting American \nworkers' jobs and wages, the real result has been to simply displace \nqualified American workers for essentially middle level jobs, and the \nLabor Department report recommends the programs be abolished.\n  Fourth, there is solid evidence that some immigrants come to the \nUnited States to participate in the welfare state, or do so because of \na failure to find a job in their own land. This bill, S. 1664, attempts \nto address this issue through strict, new, deportation rules aimed at \nany immigrant that becomes a ``public charge,'' and I commend the \ncommittee for that initiative. However, these new public charge \nregulations will have no affect unless we aggressively work to actually \ndeport such individuals. Implementation of similar legal provisions in \nthe past has been disappointing, and a renewed attempt is clearly \nneeded.\n  The pattern of immigration since 1965 has unfortunately shifted to \nless skilled workers than was the case in earlier decades and, in the \n1980's a large majority of immigrants came from the developing world, \nparticularly Latin America and Asia. Surely it should not be taboo to \nconsider whether the great numbers of developing world cultural groups \ncan actually provide the skills needed for the current U.S. job market. \nAre these prevalent immigrant groups going to strengthen our Nation \nwith their skills or weaken it because of their needs? That should be \nthe question we ask when we write such law. The wave of immigrants is \narriving as a result of policy we write in the Congress and, therefore, \nI suggest we are obliged to commission ongoing evaluations of the \nprocess and success of immigrant assimilation into American society. \nAny ethnic and national mix caused by our immigration laws should be \nthe result of conscious, deliberate policy embodied in the laws we \nconsider here on this floor, not of accident or politics or a \ndisinclination to take on sensitive groups or issues.\n  Finally, I suggest we need to be consistent in our approach to the \ngrowing and complex problems associated with immigration. We cannot \ncomplain about the changing ethnic mix of immigrants, on the one hand, \nand then exploit such people for cheap labor, on the other. We need to \nassume responsibility for the results of our immigration policies, \nevaluate them on an ongoing basis, and take the legislative steps to \nchange what we do not favor. Let us for once attempt to remove \nhypocrisy and political correctness from this issue, and face the \nrealities squarely and responsibly. If we feel the ethnic mix is \nbecoming unbalanced and the number of immigrants is too high, for the \nsake of our survival as a Nation, we must take the difficult but \nnecessary steps to correct the situation. As the 1994 U.S. Commission \non Immigration Reform, chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, stated in \nits report on page 1, ``we disagree with those who would label efforts \nto control immigration as being inherently anti-immigrant. Rather, it \nis both a right and a responsibility of a democratic society to manage \nimmigration so that it serves the national interest.''\n  As the Jordan Commission pointed out, we need to address legal \nimmigration as well as illegal, and we need to install an enforcement \nsystem that makes it far harder to overstay visas. I hope we can get a \ntime certain to consider S. 1665, on legal immigration and find a way \nto engage the other body on that matter.\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

This bill is the culmination \nof 17 years of work. It is interesting for me, as Senator Ted Kennedy \nand I were both on the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee \nPolicy 17 years ago. With this bill, we have brought to fruition most \nof the things that Father Ted Hesburgh and that commission suggested to \nus then. We have also taken welcome direction from the U.S. Commission \non Immigration Reform, and the late Barbara Jordan, who chaired that \nbody. I think with what we have done in this bill, the recommendations \nof those Commissions--instead of remaining as studies which stayed on \nthe shelf--have become sweeping measures to control illegal \nimmigration. This bill is truly sweeping.\n  I want to thank Ted Kennedy. Senator Kennedy has worked with me and \nhas helped me over quite a few hurdles. He chaired the Subcommittee on \nImmigration before I came to the Senate. After the Republicans became \nthe majority party in 1980, I chaired it. There were times when we \ndisagreed, but we were never disagreeable. He is a very special friend \nand a remarkable legislator of the first order.\n  I also want to thank Senator Bob Dole, who has consistently arranged \nso that we could go forward with this important legislation. I \npersonally appreciate not only his leadership, but his friendship. \nServing as the assistant Republican leader--his assistant--for 10 years \nwas one of my greatest honors and privileges.\n  I must also thank my staff. My staff includes Dick Day--the \n``Reverend'' Day, I call him. He is not a Reverend, but he should have \nsainthood. Back in Cody, WY, I told him, I have an issue of disaster, \none filled with guilt and racism, and I will be called everything in \nthe book, but I need somebody to move to Washington to help me and love \nme and help me along. Well, he did that. He has lost 5 pounds within \nthe last 13 days. I want to thank Charles Wood, who was been with me \nvia Harvard and Berkeley and who is willing to hang in there late at \nnight; John Ratigan, who has come to my staff from the State Department \nwith his wealth of knowledge; John Knepper, a wonderful, bright young \nman from Wyoming, a very able person to assist me in these matters; \nTrudy Settles has been a wonderful addition to our staff; and I must \nalso thank Kristel DeMay, Maureen McCafferty, and Uzma Ahmad--some our \nmarvelous interns at the Subcommittee on Immigration. I also want to \nthank Ted Kennedy's staff, including Michael Myers; he and Dick Day \nwork together without any kind of partisanship or things that set them \napart in that way. Then there are Patty First, Bill Fleming, Ron Weich, \nand Tom Perez--all of whom have been a great help in moving this bill \nthrough the Senate. There have also been so many staff for so many \nSenators who have worked so diligently on this issue.\n  I must say that we have completed 51 hours and 45 minutes on this \npiece of legislation over 8 days--although that 51 hours 45 minutes \nwould have been considerably shortened without the minimum wage \nactivities of Senator Kennedy. Nevertheless, he may have actually saved \nus a great deal of time because when we went into the cloture, with its \nparliamentary limitation of germaneness, we were saved a great deal of \ntime on some very controversial amendments. I do not want to give him \ntoo much credit, though, because I am sure we will be trying to undo \nhim in a few hours.\n  Do not go home and analyze the votes of each Senator, though, because \nyou will never be able to explain them. Every Senator's staff is \nwondering why he voted this way or that. This immigration issue is \nabout America, and America is about conflict and resolution. It is \ndebate about these issue that pull and tear at our hearts, and that is \nwhat makes us the country we are--the most magnificent country on this \nbright earth.\n  This debate is the essence of America--passion, conflict, \ncontroversy, all the rest of it. It has been an exceedingly pleasant \nexperience. I mean that. I love the work. I wish Senator Kennedy well \nas he proceeds forward with it in the years to come. I will be \nobserving from my future teaching post at Harvard, being assured that \nhe is\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\ndoing it correctly. I thank my colleagues. I thank those on the floor. \nI thank my former co-assistant leader, Senator Ford. He helps me when \nhe can and vexes me whenever he has the opportunity. Yet, I had come to \nenjoy him thoroughly in my work when we served together as assistant \nleaders of our parties. He did not care what I did, as long as we did \nnot do anything with the motor voter law. That was easy to accomplish.\n  David Pryor, who sits here, is a friend who came with me to this \nplace. Bill Bradley and I have a great friendship, and we will go on \nand do other things, and while the rest of you will be here to do the \nwork. As I look around the Chamber--I do not intend to address all the \nMembers here, but I see my colleague from Montana, who is a very \nspecial, wonderful and earthy friend. Then there is Bob Dole, who is, I \nthink, a most remarkable leader for this body--and perhaps other \nplaces, too.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the vote that was just taken, 97 to 3, I \nthink, says it all. The U.S. Senate has been debating this issue for 8 \ndays. It has been closely divided on a number of different issues. But \nI feel that most of the Members, or virtually all of the Members, feel \nthat their views were given an opportunity to be presented and to be \nexamined and to be considered and to be voted on. And the final outcome \nof this is 97 to 3. It is really an extraordinary personal achievement \nand accomplishment by my friend and colleague, the Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Simpson.\n  Al Simpson and I have been friends for many years. Although we have \nsome differences, we have a deep sense of mutual respect and \nfriendship, which has been valuable to certainly me and, I think, to \nhim. Why a Senator from Wyoming would be willing to take on this issue \non immigration has always been extraordinary and interesting to me. \nThis is not a burning issue in his particular State.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, they still remember the bitter whip of \nthe national origin quota system that divided groups and communities on \nthe basis of where one was born. Senators from the western part of the \ncountry remember the Asian Pacific triangle that discriminated on the \nbasis of race and discriminated against Asians up until 1965. And in \nmany parts of the country, in between, there are communities and \nfamilies who have cared very deeply about this.\n  Senator Simpson has seen the importance of this issue as a national \nissue and an issue for the country. This issue, as he has described it, \ninvolves so many different aspects of human emotions of passion, and \ndiscrimination, and reunification of families, and exploitation, and he \nhas taken this on as a member of the Hesburgh Commission for Legal and \nIllegal Immigration, as a key figure.\n  We passed the Refugee Act in 1980, and then in 1986, and in 1990, and \nnow again, to deal with something, which is of very important concern \nto all Americans, and that is the whole question of the illegals that \ncome to this country.\n  This legislation, I think, will be extremely important and, I \nbelieve, effective in stemming the tide of illegals, not just because \nof the expansion of the border patrols, although that will have some \neffect, and not just because of the increased penalties in smuggling, \nas all that will have an effect; it will have an important impact in \nhelping American workers get jobs and be able to hold them and have the \nenhanced opportunity for employment.\n  That, I think, is very, very important as well. But most of all I \nwant to pay my respects to Senator Simpson for his dedication and focus \non this issue. If this issue had come up over a year ago, after the \n1994 campaign, when the flames of distrust and anger were being fanned \nin many parts of the country, we would not have had this \nlegislation. It has only been because of the exhaustive time that the \nSenator has taken with each and every Member, Republican and Democrat, \nin the Judiciary Committee and talking to each of the various groups \nthat have a particular interest that we have gotten to this point, and \nhis willingness to listen to the recommendations of Barbara Jordan. I \nthought of Barbara Jordan when I heard that last rollcall because this \nwas an issue which Barbara Jordan, a distinguished lady and an \noutstanding congresswoman, that struck the conscience of the Nation on \nmany different occasions, and tireless in her own pursuit of justice \nand the elimination of forms of discrimination. She took on an \nenormously challenging task when few others would touch it, and in \nworking through, made a series of recommendations. That has been the \nbasis of this particular proposal.\n\n  So I give respect to my chairman, the chairman for the remainder of \nthis session. I think all of us who know the importance of this issue \nwill know that Alan Simpson has played an extremely important role, \naddressing in a serious way, bringing judgment, conscience, \nconsideration, and intelligence to this issue. I think this country is \nbetter served by his service.\n  I want to mention just briefly, Mr. President, other members of our \ncommittee: Senator Simon. Senator Simon, I, and Senator Simpson for a \nbrief period were the only three members of the Immigration Committee. \nHe has been a steady contributor and has an unwavering commitment to \nfairness which has marked his career.\n  Senator Feinstein, for her own integrity and effectiveness in dealing \nwith our immigration laws; Senator Grassley; Senator Kyl; Senator \nSpecter--all active on the subcommittee.\n  My colleague, Senator Biden, Senator Feingold, Senator Abraham, and \nSenator DeWine are deeply committed to our immigrant heritage and made \nmajor contributions to legal immigration and effectively in relation to \nillegal reforms.\n  Senator Hatch, who is chairman of our Judiciary Committee, has long \nbeen involved in the human side of immigration and has handled lengthy \nand contentious markups with fairness. We had very extensive markups \nwith broad attendance--virtually unanimous attendance--and he presided \nover them with fairness;\n  Senator Graham, who has presented the case for a safety net for legal \nimmigrants and the need to avoid the unfunded mandates, as well as \nSenator Chafee and Senator Leahy on those issues of asylum. That has \nbeen a matter of particular interest and concern to him. He has been \nvery effective on this bill on that.\n  Finally, I want to mention Michael Myers, who has been of such value \nand help, I believe, to the Senate and to the country, as our other \nstaff have, with Democrats and Republicans. I think all of us perhaps--\nmaybe there are those; I do not--but there are those who underestimate \nthe power of good will and intelligence of those who provide such \nassistance to all of us and make our jobs easier. Michael Myers has \nbeen there:\n  Patti Frist, Tom Perez, Bill Fleming, Melody Barnes, Ron Weich, \nMichael Mershon; and I think that we on our side have felt that the \nRepublican staff, Dick Day, Chip Wood, John Knepper, John Ratigan, and \nChuck Blahous have also been not only working for Republicans but \nDemocrats alike.\n  Carlos Angulo, who has been working with Senator Simon; Leeci Eve \nwith Senator Biden, and Bruce Cohen for Senator Leahy; all of those and \nothers have been of great help.\n  Finally, I want to thank Tom Daschle as well, who as we were going \nthrough different times and phases of the consideration of this \nlegislation and different aspects of it, has been a constant source of \nstrength to me and the other members of the committee.\n  We look forward to the conference, and we will do our very best to \nbring back to the Senate a conference that carries forward the \ncommitments of the Senate to the extent that we possibly can. This is a \nbill that deserves to be signed by the President of the United States.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the order of \nthe day?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, if I may--if the Senator will yield for a \nmoment to let me propose a unanimous-consent request, and then the \nSenator from Montana may proceed.\n  I just want to add one note. I failed to pay tribute to Chuck \nBlahous. He has not been part of the immigration staff, but he is my \nlegislative director, and was he pressed into service on this bill in a \nmost extraordinary way.\n  I, too, thank my colleagues on the subcommittee: Senator Kennedy, of \ncourse; Senator Simon, a steady friend\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nfor 25 years; Senator Feinstein; Senator Grassley, who is always there, \nalways steady, always someone to count on; Senator Kyl, who will leave \na great impression and mark, along with Senator Feinstein, on this \nsubcommittee in the future; Senator Specter and his steadiness; Bill \nRoth, my old steady friend who campaigned for me back when it was not \nsafe to do that. I see him here. I thank him for his work.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the honorable majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first, let me congratulate my colleagues, \nSenator Simpson and Senator Kennedy, for completing action on what I \nconsider to be a very good bipartisan immigration bill. It took 8 days. \nWe had it scheduled for 3. So we have lost a little time. But I think \nthe end product is probably worth it, and we hope to make up the time \nin the next few weeks on other matters.\n  Mr. President, we have before us an issue of great national \nimportance--reform of this Nation's laws on illegal immigration. But \nwhile many Members have worked hard to move this issue forward, let's \nface it: The moving force has been my colleague and friend, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming--Senator Simpson. There are so many ways to describe how \nhe has served America, but I believe that his work in this area will \nalways be at the top of the list.\n  Illegal immigration reform is not a partisan issue. It is not a \nsimple issue.\n  But make no mistake about it, this legislation is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, we are a nation justly proud of our heritage. That \nheritage is inseparable from the human experience of millions upon \nmillions of immigrants--from every country on Earth.\n  That heritage is also bound up in a reverence for the rule of law--\nfor playing by the rules.\n  The Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act combines \nboth of these strands of our national character.\n  We cannot remain a great country and fail to control our borders.\n  We cannot evade one of the principal obligations of the Federal \nGovernment and expect the States and local communities to pick up the \ntab.\n  We cannot reward those who break our laws by picking the pockets of \nhardworking Americans.\n  In short, Mr. President, we are proud that our country is a nation of \nimmigrants and a land of opportunity--but we will insist that everyone \nplay by the rules.\n  The legislation before us provides for increases in the numbers of \nenforcement personnel and creates additional detention facilities. \nPerhaps most important, it provides for the first time some realistic \nhope that our Border Patrol can cope with the overwhelming nature of \nillegal immigration by increasing the numbers of agents.\n  The bill, however, also recognizes that fully half of the illegals \ncurrently in this country were once here legally under a visa, but then \nsimply stayed. This is not a problem that can be addressed by fences \nalong the border--this is a matter of the will to enforce our laws.\n  Visa overstayers are here now--when we discover who they are they \nshould be sent on their way.\n  The bill also provides strong measures for perhaps the ultimate \ninsult to our national sovereignty. This is the case when those who \nviolate our immigration laws, the violate our criminal laws as well.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate adopted the Dole-Coverdell \namendment which closed some of the loopholes that currently exist in \nour deportation laws.\n  Under the Dole-Coverdell amendment, violations of domestic violence, \nstalking, child abuse laws, and crimes of sexual violence have been \nadded as deportable offenses.\n  It is long past time to stop the vicious acts of stalking, child \nabuse, and sexual abuse. We cannot prevent in every case the often \njustified fear that too often haunts our citizens. But we can make sure \nthat any alien that commits such an act will no longer remain within \nour borders.\n  Mr. President, I salute my colleagues who have worked so hard on this \nlegislation. They have rendered America a great service, and it is my \nhope that a strong, bipartisan vote in favor of this bill will send a \nmessage that America will no longer stand by passively--we will take \ncontrol of our borders. And most of all, Mr. President, we will ensure \nthat no one cuts in line in front of those who play by the rules.\n  So I salute my colleagues who have worked hard on this legislation. \nThey have rendered America a great service. It is my hope that we can \ncome out of the conference with a strong bipartisan bill.\n  I again congratulate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir efforts. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, today the Senate passed much needed \nlegislation to restructure our Nation's laws with respect to illegal \nimmigration. I want to take this opportunity to commend my colleagues \nSenator Simpson and Senator Kennedy for their diligence and leadership \nin crafting legislation to address this issue. As this debate has \nshown, the highly emotional and diverse views on the issues surrounding \nboth legal and illegal immigration makes it very difficult to get a \nconsensus on legislation reforming our immigration laws.\n  Despite previous efforts by Congress to control illegal immigration, \nthe evidence shows that thousands of people cross the border illegally \neach year. Clearly, our Nation simply cannot continue to absorb this \nunregulated stream of illegal aliens. The costs to society of \npermitting a large group of people to live in an illegal, second-class \nstatus are enormous. It strains not only the financial resources of our \nlocal, State and Federal governments, but also the compassion of our \npeople. The Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act will \nhelp ensure that the Federal Government meets it's responsibility to \nenforce our Nation's illegal immigration policies.\n  This legislation nearly doubles the number of Border Patrol agents \nover the next 5 years, authorizes an additional 300 INS investigators, \nincreases criminal penalties for alien smuggling and document fraud, \nand authorizes additional detention facilities for illegal aliens. \nThrough these increased enforcement activities, our Nation will be \nbetter equipped to stem the flow of illegal immigrants across our \nborders and to respond to the problems and abuses which accompany the \npresence of a significant illegal population. For these reasons, I \nvoted in favor of final passage of this legislation.\n  I did so not without some reservations. While I believe in the \nunderlying principles of the legislation, I have serious concerns over \nsome of the provisions agreed to in this bill. I am concerned about the \ncosts and administrative burdens this legislation may impose on the \nStates by the extension of deeming to all Federal means-tested \nassistance programs. Additionally, by failing to exempt some minimal \nemergency and health services from deeming, I am fearful that we will \ndiscourage legal aliens from seeking basic treatments such as \nimmunizations and prenatal care. As we know, this can lead to adverse \neffects to the public health and safety.\n  In addition, the original version of the bill contained provisions \nwhich imposed unwarranted new bars to an individual's ability to seek \npolitical asylum in this country. Due to my concern about these summary \nexclusion procedures, I joined Senator Leahy as a cosponsor of his \namendment to limit the use of summary exclusion except in emergency \nmigration situations.\n  Mr. President, most persons who are fleeing persecution do not have \nthe luxury of asking their governments for appropriate exit papers to \nleave their countries. Many flee without documents. Others flee with \nfraudulent documents. The summary exclusion provisions in the \nunderlying bill had the potential of excluding these people if they \nfailed to convince an INS border officer that they have a credible fear \nof persecution.\n  I can understand the concern that our asylum laws have been abused in \nthe past. But we have taken steps to reform the asylum system. In 1995, \nour asylum system was tightened and adequate resources have been \ninvested to root out these abuses. This effort has been successful; 90 \npercent of claims are now adjudicated within 60 days of their receipt. \nThere has been a drastic decline in new asylum applications, from \n13,000 per month at the end of 1994 to 3,000 per month currently. One \nreason for this is that asylum seekers are\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\nno longer automatically eligible for work authorization. As a result of \nthe reforms, our asylum system now works to ensure that legitimate \nasylum seekers are protected and those who file fraudulent claims are \nweeded out.\n  We have a tradition in this country of protecting bona fide refugees. \nWe have an asylum system that is working well to continue this \ntradition. The provisions included in the underlying bill would have \nundermined our good efforts to the detriment of the very people we are \nseeking to protect. The Leahy amendment appropriately gives the \nAttorney General the flexibility to address emergency migration \nsituations but retains our current asylum procedures for those who \narrive in the United States and request political asylum. I am happy to \nsay that my colleagues in the Senate recognized the importance of \nretaining this flexibility and voted to include this amendment in the \nfinal bill.\n  While I support the general principles underlying this bill, I \nbelieve we must also find new ways to address the problems of illegal \nimmigration. I am among the first to admit that we cannot afford to \nabsorb an unregulated flow of immigrants into our country. However, I \nam concerned by the shortsighted approach that is taken to address this \nproblem. Sometimes we find ourselves so caught up in the crises of the \nday that we forget to look at the root causes of problems. In the case \nof illegal immigration, I think we have fallen into this trap.\n  We can continue to increase our Border Patrol and our enforcement \nactivities in the United States. We can build a wall that stretches \nalong the United States-Mexico border and the United States-Canadian \nborder. While this may make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to \nenter the United States, I do not believe that these measures will \nsolve the problem of illegal immigration. Similarly, we can tighten \nemployer sanctions and cut off all public benefits for illegal aliens, \nin an attempt to take away the ``magnets'' which create the desire for \npeople to enter our country with or without proper documentation.\n  I believe we must look beyond these so-called magnets to focus on \ncreating opportunities for people within their own countries so they \naren't compelled to leave in search of better opportunities to support \ntheir families. To do this, the United States must maintain it's \nleadership in promoting human rights, democracy, and economic stability \nin our neighboring countries, and around the world. Unfortunately, I \nfear that we have recently begun to retreat from this position. In the \npast few years, the United States has curtailed it's spending on \nforeign aid and humanitarian assistance programs. This year, we \nessentially demolished our international family planning program, which \nwill severely affect maternal and child health around the world. \nFurther, we continue to funnel arms into the poorest and most \npolitically unstable countries across the globe.\n  We cannot continue along this path. It is only when we address the \nroot causes of illegal immigration--poverty, warfare, and persecution--\nthat the United States can truly address and eliminate this problem.\n  One final note, Mr. President. In this bill, we have significantly \nenhanced the ability of the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n[INS] to meet one of its primary missions, to control the entry of \nillegal immigrants into this country. But, I would like to take this \nopportunity to remind my colleagues that the enforcement mission is not \nthe only mission of the INS. The INS also exists to serve, to meet the \nneeds of citizens, legal residents, and visitors. It has the \nresponsibility to provide service to millions of individuals and \nemployers who are following the rules, and trying to bring family and \nemployees into the United States legally.\n  Due to the recent national attention that has been given to illegal \nimmigration, I fear that this part of the INS mission statement has \nbeen severely neglected. For example, many district and regional INS \noffices have unreliable phone service, have tremendous backlogs in \npaperwork, and fail to initiate community outreach. My State's district \noffice in Portland, OR, no longer even distributes necessary forms to \nthe public. I had planned to introduce an amendment to this bill which \nwould have addressed this situation. It would have required all INS \ndistrict and regional offices to distribute forms, and would have \nexpressed the Senate's desire that the INS provide adequate resources \nto fulfill its service mission.\n  Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to bring this amendment \nto the floor for consideration on this bill. However, I believe this is \nan issue of utmost importance and will continue to pursue enhancing the \nINS's service mission through subsequent legislation or through \ncommunications with Commissioner Doris Meissner. Citizens, permanent \nresidents, and visitors across the country need, and deserve, to have \naccess to the services only the INS can provide for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4610-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, the American people are baffled by the \ncontinuing, relentless, Republican opposition to a fair increase in the \nminimum wage. A raise of 90 cents an hour for America's lowest paid and \nhardest-pressed workers is so fundamentally fair and reasonable that it \nis hard to imagine why anyone would oppose it.\n  Our Republican friends are hoisted by their own hypocrisy. They \npreach the value of work, but they reject a living wage. The minimum \nwage has not been raised in 5 years. It is stuck at $4.25 an hour, \n$8,500 a year--not even enough to lift a family out of poverty.\n  There is even more hypocrisy than that. Republican Senators have \nvoted for three pay raises themselves in that 5-year period--thousands \nof dollars for themselves, but not one dime for families struggling to \nsurvive on the minimum wage.\n  Senator Dole has compiled, to put it mildly, an interesting voting \nrecord on the minimum wage during his career in Congress. His position \nappears to depend on the fads of politics, or perhaps the phases of the \nMoon. The only consistency is that there is no consistency.\n  Arriving in Congress as a freshman in the House of Representatives in \n1961, he took an extreme antiminimum wage position against President \nKennedy's proposal to raise the minimum wage. At the time, the minimum \nwage had not been increased since 1955. An increase was one of the \nfirst priorities of President Kennedy's New Frontier, and Congress \nresponded quickly and favorably.\n  Tomorrow--Friday, May 3--is the 35th anniversary of Bob Dole's vote \nagainst the bill, which President Kennedy signed into law on May 5, \n1961, and which raised the minimum wage from $1 to $1.25 an hour.\n  In fact, the minimum wage had been one of the key issues in the \nKennedy-Nixon 1960 Presidential campaign. As a Senator in 1960, \nPresident Kennedy had led a battle to raise the minimum wage, but \nCongress failed to act when House-Senate conferees deadlocked in a \npost-convention session in August 1960. President Kennedy then took the \nissue to the country, and in a TV ad that fall opposing Vice President \nNixon's position, he stated:\n\n       Mr. Nixon has said that a $1.25 minimum wage is extreme. \n     That's $50 a week. What's extreme about that? I believe the \n     next Congress and the President should pass a minimum wage \n     for a $1.25 an hour. Americans must be paid enough to live.\n\n  Bob Dole and Richard Nixon were wrong to oppose President Kennedy's \nminimum wage increase 35 years ago--and Bob Dole and Richard Armey are \nwrong to oppose President Clinton's minimum wage increase today.\n  At least once a decade since then, however, Senator Dole has voted \nthe other way and supported an increase in the minimum wage. He did so \nin the 1970's, and again in the 1980's. And I urge him to do so now in \nthe 1990's.\n  Seven years ago, Senator Dole and many of the same Republicans who \nare now leading the opposition to a 90-cent increase in the minimum \nwage supported precisely that--a 90-cent increase.\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\n  Senator Dole supported it. Congressman Newt Gingrich supported it. \nThe Senate voted 89 to 8 in favor of the increase. The House of \nRepresentatives voted 382 to 37 in favor of the increase. In fact, 80 \npercent of the Republicans in Congress in 1989 voted for a 90-cent \nincrease in the minimum wage, and Republican President George Bush \nsigned it into law.\n  In 1989, the minimum wage equaled $3.35 an hour. At that time, after \nadjusting for inflation, it was at its lowest level since 1955. That's \nwhy there was overwhelming bipartisan support for a fair increase.\n  The minimum wage is now $4.25 an hour, but once again, it is nearing \na 40-year low. If Senator Dole and our Republican friends could support \na fair increase in the minimum wage as recently as 1989, when its value \nhad sunk to its lowest point since 1955, why can't they support a fair \nincrease in 1996, when its value is once again reaching its lowest \npoint since 1955?\n  Our Republican friends say, ``Oh dear, we're worried that many of \nthose nice young hard-working men and women will lose their jobs if we \nraise the minimum wage.'' Spare us those crocodile tears. A hundred and \none of the Nation's most respected economists say that raising the \nminimum wage by the 90 cent's I'm proposing won't cause any significant \njob loss. The only real tears that our Republican friends are shedding \nare for business profits, not workers' jobs.\n  In fact, a great deal more evidence is available today about the job \neffect of a minimum wage increase than was available in 1989. Studies \nof the 1989 Federal increase, as well as studies of recent State \nincreases above the Federal level, provide no evidence that these \nincreases have had a significant adverse effect on jobs.\n  Professor Richard Freeman of Harvard University--one of the Nation's \npreeminent economists--concluded in a review of these studies:\n\n       . . . at the level of the minimum wage in the late 1980s, \n     moderate legislated increases did not reduce employment and \n     were, if anything, associated with higher employment in some \n     locales.\n\n  Professor Freeman goes on to say that the fact that ``moderate \nincreases in the minimum wage transferred income to the lower paid \nwithout any apparent adverse effect on employment . . . at the turn of \nthe 1990s is no mean achievement for a policy tool in an era when the \nreal earnings of the less skilled fell sharply.''\n  These studies have convinced the overwhelming majority of leading \neconomists to support a minimum wage increase. In the fall of 1995, 101 \neconomists, as I have mentioned--including three Nobel Prize winners--\nsigned a strong statement of support for a higher minimum wage.\n  Even the Employment Policies Institute Foundation--a think-tank which \nis funded primarily by the restaurant industry and which is vigorously \nopposed to an increase in the minimum wage--was forced to admit in a \npaper by Kevin Lang of Boston University that ``this author can find \nlittle effect on employment levels from changes in the minimum wage.''\n  This strong support from leading economists for a moderate increase \nin the minimum wage was not available in 1989. The quantity of evidence \nof the substantial benefits and the negligible costs of raising the \nminimum wage was not available at that time. And yet, Senator Dole, \nSpeaker Gingrich and many other Republicans who are leading the \nopposition to a higher minimum wage today were still able to vote for a \nminimum wage increase in 1989.\n  Some opponents of an increase today argue that the 1989 increase was \nmore acceptable because it set a lower minimum wage for teenagers \nworking at their first jobs. The 1989 legislation included a so-called \ntraining wage which expired in 1993. It permitted employers to pay \nteenage workers 85 percent of the minimum wage for up to 90 days.\n  But again, we know now what we did not know in 1989--the youth \nsubminimum wage was a failure. The Labor Department submitted a study \nto Congress in 1993 summarizing three surveys which found that very few \nemployers actually used the subminimum wage. In the 27 States where \nState law allowed employers to pay a subminimum wage, not more than 5 \npercent of employers chose to use it.\n  Employers did not like the youth subminimum wage, and they did not \nuse it. They did not use it because they could not find workers willing \nto work for that low a wage. Also, employers did not want two workers, \nside-by-side doing the same job, with one paid less because he or she \nwas younger than the other.\n  The youth subminimum provision cannot explain the change of heart of \nthose in Congress who supported a minimum wage increase in 1989 but \noppose it today.\n  Issues do not get any clearer than this. More than 80 percent of all \nAmericans support an increase in the minimum wage. In every segment of \nour society and every region of the country, a large majority of \nAmericans want a fair increase in the minimum wage.\n  It is easy to understand why raising the minimum wage has such broad \nsupport among the American people. You don't have to be a rocket \nscientist to understand this issue, because it is an issue of \nfundamental fairness. One of the major challenges of 1996 is the \neconomic insecurity facing the vast majority of families. Americans are \nworking harder and earning less. They hear the talk about prosperity, \nbut they do not see it in their lives. Millions of families feel left \nout and left behind, and those at the bottom of the ladder are being \nleft the farthest behind.\n  A simple vote in the Senate can change all that. Our message is \nclear--raise the minimum wage.\n  The economic evidence supports an increase in the minimum wage. The \nAmerican people support an increase in the minimum wage. A majority in \nthe Senate and the House support an increase in the minimum. The time \nhas come for an up-or-down, yes-or-no vote on increasing the minimum \nwage.\n  Let the Senate vote. Raise the minimum wage. No one who works for a \nliving should have to live in poverty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4614-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY UNITED STATES? HERE'S THE WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports, \nfor the week ending April 26, that the United States imported 8,052,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 10,000 barrels less than the 8,062,000 barrels \nimported during the same period a year ago. This is one of those rare \nweeks when less oil was imported in 1996 than for the same week in \n1995.\n  In any case, Americans now rely on foreign oil for more than 50 \npercent of their needs, and there are no signs that the upward trend \nwill abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained \nabout 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the \nArab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 \npercent of America's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply, or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the United States--now 8,052,000 barrels a \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4615-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4615-S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                POLISH-GEORGIAN CREDIT UNION PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to bring to \nthe Senate's attention an exciting movement which is currently under \nway in Poland. It is a movement to create and develop credit unions for \nthe benefit of Polish citizens.\n  A unique partnership now exists between the Polish National \nAssociation of Cooperative Savings and Credit Unions and the Georgia \nCredit Union Affiliates. Georgia-based credit unions will provide \nassistance in the development and implementation of new credit union \nservices and products for the benefit of Polish credit union members. \nThis relationship provides the opportunity for the exchange of \ninformation, experience, and expertise which is critical to the \nformation of sound financial institutions.\n  Many Polish citizens now enjoy some of the same benefits of credit \nunion membership that many here in America have long taken for granted. \nOne of the more important benefits is the ability to play a role in the \nappointment of the credit union's officers through direct election. \nThis democratic function instills greater confidence and trust in the \ncredit union by\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\ninsuring that its officers are responsive to the members' concerns and \ninterests. It also provides hands-on experience in local democratic \ninstitutions, which are the building blocks of strong national \ndemocracies.\n  Along with the personal benefits associated with credit union \nmembership comes the more important collective benefit of capital \nformation. Financial institutions such as banks and credit unions have \nalways served an important function in providing capital for new \nbusinesses and in turn economic growth. This is based on the \nfundamental relationship between savings and investment. Greater \nindividual savings leads to greater business investment. This \ninvestment leads to more productivity and greater competitiveness, and \nwe know that greater competitiveness means better jobs and higher \nstandards of living. The bottom line is that a critical component to \nPoland's prospects for long-term economic development and growth must \nbe the assurance that all Polish citizens have access to sound \nfinancial institutions for their hard earned savings and that these \ninstitutions serve their communities well.\n  I applaud the ongoing efforts to build and strengthen Poland's \nprivate financial institutions. In particular, I want to recognize \nGrzegorz Bierecki who has been instrumental in the development of the \ncredit union movement in Poland. I also want to thank Mike Mercer, \npresident of the Georgia Credit Union Affiliates, for bringing this \nmatter to my attention. I believe this movement is worthy of the \nSenate's attention and support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4615-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF BERNICE HARRIS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is a sad day in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mrs. Bernice Harris, a loyal and hard-working employee in the Russell \nCoffee Shop, leaves the Senate today after more than three decades of \ndedicated service.\n  In a body which is divided on many issues, it is safe to say there is \ntotal agreement on Bernice.\n  Bernice made the Senate, and in particular the Russell Building, a \nbetter place in which to work. Each morning, we could count on seeing \nBernice's smiling face and her friendly greeting, undoubtedly helping \nus get through a hectic day.\n  We will all miss Bernice's unflinching good cheer as well as her \nunique outlook on life. Bernice has such a wonderful perspective that \nshe never failed to improve my day and many days of many others in the \nSenate community.\n  So although it's a sad day in the Senate, it is a happy day in the \nhouse--the household of Bernice Harris. It is hard for me to relate how \nmuch we will miss Bernice. I am sure my colleagues will join with me in \nwishing Bernice well for her much-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4616-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the purposes of \ncarrying out the activities of the State Justice Institute for fiscal \nyears 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the state justice institute reauthorization act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nnot only for myself, but for Senator Heflin, the ranking minority \nmember of the Court Subcommittee of Judiciary, and for Senator Gregg.\n  This legislation would reauthorize the State Justice Institute [SJI] \nfor 4 more years through fiscal year 2000. Congress originally \nauthorized the State Justice Institute for 4 years in the State Justice \nInstitute Act of 1984, then reauthorized it for 4 more years in 1988, \nand another 4 years in 1992. The bill I introduce today will authorize \nannual appropriations for this program of $20 million each of those 4 \nyears.\n  The requested authorization levels will enable the State Justice \nInstitute to fully carry out its statutory mission to award grants, to \nimprove the quality of justice in State courts throughout the 50 States \nof our Nation.\n  The State Justice Institute serves critically important Federal \npurposes. Just as Federal financial assistance to State and local \npolice, prosecutors, and corrections is critically needed to help them \ncontrol crime, it is equally imperative that Federal funds assist the \nState courts that decide 98 percent of the criminal cases brought in \nthis country.\n  SJI plays an important role in the Nation's response to crime by \nproviding the critically needed funding to support projects that \nevaluate the effectiveness of new trial and sentencing approaches, \nand improve judges, performance in cases involving violent crimes and \ndrug abuse.\n\n  The Institute also has been a leader in fostering improvements in the \ncivil justice system by supporting efforts to evaluate innovative \nprocedures to reduce litigation delay, demonstrate innovative \nalternative dispute resolution programs, and increase the public's \naccess to the legal system. In addition, the Institute has devoted \nconsiderable resources to improving the public's confidence in both the \ncriminal and civil justice system.\n  The list of the Institute's current grant priorities reveals just how \nimportant it is to our overwhelmed State court system. The Institute's \n1996 grants will focus on: children and families in court; improving \npublic confidence in the courts; application of technology; education \nand training for judges and key court personnel; the relationship \nbetween State and Federal courts; and projects following up on recent \nInstitute-supported conferences on court-community collaboration, drug \ncourts, funding the courts, and eliminating race and ethnic bias in the \ncourts.\n  Mr. President, the Institute has performed the mission Congress \nassigned it exceedingly well. The judges and court staff who toil in \nour Nation's underfunded and outmoded State courthouses commend the \nInstitute as the only national source of support for innovation, \neducation, and information about how other States are coping with \nsimilar problems in their struggle to better serve the public.\n  The Institute is the only vehicle the Federal Government has to \nassure that State courts deliver a high quality of justice to every \ncitizen in every type of case. By doing so, the Institute fulfills the \nhighest standards of federalism. Its seed money bears fruit across the \ncountry, carrying out SJI's important national purposes in a cost-\nefficient manner that maximizes the impact of every dollar that \nCongress provides.\n  Reduced to its core, that is State Justice Institute's special role: \nSupporting promising innovations and spreading the word about them to \nevery key State--and Federal--judge and court official. That saves \nState and Federal governments significant money, time, and effort on a \nnational scale.\n  The bill also specifies that funds appropriated to the Institute are \navailable until expended, without regard to the expiration of the year \nin which they were appropriated, and proposes three technical \namendments to the State Justice Institute Act.\n  Mr. President, as chair of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, which has oversight authority \nover SJI, I am pleased to note that the cosponsor of this bill is the \nranking member of that subcommittee, senator Heflin. We urge the Senate \nto continue its support of the Institute in order to enhance the State \ncourts' ability to deliver effective justice in areas that are \ncritically important to the Federal Government and the American public.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1721\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the legislation \nSenator Grassley is introducing today to reauthorize the State Justice \nInstitute for another 4 years.\n  I was the original sponsor of the State Justice Institute Act when \nCongress first passed the act in 1984, and when it reauthorized SJI in \n1988 and 1992.\n  The State Justice Institute has proven to be a uniquely valuable \ncomponent of the Nation's justice system. Among all the agencies in the \nFederal Government, SJI is the only organization dedicated to helping \nthe State courts of our Nation. Mr. President, those counts handle well \nover 95 percent of all the criminal prosecutions and civil litigation \nbrought in this country.\n  No one State can provide the funds for innovation that SJI can, and \nno State has the ability, the money, or, in fact, the reason to share \nits good ideas with every other State. That's the role SJI plays, and \nit has worked very well with the very modest appropriations Congress \nhas provided over the years.\n  Congress has entrusted the decision about what innovations merit SJI \nsupport to a board of directors composed--by statute--of State supreme \ncourt justices, appellate and trial judges, court administrators, and \nmembers of the public, all of whom who are keenly aware of the real \nproblems in our courts and dedicated to assuring that SJI target its \nfunds at the courts' most serious problems nationwide.\n  In this era of Federal fiscal responsibility and restored political \nbalance between Federal and State governments, this small, economical \ninstitute that is governed largely by State officials may be an \nexcellent working model for any Federal grant program that serves \nimportant national purposes.\n  At a time when every segment of American society is demanding a more \neffective justice system, Congress must keep alive the only Federal \nentity that is dedicated to helping the State courts of this country \nmanage an overwhelming torrent of cases with greater effectiveness, \nefficiency, and justice.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Grassley in sponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n       By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1722.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Working \nFamilies Economic Security Act of 1996. This legislation is an effort \nto bring together in one comprehensive bill a number of items that have \nbeen on my legislative agenda for working families over the years, \nalong with a number of new ideas, and to move forward on them in this \nCongress. It does not address every issue vital to the economic \nprosperity of American families; it does not pretend to. It is simply \none more way of ensuring that bread-and-butter economic issues, which \nare so important to people in my State and throughout the country, are \nbrought back front-and-center to the attention of this Congress, which \nhas so far all but ignored them. Passing this omnibus legislation would \nbe a good step toward protecting the working people who are the \nbackbone of our economic, political and social system. This bill \ncontributes significantly to efforts within the Democratic caucus in \nthe Senate on improving the paycheck security, health security, and \nretirement security of all Americans.\n  The very real and historic changes that have rocked the American \neconomy have helped some Americans, but have done great harm to many \nothers. While some of the statistics that we use to measure the \nperformance of the economy and to gauge the standard of living seem to \nshow that the U.S. economy is doing well, the reality for many is that \ngood-paying jobs are being lost in the face of unprecedented downsizing \nby many firms. Many of the new jobs that are being created pay lower \nwages; corporate executives' salaries are rising, while workers' \nsalaries are declining; the health insurance system is inadequate to \nthe tasks of the modern workplace. There is deep apprehension and \nconcern about the future.\n  Let me give just one recent example from Minnesota. I visited during \nthe recess with members of the Cusick family in Duluth about their \neconomic worries. A life-long resident of Duluth, Ken Cusick will \ngraduate this Spring from the University of Minnesota-Duluth. He has \nthree kids and a wife who works, and yet they struggle every day. They \nworry about having money to pay for groceries, day care costs for their \nkids, and rising education costs.\n  Their lives reflect a broader reality in our country. Underneath the \nnumbers which reflect record highs in the stock market, low \nunemployment, and slow growth in the economy, a time bomb is ticking \nfor American families. Many workers are in fact being left behind, with \nonly dim hope for a brighter future. They are working more and earning \nless. And even though some Clinton administration economic advisers \nhave begun to highlight certain positive economic news, including in a \nreport last week that challenges certain assumptions about lay-offs and \njobs in the economy, I agree with Labor Secretary Reich: it is still \ntrue that for many, especially low and moderate income working people, \nthe economic recovery is spotty, partial, and has failed to increase \ntheir real take-home pay.\n  Many working families today are afraid. Workers fear losing their \njobs, having no money for retraining, losing their pensions and health \ncare, not being able to take care of aging parents, and paying for \ntheir kids' college. And they are angry that their wages are stagnant \nwhile corporate executives--even those who may be failing in their \njobs--reap windfall salaries for downsizing their firms, and putting \ngood people out of work.\n  Twenty years ago the typical CEO of a large company earned 30 or 40 \ntimes the salary of an average worker. Today that CEO earns almost 200 \ntimes more. A recent survey of American CEOs reported in the New York \nTimes indicates that CEO compensation last year rose at the fastest \nrate since the mid-1980's, skyrocketing by 31 percent in 1995 alone. \nThis increase was double the rise in 1994, and triple the one in 1993. \nThis illustrates a larger societal trend that is spinning out of \ncontrol: the vast majority of the economic gains in today's economy are \ngoing to the very wealthy few, while working men and women are being \nshort-changed.\n  For example, from WWII until the 1970's, American workers were \nresponsible for an almost 90 percent increase in productivity. In \nreturn, their real wages increased by over 95 percent. But from 1973 to \n1982, workers got only half as much of an increase in real wages as \nthey gave in new productivity. And from 1982 through 1994, they got \nonly a third as much.\n  This legislation addresses a number of basic economic concerns of the \naverage American. It includes an increase in the minimum wage; a means \nto directly address government subsidization of growing wage \ndisparities, protections for striking workers, a streamlining and \nexpansion of job retraining, and modest health care portability \nreforms. It embodies a number of initiatives that I've worked on over \nthe years, as well as some new ideas that I think must be part of an \neconomic program to provide real economic security for America's \nfamilies. I know this Congress won't act on all these initiatives, but \nI hope we will act on some this year. Those which remain may have to \nwait for a new Congress to be elected, controlled by a Democratic Party \nwhich considers the interests of working Americans priority one.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  This provision would raise the Federal minimum wage from the current \n$4.25 to $5.15 by 1997. But unlike some other approaches, it proposes \nto index the minimum wage to prevent its erosion by inflation or by \nlong periods of Congressional inaction to the point where it is no \nlonger possible for minimum wage workers to lift themselves or their \nfamilies out of poverty. This measure provides for modest but overdue \nincreases and, most important, begins to narrow the gap between the \nminimum wage and a living wage. I am\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\npleased that we are now moving forward on the minimum wage, and I \nintend to push it forward with Senator Kennedy and others until it's \nenacted. So far, we've been blocked from even getting a clean, up-or-\ndown vote on raising the minimum wage, but that can't be blocked \nforever. Sooner or later, democracy must rule, and we will get a vote.\n\n  It is unacceptable that today an American who works full-time, year \nround at the minimum wage--even with the expanded earned income tax \ncredit--does not earn enough to bring a family of three above the \npoverty line. At $4.25 an hour, a person working 40 hours a week at the \nminimum wage earns just $170 a week--before taxes and Social Security \nare deducted.\n  The current Federal poverty line for a family of four is about \n$15,500. Even with the tax credits available to them under current law, \nand food stamps, a family with one worker at the minimum wage would end \nup about $900 below the poverty line. But at $5.15 an hour, this same \nfamily would--when you factor in the earned income tax credit and a \nfood stamp benefit--be lifted above officially defined poverty levels. \nThis 90-cent increase would literally lift them above the line. For \npeople like 26-year-old Mike Kochevar, a single dad living in Hibbing \nwhile he attends the Hibbing Community College, raising the minimum \nwage even modestly would be a big help. He works two jobs, and is \nstruggling to make it.\n  What would such an increase mean for these workers, in practical \nterms, in their daily lives? It would mean an extra $1,800 or so in \ntheir pocket, for one thing. And that means more than 7 months of \ngroceries, or rent and mortgage payments for a few months, or a full \nyear of health care costs, or a season of heating bills in my State.\n  I know that minimum wage opponents will make the same dire \npredictions of job loss and damage to the economy that have been made \nevery time the minimum wage has been increased since 1938. But the \ntextbook economic theory that increases in the minimum wage result in \nlarge job losses has never had solid empirical support. Recent studies \nby leading economists who examined the results of the most recent \nincreases in both State and Federal minimum wages have concluded \notherwise. I was sent to Washington to be on the side of hardworking \nMinnesotans who are struggling to make ends meet. That's why I am \npushing this so hard, and why I intend to push it until it's enacted \ninto law.\n\n\n                             Income Equity\n\n  As I have already noted, in recent years there has been a growing \nwage gap between senior corporate executives and their employees. What \nis more remarkable is that the Federal Government helps to subsidize \nthis disparity by allowing corporations to deduct these fantastic \nsalaries. Current law prevents employer deductions for employee \nsalaries over a million dollars, with an exception for performance-\nbased pay. I believe it is unfair for employers to deduct the first \nmillion dollars of the huge and growing salaries of corporate \nexecutives, while the real wages of workers are declining. This \nprovision is a modest proposal; it is meant to ensure that the United \nStates is not subsidizing gross wage disparities through the Tax Code, \nby barring employers from writing off that portion of salaries above \nthe ratio set in the bill. Specifically, it would prohibit employers \nfrom deducting employee compensation--salaries, wages and bonuses--that \nare more than 25 times higher than the salary of their lowest paid \nworker.\n\n\n                    Protections for Striking Workers\n\n  This legislation is needed to protect American workers who go out on \nstrike. There are two central principles of American labor law: workers \nhave a right to organize without being retaliated against for \nexercising that right. And they have a right to negotiate wages, \nbenefits and other items through collective bargaining. Since the \n1980's, these rights have been seriously jeopardized, with the use of \npermanent replacements for striking workers increasing dramatically. \nEmployers often use the permanent replacement of striking workers--or \nthreat of their use--to undermine collective bargaining agreements, and \nbring in new employees. Mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, \nand the rise of a new breed of employers focused solely on short-term \nprofits has created a new climate for labor-management relations, in \nwhich workers are considered by some to be expendable, and negotiated \nagreements subject to arbitrary and one-sided suspension.\n  Under current law, while employers may not fire employees for \nengaging in a legal economic strike, they may permanently replace \nstriking workers; a distinction only a lawyer could love. This \nprovision would bar the hiring of permanent replacements for striking \nworkers. Recent strikes where employers have hired permanent \nreplacements for striking workers, or have threatened to, underscore \nthe urgent need for this change. Without it, the right to strike is \nnothing more than a right to be fired. A related provision would \nrequire the timely mediation or arbitration of initial contract \nnegotiation disputes, to prevent employers from refusing to negotiate \nfirst contracts with a duly-elected bargaining unit.\n  Under my legislation, employers would be compelled to negotiate in \ngood faith with a new bargaining unit. This measure would provide that, \nif within 60 days of bargaining unit certification a first contract is \nnot agreed to, the parties would enter into negotiations with the help \nof a mediator. If within 30 days the mediator could not bring the two \nsides to agreement, the contract would go to binding arbitration.\n  Those provisions of this bill that I've outlined go a long way toward \nprotecting people in their current jobs, and bolstering their wages. \nBut we must also address the concerns American workers have about their \nfutures.\n\n\n                           Lifelong Learning\n\n  We in Congress have a responsibility to help American workers plan \nand improve their futures. To prepare our work force for future jobs. \nAnd to provide some security while people are in transition between \njobs. One of the most important forms of help that we can provide \nAmerican working people is relevant, effective job training delivered \nin the most efficient way possible for jobs that really exist, and that \npay a decent wage.\n  Lifelong learning has never been more critical, and we must do all we \ncan to give people access to the resources they need to retool their \nskills. For too long, the Federal job training system has been too \ncumbersome, with duplicative programs that have not always been \neffective. And so this legislation includes provisions to streamline \nand consolidate these programs, and expand job training opportunities \nfor workers. Carol Turner, director of older worker retraining for the \nDuluth Workforce Center, confirmed for me the other day that in her \ncity, this kind of coordination, coupled with expanded local control, \nis critical to getting people off welfare and increasing their standard \nof living.\n  It would streamline the job training process for all Americans, \nincluding welfare recipients, by consolidating existing programs, and \nestablishing state and local work force development boards to \ncoordinate programs within each State. It would encourage States to \ndevelop one-stop delivery systems for employment services; my State has \nbeen one of the leaders in this field. It provides continued funding \nfor summer jobs and other special training programs that have been so \nsuccessful. And it imposes a cap on the amount of job training funds \nthat can be used by States for economic development activities, to make \nsure that Federal funds are in fact being used for retraining. The bill \nretains Job Corps as a national program, with strict national oversight \nstandards, a zero-tolerance drug policy, and other key reforms.\n\n\n                        Health Insurance Reform\n\n  One of the most alarming developments for workers has been the \ngrowing fear of losing their health insurance. In order to help workers \nplan for their futures, this legislation will make it easier for \nindividuals and employers to buy and keep health insurance--even when a \nfamily member or employee becomes ill. And it will allow people to \nchange jobs without fear of losing their health coverage. For folks \nlike the Edgett family of Duluth, who lost their coverage when they \ndecided to start their own small business, these kinds of efforts to \nmake health care more affordable and more portable would be a big help. \nAnd the same goes for millions of other Americans.\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\n  Despite past State and Federal reform efforts, the lack of \nportability of health insurance remains a serious concern for many \nAmericans, particularly those with preexisting health conditions. The \nGeneral Accounting Office estimates that as many as 25 million \nAmericans could benefit from this legislation.\n  This legislation builds upon and strengthens the current private \ninsurance market by guaranteeing that private health insurance coverage \nwill be available, renewable, and portable; by limiting preexisting \ncondition exclusions; and by increasing the purchasing clout of \nindividuals and small employers through incentives to form private, \nvoluntary coalitions to negotiate with providers and health plans. It \nalso provides for parity between mental health and other health care \nbenefits; its adoption would be an historic step forward in our \ntreatment of those with mental health problems in this country.\n  Enactment of the bill would help millions of workers who lose their \nemployer-based coverage and are then turned away by other insurers. It \nalso would make it easier for workers to change jobs or start their own \nbusinesses without fear of losing their health insurance. It would \naccomplish this by prohibiting employers from denying coverage of a \npreexisting medical condition to an applicant for more than 1 year. \nAfter that year, no preexisting condition limits could be imposed on \nanyone who maintains coverage, even if the person changes jobs or \ninsurance plans. In addition, individuals switching from a group plan \nto an individual plan could not be denied coverage as long as they \nmaintained continuous coverage. Finally, health plans would not be \nallowed to drop enrollees who pay their premiums, even if they become \nchronically ill.\n  The bill also includes provisions to protect retirees, their spouses \nand dependents from abrupt termination--or substantial reduction--of \ncertain health care benefits. It would require courts to order \nemployers to provide benefits while benefit disputes are litigated, \nimpose upon employers the burden of proof when health care contracts \nare silent or ambiguous about changes, and require advance warning by \nemployers of their intent to modify retiree benefit packages.\n  While this is by no means comprehensive reform, it is a good first \nstep. Even people with good health insurance coverage cannot count on \nprotection if they lose or change jobs, especially if someone in their \nfamily has a preexisting condition. Our current health care system \nallows insurers to collect premiums for years and then suddenly refuse \nto renew coverage if individuals or employees get sick. It also allows \ninsurers to routinely deny coverage to different types of businesses \nfrom auto dealers to restaurants.\n  Many States, including Minnesota, have already enacted standards for \ninsurance carriers, but because ERISA preemption prevents States from \nregulating self-funded health plans, only Federal standards can apply \nto all health plans. More and more employers in Minnesota have been \nchoosing to offer self-funded plans to employees. Such plans now enroll \nabout 1.5 million people, up from 890,000 in 1992, and about 50 percent \nof all privately insured residents. Current estimates also show that \nmore than 400,000 Minnesotans--including 91,000 children--are \nuninsured.\n\n  While I am committed to fighting for comprehensive reforms that would \ninclude everyone and enable working families to afford health care \ncoverage as good as Members of Congress have, I recognize that this may \nnot happen this year. At the very least, we should act on reforms that \nwould address some of the most egregious inequities in our current \nsystem, as well as those that would allow States to expand access and \ncontain costs.\n\n\n                             Pension Reform\n\n  It is clear that this country needs strong, enforceable pension \nprotections. The President has made some recent proposals to strengthen \npension security, which we should consider seriously in the coming \nmonths. But the new Republican majority is moving in the other \ndirection. They have passed so-called reforms, vetoed once, that would \nagain make it easy for companies to raid ``over-funded'' pension plans. \nAt a minimum we must preserve protections in current law that prohibit \ncompanies from raiding the pension plans of their employees. As we have \nall seen, overfunded plans can quickly become underfunded with a change \nin interest rates, or changes in the stock markets. For example, if \ninterest rates decline by 2 percent--as they did between November 1994 \nand December 1995--a plan's funding level can drop from 125 percent to \naround 90 percent within a matter of weeks.\n  During the 1980's, when pension assets grew with a rising stock \nmarket, companies took over $20 billion from over 2,000 pension plans \ncovering 2.5 million workers and retirees. In many cases, these \ncompanies took the funds from overfunded plans while allowing \nsignificant underfunding in other plans. In 1990, this practice was \nstopped virtually dead in its tracks by changes in law which made such \nraids prohibitively expensive by imposing a 50-percent excise tax on \ncompanies that did it. Republican proposals to weaken these and related \npension rules could allow companies to draw another $15 billion or more \nout of these plans, potentially effecting another 4 million workers and \nretirees in 6,000 plans over the next 5 years. Similar efforts to dip \ninto workers' pension plans have been a major problem for workers in my \nState, including those who worked for many years at Reserve Mining Co.\n  There is a real problem with the low rate of private savings in this \ncountry, including for retirement. Comprehensive pension, Social \nSecurity, and other retirement security reforms are difficult issues to \naddress adequately. Even so, it is critical that we do so, especially \nsince there are many proposals, some quite radical in their scope, now \nfloating around to do things like privatize the Social Security System \nand create so-called super-IRA's, allowing people to invest all or part \nof their Social Security funds in the stock markets, instead of in \nGovernment securities--where they would be more secure but perhaps \noffer slightly lower overall returns.\n  As the baby boomer generation moves toward retirement, these \nretirement security issues, along with questions about savings rates, \nportability of pensions, 401(k) plan use, and related matters could \nbecome more urgent. To look at the long-term implications of these and \nother proposed changes to our retirement security policies, I am today \ncalling for the establishment of a bipartisan commission to make \nrecommendations to Congress on how best to reform our retirement \nsecurity programs in a way that would have the most beneficial impact \non the largest number of people, similar to a bill that was introduced \nrecently on the House side.\n\n\n                        Corporate Accountability\n\n  The rash of lay-offs, corporate restructurings, and other economic \ndislocations that have rocked the American economy pose serious \nproblems for American workers, their families, and communities, and \nhave contributed to the widening income gaps in our society. For years, \nwe have seen a growing trend toward an almost exclusive focus on the \nbottom line in many corporations, with firms caught in a web of \nleveraged buy-outs, mega-mergers, swiftly changing markets, and other \nforces. While we are all committed to a free economy, we cannot sustain \na prosperity that permits us to be divided between the wealthy few and \nthe worried many.\n  Corporations must keep in mind the interests of all of their \nstakeholders in making economic decisions, and not just stockholders. \nWorkers, communities, State governments which provide economic \nincentives, suppliers and contractors, and a host of other stakeholders \nshould all be considered as firms make economic decisions.\n  This bill attempts to create incentives for firms to engage in more \nresponsible, forward-looking, stakeholder-driven decisionmaking. It \noutlines a proposed set of corporate responsibility principles that \nbusinesses would have to observe as a condition to qualify for certain \npreferential treatment in Federal contracting. These principles \ninclude, among others, providing a safe and healthy workplace; ensuring \nfair employment, including avoiding discrimination in hiring; observing \nenvironmental protections; promoting good business practices; \nmaintaining a corporate culture that\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\nrespects free expression; and encouraging similar behavior by partners, \nsuppliers and subcontractors. This proposal would require that, in its \nprocurement process, the Federal Government give a preference to \ncontractors that adopt and enforce this corporate code of conduct; it \nwould also provide for periodic reviews to ensure compliance with the \ncode.\n  I believe we must encourage responsible citizenship by firms doing \nbusiness with the Government, and this provision moves us in that \ndirection. I am skeptical of providing additional tax subsidies as some \nhave proposed, and I think this alternative approach deserves \nconsideration. I know that there are a host of other approaches, such \nas those that have caught fire in my State and elsewhere, which require \nthat a living wage--not just a minimum wage--be paid by companies that \nreceive government benefits. I want to pursue this and other similar \nideas which are bubbling up from the grassroots, because I think they \ntoo are interesting ways to prompt firms to act more responsibly, and \nto combat the growing layoffs that have so shaken our economy.\n\n\n                         Fair Trade Under NAFTA\n\n  Many Americans today are concerned about losing good jobs in this \ncountry when U.S. employers seek cheaper labor abroad. I did not \nsupport the North American Free-Trade Agreement. I believed then, and \ndo now, that this particular agreement is not in the best interests of \nthe workers of Mexico, Canada, or the United States. I believe we have \nan obligation to guarantee that workers and environmental interests are \nnot compromised. And so I have included a title in my omnibus \nlegislation that is an effort to strengthen NAFTA and at the same time \nprotect the interests of all workers.\n  The legislation I am proposing would direct the President to \nrenegotiate portions of the North American Free-Trade Agreement to \naddress the negative effects of the agreement's implementation since \nJanuary 1994. The renegotiation would seek to achieve the original \npromises of NAFTA: to improve the standard of living and quality of \nlife for United States citizens, as well as those of Mexico and Canada. \nA positive, fair NAFTA would open markets in a way that promotes a \nhigh-wage, high-skill strategy of growth for the whole continent, \npromotes environmental and consumer protection, and contributes to real \ndevelopment and democracy.\n  Instead, available evidence indicates NAFTA has failed and has \ncontributed to a substantial U.S. trade deficit, loss of jobs, \nsuppression of wages, and to downward pressure on environmental and \nhealth standards and conditions.\n  I am not opposed to free trade. I am in favor of fair trade and fair \ntrade agreements. I believe these changes would take us along the road \nof building a solid foundation for the future of our workers, our \nhealth, and the future of the entire region.\n  Mr. President, I hope this bill, and other measures to bring the \nissues of economic security for working families back to center stage, \nwill be acted on soon. I intend to continue to press legislation to \naddress these issues here in the Senate--it was what I was elected to \ndo. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation, and \nto support its key elements as I bring some of them to the Senate floor \nin the coming months.\n  Mr. President, the Working Families Economic Security Act of 1996 is \nreally an effort on my part as the Senator from Minnesota pulling \ntogether a lot of different legislation and a lot of work that I have \nbeen doing in the Senate over the years and putting it into one bill. \nThe reason I do so is that I really feel as if Minnesota and the \ncountry are kind of leading the way in telling us what we must do, the \nwork that they think is important that connects to their lives.\n  I am a cafe politician, and I try to spend as much time as possible \nwith coffee and pie--probably too much pie--in cafes in Minnesota, just \nsitting down with people and talk and listen --and listen. What I hear, \nMr. President, is, ``Senator, I am retired. I don't want anybody to \ntake my pension away.''\n  One provision in this legislation makes it crystal clear there can be \nno skimming of hard-earned pension money. That belongs to the \nemployees. It belongs to nobody else. No large multinational \ncorporation will be allowed to skim pension money from any man or woman \nretired in Minnesota or anywhere in the country. People say to me in \ncafes in Minnesota, ``Senator, it is just outrageous to me that if I \nhave a bout with cancer in my 50's, I might see my insurance policy \ncanceled.''\n  This bill includes the insurance reform provisions that we should \npass anyway that make sure that the insurance companies no longer are \nable to continue with this discrimination. It is just outrageous that \nan insurance company would not provide coverage to someone because of a \nbout with an illness, or that somebody cannot transfer from one job to \nanother or start a small business in Minnesota or in Colorado or in New \nMexico with this kind of discrimination against them because they have \nhad a bout with cancer or because they are a diabetic.\n  Mr. President, Minnesotans say to me in cafes, ``Senator, I don't \nknow what your colleagues are thinking, but let me tell you, $4.25 an \nhour to $5.15 an hour, increasing the minimum wage nationwide is an \nadditional $1,800. For that, I can pay my energy bill; for that, I can \npurchase health insurance for myself and my children; for that, I can \ngo to a community college; for that, I can put food on the table.'' \nThis includes raising the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour.\n  Mr. President, Minnesotans say to me in cafes, ``Senator, I am really \nworried because I am 50 years old and I read the papers and I know that \npeople are being downsized, restructured out of work. What will happen \nto me?'' So there is a strong emphasis here on education and job \ntraining in this legislation. I think we have to redefine education as \na teacher. It is no longer K through 12. It is for longer--K through \nhigher education. It is K through 65. People should not just be spit \nout of the economy with nowhere to go, people who have worked hard and \nare skilled. We should give skilled men and women an opportunity, if \nthey lose their job in one company through no fault of their own, to be \nable to go back to school to have the skills development to find a job, \na good job, somewhere else in the economy. There is a strong emphasis \non education and job training.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation also focuses on, in general, the \nissue of economic opportunities. People say to me in cafes, ``Senator, \nour children are in their 20's. They cannot find a job paying a decent \nwage with decent fringe benefits.''\n  So, Mr. President, let me just say, I think from pension funds to \nhealth care to decent jobs at decent wages, to educational \nopportunities, to putting an end to this obscene disparity tax, funded \ndisparity between CEO's salaries and wage earners, to some sort of \naccountability, that we call on large multinational corporations to be \naccountable. I think this is the direction people want us to go in. \nThese are the bread-and-butter economic issues.\n  I say, by way of conclusion, that I think one of the mistakes--I do \nnot believe in hate; I believe in honest debate. I think much of the \nmistake that the Gingrich Congress has made in 1994, there was a lot of \ncampaigning on the bread-and-butter economic issues, and now Speaker \nGingrich is taking the bread and butter, and working families do not \nlike that. People want to see their kids have economic opportunities. \nThese are the issues that matter: a good job, good education, \nopportunities to start a small business, having decent health care \ncoverage, making sure that we focus on investing in our kids, making \nsure we invest in an economy that produces jobs that people can count \non. That is what people are talking about in the cafes in Minnesota.\n  That is what people are talking about under the roofs in their homes. \nThat is what people are talking about on their farms. This Working \nFamily's Economic Security Act of 1996 brings that together. I will \ntake pieces of this legislation and bring amendments to the floor and \nmake sure we have votes on this.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Pell, and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1723. A bill to require accountability in campaign advertising, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\n          the campaign advertising accountability act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Pell that I believe is a small, yet a very \nimportant step in reforming the campaign system that has led to \nwidespread mistrust of the political process and mistrust of those who \nseek public office.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I am offering today is simple and \nstraightforward. First of all, it would amend the new \nTelecommunications Act to provide that all legally qualified candidates \nfor Federal elective office who refer directly or indirectly to another \ncandidate for that office in a campaign advertisement must make the \nreference in person.\n  If the candidate voluntarily chooses not to make the reference \nhimself or herself, he or she would not be eligible for the lowest unit \nrate provided to candidates under section 315(b) of the Communications \nAct for the remainder of the 45-day period preceding the primary or the \nprimary runoff election, or the 60-day period presiding the date of the \ngeneral or special election. The candidate would, however, of course, \ncontinue to have access to the broadcast station at the same charge \nmade for comparable use of the station by commercial users.\n  Second, the bill requires that broadcasters who allow an individual \nor group to air advertisements in support of, or in opposition to, a \nparticular candidate for Federal office, allow the candidate's opponent \nthe same amount of time without charge on the broadcast station during \nthe same period of the day.\n  Mr. President, these are not new concepts. In the 99th Congress, \nSenator Danforth offered S. 1310, which would have required a broadcast \nstation that allowed a candidate to present an ad that referred to her \nopponent without presenting the ad herself, to provide free rebuttal \ntime to the other candidate. Since then, other variations of what have \nbecome known as talking heads legislation have been incorporated in \noverall campaign finance reform bills and introduced as free standing \nbills.\n  Mr. President, I became interested in this issue last year when I \nread an editorial in the Washington Post by David Broder entitled, \n``Dirty Work for Dirty Campaigns.'' Mr. Broder referred to an issue of \nCampaigns and Elections which is a magazine for campaign consultants. \nThe July 1995 issue contained an article about negative attack ads and \nquoted several campaign consultants. What the consultants admitted \nabout campaigning today should shock the conscience of everyone in the \nSenate.\n  Consultants are quoted as saying in reference to developing negative, \nattack ad, ``Welcome to the world of attack mail * * * It's a world of \ntaunts, jeers, jabs, pointed fingers, and mudslinging.'' The \nconsultants go on to write, ``Excite the emotions. It's much easier and \nmore effective to persuade with the heart than with the head alone. \nFear, anger, envy, indignation and shame are powerful emotions in the \npolitical arena.'' And, Mr. President, in what is perhaps the most \nrevealing revelation about these consultants' campaign strategy, they \nwrite that the candidate should never take personal responsibility for \nattacking the opponent but, and I quote, ``It's always best to have \nsomeone else deliver the negative message, even if it's a third-person, \nunsigned piece. Keep your candidate at a dignified distance.'' Mr. \nPresident, I see nothing dignified about such a strategy. While the \nconsultants were commenting on attack mail, I don't think it requires \ntoo much of a stretch to realize that the same rules apply to many of \ntoday 's television advertisements.\n  Mr. President, a little over a year ago, I went through a costly, and \nnegative campaign. right now, many of our colleagues are preparing to \ngo through the same process and I say with all sincerity, that I do not \nenvy my colleagues whether they are Republican or Democrat because I \nknow that they will soon be subjected to many of the same negative, \nattack ads that I had to face in my race. Many of those ads will \ncontain misrepresentations, distortions, and outright untruths. Perhaps \nan image will appear but it won't be the candidate's either. Instead, \nit will be the candidate hiding behind the message. And if it is not \nthe candidate himself or herself who is orchestrating the attack ad, it \nwill be some special interest group that is not subject to even the \nminimal restraints on spending and other restrictions that candidates \nare subject to.\n\n  Mr. President, we hear that politicians are held in only slightly \nhigher esteem by the public than lawyers and journalists. While that \nmay be true, I know that my colleagues, regardless of their political \naffiliation, are honorable men and women who care about their \nrespective States and our Nation. Unfortunately, the negative \nperception persists.\n  I believe that one of the reasons for that is the trend in today's \ncampaigns to attack, attack and attack--to go negative early and stay \nnegative until the votes are counted. As Senator Danforth noted, \nlegislation requiring the candidate herself to present ads that \nreference her opponent would serve the purpose, ``* * * to open up \nspeech, open up the ability to respond, the ability to defend oneself. \nIn the case of a candidate making a negative attack, we try to improve \nthe sense of responsibility and accountability by making it clear that \nthe candidate who makes the attack should appear with his own face, \nwith his own voice.''\n  I believe that the legislation I am introducing today will begin the \nprocess of restoring the confidence of the American people in public \nservice as an honorable endeavor. I also believe that it passes first \namendment scrutiny because it sets up a system of voluntary \nparticipation in receiving the benefits of section 315 of the \nCommunications Act. A candidate's access rights to the airwaves in this \ninstance are statutory, rather than constitutional. Congress \nestablished the requirements for candidates to be eligible for the \nlowest unit rate and Congress has the right to modify those \nrequirements so long as the modifications reasonably balance the \ninterest of candidates, broadcast licensees, and the public. \nParticipation in this context is voluntary.\n  Nothing in this legislation would prohibit a candidate from offering \nan ad that references her opponent without making the reference in \nperson. A candidate could offer her ad in any format and no penalty, \neither civil or criminal, would attach for deciding not to following \nthe strictures of this legislation. Broadcasters would not be burdened \nby this bill because it does not require them to provide any additional \nbenefits to particular candidates. Instead, it leaves the choice of \nwhether or not to participate in the system whereby the candidate \nreceives a lowest unit rate charge to the candidate herself. And, \nfinally, the public is not harmed by this bill. In fact, I find it \ndifficult to believe that anyone would argue that the public would be \nharmed by requiring candidates to take responsibility for their \nstatements. More openness, more honesty and more responsibility in \ncampaign advertising would benefit all.\n  Mr. President, last year the majority leader included campaign \nfinance reform in the list of legislation that should be considered by \nthe 104th Congress, and I commend him for that. In addition, our \ncolleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin, Senators McCain and \nFeingold introduced a comprehensive campaign finance reform bill that \nhas received a positive response in many corners. Unfortunately, I fear \nthat, as the majority leader has noted, the differences between the two \nparties on comprehensive campaign finance reform could all to easily \nprevent the Congress from enacting comprehensive campaign finance \nreform. My legislation, on the other hand, is not a Republican or \nDemocratic issue. If the elections of 1992 and 1994 demonstrated \nanything, it was that neither Republicans nor Democrats have a patent \non the art of negative campaigning. Both sides have resorted to these \ntypes of ads and both sides have been the victims of them. My \nlegislation, unlike the larger issues of campaign finance reform, \nshould attract bipartisan support.\n\n  Mr. President, we are about to enter the height of the American \npolitical season. It is no doubt just a matter of time before the \nnegative advertisements begin to air across the country. By enacting \nthe legislation we are introducing today, I believe that the Senate \nwill take a major first step in bringing fresh air into the area of \ncampaign reform and a major step toward\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nrestoring dignity and confidence in our political process. I urge my \ncolleagues to act on this matter at the earliest possible time.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 1724. A bill to require that the Federal Government procure from \nthe private sector the goods and services necessary for the operations \nand management of certain Government agencies, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              the freedom from government competition act\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill called \nthe Freedom From Government Competition Act, a bill that will create \njobs and commercial opportunities for small businesses. I am joined in \nthis effort by my friend and associate from Wyoming, Senator Simpson, \nas well as Senator Kyl and Senator Craig. I urge, of course, other \nSenators to join this effort.\n  It has been the Federal Government's policy for a good long time to \ncontract out services. We have not always enforced it, however. The \npurpose of this bill is to put some teeth in the policy; we ought to \nput into the private sector all those things that could be better done \nthere, as opposed to having them done within the Federal Government.\n  This bill establishes a process in which the Office of Management and \nBudget will identify Government functions that are commercial in nature \nand recommend a plan to contract out those activities to the private \nsector over a 5-year period. It is similar to H.R. 28 in the House, \nintroduced by Congressman Duncan from Tennessee. It has bipartisan \nsupport of over 40 Members in the House and it is similar, \ninterestingly enough, to a bill that was introduced by Senator Rudman \nin the 1980's here in the Senate.\n  Significant portions of this idea were a part of the 1996 defense \nauthorization bill, which had to do with procurement and moving some of \nthese kinds of things into the private sector. This bill simply takes \nthat concept and expands it further to other Federal Government \noperations.\n  Government competition with the private sector, as we all know, is a \nbig problem. Often bureaucracy wastes too much time and money on goods \nand services that could better be delivered by the private sector. Most \nof us, I think, agree with the notion we ought to limit those functions \nof the Government to things that can only be performed by the \nGovernment and put into the private sector the other functions. That, \nbasically, is the purpose of my bill.\n  It is also wrong, it seems to me, that the Government competes with \nthe private sector. There ought to be competition, but the competition \nought to exist within the private sector. For example, surveying and \nmapmaking can be done in the private sector. Indeed it should be. \nTraining, education, janitorial services, laboratory services are all \nfunctions that can be performed by private industry. I proposed a \nsimilar bill when I served in our legislature in the State of Wyoming, \nurging and in fact setting up a process to contract out many services.\n  This idea has been a major concern for some time. It was one of the \ntop issues of the most recent White House Conference on Small Business, \nas you can imagine. State and local governments have had success, in \nsome areas, privatizing. Massachusetts Governor Weld said, ``It's not \nan issue of public versus private. It's an issue of monopoly versus \ncompetition.'' I agree.\n  The Department of Defense has had considerable success in contracting \nout some functions. The armed services are saving $1.5 billion a year, \na 31 percent reduction, from outsourcing. So it is time for us to not \nonly talk about it but to do it. This bill basically says to the Office \nof Management and Budget, come back to the Congress with a plan that \nmakes this happen. It will create jobs, help small businesses and save \nbillions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a look at this bill and \njoin me in this idea of moving those nongovernmental functions that are \nperformed by the Government into the private sector.\n  Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask it be \nappropriately referred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dole, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mrs. Murray, Mr. McCain, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. \n        Ashcroft):\n  S. 1726. A bill to promote electronic commerce by facilitating the \nuse of strong encryption, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n    the promotion of commerce on-line in the digital era act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pro-CODE \nbill, or the Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of \n1996, with the following cosponsors: the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Dole, Senator Pressler, Senator Leahy, Senator Murray, Senator \nWyden, Senator Nickles, Senator McCain, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator \nFaircloth.\n  Like the title of the bill states, my primary objective with this \nlegislation is to promote commerce both domestically and abroad. But I \nhave two other goals that I believe will be achieved by Pro-CODE: one \nis to improve the competitiveness of American software companies with \ntheir foreign competitors, the other is to protect the intellectual \nproperty and privacy of both businesses and individuals.\n  Mr. President, Pro-CODE would have a profound impact on our economy \nand the way each of us lives our life from day to day. It is a \nrelatively simple bill,  but it deals with a term few of us are \nfamiliar with: encryption. Encryption is simply the use of a string of \nletters or numbers--or a key--to render our computer files and \ntransmissions unreadable by people who have no business reading them. \nIf you have the right key, you can unlock the code and have access to \nthat information.\n  Unfortunately, American businesses and computer users face a threat--\nand it is a threat from their own Government--because the current \nadministration will not let American companies export encryption at a \nlevel higher than 40 bits. This is a fancy word, but it means is that \nit is a level of security that can be cracked by your basic \nsupercomputer in about one-thousandth of a second at a cost of a tenth \nof a cent. Companies can sell stronger encryption here at home, but it \nis too expensive to create two different standards, so they do not.\n  What this means is that commerce and communication on computer \nnetworks including the Internet is not reaching its full potential. How \nmany of you would feel secure sending your credit card number over the \nInternet--especially when you learn that reported invasions by computer \nhackers increased ninefold between 1990 and 1994? Or when Internet \nWorld magazine estimates that the actual number of unwanted computer \npenetrations in 1992 alone was 1.2 million? If you were a business, how \nmany of you would feel secure passing sensitive information to your \nbranches around the world or around the Nation? If you were an ordinary \ncitizen, would you feel secure knowing that many of your records and \nfiles are subject to the kind of security that the cyber-criminals of \ntoday just laugh at?\n  Yet that is the problem we face today, and my colleagues here today \nand I find it unacceptable. Just 3 months ago we passed a historic \ntelecommunications law that is designed to make it easier to interact \nwith each other. But the law--that vehicle which will take us along the \ninformation highway--is useless without the engine of information \nsecurity driving it forward.\n  Mr. President, our bill would allow the unrestricted export of mass-\nmarket or public-domain encryption programs. It would also require the \nSecretary of Commerce to allow the export of encryption technologies if \nproducts of similar strength are available elsewhere in the world. \nFinally, it would prohibit the Government from imposing a mandatory \nkey-escrow system in which the Government or another third party would \nhave a back door to your computer files.\n  I come from a State where distances can often keep us apart. From \nEureka, MT, in the northwest to Alzada, MT, in the southeast is the \nsame distance as from Washington, DC, to Chicago. Anything to bring us \ncloser together will\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\ngive us benefits only enjoyed now by folks in larger areas. It will \nalso give the mom-and-pop businesses in our smallest communities a leg \nup on their bigger competitors as we enter the information age.\n  But my concern is also based on the effect the current policy is \nhaving on jobs and industry in this Nation. Because of our current ill-\nadvised policy, American companies will lose their share of the world \nmarket--which now stands at 75 percent--to foreign companies who do not \nhave to abide by such restrictions. For example, I have discovered a \nWorld Wide Web page from a South African company that boasts 128-bit \nencryption. In many cases, these encryption programs are available to \ndownload from the Internet.\n  Mr. President, American companies clearly are at a competitive \ndisadvantage. A study by the Computer Systems Policy Project found that \nwithin just the next 4 years, American companies could lose $60 billion \nin revenues and American workers could lose 216,000 high-tech jobs. Our \nbill is a jobs bill that I'm sure the administration can agree with. \nBut it is not only that. As you can see, it is also a consumers bill.\n  One of the questions I have heard is, ``How does this legislation \ndiffer from a bill you are also sponsoring with Senator Leahy?'' The \nanswer is, not a lot. However, Pro-CODE is narrower in its scope. It \ndeals exclusively with the issue of commerce and omits the criminality \nprovisions. In addition, it does not set up guidelines for a voluntary \nkey-escrow arrangement. This is a streamlined measure that I hope to \nmove quickly through the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation and the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee, \nwhich I chair. We will have hearings on this bill, hopefully as soon as \nthis month, and I hope to have at least one of those in the field where \nthe people are affected most by this bill.\n  In addition to the diverse and bipartisan group of Senators you see \nbefore you, support for this legislation in the private sector is both \nbroad and deep. There are two homepages on the Web that are dedicated \nto tracking encryption legislation and making people aware of why it is \nneeded. As with the blue-ribbon campaign, Internet users will be \nencouraged to download the golden key and envelope symbol. They will \nthen be able to link to one of the two encryption pages and show their \nsupport for this effort.\n  I am also sending today an open letter to the Internet community \nencouraging support for this bill, and I expect it to be made available \nto hundreds of thousands of Internet users. I will also make myself \navailable for at least two online forums to discuss my bill with \ncomputer users. Mr. President, I urge support for this bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleagues \ntoday to introduce the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era \nAct [Pro-CODE]. This bill will eliminate outdated, useless rules, and \nregulations so that American companies can compete effectively \nthroughout the world in the global information technology industry. It \nwill strengthen our economy, create jobs, and maintain the U.S. lead in \ntelecommunications and information technology into the 21st century.\n  The high-technology industry is the crown jewel of the American \neconomy--growing exponentially each year and constantly creating new \njobs. This is the future of our country's economic security.\n  We are the world leaders in the technology revolution. Whether in \nhardware, software, browsers, semiconductors, cryptography, or other \nsegments of the industry, we have the talent and capability to retain \nthis lead indefinitely. The private sector is doing everything possible \nto expand this industry. Unfortunately, they frequently are held back \nby unnecessary or antiquated Government rules and regulations. \nGovernment should help, or at the very least, get out of the way.\n  Outdated Government policy must change and it must change \nimmediately. The future of this industry, its employees and our \ncountry's economy depends on this change.\n  This is why I am an original sponsor of Pro-CODE. The Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which I chair, will \nhave jurisdiction over this bill, that basically, would allow unlimited \nexport of commercially available encrypted software. I am committed to \nmoving this legislation forward immediately and I am joined by others \non the committee who fell the same way.\n  The health of our national economy, and my home State of South \nDakota's economy in particular, is heavily dependent upon exports. We \nmust focus on expanding our present foreign markets and opening new \nones in order to strengthen our businesses and maintain our economic \nhegemony. It is undisputed that American business can compete evenly \nwith their foreign counterparts when operating on a level playing \nfield. However, they are not always given fair treatment.\n  When U.S. companies are treated unfairly vis-a-vis their foreign \ncompetitors, they lose contracts and their market share suffers. This \nleads to lower profits and less repatriation of those profits to the \nUnited States. We must do all we can to eliminate foreign trade \nbarriers that restrict U.S. companies operating abroad. At the same \ntime, we also must eliminate our own Government's discrimination \nagainst our American multinationals. To this end, the bill assists U.S. \nmultinational companies, and high-technology companies in particular, \nby eliminating unnecessary restrictions on their operations.\n\n  The Pro-CODE bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support. I believe \nthis change in policy is vital if the United States is to maintain its \nworldwide lead in the development and sale of software technology. This \nis an industry key to the continued strength of our economy, however, \nexport controls--true relics of the cold war--are hurting American \ncompanies' ability to sell their products overseas. We won the cold \nwar. We must now disarm the weapons used to win that war before they \nare used against us.\n  It is simply logical to allow U.S. companies to sell overseas some of \nthe technology they currently are allowed only to sell within the \nUnited States. As you know, certain software readily available around \nthe world and on the Internet is not allowed to be exported from the \nUnited States. Rules that once made sense are obsolete and harmful--\nonly to us--in today's rapidly changing world. Encrypted software, \nwhich serves to secure communications, is the future of the industry.\n  If we fail to loosen our export laws, American companies face two \nunpleasant choices. First, they can simply stand by and watch their \nproducts be replaced by foreign competitors. This means losing this \nindustry the way we lost consumer electronics, steel, and the auto \nindustry in the past. In the more likely alternative, these companies \nwill be forced to move their production and research facilities \noffshore. If this happens, not only will our economy suffer, but we \nwill lose high-paying, high-technology jobs. We cannot afford either \nalternative. That is why I am fighting to correct this problem. We must \ndo so--before it is too late.\n  When I led the effort to enact the sweeping Telecommunications Reform \nAct my goal was to open up all aspects of the telecommunications \nindustry to widespread competition. Without changes in other laws this \ngoal cannot be fully achieved. Indeed, without such changes we risk the \nloss of markets such as software to foreign competitors because our own \nGovernment restricts the U.S. companies.\n  The issue is a simple one--with the globalization of our information \nsystems we must have secured transmissions. Those transactions should \nbe protected by the best encrypted software available. That means \nAmerican products.\n  As the Federal Communications Commission proceeds with implementation \nof the Telecommunications Act it is important for Congress to keep a \nwatchful eye on their deliberations. For example, some at the FCC \nsupport a mandated high-definition television [HDTV] standard. Not me. \nI will fight any FCC attempt to set mandated equipment standards. To \nestablish such mandates would set a dangerous precedent which could \nchill competitive gains the United States has made throughout the \nworld. The computer industry has grown and flourished because the \nGovernment did not set standards or impose mandates. The Government \nshould not get into mandating standards.\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\n  I also am working to bolster our competitiveness through the \nenactment of the international tax simplification for American \ncompetitiveness bill. The purpose of this legislation is to make \ntechnical corrections and simplification changes to the U.S. Tax Code--\neliminating some of the discriminatory and redundant application of \nrules of our companies. This bill likely will include a provision \neliminating the discrimination against software under the foreign sales \ncorporation rules. This too will help U.S. software exporters. This \nbill contains commonsense changes to the Tax Code designed to put \nUnited States companies on more equal footing with their key \ncompetitors in Japan and Germany. I intend to introduce this bill in \nthe next few weeks. Here too, I expect widespread bipartisan support.\n\n  I want to use my role as chairman of the Commerce Committee--with its \njurisdiction over international trade and the Commerce Department--in \ncombination with my membership on the Finance Committee--which has \njurisdiction over trade and tax policy--to help strengthen American \ncompetitiveness overseas. Our economic future depends upon diligent \nefforts to ensure our companies are treated equitably not only by \nforeign countries, but by our own as well. We can compete with anyone \ngiven a fair chance. It is my goal to put America first.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of Senators in \nsupporting legislation to encourage the development and use of strong, \nprivacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet by rolling back the \noutdated restrictions on the export of strong cryptography.\n  As an Internet user myself, I care deeply about protecting individual \nprivacy and encouraging the development of the Net as a secure and \ntrusted communications medium. Current export restrictions only allow \nAmerican companies to export primarily weak encryption technology. The \ncurrent strength of encryption the U.S. government will allow out of \nthe country is so weak that, according to a January 1996 study \nconducted by world-renowned cryptographers, a pedestrian hacker can \ncrack the codes in a matter of hours. A foreign intelligence agency can \ncrack the current 40-bit codes in seconds.\n  Perhaps more importantly, the increasing use of the Internet and \nsimilar interactive communications technologies by Americans to obtain \ncritical medical services, to conduct business, to be entertained and \ncommunicate with their friends, raises special concerns about the \nprivacy and confidentiality of those communications. I have long been \nconcerned about these issues, and have worked over the past decade to \nprotect privacy and security for our wire and electronic \ncommunications. Encryption technology provides an effective way to \nensure that only the people we choose can read our communications.\n  Encryption is critical for electronic commerce really to flourish on \nthe Internet, and for computer users to trust that their communciations \nwill remain private. Today, I have sent out an open letter to the \nInternet about this encryption legislation. So that people reading the \nletter can be assured that it is really me sending it, I am using a \npopular encryption program called ``Pretty Good Privacy'', or ``PGP'', \nto authenticate my signature. This is yet another practical use of \nencryption, and an important one for electronic commerce.\n  Maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our computer \ncommunications and information is very important to all of us both here \nand abroad. I have read horror stories sent to me over the Internet \nabout how human rights groups in the Balkans have had their computers \nconfiscated during raids by security police seeking to find out the \nidentities of people who have complained about abuses. The human rights \ngroups have been able to get for free from the Internet an encryption \nprogram called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) to protect their computer \ncommunications and files. These encrypted files are undecipherable by \nthe police and the names of the people who entrust their lives to the \nhuman rights groups are safe.\n  The encryption bill, called the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the \nDigital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996, which we introduce today, would:\n\n       Bar any government-mandated use of any particular \n     encryption system, including key escrow systems and affirm \n     the right of American citizens to use whatever form of \n     encryption they choose domestically;\n       Loosen export restrictions on encryption products so that \n     American companies are able to export any generally available \n     or mass market encryption products without obtaining \n     government approval; and\n       Limit the authority of the Federal Government to set \n     standards for encryption products used by businesses and \n     individuals, particularly standards which result in products \n     with limited key lengths and key escrow.\n\n  This is the second encryption bill I have introduced with Senator \nBurns and other congressional colleagues this year. Both bills call for \nan overhaul of this country's export restrictions on encryption, and, \nif enacted, would quickly result in the widespread availability of \nstrong, privacy protecting technologies. Both bills also prohibit a \ngovernment-mandated key escrow encryption system. While Pro-CODE would \nlimit the authority of the Commerce Department to set encryption \nstandards for use by private individuals and businesses, the first bill \nwe introduced, called the ``Encrypted Communications Privacy Act'', \nS.1587, would set up stringent procedures for law enforcement to follow \nto obtain decoding keys or decryption assistance to read the plain text \nof encrypted communications obtained under court order or other lawful \nprocess.\n  To satisfy national security and law enforcement concerns, both bills \nhave important exceptions to restrict encryption exports for military \nend-uses, or to terrorist designated or embargoed countries, such as \nCuba or North Korea.\n  I know this is not enough to satisfy our national security and law \nenforcement agencies, who fear that the widespread use of strong \nencryption will undercut their ability to eavesdrop on terrorists or \nother criminals.\n  But U.S. export controls will not keep encryption out of the hands of \ncriminals; these controls only hurt legitimate users and American \nbusiness. Any criminal intent on encrypting his computer information or \nmessages to avoid getting caught can go into any Egghead store and buy \noff-the-shelf Lotus Notes or Norton Utilities encryption program, both \nof which contain strong encryption that cannot be exported. It is then \na simple matter just to slip the software disc into his pocket to \nsmuggle out of the country.\n\n  Actually, it is even simpler than that for a foreign terrorist or any \ncriminal to get ahold of strong encryption. They don't even have to \nleave home. With a computer, a modem, and a telephone line, they could \ndownload for free off the Internet from anywhere in the world strong \nencryption, such as Pretty Good Privacy.\n  Strong encryption has an important use as a crime prevention shield, \nto stop hackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping into \nprivate computer files, and stealing valuable proprietary information. \nWe should be encouraging the use of strong encryption to prevent \ncertain types of computer and online crime.\n  It is clear that the current policy toward encryption exports is \nhopelessly outdated, and fails to account for the real needs of \nindividuals and businesses in the global marketplace.\n  In one recent example, a major high-technology firm had a multi-\nmillion dollar contract to sell digital television systems to China put \nat risk due to our export regulations. Why? The company suffered \nlengthy delays in getting export approval because the systems contained \nencryption technology to scramble TV signals--a critical component of \nthe system to protect the intellectual property rights of the \nprogramming carried by the signal. Foreign competitors seeking to get \ninto the vast China market were ready and willing to step into the \ncompany's place if it were unable to fulfill its contractual \nobligations. Two weeks after the contractual delivery date, the company \nfinally got the export approval it sought. This example is particularly \nironic since in trade negotiations, the United States has strongly \nurged China to protect intellectual property rights better.\n  Encryption expert Matt Blaze, in a recent letter to me, noted that \ncurrent U.S. regulations governing the use and export of encryption are \nhaving a ``deleterious effect * * * on our country's ability to develop \na reliable and trustworthy information infrastructure.''\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\n This sentiment is echoed by the chief executive officers of 13 major \nU.S. computer systems companies, including IBM, Apple, Digital \nEquipment, Hewlett-Packard, and others, which recently reported that\n\n       * * * encryption is the most practical and effective means \n     to protect valuable and confidential electronic information \n     traveling across open networks. The availability of effective \n     encryption is necessary to realize the full potential of the \n     Global Information Infrastructure (GII).\n\n  The time is right for Congress to take steps to put our national \nencryption policy on the right course. The Pro-CODE bill, as well as \nthe Encrypted Communications Privacy Act, S. 1587, are much-needed \nsteps to reform our Nation's cryptography policy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senator Burns, \nSenator Leahy, Senator Dole, Senator Pressler and others in \ncosponsoring the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era Act \nof 1996. The strong bipartisan support for this bill emphasizes how \nimportant our national encryption policies are becoming and reflects \nCongress' growing awareness of the issues surrounding the production \nand sale of encrypted software and hardware. I commend Senator Burns \nand Senator Leahy for their efforts in putting this legislation \ntogether.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Department of Commerce recently \nreleased a report stating there are tremendous international growth \nopportunities for software exporters in the next five to 10 years. \nUnfortunately, the Department of Commerce also acknowledged most U.S. \ncompanies don't pursue international sales because our export control \nlaws are too cost prohibitive.\n  Rather than dissuading international sales, our national policies \nshould be encouraging American companies to enter the global \nmarketplace. American software producers are losing tens of billions of \ndollars in lost sales due to outdated export controls. I recognize \nthere are legitimate national security concerns underpinning the Export \nAdministration Act. However, these archaic laws are no longer relevant \nto the post-cold-war world in which we now live. Today's national \nexport controls should target those items that really need to be \ncontrolled in order to maintain national security. Simply, they should \nmake better sense; it doesn't make sense to tell U.S. software \nproducers they can't export a product that is already widely available \non the world market.\n  Senator Burns' bill makes sure our innovative private sector \nproducers lead the way in developing acceptable encryption technology, \nand it makes sure government mandates and national export control \npolicies do not hamper private sector developments.\n  Mr. President, I introduced the Commercial Export Administration Act \nin the 103rd Congress, and I am pleased Senator Burns is incorporating \nthe spirit of my language in his bill. My language reduced regulatory \nred tape and made it easier to export generally available mass-marketed \ncommercial software. Washington state is home to some of the most \ninnovative software producers in the world, and they are eager to \nexport their goods. Unfortunately, our export controls keep Washington \nstate's companies from penetrating the world market.\n  Some of my colleagues may not know that Washington state's small and \nmid-sized high-tech companies provided more than 98,000 jobs in 1995.\n  Mr. President, I mention this because our bill will increase exports \nand enable our high-tech companies to grow further. Higher growth means \nmore jobs--plain and simple. A recent study revealed U.S. software and \nhardware exporters lost $60 billion in potential 1995 sales, and the \nstudy estimates a loss of 200,000 jobs in the industry by the year \n2000. Given the increase in international competition, we can no longer \nafford to hold U.S. companies back from potential world sales.\n  This legislation is badly needed, and I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Burns and me in supporting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

On May 11, 1996, the \norganization will hold a banquet to celebrate their 50th anniversary. \nThis significant milestone is made even more special because it marks \nthe first time a regional organization of the American Society of \nHealth-Systems Pharmacists has achieved such longevity.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the great \nachievements of the Southeastern Michigan Society of Hospital \nPharmacists over the past 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4630-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HIGHLANDS UNION BANK\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to have the \nopportunity to give well deserved recognition to a bank in my State. \nHighlands Union Bank in Abingdon, VA, recently received the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration's top ranking as one of the Nation's top \n``small business friendly banks''. The SBA Office of Advocacy defines \nsmall business lending as loans under $250,000. I would like to commend \nHighlands Union Bank for this achievement. The ranking is based on many \nfactors, including the number of loans given to small businesses, as \nwell as the dollar values. They scored 49 out of a possible 50 points--\nthe best in the State of Virginia.\n  As a member of the Senate's Small Business Committee, I believe very \nstrongly in this Nation's small businesses. Small businesses are the \njob creators in our economy. Indeed, small businesses are the backbone \nof America. Highlands Union Bank is committed to serving small \nbusiness, and providing opportunities for entrepreneurs. This financial \ninstitution believes in its community, and in helping people.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mr. Sam Neese, CEO, for \nthis outstanding recognition from the Small Business Administration. I \nalso extend my best wishes to the staff, because I know full well they \nrightfully share in this honor. Highlands Union Bank is a shining \nexample for banks across the country and I am proud to salute this \nVirginia institution for its hard work and accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4630-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOLY CROSS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this afternoon I had the privilege \nof meeting with 37 seventh-grade students from Holy Cross Elementary \nSchool in Dover, DE. Talking with these bright and energetic young \npeople on the steps of the Capitol reminded me that I was about their \nage when I first began to develop an interest in government and \nconsider a career in public service.\n  While we talked out there on this beautiful spring day, I noticed \nthat I was not alone. A number of my colleagues were similarly engaged \nwith young people from their own States.\n  Today the Senate passed important legislation on immigration reform, \nlegislation which will have a profound impact upon the communities in \nwhich these young people are growing up. And I am glad that the \nstudents from Holy Cross had the opportunity to witness some of this \nimportant debate. It provides them with the opportunity to learn that \nwhat we do here has a real-life effect upon many, many Americans. It \nreinforces that point that young people, whether they are old enough to \nvote or not, have a stake in keeping abreast of public affairs, because \nit is their communities', their States', and their Nation's future that \nis being shaped by the actions we take here in the Halls of Congress.\n  It will not be too many years before those seventh-graders are our \nleading businessmen, teachers, doctors, and even Senators, and I think \nthere are few things we as public officials can do that are as \nimportant as spending time with the young people who are the future of \nthis country. I have always said that education is the best investment \nAmerica can make, and as public servants, I believe we have a \nresponsibility to encourage that investment whenever possible.\n  Beyond that, I honestly believe that spending time with bright, \nenergetic, and thoughtful young people does us a lot of good. Because I \nnever come away from meeting them without gaining a fresh perspective \non some of the important questions and issues which confront us today. \nMy meeting with the students from Holy Cross was no exception, and I am \ngrateful to Ms. Marylou Soltys and Ms. Marie McCann and the 13 parent \nchaperones for bringing their students to Washington. I hope that they \nall enjoyed their visit, and benefited from our conversation, as much \nas I did.\n  I hope to see the day when they return to Washington as leaders in \nindustry, education, medicine, and government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4630-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4630-S4631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CYCLE OF VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, Derrick Robie's tiny, battered body \nwas discovered in the afternoon of August 2, 1993. The small town was \nshocked to find\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nthat 13-year-old Eric Smith had murdered this 4-year-old child.\n  Investigators found an indicator of violent crime in Eric Smith's \nbehavioral pattern: 1 year prior to killing Derrick Robie, Eric had \nstrangled his neighbor's cat with a hose clamp. At the time, no one \npaid much attention to this so-called prank.\n  Mr. President, it is time that we took a serious look at animal abuse \nand it's link to crimes against people. Perpetrators of serious animal \nabuse often lack empathy and respect for life in general. The absence \nof empathy is often manifested by striking, torturing and abusing an \ninnocent animal. Abusing animals is a despicable act, and psychologists \nand criminologists tell us those who lack empathy for animals may also \nlack empathy for humans. As a result they may be predisposed to other \nviolent behavior.\n  Violence begets violence. Child, spousal, and elder abuse are \nunfortunately too commonplace in our society. Often physical abuse is \ncoupled with sexual abuse against a family member. Aggression is passed \nfrom one generation to another. In a hostile home environment, children \noften mimic their parents' abusive behavior. They become abusive to \nothers, including the family pet, and learn that violence and cruelty \nare a way of life. Unless intervention occurs, this child is likely to \ncontinue violent acts to others, perhaps become an abusive spouse, and \npossibly commit other criminal acts.\n  The National Research Council and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nagree that cruelty to animals is one childhood behavior that is a \npowerful indicator of violence elsewhere in the perpetrator's life. \nThere is a strong probability that youths who abuse animals are \nthemselves victims and perpetrators of violence.\n  Dr. Frank Ascione of Utah State University has been conducting \nresearch on the animal-people abuse phenomenon for more than 15 years. \nHe has studied the common roots of violence toward people and animals \nand has found a strong correlation between animal abuse and people \nabuse. He is a leader among many researchers who have been \nscientifically studying this phenomenon since the 1970's. One study of \n38 abuse victims at a crisis shelter found nearly 75 percent of women \nwith pets reported their partner had threatened, hurt, or killed the \nanimal. Researchers in child abuse cases found that in 88 percent of \nthese family situations, the pet was also abused.\n  Violence is not an isolated event and animal abuse is often part of a \nlarger cycle of violence. For this reason, violence toward animals must \nbe taken much more seriously. Cruelty to animals can be a predictor of \nfuture violence and an indicator of the violence already in the \nperpetrator's life.\n  Experts in the family violence field instruct us to treat a single \nact of violence as indicators of past and future violence. Our public \nsupport systems must be coordinated so when an adult or child abuses an \nanimal, the animal control officer will notify other public health \nofficials to determine whether there is evidence of child, spousal or \nelder abuse. The perpetrator of animal or people abuse may, himself, be \na victim of sexual or other abuse. Further, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation has identified animal abuse as one of a cluster of \njuvenile behaviors that could suggest serious violent behavior later in \nlife.\n  The good news is that experts are finding that compassion and empathy \ncan be taught. Various schools across the country have recognized the \nlinkage of animal and people violence. They have added specialized \nhumane education to their curriculum in order to teach compassion and \nempathy.\n  In 1994 the National Research Council released a comprehensive study \non understand and preventing violence, showing that childhood behavior \nis more important than teenage behavior in predicting future violent \nbehavior. The report suggests that early prevention efforts have a \ngreater potential for reducing adult crime than criminal sanctions \napplied later in life.\n  Cities and towns across the country are beginning to recognize the \npotential for further violence in the link between animal abuses and \nother abuses. Last year the city of San Diego enacted an unprecedented \ninteragency agreement, requiring its children's services agencies to \nreport to animal control officials suspected instances of animal abuse \nwithin 24 hours of becoming aware of it. Further, the animal control \nofficers must report suspected child abuse to the proper authorities. \nThese workers are cross trained to recognize signs of abuse in animals \nand people.\n  Other cities and States are strengthening penalties for animal abuse \nas well as requiring mental health care to be administered to the \nperpetrators of animal abuse. There is much to be done, and progress \nbegins when those of authority become educated on the significance of \nanimal cruelty.\n  It is the responsibility of our private and public support systems to \nrecognize signs that a child is in trouble and intervene in an \neffective manner. The FBI has identified clusters of traits indicating \nproblems: firesetting, cruelty to animals, truancy, et cetera. When \nthere is fire setting, there could be sexual abuse. When there is \ntruancy, there could be drug problems. When there is fighting, and \ncruelty to people or animals, the perpetrator could be responding to \nabuses he is suffering or has suffered. Most importantly these signals \nshould not be treated as isolated events, but rather trigger responses \nfrom the educators, criminal justice professionals, public health \nofficials, and animal control specialists, working in concert.\n  I believe that this cycle of violence merits further investigation. \nWe must recognize there is continuity between animal abuse and people \nabuse. Further research is needed on the predictable influences of \nviolence. Meanwhile, we must take action on the known data. \nIndividuals, the public health system, the criminal justice \nprofessionals, and the educators must coordinate their efforts in \nrecognizing, intervening and preventing future violent acts.\n  In order to encourage more in-depth analyses of this link between \npeople and animal violence, I have asked Attorney General Janet Reno to \naccelerate the Department of Justice's research in this area and to \ntake appropriate action based upon what we already know. One particular \narea of interest to me is the education of prosecuting attorneys and \njudges regarding the correlation of animal cruelty to other crimes. \nWhile experts agree the penalties for such abuse should be stiffened, \nthey are also in agreement that a mental health analysis of the entire \nfamily involved in an abusive case may be necessary.\n  I intend to continue my examination of violence prevention and I \nintend to continue investigating where the public support systems may \nbe further strengthened in breaking this cycle of violence. The \nprofessionals in criminal behavior are reporting to us that violence \nhas warning signals. It is our responsibility to recognize these \nsignals and intervene swiftly and effectively.\n  Admittedly this is not an exact science. Every child that abuses an \nanimal will not necessarily become a violent offender or become a \nvictim of violence himself, but it would be a mistake to dismiss the \nstrong correlation between animal and people violence. As a society, we \nmust realize that violent behavior rarely exists in a vacuum. We must \nrecognize at-risk youths who lack empathy and compassion for animals \nand other human beings. It is our responsibility to do all that we can \nto teach these personality attributes to our youth so that today's \nanimal abusers don't continue these despicable actions and become \ntomorrow's dangerous felons, thereby perpetuating the cycle of violence \nthat has taken such a devastating toll on our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4630-5", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4631-S4632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SUPPORT FOR JUNK GUN VIOLENCE PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

PAUL KREIDER FOR HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND YEARS OF GOOD \n                                SERVICE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this June, Dr. Paul Kreider will be \nretiring from his position as president of Mount Hood Community College \nin Gresham, OR. I would like to recognize Dr. Kreider for his \nexceptional accomplishments and leadership during his many years of \nservice.\n  Through strategic planning, program review and improvement, staff and \norganizational development, management information systems, and \nparticipatory decisionmaking, Dr. Kreider has played a significant role \nin the successful development of Mount Hood Community College. His \neffectiveness as a leader has not gone unnoticed; Dr. Kreider has \nreceived a number of awards, among them the National Council for \nResearch and Planning 1991 Management Recognition Award, the National \nACCT Marie Y. Martin CEO of the Year Award, and the National Council \nfor Staff, Program, and Organizational Development Leadership Award.\n  Dr. Kreider's leadership did not stop at the doors of Mount Hood \nCommunity College; he has extended his knowledge and expertise to \nothers in the community as well. In particular, he founded and chaired \nthe Consortium for Institutional Effectiveness and Student Success in \nthe Community College, an American Association Community Colleges-\naffiliated consortium. Additionally, he reached out to assist other \ncommunity colleges in developing assessment tools to measure student \noutcomes, strategic planning, and program improvement.\n  Dr. Kreider remains quite active on State, national, and \ninternational levels. In the past, he served as president of the Board \nof Education Partners for International Cooperation, Inc. and the \nOregon Community College Presidents' Council. Presently, he sits on the \nboards of several organizations including the American Association of \nCommunity Colleges and Community Colleges for International \nDevelopment, Inc.\n  Again, I would like to both pay tribute to Dr. Kreider and \ncongratulate him for his accomplishments and contributions to the \neducational community. Mount Hood Community College, as well as Oregon \nat large, has most certainly benefited from his initiative and \nleadership. I wish him the best of luck in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4633-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4633-S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID IFSHIN\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, we laid to rest a dear \nfriend of mine, and of many of my colleagues, David Ifshin. His family \nhonored me by inviting me to be among the eulogists at David's funeral. \nI want to include in the Record a copy of my remarks so that those many \nAmericans who review our proceedings will know that a good and much \nloved man and an authentic American patriot has been lost to us.\n  I ask that those remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n             Eulogy for David Ifshin by Senator John McCain\n\n       It has become a common appeal of eulogists for the bereaved \n     to celebrate the life rather than mourn the passing of the \n     loved one to whom we bid goodbye. It is a hopeful and well-\n     intended appeal. Gathering in sorrow is not, I suspect, what \n     David Ifshin would have us do on this occasion. But he was \n     such a lovely guy, and his company such a blessing, that the \n     loss of him is a great weight which only a word from David \n     could lift from my heart today.\n       Yet, the sadness of this day will not long intrude on our \n     memories of David; memories which illuminate for me a way to \n     live my own life. As we grow older, we all learn how brief a \n     moment life is. David's was far too brief, but he filled his \n     moment with so much passion and love and with such a \n     ceaseless striving for grace that it would exhaust the lives \n     of lesser men who manage to stay among us for more years than \n     David could. Few people, having reached the end of a long \n     life, will have done as much good, lived with grater dignity, \n     deserved more honor, bestowed more love, traveled as far as \n     David Ifshin did in his forty-seven years.\n       David had an uncommon capacity for personal growth. When I \n     was in his company, I always had a sense that David derived \n     much of his own happiness from discovering virtue in others. \n     And I believe those discoveries made him grow. They nourished \n     his own humanity.\n       David was a patriot because he found, as all patriots must, \n     virtue in his country's cause. He always felt passionate \n     about his country. But when we are young our passion is not \n     always governed by wisdom gained from long experience, and, \n     thus, is often indiscriminate in the emotions it animates. \n     While living in Israel David discovered his country's virtue, \n     and his love of country became the object of his enlightened \n     passion.\n       David also possessed an animating love of justice. He \n     worked to make our society more just, and he sought justice \n     for those who were not blessed to live in this country. Even \n     more importantly, he always tried in his personal \n     relationships to do justice to others. And that explains why, \n     no matter where his reason and his love took him, David never \n     left a friend behind.\n       We friends of David are cast across the spectrum of \n     contemporary American politics. Some may think that David and \n     I became friends because David's political views became more \n     compatible with my own. That is not really true. My regard \n     for David is more personal then political affinity. We \n     remained partisans in different camps. What David taught me, \n     and, I suspect, what he taught a great many people, was how \n     narrow are the differences that separate us in a society \n     united in its regard for justice, in a country in love with \n     liberty.\n       In this town, we accentuate our political differences to \n     advance our respective agendas and our professional \n     ambitions. David kept such things in perspective. He was \n     loyal to his political beliefs, but he pledged a greater \n     devotion to the bonds of friendship and love that connected \n     him to so many people of diverse backgrounds, creeds and \n     aspirations.\n       He was extraordinarily generous in his regard for others' \n     virtues, and self-effacing in considering his own attributes. \n     Because of that capacity, I always felt in David's company \n     that I was in the presence of a better man.\n       Regrettably, it was not human virtue, but human weakness \n     which created the occasion for me to publicly declare my \n     personal regard for David. Some people who did not know David \n     based their judgment of his character in their resentment \n     over one brief episode in David's life. I am ashamed to admit \n     that I once made the same mistake. My subsequent discovery of \n     David's true character taught me to refrain in future from \n     using snapshots of another's life as the full measure of a \n     person's value. That was a valuable lesson to learn, and I am \n     indebted to David for having taught it to me.\n       To honor that debt, I tried to impart the lesson to others \n     who had rushed to a wrong judgment of David. Three years ago, \n     I went to the Senate floor to respond to a protest at the \n     Vietnam War Memorial. One of the protestors had held up a \n     sign questioning David's patriotism and his association with \n     the President. I wanted the protestors to know that they were \n     bearing false witness against a good man. That this small \n     gesture meant so much to David meant even more to me. David \n     Ifshin was my friend, and his friendship honored me, and \n     honors me still.\n       Most of the important and lasting friendships I have made \n     in my life were formed in the shared experience of war. David \n     and I did not fight a war together, but neither did we fight \n     a war against each other. We chose instead to make a peace \n     together.\n       I found little to differentiate the quality of our \n     friendship from the quality of those that were begun in \n     Vietnam. I learned about courage, honor and kindness from all \n     my friendships. From David, I learned to look for virtue in \n     others, and I also learned the futility\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\n     of looking back in anger. I'm a better man for the \n     experience.\n       I think that as David approached the closing of his life he \n     could look back with pride, and with gratitude, that his life \n     was not distinguished by its brevity, but by its richness, by \n     the love of his beautiful family, and by the tender regard in \n     which he was held by so many people who knew a good man when \n     they saw him. We are all better people for having been \n     blessed by David Ifshin's friendship.\n       Gail, Jake, Ben and Chloe, Mr. and Mrs. Ifshin, thank you \n     for so generously sharing David with the rest of us. Please \n     know that the day will arrive when your deep hurt subsides, \n     when the memory of David, and the bright and gentle moments \n     you shared with him lifts your hearts again. He will be with \n     you always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4633-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4634-S4636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMERCE SECRETARY RONALD H. BROWN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as we return to session today it \nis spring in Washington. The blossoms are out. It is a beautiful time, \nand yet I am sure the experience I had in flying back with my family \nyesterday was similar to what others returning yesterday experienced: \nIt brought home the terrible tragedy that occurred while we were away--\nthe plane that went down in Croatia carrying Secretary of Commerce Ron \nBrown and so many others. It filled me with a sense of loss again \nyesterday and today.\n  I am proud that I had the chance to work with Ron Brown during his \nall too short tenure at the Commerce Department. I enjoyed working with \nRon Brown at various stages of his career-- as an attorney, as a \nleading Democratic activist, as chairman of the Democratic National \nCommittee, and most closely and, I think, most creatively in these last \n3 years as Secretary of Commerce. I am honored that I can call him a \nfriend. We are all going to miss him--it's painful to think that my \nstaff and I won't have the sheer fun of working with him again--and the \ncountry will miss him even more. I have the greatest respect for him, \nas have so many others, as a wonderful, warm human being and as a \nleader who had a clear-eyed vision of how to make our people and our \ncountry better.\n  You never think of a man in the prime of life not being here. In a \nway, it is death that forces you to appreciate even more the great \nskills and the service that Ron Brown, displayed for our benefit.\n  Ron Brown truly loved the job he had at Commerce. He always managed \nto fit himself well to the tasks he undertook, wherever he was, but \nthis job really did fit him like a glove, from the moment he took it. \nHe understood as soon as he started the job that the mission of the \nDepartment of Commerce is to promote economic growth, that it is job \ncreation. He understood from his own experience the wide-open nature of \nour market system and that the market and its upward mobility was the \nunique way America had for creating opportunity for its citizens.\n  Ron Brown never saw the business community as an enemy, he saw it as \nan ally in expanding opportunity, and he threw himself into this job \nwith a single-mindedness and joyous commitment to moving the system, \nthe economic system, so that it would deliver for all Americans.\n  Against this background, I want to talk about two efforts he spent \nhis time on at Commerce that I think were critical. I believe that they \nwere truly extraordinary, and set a new performance standard for our \nGovernment's relationship with the private sector.\n\n\n                                Exports\n\n  The first has been written about extensively in the days since his \ndeath, and even over the preceding 3 years: The incredible export \npromotion operation he put together at Commerce. But I do not think \nthat enough has been said about why it was so important.\n  Until the mid-1970's, the United States economy was on top of the \nworld, dominating it. While our economic rivals, led particularly by \nJapan, were figuring out that selling advanced manufactured goods for \nexport was the key to economic growth and raising the living standards \nof people back home, our Government was coasting on our success. We \nwere not paying attention to the emerging economic message.\n  Other countries built export promotion machines--and they were \nmachines--through the most intimate and comprehensive alliances between \nbusiness and government, the private sector and the public sector. But \nour Government paid too little attention to the need to build these \nalliances. American businesses--and I heard this repeatedly from \nbusiness executives in Connecticut--would go abroad to compete, and \nthey would see what the business-government alliances of our \ncompetitors were doing for export promotion.\n  I remember being told a story by the executive of one of the \ncompanies in Connecticut; his firm was competing against two other \ncompanies, one from Asia and one from Europe, for a very large order in \na foreign country. He went over there to participate in simultaneous \nbidding among the three business competitors. This company from \nConnecticut, a big company, had its executives and lawyers in one room. \nBut in the other two rooms, the executives and representatives of the \nAsian company and of the European company were teamed up with a \nrepresentatives of the Asian government and of the European government, \nrespectively. The government representatives were combining with their \ncompanies to enhance their firms' offers. It made the contest unequal. \nThe Connecticut company did not get the contract. We lost an \nopportunity and jobs.\n  The State Department, I am afraid, continued to treat American \nbusiness as if it had to be held at arm's length. Too many \nadministrations went along with that distant attitude. Preoccupied with \nthe end of the cold war and retaining the political alliances required \nfor it, the State Department embraced a traditional and outmoded notion \nof what foreign policy was all about, of what mattered to people here \nat home. It missed what was happening in both the world economy and the \nAmerican economy, which has been a grave error. It made export \npromotion a low priority, while our rivals made it the top priority. \nThe State Department treated U.S. business like pariahs, it was \n``Upstairs-Downstairs''--trade was beneath our diplomatic priorities.\n  This hasn't ended. A Business Week editorial this week notes that, \n``The U.S. foreign policy and security elite believe security should be \ndivorced from economic issues. Some go so far as to suggest that \nproviding security is a perk of global power.'' It concludes, ``We \ndon't. American workers can't be expected to suffer economically to \nprotect [other nations] from one another.'' Ron Brown shared this view, \nand he was the new momentum for bringing our economy into foreign \nrelations. The President was his staunch ally on this effort, \nand helped him force change in this area.\n\n  Ron Brown, working with President Clinton, understood that we had to \ncreate a central position in our foreign policy for our economic \npolicy. Export promotion had to be at the core of our international \noutreach. It was not a bad thing, but, in fact, it was a very good \nthing, if the President visited a foreign country with the Secretary of \nCommerce and the issues they discussed with the leadership of that \nforeign country included buying American goods.\n  I come from a very export-oriented State. In fact, it has the highest \nlevel of exports per capita of any State in the country. We know that \nexports create jobs, high-paying manufacturing jobs, and that each \nmanufacturing job has an economic multiplier effect, creating a chain \nof goods and services behind it, longer by far than other types of \njobs.\n  The sad fact is that we have been disinvesting in manufacturing since \nthe mid-1970s, even though we need these kinds of jobs more than ever \nto develop a strong economy and a better standard of living for our \npeople which will continue America as the land of opportunity. Ron \nBrown, as Secretary of Commerce, understood this from the beginning of \nhis service.\n  When he began his export promotion effort, within days of arriving at \nthe Commerce Department, the leaders of the American business community \nthat I spoke to--and I particularly heard this from heads of firms in \nConnecticut--were in disbelief. Someone was finally paying attention to \ntheir priorities. Somebody was finally trying to help them pull \ntogether an American governmental countermovement to the vast efforts \nrival countries and their businesses had been mounting for decades, to \ntake jobs and exports away\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\nfrom us. Finally, someone with real power, the Secretary of Commerce, \nunderstood the problem. At the same time, in the beginning, many in the \nbusiness community were skeptical whether Ron Brown could make all this \nhappen.\n  But he proved them wrong, to their delight. He was great at this. \nTrained as a lawyer and always a superb advocate, he used those skills \non behalf of American businesses throughout the world. He knew how to \nrun campaigns, and he ran this export operation like a campaign, which \nis exactly what it is. Nobody had ever done this before in the way that \nSecretary Brown did, and our country has never benefited as much before \nas we did from his service.\n  He even set up, in the Commerce Department, something like a campaign \nwar room, where he would get reports on economic opportunities opening \nup around the world to sell American products and create American \njobs--an early warning system. Then the letters and the phone calls \nwould start flying--Ron Brown was a phone wizard, it was a technology \ninvented for him, he was forever reaching out to touch some business \nleader or a head of State abroad. He followed those calls with visits, \nsuch as the one he was on when his life ended. He was so enormously \nskilled, he was so hard working, he so absolutely and irresistibly \nlikable, he had such a great smiling charm, such sharp intelligence, he \nwas such fun, he had such energy.\n  The customers loved his performance. They all knew he spoke directly \nto and for the President of the United States, and that he would relay \ntheir messages back to the White House. Even our friends in Japan, who \nhave systematically been denying entry for too many United States \nproducts for too long, liked him, as he worked very hard at breaking \ndown their barriers.\n  U.S. business strongly appreciated his commitment to them, his \naccomplishments. He was a terrific political operator in the very best \nsense of this phrase--he was mobilizing the political system to serve \nthe public's needs. The business community understood this and \nrespected it deeply--I've heard this again and again from U.S. \ncompanies. Ron Brown was a new kind of life force to them and they had \ngreat affection for him.\n  Ron Brown and his team's export success was only beginning when he \nleft us, because the historic changes he was starting are a long-term \nproject. But this new direction was a very important accomplishment for \nAmerica. A major job for Secretaries of Commerce from now on will be to \npromote U.S. goods, not just in the offhanded, random way of the past, \nbut with all the force of Ron Brown's campaigns, or they will be judged \nfailures. From now on, the Federal Government is going to have to get \ndown and get to work with business selling our economy. It's about \ntime, but it took Ron Brown to show us how to do it. Ron Brown has set \nan entirely new standard for the country by which all that come after \nhim will be judged.\n\n\n                               Innovation\n\n  A second remarkable thing he did as Commerce Secretary was to fight \nfor innovation. This has been almost nowhere mentioned in the press, \nand it is not well understood by the public or the fourth estate or \nCongress. But Ron Brown understood that for the American dream of \nopportunity to be sustained for a new generation, a higher level of \neconomic growth was crucial. In addition to exports, he concentrated on \nanother ingredient of that strategy, innovation. Even before he was \nsworn in as Commerce Secretary, his friend George Fisher, then \npresident of Motorola and now of Kodak, invited him to speak to a \nleading group of business thinkers, the Council on Competitiveness. Ron \nBrown set out in that speech an aggressive agenda of technology \ndevelopment and promotion. He recognized that innovation has been the \ngreat American competitive advantage for generations, that it is now \nunder attack as our competitors expand, and that it has to be renewed \nif we are going to keep expanding our economy. Economists estimate that \ntechnology development--coupled with a technologically trained work \nforce--has accounted for 80 percent of the increase in United States \nproductivity and wealth for most of this century.\n\n\n                  Innovation is our bread and butter.\n\n  Brown understood that since the Second World War, the Federal \nGovernment has backed most of the long term research and development \nand applied R that has gone on in the U.S., while business focused on \nshorter term product development. That is an economic reality--the risk \nand cost of R means that the private sector must focus on what it can \nraise capital for--shorter term products. It's a classic market failure \nproblem, and until recently Congress on a bipartisan basis has \nsupported the need for governmental support of innovation. Brown picked \nup a series of small technology and technology extension programs that \nhad been quietly started at Commerce in previous administrations, and \nmade them a central focus. With an able team around him, he made the \nCommerce Department the administration's leader in civilian technology \ndevelopment, and supported a new system of cooperative R development \nwith business, requiring business to match Federal funding to ensure \nsounder Government R investments and leveraging Federal research \ndollars. He also helped expand a new system of manufacturing extension \ncenters around the country, now in over 30 States, to bring advanced \nmanufacturing techniques and technology to smaller and mid-sized \nmanufacturers desperately in need of it to be able to compete with \nglobal competitors. In a time of budget cutting, he successfully found \nthe resources to build these programs. He was also head of the \nadministration's Information Infrastructure task force, formulating \npolicies on the new information highway and how to expand our \npopulation's access to it.\n\n  He was both an innovator and an innovation supporter, and was moving \nquickly toward making the Commerce Department what it long should have \nbeen: A department for trade and technology, where each of these two \nsides of the department provides synergy for the other. It was becoming \nan agency which provided governmental leadership in these two areas in \nsupport of the private sector, not trying to dominate it, and much \nstronger because of this.\n  Ron Brown's clear success, of course, led to the usual Washington \npolitical reaction against signs of creativity. Unfortunately, for too \nmuch of this past year he had to spend time deftly deflecting attacks \non the existence of the Commerce Department. But he had helped make it \ninto an instrument for growth and job creation, and his efforts had \nstrong support among business and work force constituencies. He had \nbegun the process to put the Commerce Department on the map as a unique \nAmerican engine to support opportunity and growth in America. He had a \ngreat dream for his agency, and I respect that dream very much. I, for \none, pledge to him that I am not going to sit here in this body and let \nit get dismantled.\n\n\n                                barriers\n\n  I have discussed his innovations at Commerce, but I want to raise an \nadditional subject. Much was said in the aftermath of Ron Brown's \ntragic death about his role as a bridge builder. I say he was also a \nbarrier breaker. I think sometimes about Chuck Yeager and how he felt \npiloting his X-1 rocket plane when he first broke the sound barrier. \nRon Brown was a great barrier-breaker, too, our first African-American \nto achieve many things. While Chuck Yeager's courage enabled him to \nbreak his barrier, the sound barrier remained and had to be broken \nagain by countless other pilots. Ron Brown's barrier-breaking was \ndifferent. It also required courage, but he had a way of breaking \nbarriers that began to erase them. He would get through a barrier in \nhis wonderful, excited, buoyant way, and he would make everyone who \nwatched him think, there goes another one, and why didn't we do that \nlong ago? When Ron Brown became Commerce Secretary, many were expecting \nthe President to name an experienced business leader, and were \ndisappointed when he named a friend and politician. Ron Brown's \noutstanding performance as Commerce Secretary, and the depth of support \nhe built in the business community, was unlike anything any Commerce \nSecretary has been able to do before. We watched and thought, there he \ngoes through another barrier, the biggest he had ever faced.\n  In so doing, Ron Brown broke an even bigger barrier. America has been \nblessed with a long line of outstanding\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\nAfrican-American leaders. Many of those leaders have been seen as \nleaders of the African-American community. Ron Brown was intensely \nloyal to his African-American roots, but, like Colin Powell, he was \nalso a national leader, an American leader who was clearly understood, \nin his great energetic way, to be battling for the well-being of every \nAmerican.\n  In his struggle to save the Commerce Department over the last year, \nRon Brown often compared the abolition of the Department to unilateral \ndisarmament in the international economic wars of today. In closing, I \nnote that all around our city of Washington are statues of our great \nmilitary heros. Now we are engaged in a different kind of global \nconflict: an economic global conflict. If we ever start building \nstatues for those who have served courageously and with great success \nin this economic battle for the opportunity and the well-being of our \npeople, we ought to erect a statue to Ron Brown as one of the finest of \nthose leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4634-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE MARK AND GARY BEEF PLEDGE\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Allowing haying and \ngrazing on CRP acres is necessary to alleviate the high feed costs and \na large beef purchase by the U.S. Government should help turn the tide.\n  Speaking of helping to turn the tide, a farm broadcasting duo in \ncentral Iowa has embarked on a campaign to promote beef consumption in \nthe State of Iowa. Gary Wergin and Mark Pearson of WHO-Radio in Des \nMoines, IA are calling on their Heartland listeners to take a pledge. \nAs one who proudly and easily accepted their challenge to eat just one \nmore serving of beef a week, I submit ``The Mark and Gary Beef Pledge'' \ninto the Congressional Record.

Mr. President, in 10 days it will be Mother's Day. This \nmeans something precious to mothers, grandmothers, and expectant \nmothers in this country. I, along with many others, also think it means \nsomething special to the Senate. It is our opportunity to take up and \npass the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996.\n  I have several letters with me today. These were addressed to the \nmajority leader and the minority leader of the Senate. Each letter \nrespectfully requests that a date for Senate floor action and a vote on \nthe newborns bill be scheduled as soon as possible. This is what we can \ndo for mothers and their families this Mother's Day.\n  Let me remind us all of the history of the newborns bill. Last year, \nmany of us began to hear disturbing stories about mothers and babies \nbeing forced to leave the hospital too soon after childbirth.\n  While we can all agree that sometimes it makes good medical sense for \nmothers and babies to go home quickly, we have to recognize that, \ntragically, many times it is not good sense. We have been moved and \nsaddened to learn of the deaths of babies and of serious and sometimes \nlifelong threats to their health and normal development that come from \nleaving the hospital too soon after childbirth.\n  Many of us began to hear that the decision about whether or not a \nmother and her baby should leave the hospital was being made by the \nwrong people. We began to hear that those who should make this \ndecision, the doctor or the health care practitioner attending the \nmother and baby, were in fact not making that decision. Instead, the \ndecision forcing a woman to leave the hospital in less than 24 hours \nafter childbirth was being made by a clerk at an insurance company \nshaving costs and shortening lives.\n  I think many of us began to realize that this was the moment in a \nsituation just like this when Government should step in to try to \nprovide protection to mothers and babies. We all know the health care \nenvironment has changed, and changed with startling speed, over the \nlast couple of years. Such a massive, fast change, even when positive, \nalways creates instability and temporary imbalances. On occasion, it \ncreates a serious problem. This is a serious problem--forcing women out \nof hospitals after giving childbirth in less than 24 hours.\n  With this background, Senator Kassebaum and I introduced the \nNewborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, S. 969, about a year \nago--last June. This is a bill that respects the authority of doctors \nand other health care practitioners, in consultation with mothers, to \nmake health care decisions about the length of time their patient \nshould stay in the hospital following childbirth. This is a bill that \nrespects the flexibility that health plans need to manage care \nefficiently in our rapidly changing health care environment.\n\n  Mr. President, the newborns act creates what my colleague and \ncosponsor on this bill, Doctor and Senator Frist has called a safe \nhaven of time--a safe haven of time for doctors, mothers, and babies, \n48 hours minimum for normal childbirth, 96 hours minimum for Cesarean \nsections. Under this bill, doctors, nurse practitioners, nurse \nmidwives, and nurses will all be free to do their job. Mothers will be \nrelieved of the fear that they may be sent home too early before their \nbabies are stable and they are prepared physically and emotionally. \nNewborns will be watched\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\nand tested and assisted with their job of adapting to this world.\n  When it is appropriate for mothers and newborns to go home before the \nend of a 48-hour period or a 96-hour safe haven, they will go home--if \nit is appropriate, they will go home. Followup care will be required \nand studied in greater depth because of the fine amendment that Senator \nDeWine of Ohio was able to add.\n  Please understand that this bill does not require that all mothers \nstay in the hospital for a specified length of time any more than it \nrequires all mothers to give birth in hospitals. A woman, in \nconsultation with her doctor, may decide to leave the hospital before \n48 hours, but in no event can an insurance company require that she \nleave in less than 48 hours.\n  Mr. President, April 17, 1996, is an important day for the Senate. \nThe Labor and Human Resources Committee held a markup on the newborns \nbill and, after careful consideration, the committee members voted \noverwhelmingly to send the bill to the full Senate.\n  What I would like to do is return to the letters that are en route to \nthe distinguished Senators from Kansas and South Dakota. One letter \nmakes a bit of history. Six different professional medical groups have \nall signed the same letter asking for full Senate action in behalf of \nmothers and newborns. They are the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Nurses Association, the Association \nof Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, all joined by \nthe March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. All have joined together \nto say:\n\n       As organizations representing health care professionals and \n     advocates committed to quality maternity care, we urge you to \n     schedule for consideration by the full Senate S. 969. We ask \n     you to lend your leadership to guarantee that women and their \n     newborns receive adequate insurance coverage at one of the \n     most important times in their lives.\n\n  Mr. President, this is remarkable unity and should inspire us in the \nSenate to do the same and take action.\n  A second letter comes from more than 30 cosponsors and supporters of \nthe Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act. This letter says many \nof the same things:\n\n       Let us move on this bill. Newborns and their mothers need \n     it. It is very important. We hope--\n\n  The letter goes on to say--\n\n     we will be able to inform hundreds of thousands of interested \n     mothers by Mother's Day when this vote will occur.\n\n  Several of our women colleagues in the Senate--in fact, all of them--\nhave agreed to sign a third letter. Let me quote a few words from it. \nIt simply says: ``What better Mother's Day gift can we give to new \nmothers than passing this bill?''\n  A fourth letter comes from the Center for Patient Advocacy, a \nnonpartisan organization devoted to quality of care for patients. They \nwrite and say much the same thing. They say pass the newborn bill. Pass \nit so that by Mother's Day we can assure mothers that they will be \ntaken care of.\n  Finally, I want to mention what I believe are the most important \nletters and pieces of correspondence of all. Those are from the more \nthan 83,000--83,000 men and women, doctors and nurses, grandparents and \nfamilies who have written my office alone to support this bill--83,000.\n  The Baumans in my State of New Jersey, the Drumms of Philadelphia, \nthe Joneses of New York, the Avandoglios of Tennessee, are just a few \nof the families who have generously shared their personal experience \nand support for this bill.\n  The Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act has earned \nunprecedented, unified, professional support from doctors and prompted \nmany thousands of Americans to write us in support of this bill. The \nbill has been carefully developed with input from all interested \nparties on both sides of the aisle and throughout the community. It has \npassed the wise review of the Labor Committee and passed with flying \ncolors.\n  Many in the Senate have indicated their support. I hope we will honor \nthe occasion of Mother's Day and the voice of so many Americans by \nannouncing as soon as possible that the Senate will vote on this bill \nand, in passing this bill, will say to mothers that now we understand \nthat giving birth deserves the respect that the insurance industry has \nfailed to give it in requiring women to leave hospitals in less than 24 \nhours.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been 39 months since President \nClinton outlined his welfare reform goals to the American people. But \nhe has failed to deliver on his promise. Welfare reform was not enacted \nin 1993 nor in 1994.\n  Sixteen months ago, President Clinton declared at a joint session of \nCongress that, ``Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common \nresponsibility than our failed welfare system. It rewards welfare over \nwork. It undermines family values.''\n  As a matter of record, the new Republican Congress passed welfare \nreform twice in 1995.\n  H.R. 4, the ``Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of \n1995,'' received bipartisan support in both the House and Senate as it \nwas being drafted. But the President rejected this bipartisan approach. \nIt has now been 16 weeks since he vetoed authentic welfare reform \nlegislation for the second time.\n  Mr. President, few people have dared to look inside H.R. 4 as it was, \nafter all, a complex bill reflecting a complex welfare system. Today, I \nwould like to recommend a recent article on the Republican welfare \nproposal. The article describes how the bill incorporates three \ndifferent conservative approaches to solving the problems which plague \nour failed welfare system. Let me quote from the conclusion of the \narticle entitled, ``Welfare Fixers.''\n\n       What is especially interesting about the three conservative \n     strands of thought about welfare is that despite the \n     theoretical differences among them, together they provide a \n     coherent guide as to how to fix a broken system. As men are \n     not angels, Charles Murray's negative incentives have their \n     place. But neither are men brutes, and hence something more \n     is needed than a ``technology'' of behavioral change. As \n     Marvin Olasky reminds us, a rebirth of the spirit of \n     religious charity would change many lives for the better. And \n     as Lawrence Mead reminds us, in a commercial republic such as \n     ours, work is the proper condition for all who are able.\n\n  The article goes on to say that:\n\n       Indeed, the politicians have seen the big picture in a way \n     that is perhaps not so easy for the lone social thinker to \n     do. The Republican welfare-reform bills in Congress, along \n     with the many state plans being put into effect by Republican \n     governors, make use of Murray's incentives, Olasky's \n     religious charities, and Mead's workfare. If there are \n     theoretical and practical difficulties with each of these \n     approaches, it is precisely the combination that may make \n     conservative welfare reform politically palatable and even, \n     in the end, effective.\n\n  Mr. President, you might expect such praise to come out of the \nHeritage Foundation or the National Review or another prestigious \nconservative organization. However, this particular article was written \nby Adam Wolfson, the Executive Editor of the Public Interest and was \njust published in this month's edition of Commentary.\n  Republicans understand, and H.R. 4 reflects the reality, that there \nis not a singular approach to welfare reform. We believe that if \nfamilies are going to escape from the vicious cycle of dependency, they \nmust be enabled to find their own way out. Welfare reform is not simple \nbecause human beings are complex.\n  The goal of welfare reform for all families to leave welfare.\n  But the path on how they get there is not necessarily a straight \nline. Nor, under the Republican approach, must all families follow the \nsame path.\n  In contrast, this is precisely why Washington will never be able to \nend welfare as we know it. The bureaucrats in Washington see people \nonly in terms of numbers, not as individuals. In the tradition of \nscientific management, everything must be reduced to bureaucratic \nprocedures and mathematical equations.\n  But by vetoing welfare reform, the President ignored the most \nimportant number of all. That is, if we do nothing, the number of \nchildren on welfare will increase in the coming years.\n  When he talks about work and family values, President Clinton may \ntalk like a Republican, or at least like a\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\nNew Democrat. But he acts like an old bureaucrat by opposing reforms \nwhich are not controlled by Washington. By his vetoes, he is protecting \nthe bureaucracy and accepting the status quo in which more children \nwill fall into the trap of dependency.\n  The causes and cures of poverty involve some of the most intimate \nacts in human behavior. What many families on welfare need cannot be \nsent through the mail nor reproduced in the Federal Register.\n  There is no flaw in admitting that we do not understand how or why \nindividuals will respond to the various incentives and sanctions \npresent in every day life in modern society. The mistake is believing, \nespecially after 30 years of evidence to the contrary, that Washington \ndoes know how to apply these incentives and sanctions to the lives of \nmillions of people.\n  Under the present system, welfare dependency is allowed to become a \npermanent condition. This is one of the cruelest features of the \nwelfare system because it saps the human spirit.\n  The true measure of success will be whether the timeless values of \nwork and family life are restored.\n  Only then while we help free families from the present welfare trap \nand save future generations from its effects. To do this, we must give \nthe State and local governments all of the tools they need to change \nthe existing welfare system. Different families have different needs.\n  These tools must include Medicaid, the largest welfare program. For \nsome families, the potential loss of the value of health care coverage \nlocks them into dependency.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Adam Wolfson's \narticle, ``Welfare Fixers,'' printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Commentary, Apr. 1996]\n\n                             Welfare Fixers\n\n                           (By Adam Wolfson)\n\n       In 1982, the journalist Ken Auletta defined the question of \n     the underclass: how do we explain why ``violence, arson, \n     hostility, and welfare dependency rose during a time when \n     unemployment dropped, official racial barriers were lowered, \n     and government assistance to the poor escalated''?\n       Indeed, government spending on welfare increased from about \n     $33 billion in 1964 to over $300 billion in 1992 (both \n     figures in 1992 dollars). During the Reagan and Bush years \n     alone, total welfare spending rose more than 50 percent. But \n     all the while, rates of poverty, illegitimacy, non-work, \n     crime, and family break-up got worse, not better. From 1965 \n     to 1990, the illegitimacy rate for blacks rose from 28 to 65 \n     percent, and for whites from 4 to 21 percent. Meanwhile, work \n     among the poor plummeted, to the point where today only about \n     11 percent of poor households are headed by a full-time \n     worker. For many, Aid to Families with Dependent Children \n     (AFDC)--what most of us think of when we speak of welfare--\n     has become a permanent condition, with over 50 percent of its \n     recipients remaining on the rolls for over ten years.\n       One thing, however, has changed. Since 1935, when AFDC was \n     first created, through President Lyndon Johnson's War on \n     Poverty in the 1960's, to Bill Clinton's 1992 promise to \n     ``end welfare as we know it,'' welfare innovation and welfare \n     reform were pretty much a Democratic affair. That is no \n     longer the case. When conservative Republicans gained control \n     of Congress in 1994, they also assumed a major share of \n     responsibility for the nation's welfare system and those \n     trapped in it.\n       How do they intend to proceed? As it happens, although most \n     conservatives agree on the permanent need to end welfare as a \n     federal entitlement, there have been three different and, to \n     some extent, rival schools of thought about how to reform the \n     system. All three have been incorporated in the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which formed the \n     basis of the Republican welfare bill that President Clinton \n     eventually vetoed this past January, and also in the many \n     state plans now being put into effect by such Republican \n     governors as Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of \n     Michigan. The three approaches therefore bear scrutiny, for \n     it is no exaggeration to say that the well-being of America's \n     welfare population, and indeed of American society, depends \n     upon the conceptual clarity with which we approach this long-\n     festering problem.\n       The most influential of the three schools is associated \n     preeminently with the name of Charles Murray, and its guiding \n     premise is that humans respond rationally to economic \n     incentives. It is a tribute to the sheer rhetorical force and \n     intellectual brilliance of Murray's extensive writings that, \n     although conservatives often tend to resist mechanistic views \n     of human nature, they have embraced this analysis almost \n     without reservation. The most important parts of the \n     Republican welfare bill, those dealing with ``personal \n     responsibility,'' are in fact based on Murray's logic. I am \n     referring in particular to those sections which attempt to \n     curb the high rates of family disintegration and out-of-\n     wedlock births by the application of negative economic \n     incentives. Under these provisions, states would be permitted \n     (though not required) to deny cash assistance to children \n     born out of wedlock to teenage mothers, and would also be \n     permitted (though again not required) to deny additional cash \n     assistance to mothers on welfare who continue to have more \n     children.\n       Why, Senator Daniel P. Moynihan asked in connection with \n     this aspect of the conservative reform effort, should \n     children have to pay for the sins of their fathers (and \n     mothers)? The answer is to be found in certain assumptions \n     that were first spelled out by Murray over a decade ago in \n     his now-classic book, Losing Ground: American Social Policy \n     1950-1980. The crucial passage appears midway through the \n     book:\n       ``It is not necessary to invoke the Zeitgeist of the \n     1960's, or changes in the work ethic, or racial differences, \n     or the complexities of post-industrial economies, in order to \n     explain . . . illegitimacy and welfare dependency. All were \n     results that could have been predicted . . . from the changes \n     that social policy made in the rewards and penalties, carrots \n     and sticks, that govern human behavior. All were rational \n     responses to changes in the rules of the game of surviving \n     and getting ahead.'' [Emphasis added]\n       In other words, according to Murray, the welfare state has \n     provided exactly the wrong incentives to the poor and the \n     underclass by rewarding non-work, family dissolution, and \n     out-of-wed-lock births. It follows that if we change the \n     rules of the game, behavior will change with it. Get rid of \n     the economic supports (e.g., AFDC) that enable poor single \n     mothers to support additional children, and they will \n     eventually either abstain from sex, or use birth control, or \n     (one supposes) have abortions.\n       There is much to Murray's argument. But implementing it \n     might also entail more than the American people and their \n     representatives are willing to swallow. The key to his \n     rationalist approach is ``the overriding threat, short-term \n     and tangible.'' Here is how he describes the threat in a \n     recent article on reducing illegitimacy:\n       ``A major change in the behavior of young women and the \n     adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect of \n     having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately, \n     tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else. . . . \n     Such a change will take place only when young people have it \n     drummed into their heads from their earliest memories that \n     having a baby without a husband entails awful consequences.''\n       Murray relies heavily on a calculus of pleasure and pain in \n     part because, as a libertarian, he sees no other way. Since \n     government ``does not have the right to prescribe how people \n     shall live or to prevent women from having babies,'' it is \n     left with no options for affecting people's lives other than \n     the tax code. But there is also a deeper reason for Murray's \n     reliance on what he labels ``the technology of changing \n     behavior.'' He thinks it the only effective means of training \n     the human animal. Thought he acknowledges the roles of \n     religion and morality in forming people's sensibilities and \n     attitudes, much of the force of these other agencies, he \n     writes, has always been ``underwritten by economics.''\n       It is perhaps this oddly materialist version of human \n     volition that has led some conservatives to look beyond \n     Murray for solutions to the welfare problem. What if, they \n     ask, gutting the welfare system does not have the desired \n     effect forthwith? It will take a very resolute legislator \n     indeed to go on applying negative incentives for as long as \n     it takes. And even if we concede that negative incentives \n     have their place in any plan of welfare reform, how can we \n     expect young people to aspire to the roles of motherhood and \n     fatherhood unless we offer a more elevated conception of \n     these roles in their own terms?\n       Interestingly enough, Murray himself wrote the preface to a \n     recent book, Marvin Olasky's The Tragedy of American \n     Compassion, which embodies an alternative to the \n     ``technology'' of behavior control. The book's legislative \n     impact has thus far been slight, but its influence can be \n     felt in measures that would authorize states to contract out \n     their welfare services to private religious charities and to \n     churches. Its stamp is also to be found on Republican efforts \n     to restore civil society, like Senator Dan Coats's Project \n     for American Renewal. The book has garnered the endorsements \n     of such heavyweights as William J. Bennett and Newt Gingrich, \n     and later this spring a more policy-oriented sequel will be \n     published by the Free Press under the title Renewing American \n     Compassion.\n       Though Olasky (who teaches at the University of Texas at \n     Austin) agrees with Murray that we should scrap the current \n     welfare system, his analysis of how we got where we are is \n     quite different from Murray's and, correctly understood, \n     leads down different paths. In fact, Olasky turns Murray's \n     thesis on its head. Although he acknowledges the impact of \n     economic incentives on people's behavior, in his view the \n     underlying forces are spiritual and, broadly speaking, \n     religious. Thus, according to Olasky, ``the key change of the \n     1960's'' was ``not so much new benefit programs [Murray's \n     claim] as a\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\n     change in consciousness concerning established ones, with \n     government officials approving and even advocating not only \n     larger payouts but a war on shame.''\n       To Olasky, American social-welfare policy has always \n     reflected the dominant theology of the day. In the 18th and \n     early 19th centuries, theology emphasized a merciful but just \n     God and a sinful human nature that only God's grace could \n     cure. This produced a hardheaded approach to social policy: \n     aid to the poor was given in kind, but not in cash; charity, \n     understood as ``suffering with'' the needy, was personal and \n     paternalistic; material aid was considered secondary to, and \n     dependent upon, saving souls; aid was for the ``deserving,'' \n     not the ``undeserving,'' poor.\n       But this Calvinist theology lost out in the late 19th \n     century to a universalistic, liberalized view that \n     ``emphasized God's love but not God's holiness,'' that \n     jettisoned belief in original sin for a Rousseau-like belief \n     in the natural goodness of man, and that essentially \n     secularized a whole range of Christian beliefs. The effects \n     on social policy were dramatic and devastating--and, in \n     Olasky's opinion, completely predictable. The state took over \n     the care of the poor, crowding out private charity. Shame and \n     the work ethic were supplanted by the attitude that the poor \n     have a constitutional right--that is, an entitlement--to \n     welfare. Emphasis shifted from improving the spiritual \n     conditions of the poor to improving their material \n     conditions. As Owen Lovejoy, president of the National \n     Conference of Social Work, put it in 1920, the goal would no \n     longer be private salvation but rather the creation of ``a \n     divine order on earth as it is in heaven.''\n       Olasky's history describes, in short, a descent, a fall \n     from grace. As a nation, he claims sweepingly, we have been \n     making war not on poverty but on God, and ``the corruption is \n     general.'' Therefore, although he too, like Murray, would \n     tear down the welfare state, he does not expect any sudden \n     alteration in behavior. Rather, he sees in the end of the \n     welfare state an opportunity for private charities, and in \n     particular private religious charities, to take over some of \n     the responsibilities of caring for the poor, especially in \n     the (for him) primary arena of their spiritual needs.\n       After all, writes Okasky, it was the federal government's \n     entry into the welfare arena that ``crowded out'' private \n     religious charities in the first place. Remove the \n     government, and the charities will come surging back. Yet he \n     is honest enough to admit that the historical record is not \n     entirely clear on this point: which came first, the \n     increasing involvement of professionals and the government in \n     the lives of the poor, or a decline in voluntarism and \n     religiosity? This is a crucial question, for if something in \n     the culture led to a decline in voluntarism prior to the \n     federal government's takeover of welfare, then a simple \n     withdrawal of the latter will not necessarily lead to an \n     increase in the former.\n       ``In the end,'' predicts Okasky, ``not much will be \n     accomplished without a spiritual revival that transforms the \n     everyday advice people give and receive, and the way we lead \n     our lives.'' If that were really so, it would be reasonable \n     to conclude that public-welfare programs should not be \n     scrapped at all, but rather kept in place until the hoped-for \n     spiritual revival occurs, lest the poor be left without God \n     and without material support at once. Be that as it may, \n     however, there is much else in Olasky's thinking, \n     particularly about the role of private ``compassion,'' that \n     reformers can make use of in the months and years to come.\n       This brings us to the third current. Unlike the first two, \n     both of which see big government as the principal culprit in \n     the welfare mess, this one envisions a role for government in \n     its solution.\n       Perhaps the principal figure here is Lawrence Mead of New \n     York University. In his book, The New Politics of Poverty, \n     Mead argues, against Murray, that the marginal economic \n     disincentives created by welfare do not explain the really \n     staggering extent of non-work and family dissolution in the \n     welfare population. Moreover, having a baby out of wedlock in \n     order to receive a welfare check is not really ``rational,'' \n     in Mead's judgment. Rather, this and other aspects of the \n     behavior of the underclass are the results of a certain \n     personality profile. The non-working poor, says Mead, are \n     defeatist, passive, and psychologically resistant to taking \n     low-skilled jobs. A ``culture of poverty'' exists that cannot \n     be fully explained by the rationalist model.\n       What to do? The answer, according to Mead, is workfare, an \n     approach that would require able-bodied recipients of welfare \n     to enter the labor market. By forcing the poor to be like the \n     rest of us, workfare seeks to manage and even (in the words \n     of Congressman Bill Archer) to ``transform'' them.\n       The thinking of Mead and others who favor workfare--Mickey \n     Kaus of the New Republic is another well-known proponent of \n     such schemes--is evident in the various versions of the \n     Republican welfare-reform bill. All include the basic \n     requirement that for any aid poor people receive from the \n     government, they must work, in the private sphere if possible \n     but in the public sector if not. According to the bill, 50 \n     percent of welfare recipients must be working by 2002; even \n     single mothers with children (over the age of one) should be \n     required to work; and families receiving benefits will be cut \n     off after five years.\n       Mead argues that workfare represents, in effect, a ``new \n     paternalism,'' a ``tutelary regime.'' And indeed his ideas \n     have alarmed more than a few conservatives, especially those \n     of a libertarian bent. Many believe that any attempt by the \n     government to mold behavior, even that of the poor, marks a \n     break from the American tradition of limited government. Such \n     fears are in Mead's view well-founded. But the appearance of \n     the contemporary underclass itself marks, he believes, a \n     watershed development in our national life, if not ``the end \n     . . . of an entire political tradition.'' That tradition--the \n     tradition of the Founders, and of such classical liberals as \n     Hobbes, Locke, and Montesquieu--``took self-reliance for \n     granted.'' It assumes that people are, by nature, rational \n     maximizers of their economic interests. But now it appears \n     that many are not; and so a ``new tradition,'' a ``new \n     political theory,'' even a ``new political language'' is \n     needed.\n       All this seems somewhat overheated. For some reason, many \n     of those who propose work as a solution to the welfare \n     problem cannot resist militaristic metaphors. (Thus Mickey \n     Kaus, in The End of Equality, urges Americans to build a \n     ``Work Ethic State.'') But we need not really move beyond our \n     own liberal tradition in order to enforce the norm of work. \n     The Founders themselves recognized that humans are frequently \n     irrational, indeed even lazy. And Adam Smith, the classical \n     liberal par excellence, was not mincing words when he \n     observed that among the ``inferior ranks'' of society there \n     was a surfeit of ``gross ignorance and stupidity.'' Rather \n     than positing rational self-interest as a universal human \n     trait, Smith and other classical liberals thought that \n     through persuasion and law, it would be possible to turn men \n     away from their former pursuits of military glory and \n     religious enthusiasm toward ``small savings and small \n     gains.'' A little bit of workfare for those still unmindful \n     of their economic self-interest thus need hardly spell the \n     end of the American political tradition.\n       What is especially interesting about the three conservative \n     strands of thought about welfare is that despite the \n     theoretical differences among them, together they provide a \n     coherent guide as to how to fix a broken system. As men are \n     not angels, Charles Murray's negative incentives have their \n     place. But neither are men brutes, and hence something more \n     is needed than a ``technology'' of behavioral change. As \n     Marvin Olasky reminds us, a rebirth of the spirit of \n     religious charity would change many lives for the better. And \n     as Lawrence Mead reminds us, in a commercial republic such as \n     ours, work is the proper condition for all who are able.\n       Indeed, the politicians have seen the big picture in a way \n     that this perhaps not so easy for the lone social thinker to \n     do. The Republican welfare-reform bills in Congress, along \n     with the many state plans being put into effect by Republican \n     governors, makes use of Murray's incentives, Olasky's \n     religious charities, and Mead's workfare. If there are \n     theoretical and practical difficulties with each of these \n     approaches, it is precisely the combination that may make \n     conservative welfare reform politically palatable and even, \n     in the end, effective.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4637-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4639-S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONSERVATION AND GRAZING\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition \nto President Clinton's actions to open our conservation reserve lands \nto cattle grazing. As someone who is concerned about the environment, I \nam disappointed by his decision.\n  The conservation program pays ranchers to take ecologically fragile \nland out of grazing.\n  It has been a very successful program and has put away some 36 \nmillion acres away as a nature preserve. By removing these acres of \nland from cattle grazing and creating areas of undisturbed vegetative \ncover, the program has created habitat for many types of wildlife \nacross the Great Plains and the Midwest, including waterfowl, \npheasants, prairie grouse, raptors, and migratory songbirds. These \nspecies need undisturbed cover to nest and raise young successfully.\n  But good green grass is hard to come by. The price of feed is up and \nthe price of cattle is down. For some, the solution to higher beef \nprices may be to open up restricted land to grazing.\n  But as Richard Cohen quickly pointed out in today's Washington Post, \n``First the oil reserves, then the conservation reserves and next--\nmaybe--the Federal Reserve.''\n  In the name of environmental protection, this Congress fought off any \nattempts to allow grazing on ecologically sensitive land.\n  In fact, in last month's farm bill we provided significant funding \nfor the Conservation Reserve Program and made sure that wildlife \nhabitat was a primary objective of the reserve program.\n  By opening all 36 million CRP acres nationwide to grazing and haying \nwith few constraints and little apparent consideration for the scope of \nthe emergency, the Clinton administration has eliminated much of the \nwildlife value of the Conservation Program.\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\n  In the Great Plains, it is now nesting season, and if cattle are \nallowed on the land, ducks and grassland songbirds are going to get \ntrampled.\n  Grass is growing where it has not grown in years and species that \nwere once threatened are making a comeback. Unfortunately, President \nClinton's action probably has negated all that progress this year.\n  I am also disappointed that the Clinton administration made this \ndecision without consulting the environmental and sportsmen \ncommunities. The conservation community, the Agriculture Department, \neven the environmentalist were surprised, and, frankly, I am surprised.\n  I keep asking myself how can someone who calls himself an \nenvironmentalist justify opening up some of our most fragile and \nprotected areas to cattle grazing?\n  I believe that President Clinton's actions directly contradicts the \nbelief that the Clinton administration truly cares about the \nenvironment.\n  This situation demonstrates that, once again, the interests of \nsportsmen, conservationists, and the public still rank far below those \nof subsidized commodity agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Washington Post article to which I earlier referred.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Politics, Prices\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       What's the most dangerous place in the world? Bosnia? \n     Liberia? Chechnya? Anywhere in Montana? No. The answer is any \n     place between Bill Clinton and reelection. It is a no-man's \n     land where principle is sacrificed to politics and \n     consistency is given scant regard. That explains why the \n     administration moved this week to sell federal oil reserves \n     and open restricted lands to cattle grazing. It wants to \n     lower the price of gas and raise the price of beef.\n       The average voter, which is to say me, is confused. If I \n     drive a little less but eat more meat, will that balance out? \n     If I drive a lot less and eat more steak, will that be better \n     for the country? If I drive down to see Alan Greenspan, will \n     I get even richer? After all, I sense a pattern: First the \n     oil reserves, then the conservation reserves and next--\n     maybe--the Federal Reserve. Will Uncle Sam be giving away \n     money?\n       Silly me, it already has. The federal government paid an \n     average of $27 a barrel for the 587 million barrels of oil \n     now in storage. Since Alaskan crude, the oil that most \n     approximates what Uncle Sam has in the cellar, is now selling \n     at about $20 a barrel, you don't have to be a regular Laura \n     D'Andrea Tyson to figure out that you would be taking a $7 \n     loss on each barrel. Since the government plans to sell 12 \n     million barrels, that amounts to an anti-profit (I thought \n     I'd coin yet another stupid economic term) of $84 million. \n     I'd say offhand that the per-capita cost to the average \n     American is anyone's guess.\n       But it is not anyone's guess that Clinton is pursuing a \n     political, not economic, agenda. The price of gas became a \n     problem only when the networks started reporting on the story \n     and Bob Dole recommended repealing a 4.3-cent gas tax \n     increase that Clinton pushed through Congress in 1993. With \n     that, the White House rolled out its Big Bertha fax machines \n     and bombarded Washington with press releases noting that \n     Dole, in his reckless youth, had at one time supported a gas \n     tax increase. Next, the president announced he would sell \n     federal oil to drive down the price at the pump. But check \n     the pump. Nothing's happened.\n       And nothing much will. Despite some Capitol Hill sound \n     bites to the contrary, the price of gas has increased for \n     sound economic reasons. The conspiracy to which some \n     politicians allude happens to include consumers who are \n     driving faster in heavier cars, a brutal winter and a \n     miscalculation on the availability of Iraqi oil. Prices will \n     go down eventually--but not, probably, before they go up some \n     more.\n       In a sense, Clinton's response to Dole has been truly \n     impressive. As an exercise in cynical politics, it's a \n     masterpiece--a regular Mona Lisa or, if you will, a Jackie \n     Kennedy bauble. Opening up restricted grazing land is a \n     different story altogether. This is an appalling tale in \n     which, for a few votes, a conservation program has been \n     endangered without much thought at all.\n       The program in question pays ranchers to take ecologically \n     fragile land out of grazing. In this way, some 36 million \n     acres (about the size of Iowa) has become a sort of nature \n     preserve. But the Great Plains are parched, and good grazing \n     land is hard to come by. As a result, the price of feed is up \n     and the price of cattle is down. (Ranchers have been selling \n     off their herds.) Understandably, ranchers have been eyeing \n     the acres in the Conservation Reserve Program. The grass \n     there is tall--yummy for cattle.\n       But that land is also good for birds, and ducks. Now is the \n     nesting season, and if cattle are allowed on the land, a lot \n     of eggs and ducklings are going to get trampled. The program \n     is hardly perfect--too much acreage in some areas, not enough \n     in others--nor is it cheap. (Over a 10-year period, the \n     average payment has been a total of $52,800 for 97 acres.) \n     But grass is now growing where it has not grown in years.\n       Maybe, after due deliberation, opening the land was the \n     best way to go. But there was no deliberation, due or \n     otherwise. The conservation community, even Department of \n     Agriculture officials, was taken by surprise at how fast this \n     decision was made. Clinton would barbecue Smokey the Bear to \n     win reelection.\n       The administration is at odds with itself. If everything \n     works as planned, you could drive to McDonald's for less--and \n     pay more for a burger when you get there. The one consistency \n     is the fervid White House desire to put politics above \n     everything else. In that area, it has shown true leadership.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I want to follow on the comments that \nwere made by Senator Bradley with respect to the Newborns' and Mothers' \nHealth Protection Act of 1996. I think it is an absolutely classic \nexample of what it is the American people do expect us to do in \nCongress and what they would like us to take on. It is a very real \nproblem. As he indicated, they are very real families, very real people \nand they are in this situation, very helpless.\n  I also join Senator Bradley in urging the majority leader, Senator \nDole, to bring this bill to the floor as soon as possible. It did pass \nLabor and Human Resources by 14 to 2. That is not a close vote. That is \nvirtually a unanimous vote. We are approaching Mother's Day. It would \nbe nice to have this bill debated at that time.\n  The legislation is absolutely vital in the turmoil which is now our \nhealth care system. It shifts the decisionmaking power of when a mother \nand her baby would be leaving a hospital, discharged home, so to speak, \nfrom an insurance company or an HMO, which has interesting missions in \nall of this, and then send it back to the doctor and to the patient. \nThat is, the decision when to leave. That is why I signed on to this \nbill and became a cosponsor very, very early.\n  Many large insurers are refusing to pay for more than 24 hours of \nmaternity care. I do not know where managed care is going to take this \ncountry. I can tell you this, I am extremely worried about it, and I am \neven more worried about for-profit HMOs and managed care. Some HMOs \neven require discharge within 8 hours of delivery. I cannot imagine \nsuch a thing. I am sure that can happen from time to time, but I just \ncannot imagine that happening very often.\n  These quick discharge practices can, in fact, enormously endanger the \nlife of the mother and endanger greatly the life of the child. Newborns \nare prone to problems such as dehydration. They are prone to problems \nlike jaundice that are not even detectable until they have been alive \nfor 24 hours. So, by definition, how are doctors going to be able to \ndetermine infants' condition if they are already at home?\n  New mothers are themselves very susceptible to pelvic infections, to \nbreast infections. A new mom may be, probably is in most cases, too \nfatigued, just too tired, has been through too much in the delivery to \nproperly care for an infant 24 hours after a normal but nonetheless \nexhausting delivery problem or experience.\n  Quick discharges can result in devastating medical consequences, in \ndevastating human consequences and, yes, they can result, and have \nresulted, in death, because new mothers and fathers are sometimes \nunable to detect these early symptoms of potentially life-threatening \nconditions. This is not ideological talk, this is medical talk.\n  Right now, insurance companies start the 24-hour clock, or even the \n8-hour clock or the 12-hour clock ticking the minute the child is born. \nThe minute the child emerges, the minute of the first cry, the clock \nbegins.\n  The insurance companies do not distinguish between those mothers who\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\nhave had a 2-hour birth and a mother who has been through 12 hours or \n18 hours and had an extremely painful, exhausting, debilitating birth. \nThey make no distinction whatsoever between the two; just out of here \nin 24 hours.\n  Their rules do not distinguish between an experienced mother, a \nmother perhaps having her third or fourth child with a father or a \ngrandmother at home ready to help, ready to help the mother, ready to \nhelp the child, on the one hand, and then on the other hand, a 16-year-\nold teenage mother with an exhausting birth process who is discharged \nafter virtually no time. A teenage mother, who is terrified at the \nprospect and has no idea of how to care for a healthy baby, much less a \nbaby showing some kinds of symptoms which that 16-year-old teenage \nmother cannot understand. It makes no difference to the insurance \ncompany. The circumstances make no difference: 24 hours, they must all \nbe discharged from the hospital, period.\n  How do we get here? I mean, this is the great debate. The Clinton \nhealth care bill did not pass, I understand that. It tried to bite off \ntoo much, I understand that. The free market is working, I understand \nthat, but there are some very dangerous things going on. Some of the \nmost unhappy people in America right now, and the ones most worried \nabout quality of care, are physicians.\n\n  Judith Bowman is a first-time mom from Fairmont, WV. She recently \nexperienced one of these speedy discharges. She wrote to me:\n  ``I was surprised by the almost drive-thru like approach put on \nbringing a precious new life into the world. The information concerning \nthe baby and personal follow up care comes fast.''\n  ``I was,'' she said, ``exhausted. I couldn't understand it all. It \nwas new to me. I couldn't take it all in. I was still recovering from \nthe birth experience.''\n  ``The total length of my stay after delivery was approximately 20 \nhours.''\n  Mr. President, in concluding, I say that one would hope that the \nCongress would not need to legislate on this kind of matter. I mean, to \nbe quite honest with you, I think it is rather shocking. It is the kind \nof thing that you think that the private sector would pick up \nimmediately at the first sense of difficulties and simply stop. But, \nno--insurance companies are motivated by other things.\n  I would think that we could trust insurance companies to do the right \nthing on an individual case-by-case basis. What is so strange about \nthat? What is so radical about that? To let doctors make patient-care \ndecisions without concern of financial or other penalties being imposed \non them.\n  Of course, what I am saying is, if doctors who belong to HMOs want to \nkeep the mother more than 24 hours, they may be threatened, saying, \n``You either start discharging after 24 hours or you're off our \npayroll.'' Do not think for a moment that is not happening. It is \nscary. It is scary.\n  So this bill would require insurers to pay for a 48-hour stay \nfollowing an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and 96 hours for an \nuncomplicated Caesarean section. The bill permits, as Senator Bradley \nsaid, shorter stays. But, again, it puts the decision in the hands of \nthe physician of the mother to decide if that is appropriate. That is \nwho should make this critical decision, not an insurance company driven \nby other considerations, including those of their stockholders.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks simply by thanking Senator \nBradley and Senator Kassebaum for leading this effort. I again hope we \nwill be able to take this matter up somewhere around Mother's Day. I \nthank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4640-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GAS TAX REPEAL\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I believe that we should not have a roll-\nback of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax. Actually, retention of this \ntax is the sensible, national interest course to follow as we struggle \nto reduce the deficit. I fear that, like Sisyphus in Hades, we are \ndoomed forever to roll the heavy stone of the deficit uphill, only to \nhave it always roll down again, weighted down by yet another quick-fix \ntax cut.\n  In our effort to reduce the deficit, we grapple daily with the stark \nreality that funds for education, the environment, Medicare, and the \nearned income tax credit, are all being scaled back. And now, a clarion \ncall to lower the gas tax is being heard. Repealing the gas tax is \nprojected to save the average motorist the grand total of about $27 a \nyear in taxes. Note too, there is no certainty that the oil companies \nwill actually pass this rebate on to the consumer. The effect of this \ngesture is to reduce revenues by $4.8 billion, thereby making it all \nthe more difficult to reduce the Federal deficit.\n  While I recognize that higher gas prices effectively reduce the take \nhome pay of commuters and those whose daily livelihood depends upon the \navailability of low priced fuel, gasoline in the United States has \nbecome one of the ``great bargains of the Western world'' to quote \nDaniel Yergin in today's New York Times. Over the last few years, \nprices, adjusted for inflation, have been as low as at any time since \nWorld War II. The price of about $1.30 a gallon is exquisitely cheap \nwhen compared with the almost $5 a gallon paid in France.\n  Rather than providing a potentially illusory benefit of $27 per \nmotorist, I suggest we concentrate on those issues having a far more \nprofound impact on the lives of working Americans. We have yet to \nsatisfactorily grapple with proposals to increase the minimum wage, the \nprojected shortfall in Medicare funds in 2001, and the fact that our \neducation programs are such that the mathematics scores of some of our \nstudents, particularly in the Southeast region, continue to be \nlamentably low. Repealing the gasoline tax is the last thing we should \nthink of doing--and we should quickly reject the idea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4641-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4641-S4642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      WELCOMING U.S. DECISION TO PARTICIPATE IN EXPO '98 IN LISBON\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, on another matter, last month, the White \nHouse announced that it has accepted an invitation from the Portuguese \nGovernment to participate in the international exposition to be held in \nLisbon in 1998. This is good news indeed. I commend President Clinton \nfor this decision.\n  I have long encouraged the administration to take this step. Last \nyear, I sponsored a resolution calling for U.S. participation in Expo \n'98. In March of this year, I visited the site of the expo while in \nLisbon for President Sampaio's inauguration. During my visit, I took \nthe opportunity to learn in detail the goals and themes of the expo \nfrom Antonio Cardoso Cunha, commissioner-general and chairman of Expo \n'98.\n  Earlier this week, we welcomed Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama \nto Washington. Accordingly, I believe it is a particular appropriate \ntime to bring Expo '98 to the attention of my colleagues and to express \nmy enthusiasm for working with our Portuguese allies on this important \nproject.\n  The theme of Expo '98 appropriately, will be ``The Oceans, a Heritage \nfor the Future'' and will focus on environmental topics. As the \nresident of a coastal State which shares with Portugal a rich maritime \ntradition, I cannot imagine a more appropriate or more unifying theme. \nThe U.N. General Assembly has declared 1998 as the International Year \nof the Ocean in an effort to alert the world to the need to improve the \nphysical and cultural assets of the world's oceans. A fundamental goal \nof Expo '98 will be to focus on the growing importance of the world's \noceans and to foster a debate on the sustainable use of marine \nresources and environmental protection. The United States, of course, \nhas a vested interest in being part of this debate.\n  Our participation in this exposition, which marks the 500th \nanniversary of the historic voyage from Europe to India of the \nPortuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, should be a source of pride for \nthose of Portuguese heritage, as well as a source of great interest for \nall those with a concern for the oceans and a sense of history. \nPortugal, of course, has a great history of sea exploration, and in \nfact, helped to create important trade links between the peoples of \nEurope, the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Lisbon, the capital of Portugal \nsince the 12th century, is a vibrant cultural\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nand economic center, and its location on the Atlantic makes it a fine \nchoice for an expo focused on the sea.\n  Expo '98 offers opportunities for U.S. business as well. The \norganizers of Expo '98 will provide all facilities relating to each \nnational pavilion free of charge. Accordingly, participating countries \nwill have to provide only the contents of its representation. The U.S. \nexhibit will be financed completely by the private sector. Such an \narrangement is a win-win situation--for the U.S. Government and for \nU.S. businesses which may be able to receive increased international \nexposure through their participation. I am hopeful that a commissioner \ngeneral who will be responsible for coordinating the U.S. effort and \nfor securing corporate sponsorships will soon be appointed so that we \ncan move ahead quickly.\n  I add also, having it this year brings attention to the Law of the \nSea Treaty, which needs to be acted upon.\n  I remember myself in 1940 seeing the last time we had a world \nexhibition in Lisbon and seeing the amount of the world's surface that \nwas under Portuguese rule. On a personal note, I remember attending an \nexhibition in 1940 while visiting my father who was posted as the U.S. \nMinister to Lisbon. At that time, I attended the Exhibition of the \nPortuguese World, which focused on the contributions of Portugal's far \nflung colonies. Lisbon was a wonderful site, and the Portuguese people \nwere perfect hosts for such an exhibition.

Mr. President, one of the most profound and sensitive \nissues facing our society today is whether doctors should be allowed to \nassist in the suicide of their patients.\n  On this issue, I happen to share the view of the American Medical \nAssociation that doctors who are sworn to be life-givers, should not \nact as life-takers, and that the licensing of doctors to administer \ndeath is ``fundamentally inconsistent with the pledge physicians make \nto devote themselves to healing and to life.''\n  I recognize that there are those who do not share this point of view. \nBut the process we use to work out such disagreements and come to a \nsocial consensus is called democracy. I will vigorously defend the \nright of every fellow citizen to disagree with me, but I will also \ndefend the constitutional process by which our laws are made. The \npeople, through their elected Representatives, should be the ones to \ndecide whether to permit or to prohibit physician-assisted suicide. It \nis a give and take of meaningful public debate that enables our \ndemocratic society to examine complicated social issues and, hopefully, \nreach a consensus that enjoys broad popular support.\n  In recent weeks, however, two influential Federal courts--the ninth \ncircuit of appeals on the west coast and the second circuit court of \nappeals on the east coast--have determined that the U.S. Constitution \nflatly prohibits the States from outlawing physician-assisted suicide.\n  The ninth circuit ruled that individuals have a liberty interest in \ncontrolling the time and manner of our deaths and that a Washington \nState law prohibiting assisted suicide was, therefore, a violation of \nthe due process clause of the 14th amendment. In a more narrowly drawn \nopinion, the second circuit declared that a similar New York State law \noutlawing physician-assisted suicide violates the 14th amendment's \nequal protection clause. In fact, I think in the Washington case it was \ndue process; also the liberty clause.\n\n  These decisions, like others in recent years, have the unfortunate \neffect of substituting the judgment of unelected Federal judges for the \ndemocratic process. If the ninth circuit's decision purporting to find \na fundamental right to physician-assisted suicide is upheld by the \nSupreme Court, then all meaningful public debate on this issue would \neffectively be cut off. All of the moral and ethical concerns on both \nsides would, with a single stroke, be replaced with a judicial fiat. \nThe only citizens whose voices matter in such a decision would be the \njudges themselves. As columnist Charles Krauthamer writes: ``Not a \nsingle country in the world (save Holland) permits doctors to help \npatients kill themselves. Now judges have declared that America will be \nsuch a country, indeed that the Constitution demands that America be \nsuch a country.''\n  I yield to no one in my respect for the role of the judiciary in \npreserving our fundamental liberties. On occasion, judges may even be \nrequired to strike down a legislative act because it clearly conflicts \nwith fundamental freedoms and guarantees of equal protection set forth \nin our Constitution. This is part of the genius of our system, the \nfundamental check on the legislative and executive branches created by \nthe Framers of the Constitution.\n  But what would the Framers say of these decisions or others like \nthese? Does anyone doubt that they would be astonished to learn that \nthe Constitution prohibits the people from prohibiting physicians from \nadministering death? At some point, the legal arguments advanced by our \njudges to strike down an otherwise valid legislative act must be \nexamined in the light of common sense.\n  In creating a new constitutional right to kill oneself with a \nphysician's help, the unelected members of the ninth circuit, judges \nappointed by both Democratic and Republican Presidents, have taken it \nupon themselves to deny millions of their fellow citizens the \nopportunity to address this sensitive and morally charged issue through \nthe democratic process. That is the denial of a fundamental right that \nwould have made the Framers shake with anger. They did not fight so \nhard to win and preserve the freedom of self-government simply to \nabandon that freedom to unelected judges.\n\n  As one judge who dissented from the ninth circuit's decision \nobserved: ``That a question is important does not imply that it is \nconstitutional. The Founding Fathers did not establish the United \nStates as a democratic republic so that elected officials could decide \ntrivia, while all the great questions would be decided by the \njudiciary.''\n  In recent days, I have highlighted the enormously influential role \nthat judges play in the daily lives of the American people. Today, \nFederal judges micromanage hospitals, schools, police and fire \ndepartments, even prisons. Federal judges have unilaterally raised \nproperty taxes, and now they have struck down popularly enacted laws on \nthe theory that physician-assisted suicide is no less than a right \nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n  The Constitution is a precious legacy. It was precious when it \nemerged as that ``miracle in Philadelphia.'' Americans of all \ngenerations have made it more precious by fighting an dying to defend \nit. These sacrifices were not made so that Federal judges with life \ntenure could warp the meaning of the Constitution to fit their own \npolitical agenda or personal beliefs. When that happens, judicial \nreview becomes an expression of tyranny, no longer the guarantee of \nliberty intended by the Framers.\n  On the admittedly difficult issue of physician-assisted suicide, I am \nprepared to trust the American people. The American people, not a small \ngroup of unelected judges seeking to dispense their own superior moral \nwisdom, should be the ones deciding whether assisted suicide is \nconsistent with the values our great country does, and should \nrepresent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that opinion pieces by Charles \nKrauthamer and E.J. Dionne be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 12, 1996]\n\n                       Deciding on Life or Death\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       In the most morally laden judicial decision since Roe v. \n     Wade, two U.S. appeals courts (for the 2nd and 9th circuits) \n     have within the last five weeks struck down as \n     unconstitutional laws banning physician-assisted suicide. Two \n     issues are at stake here: (1) Should physician-assisted \n     suicide be permitted? And\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\n     (2) should judges be deciding the issue? The first is a \n     difficult question. The second is not.\n       In this column and elsewhere, I have argued that permitting \n     doctors to kill their patients is a bad idea, however \n     compassionate the motives, principally because the erosion of \n     the taboo against physician-assisted suicide will inevitably \n     lead to abuses. But whatever my private view and whatever the \n     private view of the robed eminences of the 2nd and 9th \n     circuits, is this not an issue that a democratic people ought \n     to decide themselves?\n       Have these judges learned nothing from Roe v. Wade? The \n     United States is the only country in the Western world that \n     has legalized abortion not by popular vote or legislative \n     action but by judicial fiat. The result has been 25 years of \n     social and political turmoil.\n       Having disenfranchised a democratic people on one of the \n     fundamental moral issues of our time, the courts are now bent \n     on doing it again. Not a single country in the world (save \n     Holland) permits doctors to help patients kill themselves. \n     Now judges have decreed that America will be such a country, \n     indeed that the Constitution demands that America be such a \n     country.\n       It is not as if the people have neglected the issue. Since \n     1991, three states have held referenda on the question. \n     California and Washington voted narrowly to retain the ban, \n     Oregon voted even more narrowly to lift it.\n       Well, they can forget their votes. Judge Stephen Reinhardt \n     and the 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco have decided the \n     issue for them. Congratulating his own steely self-\n     discipline, Reinhardt writes: ``We must strive to resist the \n     natural judicial impulse to limit our vision to that which \n     can plainly be observed on the face of the document before \n     us,'' meaning the Constitution. And resist he does, \n     heroically. In a manifesto longer than the Unabomber's, \n     Reinhardt embraces a ``dynamism of constitutional \n     interpretation'' and proclaims a constitutional ``right to \n     die'' lodged, lo, undiscovered all these years right under \n     our noses in the ``liberty interest'' of the Due Process \n     Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n       (Question: If the liberty interest mandates permitting \n     assisted suicide, how can one justify the current drug laws? \n     If the state may not impinge on your liberty to make yourself \n     dead, how can it impinge your liberty to make yourself high?)\n       The prize for judicial presumption, however, goes to Judge \n     Guido Calabresi of the 2nd Circuit in New York for his \n     opinion concurring that current laws banning assisted suicide \n     must be thrown out but for a different--and revealing--\n     rationale: They must go because they are obsolete. They were \n     originally enacted at a time when suicide was either a crime \n     or considered a ``grave public wrong.'' Now that suicide is \n     considered neither, he says, the assisted suicide laws make \n     no sense. Calabresi grants that the Constitution and its \n     history do not clearly render these statutes invalid. But \n     that deters him not a bit. He would throw them out anyway \n     until the New York legislature comes up with new assisted-\n     suicide laws sporting more modern rationales.\n       Are democratically enacted laws to be stricken until a new \n     moral exegesis can be cooked up to satisfy a judge's personal \n     ethics? Judges rule on the constitutionally of laws, not \n     their currency.\n       Calabresi presumes that the people of New York retain their \n     prohibition against physician-assisted suicide out of absent-\n     mindedness. Yet he himself notes that in 1994 a task force of \n     doctors, bioethicists and religious leaders organized at the \n     request of Gov. Mario Cuomo concluded (unanimously, mind you) \n     that the laws against physician-assisted suicide should be \n     retained. Yet Calabresi carriers on as if no one other than \n     he has bent his mind to the problem.\n       Calabresi is a Clinton appointee. Judge Roger Miner, who \n     wrote the 2nd Circuit's majority opinion, was appointed by \n     Reagan. The 9th Circuit majority (1 Kennedy, 5 Carter, 2 \n     Reagan appointees) is similarly ecumenical. Which proves that \n     judicial imperialism is a bipartisan occupational disease.\n       Is it too much to hope that the Supreme Court will put a \n     stop to it? It would do a great service to the democratic \n     character of this country by reviewing these opinions, \n     overturning them and remonstrating against the breathtaking \n     arrogance of these imperial judges. It might begin by quoting \n     from the dissent of the 9th Circuit's Andrew Kleinfeld: \n     ``That a question is important does not imply that it is \n     constitutional. The Founding Fathers did not establish the \n     United States as a democratic republic so that elected \n     officials would decide trivia, while all great questions \n     would be decided by the judiciary.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n         [From the International Herald Tribune, Apr. 16, 1996]\n\n                On Dying in America: A Quiet Revolution\n\n                         (By E.J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       Washington. Thanks to two court decisions, the people of \n     the United States are hurtling down a road they did not \n     choose and have grave doubts about pursuing. The decisions, \n     by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on the West Coast \n     and the 2d Circuit on the East Coast, abruptly struck down \n     laws prohibiting doctor-assisted suicide.\n       It all happened without a full national debate, without any \n     consultation of patients or doctors. These judges decided \n     there ought not be a national dialogue on what is one of the \n     most difficult ethical, moral and practical decisions \n     confronting modern medicine. They were sure they knew better \n     than the rest of us.\n       What needs to be recognized is that this is not some small \n     legal step. These decisions, if kept in force, will \n     revolutionize the way we Americans think about dying. They \n     will hugely increase the pressures on the very ill to agree \n     to kill themselves, utterly transform the relationship \n     between doctors and patients and create gaping loopholes for \n     abuse.\n       It is especially chilling that these decisions come up as \n     the country is moving rapidly into managed-care health plans \n     where all the incentives are to cut costs. What easier way to \n     cut costs than to create subtle pressures on patients to kill \n     themselves? Of course there is no managed-care plan out there \n     that would ever do such a thing consciously--one hopes so, \n     anyway. But as medical care for the very ill becomes more and \n     more expensive, it is naive to pretend that such pressures \n     will never arise.\n       That is why those who call themselves liberal should not \n     rush to the cause of assisted suicide just because the battle \n     flag of ``a liberty interest'' has been raised. One of the \n     most badly needed protections in America's increasingly \n     complicated health system is to insulate individuals from \n     bureaucratic pressures when they make the hardest decisions \n     of their lives.\n       Many doctors vigorously oppose assisted suicide precisely \n     because they want their own missions to remain clear and \n     unequivocal. The American Medical Association worries that \n     assisted suicide is ``fundamentally incompatible with the \n     physician's role as healer and care-giver.'' Medicine is, as \n     the medical ethicist Leon Kass put it, ``an inherently \n     ethical activity.'' The doctors we admire most are those \n     who keep their ethical obligations in the forefront. We \n     ought not transform their ethical role without debating \n     what such a change would mean. This choice cannot be \n     thrust upon us, of a sudden, by courts claiming higher \n     ethical wisdom.\n       The confusion created when judges decide this issue by fiat \n     is illustrated by the fact that the two courts reached their \n     decisions for entirely different constitutional reasons. The \n     2d Circuit judges said laws against assisted suicide violated \n     the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, since the law \n     permits one class of people to end their lives by withdrawing \n     treatment but requires another class to stay alive because it \n     denies them suicide.\n       This gives the concept of ``equal protection'' a chilling \n     twist. It is a terrible leap to declare that withdrawing \n     support is exactly the same as helping a patient commit \n     suicide. In the first case, we are acknowledging that great \n     medical advances permit us to trump nature and keep people \n     alive long after they would otherwise have died. In the \n     second, we are taking active measures to kill people. Surely \n     this is not a line we should erase casually.\n       The 9th Circuit, on the other hand, relies on the liberty \n     protections of the 14th Amendment. ``At the heart of liberty \n     is the right to define one's concept of existence, of \n     meaning, of the universe and of the mystery of human life,'' \n     wrote Judge Stephen Reinhardt. Well, sure, But what is at \n     stake here is the relationship of the individual to the \n     medical system. What needs arguing is whether liberty will \n     actually be enhanced by giving doctors Q and hospitals and \n     HMOs Q new powers over life and death.\n       One cannot escape the suspicion that we have here an \n     outcome in search of a rationale. The goal is to legalize \n     assisted suicide and the judges rummage around for \n     constitutional language to justify the goal.\n       This is no easy issue. Modern medicine can keep people \n     alive far longer now than in the past. It's fair to debate if \n     more people may now suffer more pain in the last stages of \n     life, and what that should mean for the practices of \n     medicine. But the courts should not decide this for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4642-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4643-S4646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TRAVELGATE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I read a story in the Washington \nTimes that ought to absolutely outrage every Member of this body. It \nshould also outrage the American people. The article is entitled \n``Democrats Stymie Effort to Pay Travelgate Legal Fees.'' It is written \nby Mr. Paul Bedard.\n  The story is about how Democrat Senators are secretly trying to pull \nthe plug on a Republican bill to pay legal fees for this person. The \nbill would help undo some of the damage that the Clinton White House \nperpetrated against seven innocent employees of the White House travel \noffice. Mr. Billy Dale was the head of that office. He is the most \nprominent of the seven and the most harassed by the White House. The \nbill would restore only a small part of the economic damage done to \nthese citizens and their families. It would simply pay their legal \nfees. It would do little or nothing to restore their reputations, their \ndignity, their psychological trauma, or their faith in their \nGovernment, especially in this White House.\n  Now, to make matters worse, Mr. President, the Democrats want to take\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\naway their legal fees, too. This, of course, is adding insult to \ninjury. By their putting a stop to this bill, the Democrats would \ndeprive these seven of legal fees, even after it has been shown that \nthe seven should not have been targets of the Clintons in the first \nplace.\n  These seven innocent--let me repeat, innocent--workers were given \ntheir walking papers so a Clinton family member and a rich Hollywood \ncrony and a Clinton contributor could reap spoils for themselves. The \nseven became unjust targets of the enormous power of the Federal \nGovernment. Their rights were trampled all over.\n  Why should our Democrat colleagues be trying to secretly kill the \nlegal fees for the Travelgate seven? Here is what Mr. Bedard of the \nWashington Times says: ``A Senate leadership official said Democrats \nhope to kill the aid for Mr. Dale in order to save the President the \nembarrassment of having to sign it.''\n  Mr. President, that is no justification whatever. If that is the \njustification, then that explains why this effort is being done in the \nsecrecy of the back room. First, the President fails to take \nresponsibility for his actions. He points the finger and blames the \nfirings of the Travelgate seven on others. Now it appears that his \nlieutenants do his bidding to stop the legal fee bill, once again \nfailing to take responsibility as a President of the United States for \nhis own actions.\n  This is precisely why I have often repeated on this floor my \nobservation that there is an absence of moral leadership coming from \nthis White House. If there was ever an appropriate illustration of what \nI am talking about, this clandestine maneuvering on the Travelgate bill \nis it. If all of this is true, these Senators are doing the President \nof the United States a disservice, as well as Mr. Dale, and the \nPresident would best show some leadership by standing up and saying he \nwants no part of this effort to harass these citizens any longer.\n  In the Travelgate case, the President and First Lady already have \nbeen accused of coverup, damage control, stonewalling, a failure of \nmoral leadership, cronyism, nepotism and, most importantly, a breach of \npublic trust.\n  Why should these Senators, whom I assume are allies of the President, \nwant to add to this list of accusations legislative as well?\n  It is all right for the President of the United States to create a \nfund and have his own legal fees paid by lobbyists, cronies, and high \nrollers. But if the average ``Joe Citizen'' wants and deserves to be \nmade whole in the face of Federal harassment, he gets, as Mr. Dale has \nfound, the plug pulled on him secretly behind closed doors.\n  I submit that the harassment of Billy Dale by the Democrats \ncontinues. First, it was the Clinton White House doing it to Mr. Dale. \nThen it was the FBI and the Federal prosecutors. Now it is friends of \nthe President in the U.S. Senate. It seems like everybody in Government \nis in a league together to frustrate an attempt to help make Mr. Dale \nwhole--at least economically. There is no way you are going to help him \nwith all these other problems he has.\n  I will urge our leaders--meaning our Republican leaders in this \nbody--to lift up this rock to the light of day and see who scurries \naway from the refuge of secrecy, closed doors, and the dark. I will \nurge that a full public debate be allowed on this bill, followed by a \nrecorded vote instead of a voice vote. Let those who are doing their \nwork behind the scenes face the American people and make their case in \npublic.\n  This is a fairly outrageous position for anybody to take, \nparticularly since the President is trying to get his legal bills paid \nby donations from his friends. Now, this is outrageous. I have not seen \na whole lot like it in the 15 years I have been here. This is not a \ndebate about corporate or trade associations or labor organizations or \nlarge grassroots organizations; this is a debate about doing justice \nfor just one person--a man who was wrongly accused and harassed by our \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, in a sense, this is a debate about our moral leaders \nin the White House. Mr. Dale and his family have been left financially, \nemotionally, and psychologically drained. Since a Federal jury \nacquitted Mr. Dale after all of 2 hours of deliberations, how can \nanyone in this body defend such action? One thing is for sure: I do not \nthink the people will want to defend such action in public. In that, I \nhave much confidence.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Times, May 2, 1993]\n\n        Democrats Stymie Effort to Pay ``Travelgate'' Legal Fees\n\n                            (By Paul Bedard)\n\n       Senate Democrats have ganged up in secret to block \n     legislation that would pay off ``Travelgate'' figure Billy R. \n     Dale's $500,000 legal bill in an apparent effort to shield \n     the president from further embarrassment in the scandal.\n       Senate leadership sources said yesterday that Sen. David \n     Pryor of Arkansas, a close ally of the president, put a \n     confidential ``hold'' on the bill, blocking it from being \n     considered by the Senate.\n       They said Mr. Pryor, who is retiring this year, then passed \n     the hold to other Democrats, and they have kept the \n     legislation from being considered for passage in a voice \n     vote.\n       Pryor spokesman Beau Morrison denied that the senator now \n     has a hold on the bill, adding that a senator's privilege to \n     put a hold on legislation is supposed to be confidential.\n       Senate protocol allows any member to place a confidential \n     hold on any legislation for any reason. Democratic senators \n     recently tried to kill that rule.\n       ``Pryor did put a hold on it, and we expect another \n     Democrat to drop one on it now that you have caught wind of \n     it,'' a Republican source said.\n       Mr. Dale accumulated legal bills of $500,000 in defending \n     himself against two counts of embezzlement that followed his \n     surprise ouster as White House travel office director May 19, \n     1993. A U.S. District Court jury took two hours to acquit him \n     after a three-week trail.\n       The firings of Mr. Dale and his six aides sparked the \n     Travelgate scandal.\n       A House panel is investigating a former senior White House \n     aide's accusation that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     demanded the firings in order to make room for Clinton \n     associates. Mrs. Clinton has denied the charge.\n       Republicans upset with Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's \n     refusal to force the issue on the Senate floor yesterday \n     urged the likely GOP presidential nominee to bring the \n     legislation to a vote.\n       ``Please do whatever you can to bring this bill to the \n     floor, thus allowing those opponents the opportunity to make \n     their arguments in public, in the light of day,'' Sens. \n     Christopher S. Bond, Missouri Republican, and Richard C. \n     Shelby, Alabama Republican, wrote to Mr. Dole in a letter \n     provided to The Washington Times.\n       ``The careers of seven long-time employees were put in \n     jeopardy, their finances devastated and their reputation \n     forever stained. And now a simple bill designated to attempt \n     to right one of the wrongs perpetrated against these seven \n     employees is being held up by at least one Democrat \n     senator,'' they wrote.\n       ``We believe the `Travel Office Seven' has suffered \n     enough--this bipartisan, widely supported bill should be \n     allowed to pass.''\n       The House in March voted 350-43 to pay Mr. Dale's bills. \n     Swift Senate action was promised--along with presidential \n     approval--but the bill was stopped dead by Democratic \n     opposition.\n       The House and Senate previously approved a $150,000 bill to \n     help cover the legal bills of the other travel office \n     workers.\n       Unless Mr. Dole pushes the bill Republicans expect the hold \n     ``to continue until we begin putting pressure on the \n     Democrats,'' Senate leadership official said ``We should be \n     going to the floor every day to force and embarrass the \n     Democrats, but we aren't there yet.''\n       The official said Senate Democrats hope to kill the aid for \n     Mr. Dale in order to save the president the embarrassment of \n     having to sign it. Mr. Clinton has said he will sign it, but \n     he isn't pushing Democrats to let the bill go.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I might, I would like, through the \nChair, to request my good friend from Iowa to stand by for a few \nmoments, because I would very much like to know some of the points that \nhe raised so that I might be able to respond. I say that in great \nrespect to him. When I saw him take the floor and mention the \nTravelgate issue, I literally ran from my office in the Russell \nBuilding to be here so that I may attempt to respond.\n  First, I do not know if the Senator from Iowa, in any way, has \nindicated or implied that a Member on this side of the aisle--\nespecially this Senator from Arkansas--or would have inferred that this \nSenator from Arkansas has had a hold on this particular bill, known as \nthe Travelgate reimbursement bill for legal fees.\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\n  In this morning's Washington Times, Mr. President----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator will let me answer, and I will not take \nthe floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Sure.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I did not say anybody's name. However, \nthe article I have put in the Record does have the name of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas in a headline. This was the basis for my comments. I did \nget unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I do not object. I am very proud that my good friend is \nraising this point so that I can finally respond to it.\n  The Washington Times indicated this morning that the Senator from \nArkansas, myself, Senator Pryor, had a hold on this bill to repay all \nof the legal fees, some $500,000, which had been amassed by those \npeople involved in the Travelgate episode.\n  Mr. President, I want to state this: I do not have a hold on this \nbill. I have never placed a hold on a bill in my 18 years in the \nSenate. I will be here about another few months, and I will never place \na hold on a bill, or a piece of legislation. I do not think that is a \nhealthy way to conduct the business of the Senate. And I deeply \nresent--not the Senator from Iowa--but any insinuation by anyone from \nthe media that the Senator from Arkansas has a hold on this bill. I do \nnot have a hold. I have never talked to anybody about having a hold. I \nhave never mentioned to the majority leader, to the minority leader, to \nthe floor staff, to the Cloakroom, or anyone, that I want to stop this \nbill.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I want to see this bill come to the floor. I \nwish it would come to the floor tonight. I wish we would vote on it \ntonight, because I am probably going to support it because I have an \namendment I may want to add to this bill. This amendment relates to \nchanging the implementation of the GATT treaty, so that a handful of \ndrug companies will not continue taking advantage of the American \nconsumer, the American taxpayer, in the sale of certain pharmaceutical \ndrugs.\n  I might use this bill as that vehicle, Mr. President, to offer that \namendment so that we can correct this odious mistake that the Congress \nhas made in carving out a special exemption and a special place for \nGlaxo, the manufacturer of Zantac, and other drug firms of the \nmanufacturing nature, in the manufacture of drugs that are necessities \nof life for people. I was going to use this as a possible vehicle to \nmake that change and to offer that amendment.\n  There is another bill that I hope will come to the floor. The Senator \nfrom Iowa had worked for many years on something we called the \ntaxpayers' bill of rights. I was going to see if there would be a way \nto offer my amendment on Glaxo and the GATT implementing legislation. I \nhave been consulting with my colleague, Senator Brown of Colorado, and \nSenator Chafee of Rhode Island, to establish which vehicle would be \nbest for us to use to get the maximum number of votes. If Travelgate \nwas the one, that would be fine, or the taxpayers' bill of rights, that \nwould be fine. Whatever the legislation, Mr. President, I was prepared \nto offer this amendment to correct this mistake Congress made, which \nallows extra profits of $5 million each day to one particular firm, \nwhich I think is unconscionable.\n  I state to my friend, once again, I do not have a hold on this bill. \nPlease insert the article. I will certainly not object. I thank the \nSenator for raising the point, because all day I have been asked by \nvarious members of the press if I actually had a hold on the bill. I do \nnot. I see that my friend may be seeking recognition.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will the Senator yield for rebuttal on my part?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator very \nmuch for coming to the floor to make his remarks. I absolutely believe \nwhat the Senator says. I hope that the Senator will have an \nopportunity, maybe, to study what I said, because, as he said, he had \nto leave his office to come over here. I will be happy to discuss, \neither privately or on the floor of the Senate, any of the comments \nthat I made. I did not name any Senator, albeit, the Senator's name \ncould be implied from putting the article in the Record. But I did not \naccuse any Senator of putting a hold on it. People on this side of the \naisle did inquire about whether or not there was a hold by somebody on \nyour side of the aisle on the bill, and we were told there was a \nhold. We were not told who it was, but that there is a hold on the \nbill.\n\n  So I want to take time to clarify that because the Senator from \nArkansas asked me to, and I appreciate how he approaches this issue as \nwell.\n  I still would leave my comments, though, that we should get this bill \npassed. It is not going to restore the situation prior to the firing \nthe way it was for Mr. Dale. But I think that this is something which \nwill bring some justice to it and some equity to other situations in \nthis town where people are getting their legal fees paid.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa very much.\n  I once again appreciate this opportunity to be able to come to the \nfloor and attempt to clarify this situation which I think is somewhat \nof sync. If I might, before my friend and colleague leaves the floor, I \nam just going to take a very few moments before my colleague leaves.\n  There seems to be sort of an insinuation in some of the media \nwritings--in the Washington Times--that the White House, through \nSenator Pryor from Arkansas, being from the same State as the President \nand the First Lady, might be inclined to put a hold on this bill so as \nnot to embarrass the White House, or whatever.\n  Mr. President, let me state in the presence of my colleague, the \nSenator from Iowa, that I have never talked to anyone in the White \nHouse about this bill. Never, ever have I talked to anyone in the White \nHouse about this bill. I do not think they have any idea whether there \nis a hold on this bill or not. In fact, I think I have seen in the \npress, or I have heard somewhere, that the President has indicated that \nhe would probably sign this bill. I do not know what the President's \nposition on this bill is.\n  But, if I may, I am so appreciative of the Senator remaining to let \nme tell him how this might have started. This is a very small body, and \nwe all know each other. I went the other evening to one of Senator \nGrassley's colleagues, Mr. President, on the other side of the aisle, \nand I said, ``When is the Travelgate reimbursement for legal fees bill \ncoming?'' They said, ``Well, we are not sure.'' I said, ``I may have an \namendment to the bill.'' I may amend it either with the GATT \nimplementation legislation to try to cure this terrible mistake we have \nmade to allow all these windfall profits to occur for Glaxo and other \ncompanies, or I may have another amendment. I may offer an amendment to \nput some extra money in this bill as a contingency fund, a contingency \nfund to somehow begin to compensate and to give some protection, even a \nmodest amount of protection, for those individuals who are being \ndragged up here to Washington, DC, time and again at their own expense \nincurring enormous back-breaking legal fees to appear before the \nWhitewater committee.\n\n  Mr. President, these people are financially destitute. These are not \nPresidents and First Ladies necessarily. These are secretaries and file \nclerks who are having to answer a subpoena and bring records, bring \nthemselves, pay for airplanes, and come up here and give opportunities \nto be grilled and interrogated by the Whitewater committee.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if Mr. Dale's firing was right or not. I \nhave not truly followed that case. I think the President probably had \nthe right to fire him should he have wanted him fired. I do not know \nhow that worked. But whether he did or whether he did not, that is \nirrelevant to the other issue.\n  Do we need to start looking at a way to protect private citizens in \nthe payment of their legal fees when they are not a target of an \ninvestigation, when they are not even truly a part of any problem that \nhas given rise to an investigation when those individuals cannot pay \ntheir legal bills?\n  Mr. President, when these people are first talked to about appearing \nbefore this committee or before Kenneth\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\nStarr's grand jury in Arkansas or before a grand jury here, they do not \nknow what is happening. They do not know if they need an attorney or \nnot. They do not know in most cases whether they are a target of an \ninvestigation or not. They are having to produce mountains of \ninformation. They are having to produce file drawers full of documents. \nFor many of those documents, they do not know where they are. But in \nmost cases they are trying to comply in good faith and with good \nintentions.\n  So, Mr. President, that may have been how this rumor started about \nthe Senator from Arkansas putting a hold. I said that I might have an \namendment. One amendment might be on the GATT Glaxo issue; one \namendment might be to add additional funds so that we could cover those \nindividuals who could not pay attorney's fees who are not targets of an \ninvestigation.\n  I remember hearing the majority leader sometime back. I tell you, I \nthink he was right. I remember him talking about someone who had been \nhauled--perhaps hauled or subpoenaed--before the Iran-Contra committee. \nI believe that was the case. The majority leader said then that what he \nwas going to have to do is go out and try to get his reputation back.\n\n  Those words rang in my ears, and they ring in my ears again as we \ncontinue dragging these people up from especially our State and where \nit is going to wreak financial devastation on some of these individuals \nwho have had no part in creating this problem but were merely what you \nmight call lower echelon public servants who are going to be \nfinancially destitute after all of this is over.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished majority leader is here. I \nwant to thank once again my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for \nremaining, and he has had to leave the floor now.\n  Seeing no other Senators seeking recognition, I yield the floor at \nthis time.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4643-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. \n     641), a bill to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act of 1990, \n     and for other purposes, having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of April 30, 1996.)\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996, S. 641. This \nbipartisan legislation reauthorizes critical health care programs which \nprovide services for individuals living with HIV and AIDS. Accordingly, \nI urge the Senate to move expeditiously to pass this conference report, \nwhich has already moved through the House with near-unanimous support.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act plays a critical role in improving the \nquality and availability of medical and support services for \nindividuals living with HIV disease and AIDS. As the HIV epidemic \ncontinues, the need for this important legislation remains.\n  Achieving a compromise on the Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization \nbill has been a long process, and I am delighted to see it come to a \ncompletion. The give-and-take involved in the conference rarely leaves \neveryone satisfied with every aspect of the final agreement. I believe, \nhowever, that the compromise bill offers constructive change, and I am \nparticularly pleased that it provides greater equity for rural states \nthrough changes in the funding formulas.\n  The present distribution formulas have led to disparity in funding \nfor individuals living with AIDS based on where they live. When the \nCARE Act was first authorized in 1990, the epidemic was primarily a \ncoastal urban-area problem. Now it reaches the smallest and most rural \nareas of this country. Our agreement ensures that the amount of Federal \nAIDS support for an individual in a rural State more closely \napproximates the support for an individual living in a high AIDS \npopulation area. This agreement ensures that any individual living with \nAIDS, regardless of where he or she lives, will have similar support \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, with any formula change, there is always concern about \nthe potential for disruption of services to individuals now receiving \nthem. To address this concern, the bill maintains hold-harmless floors \ndesigned to assure that no entity receives less than 95 percent of its \n1995 allocation over the next 5 years, and all entities are held \nharmless in fiscal year 1996.\n  The Senate-House HIV testing compromise shifts the emphasis from \nmandatory testing of infants to voluntary testing of pregnant women. It \nprovides $10 million to help States meet CDC guidelines for voluntary \nHIV counseling, testing, and treatment for pregnant women. I believe \nthe emphasis on voluntary testing for pregnant women makes sense and is \nan appropriate compromise. Medical technology today enables us to \ngreatly reduce the chance that a HIV-positive mother will pass HIV to \nher newborn if she receives proper treatment prior to delivery. This is \nwhy I felt it was so critical to focus our Federal resources on \nvoluntary testing of mothers rather than testing newborns, when it \nwould be too late to try to prevent most HIV transmission.\n  I believe that the changes proposed by this legislation will assure \nthe continued effectiveness of the Ryan White CARE Act by maintaining \nits successful components and by strengthening its ability to meet \nemerging challenges.\n  Putting together this legislation has involved the time and \ncommitment of a wide variety of individuals and organizations. I want \nto acknowledge all of their efforts. I particularly appreciate the \nconstructive and cooperative approach which the Senate conferees, \nSenators Jeffords, Frist, Kennedy, and Dodd, lent to the development of \nthis legislation. I wish to thank both the Senate and the house \nconferees for their efforts in crafting the compromises reflected in \nthis conference bill.\n  I also wish to thank their staffs, including Sharon Winn, Susan \nRamthun, Jonelle Rowe, M.D., Joe Musker, Michael Iskowitz, Seth \nKilbourn, Jane Loewenson--as well as Marty Ross, M.D., James Wade, M.D. \nand Kent Bradley, M.D. of my staff--for their hard work in reaching \nthis agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nKassebaum in\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\nbringing to the Senate floor the conference report for the Ryan White \nCARE Reauthorization Act of 1996. This is critically important \nlegislation and I am pleased that after months, an agreement has \nfinally been reached.\n  For 15 years, America has been struggling with the devastating \neffects of AIDS. More than 1 million citizens are infected with the \nvirus. AIDS itself has now become the leading killer of all young \nAmericans from ages 25 to 44. AIDS is killing our brothers and sisters, \nparents and children, friends and loved ones--all in the prime of their \nlives. This epidemic knows no walls and has no mercy.\n  More than 500,000 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS. Over half \nhave already died--while the epidemic marches on unabated.\n  The epidemic is now a decade and a half old, but almost 40 percent of \nthe AIDS cases in this country have been diagnosed in the last 2 years. \nAnother American gets the bad news every 6 minutes. Each day, 100 more \nof our fellow citizens die of AIDS.\n  As the crisis continues, it becomes more and more difficult for \nanyone to pretend that AIDS is someone else's problem. There are few of \nus who do not know someone who is either infected or affected by AIDS. \nIn a very real way, we are all living with AIDS.\n  In 1990, AIDS advocates and service providers gave us the sound \nadvice that the development and operation of community-based care \nnetworks could help shore up the Nation's overburdened health system, \nand improve the quality of life and efficiency of services for \nindividuals and families living with AIDS.\n  In response, and in the name of Ryan White and all the other \nAmericans who had lost the battle against AIDS, Congress passed the \nComprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act, called the CARE Act. With \nbroad bipartisan support, we put people before politics, and took \nconstructive action that has made a world of difference.\n  America can take satisfaction that, in difficult times, sometimes we \nget it right. In the case of the CARE Act, we have.\n  The act contains a series of provisions that have reduced inpatient \nhospitalization and emergency room visits--and allowed more than \n300,000 Americans with HIV disease to live longer, healthier, and more \nproductive lives.\n  Title 1 of the act provides emergency relief for cities hardest hit \nby AIDS.\n  Title 2 provides funding for all 50 States to organize and operate \nHIV care consortia, to offer home care services and lifesaving \ntherapeutics, and to continue private insurance coverage for those who \nwould otherwise fall onto the public rolls.\n  Title 3 funds community health centers and family planning clinics \nwhich offer primary care and early intervention services to those \nliving with HIV in underserved urban and rural communities face an \nincreasing demand for care.\n  Title 4 links cutting-edge pediatric AIDS research with family \ncentered health and support services to meet the unique needs of \nchildren, youth, and families with HIV.\n  Title 5 funds national demonstration projects for HIV populations \nwith special needs, including teenagers, minorities, the homeless, and \nNative Americans.\n  Together, these titles put in place a strong national response with a \nproven track record of success that has saved both money and lives.\n  In Boston, the act has led to dramatically increased access to \nessential services. Because of the act, 15,000 individuals are \nreceiving primary care, 8,000 are receiving dental care, and 9,000 are \nreceiving mental health services. An additional 700 are receiving case \nmanagement services and nutrition supplements. This assistance is \nreducing hospitalizations, and is making an extraordinary difference in \npeople's lives.\n  While our response has changed significantly since 1990, the \nbrutality of the epidemic remains the same. When the act first took \neffect, only 16 cities qualified for ``emergency relief''. In the past \n5 years, that number has more than tripled.\n  This crisis is no longer limited to major urban centers. Caseloads \nare now growing in small towns and rural communities, along the coasts, \nand in America's heartland. From Weymouth to Wichita, no community will \navoid the epidemic's reach.\n  We are literally fighting for the lives of hundreds of thousands of \nour fellow citizens. This reality challenges us to move forward \ntogether in the best interest of all people living with HIV. And that \nis what this conference report seeks to do.\n  This bill acknowledges that the HIV epidemic has expanded its reach, \nbut we have not forgotten its roots. While new faces and new places are \nnow affected, the epidemic rages on in the areas of the country hit \nhardest and longest.\n  The pain and suffering of individuals and families with HIV is real, \nwidespread, and growing. All community-based organizations, cities, and \nStates need additional support from the Federal Government to meet the \nneeds of those they serve.\n  The revised formulas in this legislation will make desperately needed \nresources available to cities and States, based on the number of people \nliving with HIV disease. These changes will increase the availability \nof medical care and the support services to individuals with HIV in \nmany cities, including Boston, and in many States.\n  Equally important, the compromise will ensure the ongoing stability \nof the existing care system in areas of the country with the greatest \nincidence of AIDS. The HIV epidemic in New York, San Francisco, and \nMiami is far from over--and in many ways, the worst is yet to come.\n  Finally, the compromise includes a provision promoting voluntary HIV \ncounseling, testing, and treatment for pregnant women as part of \ncomprehensive prenatal care.\n  Thanks to recent research advances, we now know that this sound \npublic health approach will save countless young lives. Doctors, \nnurses, public health officials and AIDS organizations have all called \nfor this responsible action.\n  This aspect of the bill is a dramatic departure from the provisions \ncontained in the House bill, which focused on mandatory testing of \nnewborns. That approach is both too little and too late. In addition, \nit is likely to prove counterproductive for achieving the goal of \npreventing HIV in newborns or prolonging the lives of children infected \nwith HIV.\n  The participation and cooperation of parents and physicians is \nessential if children are to receive the care they need. Mothers must \nbe involved in the health care system, not alienated from it. Mandatory \ntesting programs threaten to drive women away from essential services, \nfor fear of losing their health care or the custody of their children. \nThis is especially true for poor women and IV drug users who are at \nhigh risk for HIV, but who are also often highly mistrustful of the \nhealth care system.\n  An HIV test by itself does not guarantee needed participation, and \ndoes not ensure access to care. It does not provide access to health \ninsurance or to necessary followup treatment. It does not mean that a \nmother will be able or willing to follow a complex treatment schedule.\n  Doctors, nurses, patients, and all those on the front lines of this \nepidemic agree that to maximize the potential for appropriate care, the \nrelationship between a woman and her health provider must be based on \ncompassion, confidence, and trust.\n  Coercive, mandatory procedures are hostile to such a relationship and \nhostile to the American tradition of respect for the doctor-patient \nrelationship.\n  The compromise contained in the conference report focuses on the \npromising strategy of offering voluntary HIV counseling, testing, and \ntreatment to pregnant women. States are given the time and the \nresources to implement the CDC guidelines and to begin to save lives.\n  Medical professional and public health officials have expressed \nserious concerns about Congress withholding funds unless they \nimplemented a program which they do not believe is in the best interest \nof those they serve. Under this bill, no doctor or State will be forced \nto implement a program of mandatory HIV testing of newborn during this \nreauthorization cycle.\n  No State will be forced to implement a mandatory testing program at \nall unless, first, the Secretary of HHS decides that such a program has \nbecome the standard of practice; and second,\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nthe State is unable to achieve a significant reduction in HIV \ntransmission from mother to child by the year 2000. This compromise \nallows States to keep their eyes on the goal, rather than divert their \nattention or resources to a strategy they believe is wrong.\n  If States do implement mandatory testing programs, this provision \nrequires that States have in place protection against insurance \ndiscrimination based on HIV status or based on the fact that an \nindividual has undergone HIV testing. This protection adds to the \nprotection already provided under the Americans With Disabilities Act \n[ADA].\n  Under the ADA, an insurance company or an employer cannot place \ndifferent requirements or restrictions on people with HIV or AIDS than \nthey place on people with diseases of similar financial risk. This \nprotects against insurance discrimination based on fears and myths, \nrather than objective actuarial and financial considerations.\n  The requirements in this provision add to those of the ADA, and \nprohibit insurance discrimination against individuals who have simply \nundergone HIV testing. The ADA has an important provision which \nprotects people who are perceived to have HIV or AIDS. Many people who \nhave undergone HIV tests, and are subsequently discriminated against, \nmay be perceived as having HIV and are thus protected by the ADA. But \nthis provision makes clear that such individuals may not be \ndiscriminated against in insurance, whether or not they are perceived \nas having HIV.\n  The reason for this provision is clear. As I have noted, I do not \nbelieve mandatory testing is appropriate. But if a State ultimately \nchooses to fulfill its obligations under this law by enacting such \ntesting, it must also ensure that comprehensive insurance protection is \nin place. Congress has already ensured significant protection when we \npassed the ADA. These State laws or regulations will complement such \nprotection.\n  Like most compromises, it is not perfect and it will not please \neveryone. But on balance, it is a fair one. We have sought sound \npolicy. We have listened to those on the frontlines. And we have \nattempted to support their efforts, not tie their hands.\n  With the enactment of this conference report, Congress has put aside \npolitical, geographic, and institutional differences to face this \nimportant challenge squarely--and in all likelihood, successfully.\n  In these times of partisan politics and scarce resources, it is a \ntribute to the effectiveness of this landmark legislation that Congress \nvoted nearly unanimously to continue this program--and to provide a \n$105 million increase for this year.\n  This action will sustain and expand the act's lifeline. It will \nprovide better care and support for hundreds of thousands of \nindividuals and families caught in the epidemic's path.\n  The Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act, however, is about more than \nFederal funds and health care services. It is also about caring and the \nAmerican tradition of reaching out to people who are suffering and in \nneed of help. Ryan White would be proud of what is happening in his \nname. His example, and the tireless commitment of so many others, are \nbringing help and hope to our American family living with AIDS.\n  I am pleased that the House of Representatives passed the conference \nreport earlier this evening by a vote of 402 to 4 and I urge my \ncolleagues to unanimously approve this critically important conference \nreport.\n  Before we take final action, I would like to thank the committee \nstaff who have worked tirelessly on this legislation and made it \npossible for us to reach this point. First and foremost, I would like \nto thank Michael Iskowitz of my staff, who was instrumental in the \ndevelopment of this act in 1990, and who has been indispensable \nthroughout this reauthorization process.\n  I would also like to thank Seth Kilbourn who, during his detail with \nthe Labor Committee, proved invaluable to our efforts. Finally, I would \nlike to thank Senator Kassebaum and her able staff, including Kent \nBradley, Jim Wade, and Marty Ross. This has been a solidly bipartisan \neffort and I am grateful to the chairman and her staff for their \ncooperation and collaboration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks, a summary of the legislation \nand of the voluntary testing compromise be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Ryan White AIDS CARE Act Summary\n\n\n                   Title I--Disaster Relief to Cities\n\n       Provides emergency assistance to metropolitan areas hardest \n     hit by the AIDS epidemic. Urban areas with more than 2,000 \n     diagnosed AIDS cases qualify for such assistance (FY91=16 \n     cities, FY93=24 cities, FY95=42, and FY96=48 projected \n     cities).

Focusing on voluntary testing of pregnant women rather \n     than mandatory testing of newborns is the approach supported \n     by medical professionals and public health officials as the \n     most effective means of preventing perinatal transmission of \n     HIV. The compromise contains the following provisions.\n       Provides $10 million to assist states in implementing the \n     CDC guidelines which call for voluntary HIV counseling, \n     testing, and treatment for pregnant women. For states to \n     access these funds, they must have adopted the CDC \n     guidelines.\n       Within 4 months of enactment (Sept. 1996), the CDC, in \n     consultation with states, must develop and implement a system \n     for states to gather data related to perinatal transmission, \n     to document reduction in such transmission.\n       The Secretary of HHS is directed to contract with the \n     Institute of Medicine to evaluate the extent to which state \n     efforts have been effective in reducing perinatal \n     transmission of HIV and to analyze the existing barriers to \n     further reduction in such transmission. Within two years of \n     enactment (May 1998), the Secretary shall report these \n     findings to Congress along with any recommendations made by \n     the Institute.\n       After 2 years and 4 months (Sept. 1998), the Secretary of \n     HHS will make a determination of whether mandatory HIV \n     testing of all infants born in the US whose mothers have not \n     undergone prenatal HIV testing has become routine practice in \n     the provision of health care in the US. This determination \n     will be made in consultation with states and experts.\n       If the Secretary determines that such mandatory testing has \n     become routine practice, after an additional 18 month period \n     (March 2000), a state will not continue to receive Title 2 \n     Ryan White funding unless it can demonstrate one of the \n     following:\n       (1). A 50 percent reduction (or a comparable measure for \n     states with less than 10\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\n     cases) in the rate of new AIDS cases resulting from perinatal \n     transmission, comparing the most recent data to 1993 data;\n       (2). At least 95% of women who are received at least two \n     prenatal visits prior to 34 weeks gestation have been testing \n     for HIV; or\n       (3). A Program for mandatory testing of all newborns whose \n     mothers have not undergone prenatal HIV testing.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof the Ryan White CARE Act; I am proud to have served on the conference \ncommittee for this very vital legislation; and I am proud to be here \ntoday to speak in support of the bill's final passage. As most of us \nare aware, AIDS has become one of the most difficult and complicated \npublic health threats in recent memory. For this reason, the Ryan White \nCARE Act is important not only for to those already infected with HIV \nor suffering from AIDS--as a public health bill, this legislation is \nimportant for all of us.\n  We've said it a number of times before, but it bears repeating: AIDS \nis now the leading killer of men and women ages 25 to 44. AIDS has \nkilled over 300,000 people since the beginning of the epidemic in the \nearly 1980's--but half of those people, 154,077, have died in the past \n2 years. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 1 \nmillion people are now infected with HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS. \nClearly, then, AIDS is challenging our health care system in ways it \nhas not been challenged before.\n  We discussed this bill at length nearly a year ago, so I want to take \na few minutes to remind my colleagues of the valuable programs they \nwill help to support today. As I've already mentioned, the bill \nprovides health services to those already living with AIDS. It also \nrelieves pressure from our critical care units and emergency rooms by \nutilizing early intervention techniques with AIDS and HIV patients.\n  The programs we're reauthorizing today work at the local level, and \nthey're cost-effective--two things we've tried hard to stay focused on \nin this Congress. The Ryan White CARE Act funds community based \norganizations to provide needed outpatient care at the local level in \nthe most cost effective and efficient ways possible for the populations \nthat need help the most. One study even indicated that a person \nreceiving outpatient managed care spends 8 fewer days in the hospital \nthan a person not receiving such care--resulting in a cost savings of \nover $22,000 per person.\n  Dollars from the CARE Act increase the availability of critical \noutpatient primary care services; they provide support services; and \nthey improve the quality of life of those living with HIV. In Vermont, \nCARE Act money is used primarily to provide pharmaceuticals to people \nwith HIV and AIDS who need drugs, but cannot afford them.\n  Successful outpatient care keeps people out of the hospital, improves \ntheir quality of life, and saves money for the system. When early \ninterventions and primary care are used successfully, the health care \nsystem saves untold dollars in unused emergency health services. From a \npurely fiscal perspective, we cannot afford not to fund these programs.\n  Finally, let me remind my colleagues that this is not a disease from \nwhich we can remove ourselves so easily as we might expect. Any of us \nwho previously felt confident we could not be touched by HIV or AIDS \nbecause AIDS affects other people must now reexamine those assumptions. \nSoon we will all have friends whose lives have been touched by this \ndisease. I had the honor of hosting one of my friends, David Curtis, at \na Labor Committee hearing on this bill. The face of AIDS is changing, \nit is affecting the people I know and the people we all know.\n  If we and our loved ones are affected, I know we will want adequate \nresources to be available to help with prescription drugs, health care \nand support services. The Ryan White CARE Act is an assurance that help \nwill be available. So for my friend, David Curtis and the millions of \nother Americans affected by HIV, I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting final passage of the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the conference \nreport be deemed adopted, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the conference report be \nincluded in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate will have a period for morning \nbusiness only tomorrow, and no rollcall votes will occur during \nFriday's session of the Senate.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will recess until 12 noon on \nMonday, May 6th. Following morning business on Monday, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate turn to the consideration of Calendar No. 380, \nH.R. 2937, regarding White House Travel Office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, it is \nmy hope that the Senate could dispose of the White House Travel Office \nbill by the close of business on Monday. I did not hear the debate \nbetween the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Iowa, but, \nhopefully, if there are problems, we can work those problems out. We \nhope there are not any nongermane amendments. We will see what happens. \nPerhaps we could find that out before or maybe on Monday because I may \nfill up what we call the amendment tree--I prefer not to do that--in \norder to keep the Senate germane to the pending issue.\n  There will be no rollcall votes during Monday's session of the \nSenate, and the Senate may be asked to consider any other legislative \nmatters that may be cleared for action.\n  I know there are a number of nominations on the calendar. I have \nnever been one to try to hold up nominations, but I would just say to \nthe White House they have had nominations--Republican nominees have \nbeen down there for 6 to 8 months--that have not been sent to the \nappropriate committees. It seems to me there ought to be some \nreciprocity here. If they continue at the White House to say, ``We are \nnot going to send Republican nominees out,'' we do not find it very \ndifficult to say, ``Why should we clear nominations the White House \nwants?''--whether judicial nominations or any others.\n  So I hope we could have some understanding because I have never been \none, regardless of who is in the White House, to try to hold up \nnominations. These nominees have families and obligations but so do the \nfamilies we have sent down months and months and months ago. They are \nstill waiting for some word from the White House. They cannot have it \nboth ways.\n  I also hope that we could still work out some agreement--we made a \ntentative suggestion to our colleagues on the other side with reference \nto the minimum wage. I will ask Senator Lott to try to meet again early \nnext week with Senator Daschle or his designee to see if we can work \nout some time to take up that matter, either as a part of something \nelse, which I will not speculate what it might be, or have separate \nvotes, parallel votes on our proposal and a Democratic proposal, \nbecause we would like to proceed with the legislation and not have \nnongermane amendments at every turn. It took us 8 days to complete an \nimmigration bill that probably should have taken 3 days, and I hope \nthat we can catch up. We need to catch up so we can hopefully enjoy a \nrecess or a few days off the end of this month. We have\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\na number of bills we think should be completed prior to that time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4649-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Once again I should have been here a few moments ago \nbecause it was my understanding that one of my colleagues, and perhaps \neven the majority leader himself, made some reference to the \nappointment of judges by President Clinton.\n  Mr. DOLE. Not today.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I did not hear the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I did not make any reference today to the appointment of \njudges, but I did make a reference to the fact that judges in the \nsecond and ninth circuits have been reaching for some way to find a \nconstitutional right to die, and I thought that should be decided by \nthe legislative branch.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I see. Notwithstanding the majority leader's assurances \nthat he has not talked about President Clinton's appointments to the \nbench, Mr. President, I think the record should fairly reflect what the \nfacts are about this. I really appreciate the majority leader yielding \nto me for a moment.\n  The appointments of President Clinton's judges--in fact, almost two-\nthirds of President Clinton's judicial appointments--have received the \nAmerican Bar Association's highest rating: ``Well qualified,'' the \nhighest percentage of any of his three predecessors.\n  Second, U.S. News and World Report is saying with regard to President \nClinton's appointments to the bench, and I quote, ``Centrism is \ncarrying the day.''\n  Third, even Senator Hatch, our colleague and friend from Utah, our \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has as \nrecently as August 3, 1995, Mr. President, stated at a confirmation \nhearing, and I quote:\n\n       I wish to compliment the administration for the type of \n     people they are sending to us. It is making our job much \n     easier.\n\n  That is a direct quote from the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. Only two more \ncomments, because I know the distinguished majority leader may be \nneeding to get on.\n  Only 3--only 3--of the 185 judges in the lower Federal court \nappointed by President Clinton have been even the subject of contested \nvotes. They did not even have a vote--only three have been subjected to \na contested vote in the Judiciary Committee or in this Chamber. I think \nthis is a remarkable record.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say that the Senate has approved \nunanimously with the consent of all Republicans 182 of 185 lower court \nFederal judges President Clinton has nominated and were ultimately \napproved for the bench.\n  So I think from time to time it is necessary for us to put the facts \nout in the Record, and I am very, very grateful for the understanding \nand the opportunity the majority leader has given me to make this \nrecord.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I would only say the fact \nthat they got the highest rating by the American Bar Association \nworries me even more. It is nothing but a liberal advocacy group, and \nthat should indicate what kind of judges are being given these very \nhigh ratings. The more liberal you are, the higher rating you get from \nthe American Bar Association.\n  It is customary, it has been in Democratic and Republican \nadministrations, to honor a President's nominees unless there was some \nreason--sometimes you do not know until after they have, in this case, \nbeen on the bench and made a few rulings to see precisely which \ndirection they can go, but we will be happy to accommodate the Senator \nfrom Arkansas if he would like to have all these contested in the \nfuture. I do not know how many judicial nominees are on the calendar \nnow.\n\n  So I would just say, obviously, the President has a right to appoint \nthe judges that he believes more or less follow his philosophy and \nothers would have the right to appoint those who follow their \nphilosophy. That debate will probably continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4650-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is also my hope that we can complete \naction on the Billy Dale matter on Tuesday, and then also Amtrak \nauthorization which is, as I understand, not particularly \ncontroversial, and the firefighters discrimination bill, S. 849. We \nhope we might be able to reach a time agreement on the firefighters \ndiscrimination bill. I think it has broad bipartisan support. I know \nthe Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] has an amendment; the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] has an amendment. There are three or \nfour amendments on each side. Some will be adopted, some will be \ndefeated. But I would like to complete action on that bill early next \nweek so that we can move on to other matters before the week is out.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if the majority leader will answer a \nquestion, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am wondering--I guess we are calling the compensation \nmeasure, the Travelgate issue, Billy Dale--which is fine. I think we \nwill just call it the Billy Dale legislation.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not have a number.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I wonder if the majority leader might be favorably \ndisposed to any kind of amendment to that which might set up a fund to \nultimately compensate those people regarding the Whitewater matter who \nmay have been called here or called to Little Rock or called to some \ngrand jury, to help them be compensated for their legal fees, if they \nwere not a target of the investigation, not a subject of the \ninvestigation, and are found to be destitute and cannot pay their legal \nbills. I wonder if the majority leader would look kindly on such an \namendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would certainly look kindly on having the Senate \nJudiciary Committee considering that. I think Senator Hatch would be \nvery receptive.\n  My view is, if someone who is not a target is not only inconvenienced \nbut must go out and hire counsel, there should be some recompense. I do \nnot care whether it is Whitewater or whatever it may be.\n  So I would certainly, if I could work with the Senator from Arkansas \nand encourage the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, to immediately go \nto work on it, perhaps we can work out something.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/02/senate-section/article/S4650-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4650-S4651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
