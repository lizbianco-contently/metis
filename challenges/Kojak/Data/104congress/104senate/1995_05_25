Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes on this rescissions package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I merely wanted to say, in conclusion of \nthis process on the rescissions package, I am very hopeful that the \nPresident will sign this bill. If he does not sign this bill, of \ncourse, there are problems relating particularly to the supplemental \nappropriations that are included in this bill.\n  We have worked long and hard on this. I want to take this occasion to \nthank my colleague from the Democratic side of the aisle, Senator Byrd, \nthe ranking member of the full committee; each of subcommittee chairs \nand each of the subcommittee ranking members, and the extraordinary \nstaff that we have on both sides that have worked together very \ncarefully.\n  Mr. President, I cannot predict what will happen. There have been \ndiscussions between the Republican leadership of the House and the \nSenate with the White House wondering if there might be a better way to \nachieve a [[Page S7406]] common goal that the President has and we \nhave. I make no predictions.\n  I must say, I am terribly disappointed we had so few Democrats \nsupport this measure today, because I can say one thing: If there is a \nrevision or if there is a new package that comes down the track, we \nwill not have enough votes on this side to pass it. I, therefore, would \nurge that the White House take a very careful view of the politics of \ngetting any other package passed, even one that we might be able to \nagree to.\n  I thank my colleagues on the committee, both the Republicans and \nDemocrats, for having brought us to a conclusion at this point on the \nrescissions conference report.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I voted against the bill before the \nSenate today because of its misplaced priorities: cuts in education, \ncuts in training, cuts in housing, but no cuts in programs which do not \naddress critical needs or waste tax dollars.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton has shown real leadership by drawing \na line in the sand and standing up for important investments in our \nfuture. The President has repeatedly made it clear that he wants to \nwork with the Congress to reduce spending, but that it is his \nresponsibility to protect important investments in our future. The \nPresident does not want to pile up a stack of veto messages. He wants \nto work with the Congress to move legislation that will help the \nAmerican people. He saw gridlock in the last Congress and does not want \nto repeat the experience.\n  Despite his efforts to cooperate, the House of Representatives \ncrafted a bill to cut programs which the President found unacceptable. \nThe Senate, after a great deal of effort, came up with a deficit \nreduction bill which every Member voted for and which the President \nsaid he could sign. In conference with the House of Representatives, \nhowever, it changed again. Almost 85 percent of the funding for \npriorities important to the President was eliminated. That was done, in \nmany cases, without Democratic members of the Appropriations Committee \nhaving access to the decisionmaking process. I support the President's \ndecision to veto this bill, and have voted against it.\n  Mr. President, rather than force a useless confrontation, we can and \nshould have revised this legislation and passed it. Everyone agrees \nthat the disaster relief in this bill is important. Everyone agrees \nthat the aid to Oklahoma in this bill is critical. Everyone agrees that \nthe aid to Jordan in this bill protects our national self-interest. And \neveryone agrees that we can and should cut some of the funding \nappropriated for certain programs last year.\n  It was irresponsible for the Republican majority, in a fit of \npartisan political pique, to simply refuse to revise this legislation \nand get it passed. Yet the most ardent budget cutters claimed they were \ntoo busy to save the American taxpayers a mere $10 billion or so in \nwhat they see as unnecessary and wasteful spending. That, Mr. \nPresident, is ridiculous. If we had worked with the administration, we \ncould have quickly adopted legislation to give people the aid they need \nand the reductions in overall spending they want.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the initial Senate version of this bill, a \nbill which more closely met my own priorities, especially when compared \nto the House measure. I was not entirely satisfied with the Senate \nbill. We cut billions from housing programs, but we did not touch a \npenny of military spending. We cut billions from education and training \nprograms, but we did not touch wasteful subsidies which go to wealthy \nand corporate agricultural interests. We cut millions for dozens of \nimportant, productive, and efficient programs, but we did not look for \nthe waste and mismanagement which permeates too many of our programs. \nThat situation did not get better in conference. We cut $1.4 billion in \njob training funds and another $831 million in education. Look at the \nspecifics: $65 million for adult job training, gone; $67 million for \ndisplaced workers, gone; $12.5 million for school to work programs, \ngone; $236 million for the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program, gone; \n$91 million for vocational and adult education, gone. Those programs \nrepresent an investment in our future, and those cuts make that future \na little darker.\n  So, Mr. President, I oppose this conference report. I still believe \nthe Government can play a role in improving the lives of the American \npeople. I accept and embrace the need to reduce the deficit and get \ncontrol over spending, but I believe we can do that while still \naddressing the needs we face as a nation.\n  Given that, Mr. President, I voted against this bill and will support \nthe President's veto. I hope our colleagues will quickly move to put \ntogether a bill which meets our obligations to reduce overall Federal \nspending while preserving programs that help people.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I voted for the original rescissions bill \nbecause the reductions were reasonable and because we had restored 80 \npercent of the education cuts that were contained in the House bill. I \nfervently hoped that the Senate position on education would prevail in \nthe House-Senate conference. Unfortunately, it did not. As a result \nthere are drastic cuts in several important Federal education programs, \nsuch as safe and drug free schools, dropout prevention, and education \nreform. Because of this, I cannot support the conference report.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \nemergency disaster supplemental conference report. We are faced with a \ndifficult decision: Parts of the Nation, including California, \ndesperately need the emergency disaster funds contained in this bill, \nyet many of the cuts in this legislation, such as the Safe and Drug \nFree Schools Program and the Summer Youth Employment Program, will harm \nmany of those very people we are intending to help the most.\n  However, emergency spending is just that, and American families \naffected by natural disasters cannot wait for us in Washington to get \nour acts together to begin providing relief. Since the beginning of \nthis year, there have been seven new disaster declarations, including \ntwo floods in California, flooding in South Dakota, tornadoes in \nAlabama, the great tragedy of Oklahoma City, and flooding in Louisiana \nand Mississippi. FEMA has also undertaken preliminary damage \nassessments in Tennessee and Kentucky as a result of the tremendous \nrain and hail storms that recently swept through that area, and in \nSouth Dakota as a result of flooding.\n  Also, and more recently, the specter of the Mississippi River's \nrecent cresting and the snowpacks melting in California reinforces the \nurgency for this timely assistance. I note with trepidation and concern \nthat tornado season in the South and Midwest, and hurricane season in \nthe Gulf and East Coast States will both soon be here.\n  In addition to this year's disasters, this funding will also go to \ncontinue or closeout the disaster assistance accounts in 40 other \nStates for over 280 separate Federal disaster assistance obligations.\n  I understand President Clinton has said he will veto this bill. I \nwelcome the recent comments by Chairman Hatfield and Chairman \nLivingston which would indicate at the very least a willingness to work \ntoward providing this needed relief. I urge the administration and the \nleadership of both parties to work together toward a speedy resolution \nof the impasse we will soon face.\n  I fully support efforts to cut spending and reduce the deficit and \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the future toward that \nend. However, there are other vehicles for deficit reduction; we spent \nmost of this week on the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution. Very soon \nwe will also begin considering the fiscal year 1996 appropriations \nbills. I respectfully submit to my colleagues that these are the proper \nvehicles for controlling spending and deficit reduction and I pledge to \nwork with them at the appropriate time to make those difficult \ndecisions.\n  Let me reiterate that this is a national disaster relief bill. Now is \nthe time for the Congress to come through for Americans who have been \naffected by national disasters. Let us not allow this obligation to get \nmired down in partisan bickering over which programs to cut and when to \ncut them. We will have the opportunity to make these cuts later; this \nemergency assistance, however, cannot wait.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this conference report and to work with \nthe administration toward formulating a disaster assistance bill that \ncan both pass [[Page S7407]] the Congress and be signed by the \nPresident.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the conference \nreport on the emergency supplemental and rescission bill. Some of the \ncuts in the report were well deserved. The emergency relief for \nCalifornia and Oklahoma is certainly much needed. But you do not buy a \nhorse because it has two good legs, and I will not vote for a \nrescission bill whose cuts have such a lopsided affect on low- and \nmiddle-income Americans. There is a better way to cut spending.\n  Last month I supported the Senate in overwhelmingly passing a \nrescission bill that, while far from perfect, put the emphasis of cuts \nwhere it should be, on pork not the poor. The Senate bill included cuts \nto earmarked courthouse construction, American subsidized broadcasting \nto Europe--a hard program to support when public broadcasting at home \nis being cut, and unused funding for transportation projects.\n  The House cuts had a much difference focus, a focus that \nunfortunately the conference report has adopted. The conference package \ncuts $319 million from low-income fuel assistance programs, $113 \nmillion--five times the Senate level of cuts--to low-income education \nprograms, and $1.5 billion more than the Senate proposed in cuts to \nassisted housing programs. Affordable housing took the biggest cut, \nwith the conference report rescinding $7 billion from Department of \nHousing and Urban Development--30 percent of this year's budget.\n  These cuts are not equitable, they are not fair to working American \nfamilies, they are not the cuts the Senate voted for on April 6. I hope \nthat there will be an opportunity to return the focus of this \nrescission bill to the programs that the Senate bill targeted. The \ndisaster victims need the assistance the supplemental will provide. Let \nus get it to them without making victims of middle-class American \nfamilies.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, regrettably, I do not support the \nconference agreement before us today. While it cuts this year's funding \nby $16.4 billion, and adds new spending for the California earthquake, \nother disasters and the Oklahoma City catastrophe, it misses the target \non some very fundamental issues. I support cutting spending and \nreducing the deficit. But the cuts in this bill are in the wrong \nprograms and in the wrong amounts.\n   Mr. President, I voted for this bill when it originally passed the \nSenate. I did so because immediately before final passage a carefully \ncrafted bipartisan amendment by Senators Dole and Daschle was adopted \nto restore some money for certain critical health, education, and \ntraining programs that had been deeply cut in the bill.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Dole-Daschle amendment was gutted \nby the conferees. This bill now rescinds $813 million in education \nfunding, almost three times the amount that was included in the \noriginal Senate bill. It cuts education reform programs, it cuts \nstudent loan programs, and it cuts money to keep schools safe and kids \noff of drugs. That is simply unacceptable. What could be a higher \nnational priority than investing in our kids? How can we say on the one \nhand that drugs in our schools have reached epidemic proportions, and \non the other hand cut funding for the Safe and Drug Free Schools \nProgram? These cuts just do not meet the commonsense test, and I think \nmost Americans will agree.\n  Equally disturbing to me is the amount of funding that was cut from \ntraining programs. These cuts total $1.4 billion. The bill makes deep \ncuts in the Youth Job Training Program, the Youth Unemployment Program, \nand the School-to-Work Program. These are programs that help \ndisadvantaged kids obtain the skills they will need to move into the \nwork force and become productive citizens.\n  How can we in good conscience support big cuts in programs for \nchildren from struggling families in order to pay for tax cuts for the \nwealthy? I do not think average Americans support these reductions. I \nthink they would prefer that we close corporate tax loopholes rather \nthan eliminate the helping hand low-income youth might need to have a \nbrighter future. I think they would rather have us spend $1 billion on \nyouth training programs than $50 billion on star wars. I think the \naverage American family would rather have us spend money to keep poor \nseniors from freezing in the winter than paying for some Member's pork \nproject.\n  There also appears to be a hidden agenda in this bill. Rather than \nearmarking all the spending cuts in the bill for deficit reduction, \nthere are $50 billion in long-term savings that are not set aside for \nthat purpose. The motive of Republican tax cut proponents is clear. \nThey want that money to finance a big tax cut package for the affluent.\n  Because I think this conference agreement establishes the wrong set \nof spending priorities and does not use all the savings for deficit \nreduction, I am pleased that the President has threatened to veto it. \nWe start over, we can produce a better product.\n  The President has sent us his guidelines for a package of cuts he \nwill support. His proposal has deeper spending cuts than are contained \nin this bill. But his priorities are different. He would restore money \nfor education, training, health, veterans and poor pregnant women. And \nhe would pay for spending on these programs by cutting funding for \nFederal buildings, government travel, and highway projects.\n  The President wants us to continue to invest in people, not pork. I \nhappen to share that view. Investing in our people, especially in kids \nwho are at risk of falling through the cracks of the social safety net, \nis the value system I want to represent, and those are the values I \nbelieve most Americans support.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Conference \nReport on H.R. 1158. While I am a strong supporter of deficit \nreduction, I am opposed to the precedent of requiring large budget cuts \nin order to pay for emergency disaster relief. In addition, I believe \nthis bill undermines programs which make the investments in our \nNation's future. In addition, my own State of Maryland suffers a \ndisproportionate share of the rescissions which will have a negative \nimpact on Maryland's economy. For these reasons, I am opposed to this \nbill.\n  The conference report made a very deep cut in funding for the \nconsolidation of the Food and Drug Administration facilities in \nMontgomery County, MD. The conferees' decision to rescind $228 million \nwill delay the consolidation of FDA facilities which are in desperate \nneed of modernization. I believe that modernizing the FDA is a national \npriority that is vital to protecting public health and safety and \nimproving the regulatory capability of this agency.\n  This conference report also makes significant cuts in the VA/HUD \nSubcommittee budget in order to pay for disaster funding for \nNorthridge, CA and Oklahoma City. It is wrong to require programs \nwithin the jurisdiction of single appropriations subcommittee to bear \nthe costs of funding national disasters. Funding assistance for \nnational disasters is a national responsibility requiring everyone to \ncontribute.\n  During the Senate's consideration of H.R. 1158, I offered an \namendment to that would have made an across-the-board cut in \ndiscretionary spending to pay for disaster relief in a more equitable \nmanner. Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated.\n  As the flood waters once again rise throughout the Midwest, we are \nreminded of the need to establish a rainy day fund to prepay the costs \nof disaster relief. Our failure to establish such a fund is costing VA-\nHUD programs $8.5 billion--over 10 percent of all the funds \nappropriated for VA-HUD programs in FY 1995.\n  The conference agreement also nearly triples the Senate-passed \nrescissions for education programs and doubles the amount of funding \nrescinded for national service. These programs represent the kind of \nstrategic investments that I believe the we have to make if we are to \nprepare future generations for the 21st century.\n  While the conferees did recognize the value and need of moving \nforward with this project in the future, I will continue to fight for \nFDA consolidation despite the rescission contained in this bill.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I am opposed to the conference \nreport to H.R. 1158.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7405-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7408-S7416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, which the \nclerk will report\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for the \n     fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1168\n    (Purpose: To allow the shift of up to $1 billion from wasteful \n bureaucratic overhead and wasteful procurement in the military budget \n       for use in strengthening enforcement of immigration laws)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Lautenberg and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1168.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 68, add at the end of line 12 the following: ``In \n     addition, paragraph (1)(B) of this section shall not apply to \n     legislation that proposes to eliminate up to $1,000,000,000 \n     from wasteful bureaucratic overhead and wasteful procurement \n     in the military budget, and to apply the resulting savings \n     for use in strengthening enforcement of immigration laws.''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment would allow the shift \nof up to $1 billion from wasteful bureaucratic overhead and procurement \nin the military budget, for use in fighting illegal immigration.\n  Let me take a moment and explain why the amendment is needed.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution proposes to reestablish a so-\ncalled firewall that will give special protection to the military \nbudget--protection not provided to any other program in the entire \nGovernment. Under this provision, a majority of the Senate would be \nblocked from shifting funds from the military budget for use in meeting \ndomestic needs here at home. The only way to waive the prohibition \nwould be to obtain a supermajority of 60 votes.\n  Mr. President, I strongly object to this supermajority vote \nrequirement. In my view, if a majority of the Senate thinks it's more \nimportant to address a particular domestic problem than to spend more \nmoney on the Pentagon bureaucracy, or on an outdated weapon system, a \nmajority ought to have that right.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate seems determined to establish a firewall \nfor the military budget. And so it seems inevitable that the firewall \nwill indeed be erected. However, I am hopeful that my colleagues will \nagree to reasonable exceptions to allow the transfer of funds for \nparticularly compelling purposes.\n  The premise of my amendment, Mr. President, is that fighting illegal \nimmigration is one such compelling purpose.\n  Mr. President, illegal immigration is rampant in this country. Some \nestimates show that 300,000 illegal immigrants come to this country \neach year. Despite its past admirable work, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service is woefully understaffed and underfunded.\n  We need more border patrol agents to stop illegal immigration and \nother INS officials to help deport those who are living in this country \nillegally.\n  Mr. President, illegal immigration is a major problem. Ask State and \nlocal officials from California, Texas, Florida, New York, and New \nJersey about the toll that illegal immigration takes on their economies \nand local services.\n  Mr. President, at a minimum a majority of the Senate ought to be free \nto provide up to $1 billion into fighting illegal immigration, if we \ncan identify savings from military spending that the Senate agrees is \nwasteful.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment will allow the transfer of up \nto $1 billion from the wasteful bureaucratic overhead and wasteful \nprocurement in the military budget for use in strengthening enforcement \nof the immigration laws without the 60-vote point of order that would \notherwise apply to such transfer.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment exempts legislation, \nwhich would transfer $1 billion from defense to immigration, from the \npoint of order for breaching the nondefense firewall.\n  This amendment is not germane and is subject to a point of order. \nTherefore, I make a point of order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand there are about 54 amendments, \nbut only about 30 will require rollcall votes. I thought maybe we would \ndo 20 today and 10 tomorrow--whatever is left tomorrow--and still try \nto accommodate the President on the antiterrorism bill. But it is going \nto be very difficult to do that. As long as he understands why we \ncannot do it, I assume he will not hold me responsible. We do not want \nto do all these today, we have so many.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to an agreement I had made with \nthe minority, I withdraw my point of order at this point. Therefore, we \nwill be voting up or down on the Lautenberg amendment, which is what I \nindicated a moment ago.\n  Mr. EXON. Have the yeas and nays been ordered? I ask for the yeas and \nnays, if they have not been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     for himself and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1169.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 68, add at the end of line 12 the following: ``In \n     addition, paragraph (1)(B) of this section shall not apply to \n     legislation that proposes to eliminate up to $2,000,000,000 \n     from wasteful bureaucratic overhead and wasteful procurement \n     in the military budget, and to apply the resulting savings \n     for use in addressing the problem of domestic violence.''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment would allow the shift \nof up to $2 billion from wasteful bureaucratic overhead and procurement \nin the military budget, for use in addressing the problem of domestic \nviolence.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution proposes to reestablish a so-\ncalled firewall that will give special protection to the military \nbudget--protection not provided to any other program in the entire \nGovernment. Under this provision, a majority of the Senate would be \nblocked from shifting funds from the military budget for use in meeting \ndomestic needs here at home. The only way to waive the prohibition \nwould be to obtain a supermajority of 60 votes.\n  This supermajority vote requirement, in my view, is wrong. As I see \nit, if a majority of the Senate believes it's more important to address \na particular domestic problem than to lavish more money on the Pentagon \nbureaucracy, or on an unnecessary weapons system, a majority ought to \nhave that right.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate seems determined to establish a firewall \nfor the military budget. And so it seems inevitable that the firewall \nwill indeed be erected. However, I am hopeful that my colleagues will \nagree to reasonable exceptions to allow the transfer of funds for \nparticularly compelling purposes.\n  Mr. President, fighting domestic violence deserves to be a very high \npriority.\n  Mr. President, every 12 seconds, a woman is battered in the United \nStates. Each year, over 4,000 women are killed by their abusers.\n  Mr. President, domestic violence has reached crisis proportions. And \nwe have got to do--it is critical that we do everything possible to \nrespond.\n  Mr. President, I know that many of my Republican colleagues do not \nbelieve that there is any waste in the Pentagon budget. I think they \nare wrong. But even if they are not yet convinced, I hope they will \nsupport the amendment. Under my proposal, it will be up to the Senate \nto decide whether any particular item of military spending is wasteful. \nThat is a judgment that a majority of Senators should be allowed to \nmake in the future. Also, the amendment limits transfers to $2 billion, \nwhich represents less than 1 percent of the military budget.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment poses this question to my \ncolleagues: Whose side are you on? Do you want to support wasteful \nbureaucratic overhead at the Pentagon? Or do you want to stand with \nAmerica's women, and support the fight against domestic violence?\n  I think it is an easy choice. And I hope my colleagues agree.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment would allow the transfer of \nup to $2 billion from the wasteful bureaucratic overhead and wasteful \nprocurement in the military budget for use in addressing the problems \nof domestic violence without the 60 vote point of order that would \notherwise apply to such a transfer.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a little different \ninterpretation. So I would like to state it. This legislation would \ntransfer $2 billion out of the Department of Defense. We have no \nassurance what it would be used for, but it would be transferred out of \nDefense.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NUTRITIONAL HEALTH \n                   OF CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal nutrition programs, such as the school lunch \n     program, the school breakfast program, the special \n     supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and \n     children (referred to in this section as ``WIC''), the child \n     and adult care food program and others, are important to the \n     health and well-being of children;\n       (2) participation in Federal nutrition programs is \n     voluntary on the part of States, and the programs are \n     administered and operated by every State;\n       (3) a major factor that led to the creation of the school \n     lunch program was that a number of the recruits for the \n     United States armed forces in World War II failed physical \n     examinations due to problems related to inadequate nutrition;\n       (4)(A) WIC has proven to be extremely valuable in promoting \n     the health of newborn babies and children; and\n       (B) each dollar invested in the prenatal component of WIC \n     has been shown to save up to $3.50 in medicaid costs related \n     to medical problems that arise in the first 90 days after the \n     birth of an infant;\n       (5) the requirement that infant formula be purchased under \n     a competitive bidding system under section 17 of the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786) saved $1,000,000,000 \n     in fiscal year 1994 and enabled States to allow 1,600,000 \n     women, infants, and children to participate in WIC at no \n     additional cost to taxpayers; and\n       (6) a balanced Federal budget will provide economic \n     benefits to children alive today and to future generations of \n     Americans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution include the assumptions that-- [[Page S7410]] \n       (1) schools should continue to serve lunches that meet \n     minimum nutritional requirements based on tested nutritional \n     research;\n       (2) the content of WIC food packages for infants, children, \n     and pregnant and postpartum women should continue to be based \n     on scientific evidence;\n       (3) the competitive bidding system for infant formula under \n     section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n     1786) should be maintained;\n       (4) foods of minimum nutritional value should not be sold \n     in competition with school lunches in the school cafeterias \n     during lunch hours;\n       (5) some reductions in nutrition program spending can be \n     made without compromising the nutritional well-being of \n     program recipients;\n       (6) in complying with the reconciliation instructions in \n     section 6 of this resolution, the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate should take this \n     section into account; and\n       (7) Congress should continue to move toward fully funding \n     the WIC program.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think this has wide bipartisan support. \nBasically this says we will continue the nutrition guidelines that this \nSenate has voted for many times, feeding programs, and will require \ncompetitive bidding in the sale of infant formula on WIC programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MAINTAINING FEDERAL FUNDING \n                   FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedoms and security;\n       (2) law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation and \n     support;\n       (3) law enforcement officers and agencies are under \n     increasing attacks, both to their physical safety and to \n     their reputations;\n       (4) on April 7, 1995, the Senate passed S.J. Res. 32 in \n     which the Senate recognizes the debt of gratitude the Nation \n     owes to the men and women who daily serve the American people \n     as law enforcement officers and the integrity, honesty, \n     dedication, and sacrifice of our Federal, State, and local \n     law enforcement officers;\n       (5) the Nation's sense of domestic tranquility has been \n     shaken by explosions at the World Trade Center in New York \n     and the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and by the \n     fear of violent crime in our cities, towns, and rural areas \n     across the Nation;\n       (6) Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts need \n     increased financial commitment from the Federal Government \n     and not the reduction of such commitment to law enforcement \n     if law enforcement officers are to carry out their efforts to \n     combat violent crime; and\n       (7) on April 5, 1995, and May 18, 1995, the House of \n     Representatives has nonetheless voted to reduce \n     $5,000,000,000 from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund in \n     order to provide for tax cuts in both H.R. 1215 and H. Con. \n     Res. 67.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that the Federal Government's commitment to \n     fund Federal law enforcement programs and programs to assist \n     State and local efforts should be maintained and funding for \n     the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund should not be reduced \n     by $5,000,000,000 as the bill and resolution passed by the \n     House of Representatives would require.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment by Senator Leahy was \nexplained in some detail but not fully during our limited debate.\n  Simply stated, this amendment corrects the House money removed from \nthe antiterrorism and violent crime trust fund to be used for a tax \ncut. In light of the Oklahoma bombing and the increased terrorist \nthreat, this amendment says we should put back the money that was taken \nout by the House.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have discussed this with the managers. I \nknow their concern in moving forward. I do not think anybody is going \nto oppose this, and I would accept a voice vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. This is in the Senate package, and \nactually we will accept it without a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The amendment (No. 1171) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I wish to thank--I am sure I would be joined \nby my colleague--Senator Leahy for his offer. We are moving much faster \nthan we had anticipated because we are cooperating.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1172\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for additional Medicare payment safeguards)\n\n  Mr. EXON.

MEDICARE SAFEGUARDS COMPLIANCE INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Adjustments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of points of order under the \n     Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and \n     concurrent resolutions on the budget--\n       (A) the discretionary spending limits under section \n     601(a)(2) of that Act (and those limits as cumulatively \n     adjusted) for the current fiscal year and each out-year;\n       (B) the allocations to the Committees on Appropriations of \n     the Senate and House of Representatives under sections 302(a) \n     and 602(a) of that Act;\n       (C) the levels for the major functional categories that are \n     appropriate and the appropriate budgetary aggregates in the \n     most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget; \n     and [[Page S7411]] \n       (D) the maximum deficit amount under section 601(a)(1) of \n     that Act (and that amount as cumulatively adjusted) for the \n     current fiscal year,\n\n     shall be adjusted to reflect the amount of additional new \n     budget authority or additional outlays (as defined in \n     paragraph (2)) reported by the Committees on Appropriations \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives in \n     appropriation Acts (or by the committee of conference on such \n     legislation) for the Health Care Financing Administration \n     medicare payment safeguards programs (as compared to the base \n     level of $396,300,000 for new budget authority) that the \n     Congressional Budget Office has determined will result in a \n     return on investment to the Government of at least 4 dollars \n     for each dollar invested.\n       (2) Additional amounts.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``additional new budget authority'' or ``additional outlays'' \n     (as the case may be) means, for any fiscal year, budget \n     authority in excess of $396,300,000 for payment safeguards, \n     but shall not exceed--\n       (A) for fiscal year 1996, $50,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $50,000,000 in outlays;\n       (B) for fiscal year 1997, $55,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $55,000,000 in outlays;\n       (C) for fiscal year 1998, $60,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $60,000,000 in outlays;\n       (D) for fiscal year 1999, $65,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $65,000,000 in outlays;\n       (E) for fiscal year 2000, $70,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $70,000,000 in outlays;\n       (F) for fiscal year 2001, $75,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $75,000,000 in outlays; and\n       (G) for fiscal year 2002, $75,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $75,000,000 in outlays;\n       (b) Revised Limits, Allocations, Levels, and Aggregates.--\n     Upon reporting of legislation pursuant to paragraph (1), and \n     again upon the submission of the conference report on such \n     legislation in either House (if a conference report is \n     submitted), the chairman of the Committees on the Budget of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives shall file with \n     their respective Houses appropriately revised--\n       (1) the discretionary spending limits under section \n     601(a)(2) of that Act (and those limits as cumulatively \n     adjusted) for the current fiscal year and each out-year;\n       (2) the allocations to the Committees on Appropriations of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives under sections \n     302(a) and 602(a) of that Act; and\n       (3) the levels for the appropriate major functional \n     categories that are appropriate and the appropriate budgetary \n     aggregates in the most recently agreed to concurrent \n     resolutions on the budget;\n\n     to carry out this subsection. These revised discretionary \n     spending limits, allocations, functional levels, and \n     aggregates shall be considered for purposes of congressional \n     enforcement under that Act as the discretionary spending \n     limits, allocations, functional levels, and aggregates.\n       (c) Reporting Revised Allocations.--The Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     may report appropriately revised allocations pursuant to \n     sections 302(b) and 602(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 to carry out this section.\n       (d) Application of Section.--This section shall not apply \n     to any additional budget authority or additional outlays \n     unless--\n       (1) in the Senate, the chairman of the Budget Committee \n     certifies, based on the information from the Congressional \n     Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, the Health Care \n     Financing Administration (as well as any other sources deemed \n     relevant), that such budget authority or outlays will not \n     increase the total of the Federal budget deficits over the \n     next 5 years; and\n       (2) any funds made available pursuant to such budget \n     authority or outlays are available only for the purpose of \n     carrying out Health Care Financing Administration payment \n     safeguards.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the General Accounting Office and the Health \nand Human Services inspectors general have found Medicare losses in \nbillions of dollars every year because of the inadequate payment \nsafeguards like audits and computer checks. Every dollar of investment \nin payment of safeguards saves $11 according to the GAO.\n  In order to increase efforts to cut Medicare waste, the amendment \nprovides an exclusion from the domestic discretionary caps only for \nincreases above current spending levels for Medicare payment \nsafeguards. This would occur only if the CBO finds that they will \nprovide at least a 4-to-1 return on investment. A limit is set at $50 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996, rising to $100 million in fiscal 2002.\n  It cannot be used as a loophole to provide for any other kind of \nadditional spending.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe we should turn this amendment \ndown. This once again increases spending for a special purpose. We \ndenied that for the IRS as to others taking it off budget.\n  That is essentially what this would do.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Mexico to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa. On this question, the yeas and nays were ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1173\n\n  (Purpose: Sense of the Senate regarding the need to enact long-term \n           care reforms to achieve lasting deficit reduction)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Feingold, for \n     himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Simon, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1173.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the resolution, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  . NEED TO ENACT LONG TERM HEALTH CARE REFORM.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that the 104th Congress \n     should enact fundamental long-term health care reform that \n     emphasizes cost-effective, consumer oriented, and consumer-\n     directed home and community-based care that builds upon \n     existing family supports and achieves deficit reduction by \n     helping elderly and disabled individuals remain in their own \n     homes and communities.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, Senator Feingold's amendment requests the \nsense of the Senate that the 104th Congress should enact fundamental \nlong-term health care reform that emphasizes cost-effective home and \ncommunity-based care and achieves deficit reduction by helping elderly \nand disabled individuals remain in their homes and communities.\n  I believe this amendment has possibly been agreed to and possibly \ncould be handled by a voice vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, our priority in this budget is ensuring \nthe short- and long-term solvency of Medicare, not necessarily \nrestructuring the entire health care system. But I am willing to accept \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the majority and I thank Senator \nFeingold.\n  I ask that the amendment be agreed to. [[Page S7412]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1173) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1174\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding losses to \n  Medicare and Medicaid and other health programs due to disease and \n                 disability caused by tobacco products)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Harkin, for \n     himself and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1174.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LOSSES CAUSED BY USE OF \n                   TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates that tobacco products impose a $20,000,000,000 cost \n     per year on Federal health programs like medicare and \n     medicaid through tobacco-related illnesses;\n       (2) tobacco products are unlike any other product legally \n     offered for sale because even when used an intended they \n     cause death and disease; and\n       (3) States such as Florida, Mississippi, Minnesota, and \n     West Virginia are currently taking action to recover State \n     costs associated with tobacco-related illnesses.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any proposal by the Committee on Finance of the Senate \n     to reduce Federal spending on medicare and medicaid as \n     required by Senate Concurrent Resolution 13 should include a \n     proposal to recover from tobacco companies a portion of the \n     costs their products impose on American taxpayers and Federal \n     health program including medicare and medicaid.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, a brief summary of the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa would indicate that it is the sense of the Senate \nthat any proposal by the Finance Committee to reduce spending on \nMedicare and Medicaid should include a proposal to recover from the \ntobacco companies a portion of the cost of their products imposed on \nMedicare and Medicaid and other Federal health programs. The Center for \nDisease and Prevention estimates that products sold by tobacco \ncompanies impose $200 billion a year on Medicare and Medicaid and other \nFederal health programs through tobacco-related illnesses.\n  The adoption of this amendment would put the Senate on record in \nsupport of the efforts to have tobacco companies pay a portion of the \ncosts of their products imposed on American taxpayers and the Medicare \nand Medicaid Programs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am just going to make a statement, \nthen I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Exon, I have been kind of patient in \nletting him just read what any Senator has to say. It is getting more \nand more like a speech. It was supposed to be a little brief statement \nof purpose.\n  I hope we can kind of work together and keep it to a statement of \npurpose in the future, or we will have to have somebody debate the \nissue on each one for an equal amount of time, and we do not want to do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this is a $140 billion tax increase. \nTherefore, on behalf of myself, Senator Robb, Senator Hollings, Senator \nHelms, Senator McConnell, Senator Faircloth, Senator Coverdell, Senator \nThompson, Senator Warner, Senator Frist, and Senator Thurmond, I move \nto table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the budget resolution we are debating \ntoday assumes that Federal grants for sewage treatment construction and \nsafe drinking water infrastructure would be phased out over the next 3 \nyears. If approved, this proposal would end the Federal Government's \n20-year commitment to assist cities and towns in cleaning up our \nNation's waters. My amendment would restore these funds--funds which \nare absolutely vital to State and local Government's efforts to meet \nwater quality standards under the Clean Water Act.\n  Since 1972--when we passed into law the Clean Water Act--Congress has \nprovided grants to States to help local governments meet water quality \nstandards. These Federal dollars are used to capitalize what are known \nas State revolving funds or loan programs. Under these revolving funds, \nStates provide low-interest construction loans to cities and towns to \nconstruct and improve wastewater treatment facilities. These grants \nhave been a centerpiece in our efforts to reduce point source water \npollution--the pollution that comes from sewer pipes and industrial \nwastewater pipes. They have also been instrumental in once again making \nmany of the rivers, lakes, and estuaries in this country fishable and \nswimmable.\n  In my home State of Maryland, these moneys, together with millions of \ndollars in State funds, have been a key to efforts to improve water \nquality and restore living resources in the Chesapeake Bay--the largest \nestuary in the United States and Maryland's most valuable resource. We \nstill have a long way to go, however, before the water quality of the \nbay is sufficient to sustain viable populations of many fish, \nshellfish, and bird species. Maryland has been counting on its State \nrevolving fund as one of its primary mechanisms for reaching the water \nquality goals that it and the other Chesapeake Bay Agreement \nsignatories made for the bay. In Maryland, the State revolving fund is \nused to upgrade treatment facilities, correct failing septic systems, \nretrofit urban areas with stormwater management facilities, and restore \ndegraded stream systems impacted from stormwater runoff from developed \nand agricultural areas. All of these improvements have a direct impact \non the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and its living resources.\n  This budget resolution eliminates grants to State revolving funds. it \nphases them out over the next 3 years, leaving State and local \ngovernments on their own to come up with the funds for adequate \nwastewater infrastructure and setting back our efforts to clean up the \napproximately 40 percent of the Nation's water bodies that are still \nimpaired. Even the rewrite of the Clean Water Act that passed the House \nlast week--which in my judgment would gut some of the most important \nclean water programs provided for in current law--continues funding for \nsewage treatment State revolving funds through the year 2000.\n  The burden this budget proposal places on State and local governments \nis staggering. EPA estimates that over $137 billion are still needed to \nachieve waste treatment objectives nationwide. The State of Maryland \nestimates that its water infrastructure needs over the next 5 years are \nnearly 10 times the proposed funding level in the budget resolution.\n  This proposed cut would also adversely impact the labor market, \neliminating approximately 100,000 construction related jobs over 5 \nyears, and an additional 200,000 jobs over the next 20 years. It would \nalso jeopardize U.S. commitments to the environmental provisions of \nbilateral agreements that call for investment in water infrastructure \nin the United States-Mexico border area.\n  Mr. President, water pollution is an interstate problem that demands \na Federal response. Water from six States flows into the Chesapeake \nBay. Even if Maryland had the resources to complete construction of all \nneeded wastewater infrastructure, the Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts \nwill only be successful if similar investments are made in the five \nother States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Without Federal \nassistance, however, it is unlikely that the upstream States will make \na substantial investment in the water quality of the bay. The Congress \nunderstood the interstate dynamic of pollution in 1972 when a \nbipartisan majority passed the Clean Water Act and began funding waste \ntreatment infrastructure. We seem to have forgotten this lesson.\n  This budget resolution also phases out on the same schedule all \nFederal funding for grants to assist local governments in improving \ndrinking water quality. Municipalities need significant resources to \ncomply with drinking water standards to prevent the serious adverse \nhealth effects that can and do occur from drinking water contamination. \nIn 1993--just 2 years ago--100 people died and over 400,000 fell ill \nfrom a bacteria outbreak in the public water supply in Milwaukee, WI. \nThe Congress appropriated money last year for the very first time to \nprevent problems like this from happening in the future. Mr. President, \nI remind my colleagues that we appropriated these funds to save the \nlives of Americans; to prevent illness and disease. This is not pork. \nThis is not a make-work public work project. It is an investment in the \nhealth of Americans and in a clean environment.\n  Mr. President, balancing the budget should not, and need not, come at \nthe expense of human health or a clean environment. The amendment I \noffer today is deficit neutral and will restore water infrastructure \ngrants, including money for the clean water, and drinking water State \nrevolving loan funds for the next 7 years at 1995 levels. I urge my \ncolleagues' support for this amendment to continue this country's \ninvestment in clean water and safe drinking water.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Maryland Department of \nthe Environment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Maryland Department\n\n\n                                           of the Environment,\n\n                                      Baltimore, MD, May 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: This letter is to bring an urgent \n     matter to your attention and to request your immediate \n     assistance in amending the Senate Budget Resolution in order \n     to continue the State Revolving Loan Fund authorizations \n     through the year 2000, as opposed to the current language \n     which phases out the program in three years.\n       This environmental financing mechanism is the largest and \n     only source of funds, other than some very small State grant \n     programs, now available to local governments struggling to \n     meet the demands of providing adequate infrastructure and \n     protecting surface and groundwater resources.\n       In addition, the State of Maryland faces the special \n     challenge of working to restore the Chesapeake Bay and its \n     tributaries together with its neighboring jurisdictions and \n     the federal government. Without this funding mechanism, \n     Maryland will not be able to fulfill its commitment to reduce \n     pollution to the Bay by the year 2000, as agreed to by the \n     signatories of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. [[Page S7415]] \n       Maryland has been particularly aggressive in establishing \n     and maximizing its Revolving Loan Fund by leveraging federal \n     and state funds through the sale of revenue bonds. However, \n     as described below, the needs will continue to exceed the \n     availability of funds for many years to come.\n       The 1994 Annual Needs Survey conducted by the Maryland \n     Department of the Environment documents $1.26 billion in \n     wastewater projects needed to: correct areas of failing \n     septic systems; eliminate excess inflow and infiltration into \n     sanitary collection systems; upgrade treatment facilities to \n     meet water pollution control standards; and accommodate \n     planned development in designated growth areas across the \n     State.\n       The Survey also identified over $30 million in projects to \n     retrofit existing urban areas with stormwater quality \n     management facilities and to restore degraded stream systems \n     impacted by stormwater runoff from developed and agricultural \n     areas. These types of projects can be financed through the \n     Maryland Revolving Loan Fund.\n       In addition, the Department estimates that there is a need \n     for over $500 million to remediate existing municipal \n     landfills, in order to restore and protect water quality, \n     which is also fundable through the Revolving Loan Fund.\n       This represents a total need of about $1.8 billion for \n     water quality improvements in the State. The Senate \n     Resolution proposes a total of $3.5 billion nationally over \n     the next three years, after which no appropriations are \n     provided. Of this amount, Maryland would receive $76 million \n     over the three years, assuming an allocation of 2.1867%. \n     Fully leveraging these federal grants and state match will \n     generate approximately $180 million for loans to local \n     governments. Even when the portion of the program now \n     revolving is added, only another $24 million is generated \n     over this three year period. Thus our needs are nearly ten \n     times the proposed funding level in the Senate Resolution.\n       Not to extend the authorization of the federal revolving \n     loan funds through the year 2000 could be the single most \n     devastating setback to federal, state and local efforts to \n     achieve the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, which has \n     become the national model for improving water quality under \n     the Clean Water Act.\n       I think we would agree that this is a critical issue \n     requiring your immediate intervention. Please let me know \n     what additional support I can provide to assist you with the \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jane T. Nishida,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor, with my friend \nand colleague Senator Sarbanes, an amendment to Senate Concurrent \nResolution 13, the congressional budget resolution, which would restore \nfunding for clean water and safe drinking water State revolving funds \n[SRF's], the low-interest loan programs that assist local communities \nto provide quality water to their residents.\n  Mr. President, there are many things in this budget resolution before \nus that I find absolutely amazing. Ranking right up there at the top of \nthe list of bad ideas is a provision to eliminate the Federal low-\ninterest revolving loan program which helps communities finance \nimportant water infrastructure projects. This provision in the \nRepublican budget proposal cuts one of the very important Federal \nprograms which helps local communities meet their financial obligations \nto safeguard our citizens' water.\n  Our amendment would restore the water infrastructure revolving fund \naccounts to the 1995 levels of $2.96 billion annually through 1996-\n2002. In addition, our amendment is deficit neutral in that it provides \nfunding by allocating money from section 204 of the budget resolution's \nsurplus allowance.\n  I find it extremely ironic that the Republican leadership would allow \na provision which totally eliminates assistance to local communities \nwhen just weeks ago the Congress passed and the President signed into \nlaw a bill which would require such assistance in future legislation. \nAs we all know, the unfunded mandates legislation requires the Federal \nGovernment to fund 100 percent of certain requirements for local and \nState governments to meet Federal safeguards in areas such as water or \nair quality beginning on January 1, 1996. However, at the same time, \nthis bill would phase out the very Federal assistance that the Federal \nGovernment has provided for over two decades.\n  While I would have liked to see certain changes in the unfunded \nmandates legislation and while I offered and supported amendments to \nimprove the bill, I voted for the final version specifically because I \nhave always believed and continue to believe in a strong Federal-State-\nlocal Government partnership. Have we forgotten so quickly the concerns \nwe heard expressed from towns and cities across this country? I have \nnot. I remember the concerned conversations I had with dozens of \nconcerned local officials and the letters I received from hundreds of \nconcerned citizens about the need for assistance from the Federal \nGovernment. That is why I am supporting this amendment today.\n  Why is Federal assistance still needed in this area? Americans\n   have come to expect a certain level of protection in the water they \ndrink, the air they breathe and the food they eat. Polls show that the \nvast majority of Americans believe that the appropriate role of the \nFederal Government is to provide the necessary safeguards to maintain \nthe public health and safety standards to which they have become \naccustomed during their lifetimes.\n\n  With approximately 40 percent of our Nation's water sources still \nimpaired, we must continue our commitment to water pollution prevention \nand abatement. As we seek to balance the budget, we must be mindful not \nto hastily eliminate the public infrastructure investments that for too \nlong have been short-changed in the recent budget proposals.\n  In 1972, a bipartisan Congress passed and a Republican President \nsigned into law the original Clean Water Act, the comprehensive measure \nto protect and restore the quality of water in our Nation's rivers, \nlakes, and streams. Since then, the water infrastructure program has \nbeen an important component of a well-balanced effort to help local \ncommunities reduce pollution from sewage and industrial wastewaters. In \naddition, the Safe Drinking Water Act provides a similar program to \nprotect the Nation's ground waters from which we get the water that \nflows from our taps.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that outstanding water \ninfrastructure needs total over $135 billion nationwide. Phasing out \nthe SRF Programs over the next 3 years will leave many local towns and \ncities stranded in their financial pursuits.\n  In my home State of Massachusetts, even with the assistance provided \nby the Federal Government over the years, the cost of meeting the water \nquality standards has placed and continues to place an extraordinary \nburden on many families and communities. Many Massachusetts residents \ncurrently pay water and sewer bills that exceed their property taxes. \nCompanies are considering moving their activities out of State and \nlower income families worry about paying the ever-increasing water \nbills.\n  Ratepayers in the greater Boston area must shoulder the burden of a \n$5.2 billion water infrastructure construction project, with only \nminimal assistance from the Federal Government. However, it is not just \nlarge cities such as Boston or Baltimore or San Diego that need \nassistance. Small- and medium-sized towns across the country borrow \nfunds from the State revolving fund to upgrade septic systems and build \nwastewater treatment and stormwater management facilities. In \nMassachusetts, communities across the State--Fall River, Gloucester, \nNew Bedford, South Essex, Lynn, to name just a few--have mounting water \nrates because of their water projects, and need the assistance \navailable from the revolving funds.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Sarbanes and the other \ncosponsors I previously announced, I propose this amendment to restore \nwater infrastructure grants to assist the State and local governments \nin meeting clean water and drinking water standards.\n  As the amendment draws the funding from the $170 billion fiscal \ndividend, it would not increase the deficit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is, I hope, the last in a series of \namendments that attempts to spend the dividend. I do not know how much \ndividend there will be left if we would have spent all of it as \nrequested by Democratic amendments. But, in addition, we have no \nassurance that if this were [[Page S7416]] granted, it would be spent \nin the manner suggested.\n  It is subject to a point of order under the Budget Act, and I make \nthe point of order.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Baucus, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] for Mr. Baucus, for \n     himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Robb, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n     Ford, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Heflin, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Wellstone, \n     and Mr. Exon, proposes an amendment numbered 1178:\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MANDATORY MAJOR \n                   ASSUMPTIONS UNDER FUNCTION 270: ENERGY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that within the mandatory \n     major assumptions under budget function 270, none of the \n     power marketing administrations within the 48 contiguous \n     States will be sold, and any savings that were assumed would \n     be realized from the sale of those power marketing \n     administrations will be realized through cost reductions in \n     other programs within the Department of Energy.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the budget resolution assumes $1.6 billion \nfrom the sale of unnamed power marketing administrations, and I have \ncosponsored this amendment to express the Senate's view that savings \nshould be sought from other Department of Energy spending rather than \nfrom sale of the PMA's.\n  Some in Congress and the executive branch have tried for years to \nsell off parts or all of the public power generation, transmission and \nmarketing system that we built in the middle of this century to bring \naffordable power to rural areas and many small cities.\n  From the standpoint of our responsibilities to the public purse, such \nproposals are penny-wise but pound foolish. For a one-time gain in sale \nof assets, some propose selling off a system that has generated about \n$50 billion in power revenues, a system that has paid its way on time \nand with interest.\n  In addition to net power revenues that come to the Treasury, the \n$21.6 billion that was invested to build the PMA's is being repaid by \nthe power customers in the same way most of us repay our home \nmortgages. The system has paid off more than $5 billion of the initial \ninvestment, and $9 billion in interest.\n  But, for me, the worst part about selling the PMA's would be the \neffect on rural America. The PMA's were built so our farms and small \ntowns would have assess to dependable, affordable electricity. That \npromise has been fulfilled.\n  However, the sale of the PMA's would cancel the mortgage, so to \nspeak, upon which the PMA's and their customers have been faithfully \nmaking payments for years. It would add debt to the system and force \nsubstantial power rate increases across rural America. I have received \nestimates that customers in my State would see rate increases averaging \n24 percent.\n  In a budget resolution that would cut taxes to the most wealthy in \nthis country, the provision for PMA sales would impose a kind of back-\ndoor tax increase upon rural America.\n  The sale of PMA's is foolish from a public policy standpoint, and it \nis unfair and hurtful to rural America. This body should voice its \nopposition to such a proposal by voting for this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota would state the sense-of-the-Senate that none of the Power \nMarket Administrations [PMA] should be sold and that the savings \nassumed from these sales should be taken from elsewhere in the \nDepartment of Energy's budget. I intend to vote against this amendment, \nand I would [[Page S7417]] like to take a brief moment to explain why.\n  Many people have offered their interpretations of last November's \nelections. The theme which reoccurs in almost all of these analyses is \nthe desire of the American people to have a smaller and more efficient \ngovernment. The budget before us lays out a road map which attempts to \naccomplish that goal.\n  My colleagues are well aware that the assumptions included in the \nbudget resolution are not binding. The authorization committees can set \ntheir own priorities as to how to meet the budget outlined in the \nresolution. We should not follow the advice of this sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that urges the authorizing committee to refrain from \nexploring all of the available budget options.\n  The Power Marketing Administration sells power generated at Federal \nwater projects to millions of Americans across the Nation. The power \ngenerated by these facilities is essential to many small and rural \ncommunities throughout my home State of Arizona.\n  We should of course be very careful not to enter into any agreement \nwhich would result in unfair rate increases to the many people served \nby these systems, or that would result in the inefficient operation of \nthese facilities.\n  Nevertheless, the committee should be allowed to at least examine the \nissue. Several ideas have been discussed on how to down size the \nFederal Government in relation to the PMA's either through sale, lease, \nor management contracts.\n  The budget resolution suggests that existing customers could be given \nthe first option to buy the PMA's. Under this scenario, it may be \npossible for users to operate these facilities more efficiently than \nthe Federal Government and actually reduce power rates. These and other \nideas could and should be discussed to determine if it is possible to \nresolve this issue in a manner which will meet the public interest.\n  Mr. President, I feel it would be inappropriate and an abdication of \nour responsibility to not even examine if and how we can reduce the \nsize of the Government by exploring opportunities to provide power in a \nmore efficient and cost effective manner.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the amendment that I have just offered \nproposes a sense of the Senate that the budget resolution not include \nlanguage to sell the power marketing administrations except for Alaska; \nthat offsetting revenue be found in the Department of Energy programs.\n  This amendment recognizes that the production marketing associations \ncontribute an annual $240 million a year in revenue to the Treasury \nwhile providing affordable, reliable power to 32 rural States. The \nPMA's are a vital part of this Nation's infrastructure and should not \nbe sold to net an estimated $165 million.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the budget resolution scales back on the \nPresident's proposals to sell PMA's.\n  We reduce the savings in the President's budget by two-thirds or $2.9 \nbillion. Our assumption can be accomplished by dropping the sale of the \nwestern PMA's from the President's budget. We also assume that existing \ncustomers get a preferential right to purchase the PMA's. I think there \nare some Senators who know which PMA's were in neither proposal.\n  I wish to move to table the amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto table the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, unless it was previously ordered, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senators Wellstone, Moseley-Braun, and Exon be \nincluded as cosponsors of the amendment that was just agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I say to all Senators we are making great \nprogress. There has been great progress on both sides.\n  We have two amendments that I think we have tentatively agreed to \naccept by voice vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1179\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding reducing \n            overhead expenses in the Department of Defense)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Levin, for \n     himself, and Mr. Simon, proposes an amendment numbered 1179.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . DEFENSE OVERHEAD.\n\n     (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the major discretionary assumptions in this concurrent \n     budget resolution include 15 percent reduction in overhead \n     for programs of nondefense agencies that remain funded in the \n     budget and whose funding is not interconnected with receipts \n     dedicated to a program;\n       (2) the Committee Report (104-82) on this concurrent budget \n     resolution states that ``this assumption would not reduce \n     funding for the programmatic activities of agencies.''\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations \n     should make a reduction of at least three percent in overhead \n     for Fiscal Year 1996 programs of defense agencies, and should \n     do so in a manner so as not to reduce funding for the \n     programmatic activities of these agencies.\n\n  Mr. EXON. This is the Levin-Simon amendment. The budget resolution \nassumes the 15 percent reduction in overhead for nondefense agencies. \nThe Levin-Simon amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which \ncalls on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee to make at least a 3-percent reduction in overhead in defense \nagencies without reducing programmatic activities. I believe that, \nafter a lot of discussion, this can be accepted by a voice vote.\n[[Page S7418]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of [[Page S7419]] Senator Grams and Senator Abraham and ask for \nits immediate consideration.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 73, line 2, strike ``may be reduced'' and insert \n     ``shall be reduced''.\n       On page 73, line 2, strike ``may be revised'' and insert \n     ``shall be revised''.\n       On page 74, line 12, strike ``may'' and insert ``shall''.\n       On page 74, line 13, strike ``may'' and insert ``shall''.\n       On page 74, line 21, strike ``may'' and insert ``shall''.\n       On page 74, line 16, insert the following before the \n     period, ``by providing family tax relief and incentives to \n     stimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic \n     growth.''\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I support this amendment because I \nbelieve that at least a substantial part of the fiscal dividend in the \nbudget before us is set aside for family tax relief, incentives to \nstimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n  Getting our fiscal house in order by balancing the budget represents \na significant investment in our economic future. At the same time, I \nvery much believe that providing family tax relief and savings and \ninvestment incentives is a significant investment in our collective and \nindividual futures as well.\n  The budget will inevitably require some painful adjustments. If we \nare asking the American people to make some of these adjustments, to \nshare in this sacrifice, there should also be a light at the end of the \ntunnel. We should provide much-needed tax relief to the working \nfamilies of this country, and tax incentives to the businesses of this \ncountry so that people will continue to have jobs at which they can \nwork.\n  As I understand it, the family tax relief envisioned by this \namendment could embrace not only a middle-class child credit but a \ndeduction for college and vocational training, much like the $10,000 \neducation deduction proposed earlier this year by President Clinton. In \nmy travels across Connecticut, I have found that the level of anxiety \namong parents over how to pay for the higher education of their \nchildren is very high. Even those parents who have scrupulously saved \nover the years are wondering how they can ever foot education bills \nthat run up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. And it is important to \npoint out that while an education deduction will make it easier for \nfamilies to invest in the future of their children, an education \ndeduction also represents a collective investment in the future of this \ncountry.\n  We are all aware of two additional facts. First, savings and \ninvestment are critical to our future economic well-being, and second, \nwe are not doing enough of either. At present, our budget deficit eats \nup our national savings by borrowing from our national savings pool to \npay for our current spending. Our national savings rate, which has been \nhovering between 3 and 4 percent of national income is not only \nhistorically low for us but three to four times lower than competitor \ncountries such as Japan. This is a national crisis which the balanced \nbudget before us attempts to address.\n  That is one side of the equation. The other side is to jump start \nsavings and investment in this country by providing tax incentives for \nsavings and investment. Short of a complete overhaul of the Tax Code, \nalong the lines of the thoughtful proposal that has been put forth by \nSenators Nunn and Domenici, I believe we should act now to reverse the \ndownward savings trend in this country.\n  The initiatives outlined above, combined with a steady path toward a \nbalanced budget, will take us up to a higher plateau of savings and \ninvestment which will translate into new jobs and new growth in this \ncountry. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the amendment states that once balance \nis achieved and certified by the Congressional Budget Office, a reserve \nfund is provided to the Finance Committee for reduced revenues.\n  If the Finance Committee reports a tax bill, it would include \nprovisions for family tax relief and to stimulate savings and \ninvestment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1183\n\n                   (Purpose: To propose a substitute)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Conrad, for \n     himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Graham, Mr. Simon, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Robb, and \n     Mr. Byrd, proposes an amendment numbered 1183.\n\n  (The text of the amendment appears in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment received some debate, \nalthough limited. I think most Members of this body understand the \nproposal very, very well. I do not have enough time to explain it in \ngreat detail.\n  Let me try to sum up very briefly. The fair share alternative offered \nby Senator Conrad and others makes some very hard and necessary choices \nin the whole area of budget fairness. The Republican plan makes the \nwrong choices.\n  This alternative gives us a plan that asks everyone to contribute. \nThe fair share plan balances the budget by the year 2004 without \ncounting the surpluses in the Social Security trust fund and achieves \nmore deficit reduction in 2002 than the Republican plan.\n  The fair share plan freezes discretionary spending but restores $190 \nbillion in public investment. The fair share plan restores funding to \nMedicare, Medicaid, student loans, and other high priorities. It \nrejects the tax [[Page S7420]] cut targeted to wealthy and instead asks \nthem to contribute by limiting the growth of tax loopholes that benefit \nthe wealthy.\n  The alternative does not balance the budget on the backs of the \nmiddle class, children, college students, and our elders.\n                  finally, a ``real'' balanced budget\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Conrad, for his work in constructing this amendment. As \nI learned in 1980 and again in 1985, it is not an easy task. But the \nSenator from North Dakota should be commended for his courage and \nresolve to focus his budget alternative on three bedrock principles \nthat are essential if we really want to do the job.\n  First, the Conrad alternative would comply with section 13301 of the \nCongressional Budget Act and would balance the budget without counting \nthe surpluses in the Social Security trust fund. We've heard a lot of \ntalk in the last few days about how the Republican budget resolution \nwould balance the budget in 7 years, but the hard facts tell otherwise. \nAgain, I would invite my colleagues to turn to page 7 of the Republican \nresolution where the deficit for fiscal year 2002 is listed as $113.5 \nbillion. In contrast, the Conrad amendment is designed not only to talk \nthe talk, but to walk the walk. Under this proposal by the year 2004, \nthe Federal budget, excluding Social Security, would be in balance.\n  Second, the Conrad approach recognizes that the Federal budget cannot \nbe balanced through spending cuts alone. If we want a balanced budget, \nwe have to have a balanced approach. No one relishes the idea of \nraising taxes, but the simple fact is that we could eliminate all \nspending on non-defense discretionary programs and the budget would \nstill be out of whack. Instead of facing this budget reality, the \nRepublican resolution plays Santa Claus, promising $170 billion in tax \ncuts that will be written in stone out of a economic dividend that may \nnever materialize.\n  Finally, the Conrad amendment protects programs that are crucial to \nour Nation's well-being. The Republican strategy is an alarming \npermutation of a justification that we heard during Vietnam--that we \nhad to burn the village in order to save it. Mr. President, that line \nwas wrong then and it is wrong now. Programs such as education and \nbiomedical research are crucial investments in our Nation's future; \ndrastic cuts in such programs are penny wise and pound foolish.\n  While the Conrad approach offers a far more honest and realistic \napproach to balancing the budget, it is not a perfect plan. \nSpecifically, I am concerned that the $170 billion economic dividend, \nwhich Senator Conrad puts towards deficit reduction, may never \nmaterialize and that the elimination of tax loopholes may fall short of \nits $228 billion target. A far more certain and equitable alternative, \nI believe, would rely on a comprehensive 5 percent value added tax that \nwould be earmarked specifically for deficit and debt reduction. Such an \napproach would reap additional benefits in encouraging national savings \nover consumption and in improving our international trade position \nthrough a border neutral tax.\n  While we may differ on some of the specifics, let me again applaud \nthe efforts of Senator Conrad for his willingness to stop the \ngamesmanship of the past few days and to propose the first real \nbalanced budget that we have seen.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as we approach final passage of the fiscal \n1996 budget resolution, I want to take a few moments to outline my \nviews and concerns on this historic vote.\n\n\n                           conrad alternative\n\n  This morning I voted to support Senator Conrad's Fair Share Balanced \nBudget Plan offered as a substitute to the majority's resolution. While \nthis plan is far from perfect, it represents a fairer, more honest \napproach to fiscal discipline than the underlying budget resolution.\n  The Fair Share plan would balance the budget by 2004 without counting \nthe Social Security trust fund in the calculation. In other words, it \nwould not use the Social Security surpluses to mask the true size of \nthe deficit, as the majority's resolution would do. It would produce \n$16 billion more in deficit reduction in 2002 than does the Republican \nplan.\n  The plan would freeze non-defense discretionary spending, instead of \ncutting it $190 billion below a freeze, as the Republican resolution \nwould do. As a result, this alternative would save critical investments \nsuch as education, technology, medical research, and important \nenvironmental clean-up efforts from far more severe cuts.\n  The alternative would also lessen the severity of the Republicans' \ncuts in Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition and veterans benefits. The plan \nwould fully fund student loans.\n  The alternative wisely contains no tax cuts. As I have said \npreviously, I do not believe that now is the time to cut taxes. Revenue \nreductions only serve to make the hole we must dig ourselves out of \nthat much deeper. Tax cuts skewed toward the affluent, as are those \npassed by the House, are especially difficult to justify.\n  Finally, the Fair Share plan would cap the rate of growth for tax \nloopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthy. It would therefore \nensure that all segments of society, including the most affluent, \nsacrifice to attain a balanced budget. This stands in stark contrast to \nthe Republican plan.\n  I do not support every element of this alternative, but I believe it \nmakes an important statement: There are other, fairer routes to a \nbalanced budget than the one offered by our Republican colleagues.\n                         fiscal 1996 resolution\n\n  Mr. President, in my view, the underlying resolution is fundamentally \nflawed. It treats our people not as assets to be developed, but as \nitems in a spending cut process. It burns the bridges that ordinary \nAmericans use, or hope to use, or hope to use, to cross over to a \nbetter life for themselves and their families. And it requires the \nmiddle-class and the less affluent to clean-up from the fiscal train \nwreck of the 1980's. I would remind my colleagues that our budget would \nbe in balance if we were not required to pay interest on the debt \naccumulated solely during the Reagan/Bush era.\n  In an effort to lessen its adverse impact, I have supported numerous \namendments to restore funding for vital Federal investments such as \nhealth care, education, and the environment. The cost of all of these \namendments has been fully offset from other sources. I regret that few \nof these amendments have passed, but I am pleased that we were able to \nachieve bipartisan cooperation in restoring funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health and partial restoration for student loans. I \noffered and cosponsored a number of amendments that would have restored \ngreater funding for our critical investment in education. They, \nunfortunately, failed.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the American middle-class is collapsing around us. A \nreport just released by the Casey Foundation states that today, nearly \na third of all men between the ages of 25 and 34 don't earn enough to \nsupport a family of 4 above the poverty level. That's about two and a \nhalf times the number from 25 years ago.\n  There was a time when blue collar workers formed the bedrock of the \nmiddle-class. High-wage jobs for people without years of advanced \neducation were plentiful, and a high school education was a passport to \na healthy future. That time is gone.\n  The United States now has the largest gap between rich and poor of \nany industrialized nation in the world. The richest 1 percent of \nAmerican families now own 40 percent of our Nation's wealth, whereas in \nBritain--our closest rival--the top 1 percent own just 18 percent of \nthe wealth.\n  If we care about restoring opportunity and security to our people, \nthen we've got to do better by them. If we want them to obtain the best \njobs that the new economy has to offer, then they'll need the best \neducation, job training, and health care that this country has to \noffer.\n  American politics is about change, Mr. President. But it is not about \nthis kind of change. This debate should be about how we build a \nstronger and a richer America, not just fiscally, as important as that \nis, but economically and socially and morally, as well. Using this \nstandard, this resolution fails. [[Page S7421]] \n  In the days ahead, it is my sincere hope that we can work \ncooperatively together to put our fiscal house in order without \njeopardizing our neighborhoods, our communities, and our future in the \nprocess. We can do better, and we must.\n                        getting priorities right\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the alternative \nbudget proposed by my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad.\n  I have cosponsored this alternative because a budget debate is about \npriorities. The Republican budget resolution has its priorities all \nwrong. And the Conrad alternative, which I helped put together, gets \nour priorities right.\n  Mr. President, the problem with the Republican budget resolution is \nthat it hits middle America in the stomach. It tells the elderly, most \nof whom live on fixed incomes, to absorb $256 billion in Medicare cuts. \nThis budget asks the poor to suffer $175 billion in Medicaid cuts. It \nrequires students from middle-income families to pay interest on their \nloans during their schooling, a total hit of $14 billion. And it would \ncut food and farm programs by $46 billion.\n  As I have mentioned on the floor before, what is truly galling about \nthe Republican budget is that it would use this hit to middle-income \nAmericans to pay for $170 billion in tax cuts primarily for the \nwealthy. Tax cuts are irresponsible when we are trying to cut the \nbudget deficit. And the budget passed by the House is even worse. It \ntakes $350 billion from programs that people depend on and then uses \nthat money to pay for tax cuts that would overwhelmingly benefit the \nrich.\n  Our alternative is a sharp contrast to the Republican budget. My \ncolleague from North Dakota and I are interested in very different \npriorities.\n  While achieving more deficit reduction than the Republican plan, we \nwould restore much of the funding for a few key domestic programs that \nthe GOP budget would cut. We would add back $100 billion for Medicare. \nWe would restore $50 billion for Medicaid. We would provide $24 billion \nmore for food and farm programs. And we would soften the blow to our \nNation's students by $14 billion. All of these programs would still be \ncut, but not nearly so much under our alternative as under the \nRepublican budget.\n  To pay for our changes, we simply would ask the wealthy and big \ncorporations to give up some of their tax breaks, get out of the \ncorporate welfare wagon, and help the rest of us pull toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  We would require the Finance Committee to close $228 billion in tax \nloopholes for the wealthy and for big business. Foreign corporations \nthat try to avoid taxes here could expect a crackdown under the Conrad \nbudget. Multinational firms that try to hide their income from the IRS \nwould have a far more difficult time. Billionaires who renounce their \ncitizenship and retire to tax havens abroad would have to pay the taxes \nthe rest of us have to pay.\n  We have chosen these tax changes carefully. We would not touch the \nhome mortgage interest deduction, the deduction for State and local \ntaxes, or the deduction for charitable giving. These are provisions \nthat millions of Americans depend on. We would also insist that any \nreduction in tax preferences target those who earn over $140,000 a \nyear.\n  Also, Mr. President, let me emphasize that we would use the $170 \nbillion fiscal dividend for deficit reduction, not for tax cuts for the \nwealthy. That is what the American people want us to do--reduce the \ndeficit first.\n  And reduce it we do. This alternative budget would balance the budget \n(without counting the Social Security trust fund surplus) in the year \n2004, two years earlier than the Republican budget would do so. We \nachieve more deficit reduction than the majority's budget by the year \n2002.\n  Mr. President, there you have it. I will vote for this alternative \nbecause it does more to reduce the deficit and it shares the pain \nfairly. It asks all Americans to pay their fair share, and that is the \nright way to cut the deficit.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Republicans, in particular \nRepresentative Kasich and Senator Domenici, deserve credit for focusing \nthe attention of Congress on the great need to balance the Federal \nbudget. The ever-growing national debt is a weight on the growth of the \neconomy. Merely paying the interest on the debt costs taxpayers \nhundreds of billions of dollars each year and limits the Government's \nability to act effectively. I strongly support balancing the budget at \nthe earliest possible date, and I realize that a lot of sacrifices will \nneed to be made in order to reach a balanced budget.\n  The Republican budget leaders in both the Senate and the House were \nbrave enough to submit plans that call for a great deal of fiscal \nrestraint and some hard choices. For that we should commend them.\n  But, unfortunately for a lot of Americans and a lot of New Mexicans, \nthe choices the Republicans have asked us to make are the wrong \nchoices. With their eyes firmly fixed on providing tax loopholes to the \nrich and to providing an unspecified tax cut, the Republicans in \nCongress are forced to balance the budget in an unbalanced way.\n  I am sure in coming weeks I will be criticized for not voting for the \nRepublican budget. People will say I did not support a balanced budget. \nBut the truth is that today I will be recorderd as having voted in \nfavor of a balanced budget, the very same day the Republican budget \npassed. But the balanced budget I voted for--the Democratic alternative \nbudget I helped craft--is a budget just as strict fiscally as the \nRepublican budget, but fairer to seniors, students and working \nfamilies.\n  The Republican budget, in my view, is anti-working families, anti-\nseniors, anti-future, and anti-New Mexico. In contrast, the Fair Share \nPlan--formulated by my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, \nmyself and a small group of Democratic Senators--does the following:\n\n\n  I. Achieves even greater fiscal discipline than the Republican plan\n\n   A. Balances the budget (on a unified basis) by 2002, just as the \nRepublican plan does.\n   B. Achieves total on-budget balance (that is, without using Social \nSecurity surpluses) by 2004, or 2 years before the Republican plan \ndoes.\n\n\n    II. Protects critical investments in our future competitiveness\n\n   A. Restores non-defense discretionary spending to a hard freeze, \nproviding almost $200 billion more than the Republican plan for \ncritical investments in: First, education and training, second, \ninfrastructure, third, research & development, and fourth, other areas \nthat will boost our economic competitiveness in the 21st century.\n   B. Freezes defense spending to the same extent as the Republican \nplan.\n\n\n            III. Reduces the burden on middle class families\n\n   A. Protects middle class seniors by restoring $150 billion from the \nRepublican cuts in Medicare and Medicaid benefits.\n   B. Restores to middle class college students and their families the \nfull $14 billion that Republicans propose to cut from student loans and \nother mandatory education accounts.\n   C. Reverses the Republican plan's cut in the earned income tax \ncredit for lower-middle class and poor working families, by restoring \n$60 billion of the Republican proposal on income assistance programs.\n   D. Only cuts $22 billion from family farm and nutrition assistance \nprograms, $24 billion less than the Republican proposal.\n   E. Restores half of the Republican $10 billion cuts in veterans \nbenefits.\n\n\nIV. Asks the wealthy to pay some fair share of the burden of balancing \n                               the budget\n\n   A. Rejects the Republican $170 billion reserve for tax cuts that \nwill mostly benefit wealthy taxpayers.\n   B. Asks big corporations and wealthy taxpayers (couples making over \n$140,000 per year, e.g.) to pay some share of the deficit reduction \nburden, by closing tax loopholes and by just limiting the growth in tax \nbreaks and tax preferences for corporations and these wealthy taxpayers \nto inflation plus one percent (CPI + 1 percent).\n\n\n    V. Brings all, and not just some, of the components of federal \n                       expenditures under control\n\n   A. The Republican budget proposal limits Federal direct spending to \nless than a 25-percent increase over the \n[[Page S7422]] next 7 years, but allows Federal tax expenditures in the \nform of loopholes, tax preferences, and tax breaks to increase by \nalmost 50 percent over the next 7 years.\n   B. The Fair Share Budget corrects this imbalance by limiting direct \nspending to just over 25-percent increase (cutting over $1 trillion in \nspending and interest over the next 7 years), but also by slowing the \ngrowth of Federal tax breaks and tax preferences to a 35-percent \nincrease over the same period. The alternative budget requires the \ncutting of just 5.7 percent of a projected $4 trillion of tax \nexpenditures over the 7 years, and limits the cuts only to wealthy \ncorporations and wealthy taxpayers (couples earning over $140,000, \ne.g.).\n\n\n                VI. Is NOT about raising anybody's taxes\n\n   A. Tax preferences or tax entitlements are one of the fastest \ngrowing categories of Federal spending. The Fair Share Balanced Budget \nresolution does not reduce these entitlements. It only slows their \ngrowth to inflation plus 1 percent.\n   B. The Republicans cannot have it both ways. They cannot claim, on \nthe one hand, that the Fair Share Budget's proposed slow-down in the \ngrowth of tax entitlements for the wealthy constitutes a tax increase, \nbut, on the other hand, claim that their slow-down in the growth of the \nearned income tax credit [EITC] (which is also a tax expenditure) is \nnot a tax increase. If they claim that the Fair Share Budget includes a \ntax increase on the rich and big corporations, they must also admit \nthat the Republican budget plan includes a tax increase on lower-middle \nclass and poor working families.\n  While not perfect, this Democratic alternative plan achieves the goal \nof a balanced Federal budget without asking America's working families, \nseniors and students to bear all of the burden. But the Republican \nbudget does not ask the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest \nAmericans to contribute one dime to balance the budget. Moreover, in \norder to secure a $170 billion reserve for tax cuts to benefit mostly \nwealthy people, the Republican budget trades away investments in our \nfuture--in education, infrastructure, and research and development--\ninvestments in our children.\n  Remember that the main reason given for eliminating the deficit is \nthat we are doing it for our children. But, if we free our children \nfrom the burden of the Federal deficit by depriving them of the \neducation and training that they will need to compete and succeed in \nthe global and technologically driven economy of the next century, then \nwe have not been responsible.\n  Education programs, for example, are especially important to New \nMexico. My State has the third highest rate of children living in \npoverty of any State in the Nation. More than one in four children in \nNew Mexico live in families with incomes below the poverty line. One-\nthird of the students in New Mexico's schools have limited proficiency \nin English. Its school-age population has grown tremendously, and a 12-\npercent increase in New Mexico's population of school-age children is \nprojected over the next 7 years. The Republican budget will cut \nprograms for New Mexico's schools by about 30 percent over the next \nseven years; that translates into tens of millions of dollars that New \nMexico's schools will have to do without as they struggle with these \nspecial problems.\n  By cutting programs to help the children of working families go to \ncollege by nearly a third, which is being proposed by the GOP, tens of \nthousands of New Mexico's students could lose the opportunity to go to \ncollege. That would be devastating to their futures and to the future \nof our State. In New Mexico, most higher education students receive \nFederal financial aid, including 33,000 students who receive Pell \nGrants.\n  I do not believe that America will be well-served by the Republican \nbudget, nor do I feel that most Americans would agree with the specific \nproposals contained within it. And that is why I am proud to have \ncosponsored the fair share balanced budget alternative and to vote for \nit today.\n  In conclusion, I want to remind the Senate that the passage of any \nbudget resolution today is only the beginning of a long process that \nwill determine the priorities of our Government. The budget is only a \nframework for the appropriations committees to work with as they spend \nthe summer determining specific spending levels for agencies and \nprograms.\n  Throughout this process, I pledge to continue to fight for proper \nfunding for programs that will contribute to providing educational \nopportunities for our children, meet the health care needs of our \nsenior citizens, and reward work and encourage innovation in the \nmarketplace.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 2 years ago, we passed the largest tax \nincrease in American history.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the concurrent \nresolution.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Simon, for \n     himself, Mr. Pell, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1184.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 207 in its entirety.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, a little-noticed provision of the budget \nresolution will make it more likely that student loan cuts will come \nout of the pockets of students, rather than banks, bureaucrats, and \nother middlemen. Section 207 changes the way the loan costs are scored \nin the budget by requiring administrative costs--such as collection \nexpenses--to be counted on a long-term--accrual--basis, rather than on \na cash basis over the 5-year budget window. While this may sound like a \nreasonable change, it is accomplished in a manner that is inconsistent \nand biased.\n  Section 207 is not applied consistently to all loan programs. \nInstead, it targets student loans in particular. Furthermore, this type \nof end-run around the Budget Act is not appropriate on a budget \nresolution.\n  Section 207 is biased. There are a number of problems with the way \nthat loans are scored in the budget. Section 207 only fixes one of \nthem, skewing the scoring against direct student loans. This makes it \nmore difficult to achieve savings without eliminating the in-school \ninterest exemption or increasing fees and other student costs. A \ncomplete reform of the budget scoring rules for loan programs would \nconsider:\n  Cost-of-funds. The most significant item that overstates the cost of \ndirect lending is the discount rate that is currently used. The \ninterest rates that students pay vary annually, and the subsidized \nrates that the Federal Government promises to banks vary each quarter. \nA Council of Economic Advisors memorandum of April 30, 1993, points out \nthat ``a multiple year loan with an interest rate that resets each year \nshould be treated for pricing purposes as having a maturity of one \nyear,'' meaning that a short-term rate should be used. But CBO and OMB \nassume that the Government's cost-of-funds is a higher, long-term rate, \nthe 10-year bond. This makes direct lending appear much more costly \nthan it really is. Indeed, in a February 8, 1993, letter, GAO pointed \nout that using shorter term interest rates would have more than doubled \nthe direct loan savings.\n  Tax-exempt bonds. Many student loan secondary markets use tax-exempt \nbonds, costing the Federal Treasury an estimated $2.3 billion over 5 \nyears. This cost is not considered when the Congressional Budget Office \ndetermines how much direct lending saves, or how much the guarantee \nprogram costs.\n  Taxpayer bailouts. When guaranty agencies agree to share the risk \nunder FFEL by paying a larger portion on defaulted loans, they are \nusing money that belongs to the Federal Government--so the Federal \nGovernment is essentially sharing with itself. Furthermore, when any \nagency can't pay its share, the Federal Government steps in. These \ncosts aren't currently considered.\n  I would hope that the chairman would reconsider this provision prior \nto conference.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment simply strikes section 207 in \norder to keep all of our options open to avoid imposing costs on \ncollege students and their families.\n  The amendment has no cost impact. The amendment strikes budget \nscoring rules in the budget resolution that single out a particular \nprogram.\n  This amendment will allow committees of jurisdiction to look at these \nissues in a comprehensive manner. First, last, and always, this \namendment protects students.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a slightly different impression. \nThe Simon amendment would strike language in the resolution that \ncorrects a bias against guaranteed student loans.\n  If adopted, the Simon amendment would favor the Clinton \nadministration policies for direct Government student lending. The \nbudget resolution does not do that.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska made a suggestion \na few moments ago that is now being seriously considered.

I would like to know. We \nwill put it in proper form if we can get approval of it on both sides.\n  Informally, I would ask if anyone would object if the Senator would \nput it in written form, what I have just orally stated?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there is no debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the regular order, the question is on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder for purposes of trying to move \nahead with the budget, if the Senator might agree, and we will agree to \ntake the two amendments, the one pending and the amendment to it, set \nit aside without prejudice and let us move ahead with some of the other \namendments?\n  Mr. EXON. We agree. I think that is a good suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1187\n\n  (Purpose: To eliminate the firewall between defense and nondefense \n                        discretionary accounts)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for Senators \nSimon and Bumpers, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. EXON], for Mr. Simon, for \n     himself, and Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1187.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 65, strike lines 13 through 18 and insert \n     ``$477,820,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $526,943,000,000 in outlays;''.\n       On page 65, strike lines 20 through 25 and insert \n     ``$466,192,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $506,943,000,000 in outlays;''.\n       On page 66, strike lines 2 through 7 and insert \n     ``$479,568,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $499,961,000,000 in outlays;''.\n       On page 66, strike lines 9 through 14 and insert \n     ``$477,485,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $502,571,000,000 in outlays;''.\n       On page 66, strike lines 16 through 21 and insert \n     ``$492,177,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $511,761,000,000 in outlays;''.\n       On page 66, strike beginning with line 23 through line 3, \n     page 67, and insert ``$496,098,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $517,258,000,000 in outlays; and''.\n       On page 67, strike lines 5 through 10 and insert \n     ``$495,498,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $518,160,000,000 in outlays.''.\n       On page 67, line 22, strike ``sum of the defense and \n     nondefense''.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Simon-Bumpers amendment eliminates the \nresolution's provision that establishes a firewall between defense and \nnondefense discretionary accounts. The amendment does not change the \nlevels of budget authority and outlays, and does not add a single cent \nto the deficit.\n  The amendment simply assures that Congress maintains flexibility to \nrespond to changing spending priorities in a prudent, fiscally sound \nway. That sort of flexibility is particularly important in light of the \nvast uncertainties concerning the Nation's domestic and military \ncommitments in the years ahead.\n  As we debate the Nation's priorities within the overall constraints \nof the balanced budget, we should not bind ourselves needlessly to \nsubcategories within the discretionary caps. Removing the firewall is a \nvital step in achieving the necessary flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. [[Page S7425]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while this does not change the numbers, \nit permits the defense moneys and the nondefense moneys to be fungible \nand move back and forth between the two.\n  The Budget Committee said we should not do that for the next 7 years. \nI believe they are right.\n  I move to table the amendment. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate we have lost about 10 or 15 \nminutes here. I would ask the clerk: At the end of the time we will \nturn in the scorecard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Senator Exon is \ngoing to explain each of the three. I will have a brief explanation. \nThen everybody ought to stay here because we are going to vote on them \none after another. We are not going to have an explanation at the end \nof each one. So three explanations, three amendments, and vote on those \nthree amendments in sequence and immediately upon completing one go to \nanother, no time interval for explanations.\n  Mr. EXON. I would just simply add then we will go on with the process \nthat had been established by the majority leader for 10 minutes and 10 \nminutes only thereafter. That does not mean----\n  Mr. SIMON. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Nine minutes thereafter. That does not mean we are going to \nchange.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Oh, no.\n  Mr. EXON. Anything other than to maybe expedite things for just a \nmoment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. EXON. We are getting very close.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the inclusion of \n  reductions in Medicare spending in the concurrent resolution on the \n                      budget for fiscal year 1996)\n\n  Mr. EXON. The first of the three amendments that have just been \nsuggested by the Budget Committee chairman I send to the desk in behalf \nof Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Kennedy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1188.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REDUCTIONS IN MEDICARE \n                   SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Medicare protection is as important as Social Security \n     protection in guaranteeing retirement security and is truly a \n     part of Social Security;\n       (2) senior citizens have contributed throughout their \n     working lives to Medicare in the expectation of health \n     insurance protection when they retire;\n       (3) because of gaps in Medicare coverage, senior citizens \n     already spend more than one dollar in five of their limited \n     incomes to purchase the health care that they need;\n       (4) low and moderate-income senior citizens will suffer \n     most from Medicare cuts, since 83 percent of all Medicare \n     spending is for older Americans with annual incomes below \n     $25,000 and two-thirds is for those with annual incomes below \n     $15,000;\n       (5) at the present time, Medicare only pays 68 percent of \n     what the private sector pays for comparable physicians' \n     services and 69 percent of what the private sector pays for \n     comparable hospital care;\n       (6) piecemeal, budget-driven cuts in Medicare will only \n     shift costs from the Federal budget to the family budgets of \n     senior citizens and working Americans;\n       (7) deep cuts in Medicare could damage the quality of \n     American medicine, by endangering hospitals and other health \n     care institutions that depend on Medicare, including rural \n     hospitals, inner-city hospitals, and academic health centers;\n       (8) deep cuts in Medicare will make essential health care \n     less available to millions of uninsured Americans, by \n     endangering the financial stability of hospitals providing \n     such care; and\n       (9) cuts in Medicare benefits should not be used to pay for \n     tax cuts for the wealthy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this concurrent resolution assume that \n     reductions in projected Medicare spending included in the \n     reconciliation bill for fiscal year 1996 should not increase \n     medical costs such as premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance \n     or diminish access to health care for senior citizens, and \n     further, that major reductions in projected Medicare spending \n     should not be enacted by the Congress except in the context \n     of a broad, bipartisan health reform plan that will not--\n       (1) increase costs or reduce access to care for senior \n     citizens;\n       (2) shift costs to working Americans; or\n       (3) damage the quality of American medicine.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy's amendment urges that any \nreductions in Medicare should not increase premiums, deductibles and \nco-insurance for senior citizens and that Medicare reductions should \nnot be enacted except as part of a broader health reform.\n  I send a second amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. DOLE. Could I have an explanation of the one we just did, an \nexplanation of the first Kennedy amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. I thought we were going to do it in sequence.\n  Go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We interpret the Kennedy amendment to propose that we \nhold Medicare reform hostage until we have a national health care \nreform package. But I am going to move to table it at the appropriate \ntime in any event.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1189\n\n  (Purpose: To restore $28,000,000,000 in outlays over seven years to \nreduce by $22,000,000,000 the discretionary cuts proposed in elementary \n    and secondary education programs and reduce the reconciliation \n instructions to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources (primarily \n    affecting student loans) by $6 billion by closing corporate tax \n                               loopholes)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, a second \namendment, offered by Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is about something that we \nall know a great deal and have generally supported very well, Pell \ngrants. This amendment, also sponsored by Senator Pell, would restore \n$8.8 billion over the budget period to protect the value of Pell grants \nagainst inflation and increasing college enrollments. Under the pending \nbudget proposal, the Pell grants would decline in value by 40 percent \nover the next 7 years.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, again, we are going to raise taxes by \n$8.8 billion to spend that amount of money. I believe we have held firm \non that heretofore, and I hope we do so again.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nthat all three amendments be ordered to be for a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not waive a right to table the \namendments, do I, with that?\n  Mr. EXON. No, the Senator does not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fine. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection. Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have a way to dispose of Harkin-\nMcCain. I would add that as a fourth effort and move to table the \nunderlying amendment--that will take care of both of them--and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have cleared it with Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. EXON. I believe what the majority leader just said has been \nagreed to by Senator Harkin, but I do want to check with him. As I \nunderstand it, you on that side will offer a tabling motion.\n  Mr. DOLE. I just did it.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator just did it.\n  Mr. DOLE. To table both of them.\n  Mr. EXON.

I send an amendment to the desk, the No. 1 Bradley \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Bradley, for \n     himself and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 1192.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL OF TAX EXPENDITURES.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget (or \n     amendment, motion, or conference report on such a resolution) \n     that does not include--\n       (1) appropriate levels for the budget year and planning \n     levels for each of the 6 fiscal years following the budget \n     year for the total amount, if any, tax expenditures should be \n     increased or decreased by bills and resolutions to be \n     reported by the appropriate committees; and\n       (2) tax expenditures for each major functional category, \n     based on the allocations of the total levels set forth in the \n     resolution.\n       (b) CBO.--The Director of the Congressional Budget Office \n     shall include alternatives for allocating tax expenditures in \n     accordance with national priorities as required by section \n     202(f)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the \n     concurrent resolution, bill, or joint resolution, as the case \n     may be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of \n     the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n       (e) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, new \n     entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall \n     be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee \n     on the Budget of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, this amendment makes a very simple point: \nwe can spend money just as easily through the Tax Code as we can \nthrough the appropriations process or through the creation of mandatory \nspending programs.\n  The amendment that I have offered would simply require that in our \nannual budget process we establish targets for reducing tax loopholes--\njust as we do for all other types of spending. Those targets would be \nenforced through a separate line in our budget reconciliation \ninstructions for reductions in tax loopholes. We already do this for \nother entitlement programs. There is no reason not to do so for tax \nloopholes. The Senate would pass a budget resolution asking the Finance \nCommittee to reduce tax loopholes, for example, by $10 billion a year \nor $20 billion or whatever the Senate decides is prudent. It would be \nup to the Finance Committee to meet those targets through the \nreconciliation process.\n  This separate tax expenditure target would not replace our current \nrevenue targets. Instead, it would simply ensure that the committee \ntake at least the specified amount from tax loopholes. In other words, \nwe would ensure that the committee would not raise the targeted amount \nfrom rate increases.\n  I think we should be honest about the hundreds of billions of dollars \nthat we spend each year through tax loopholes. Spending is spending, \nwhether it comes in the form of a government check or in the form of a \nspecial exception from the tax rates that apply to everyone else.\n  Tax expenditures are a large and rapidly growing form of spending by \nthe Federal Government. According to the Budget Committee, in 1996, tax \nexpenditures will cost over $480 billion; left unchecked, we will spend \nroughly $4 trillion on tax expenditures between now and 2002. In 1986, \nwe dramatically scaled back these loopholes. However, since that time, \nthey have grown at an astronomical rate. At a time when we are properly \ntalking about other spending cuts, I do not believe that tax \nexpenditures should be off the table.\n  Tax expenditures or tax loopholes allow some taxpayers to lower their \ntaxes and leave the rest of us paying higher taxes\n than we otherwise would pay. By requiring that Congress establish \nspecific targets for tax loopholes as part of the budget reconciliation \nprocess, this amendment simply places tax loopholes under the same \nbudgetary scrutiny as all other spending programs.\n\n  Tax loopholes do not, as some would say, simply allow people to keep \nmore of what they have earned. Rather, they give the few a special \nexception from the rules that oblige everyone to share in the \nresponsibility of the national defense and protecting the young, the \naged, and the infirm.\n  Mr. President, in the face of a Federal debt rapidly approaching $5 \ntrillion, we cannot afford to be timid. Our children's way of life is \ndependent upon our acting on the Federal deficit today and tomorrow and \nevery year thereafter until we restore fiscal sanity to our budget. We \ncannot wait until we grow our way out of the debt. And we should not \nand cannot wait until deficits start drifting up in the latter half of \nthis decade before we do something.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that by 2004 the national \ndebt held by the public will rise to roughly $6 trillion. At that time, \nthe national debt will equal almost 55 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. By 2004, interest payments on that debt will be approximately \n$334 billion, or over 3 percent of our gross domestic product. One \nrecent report stated that these interest payments will cost each of \ntoday's children over $130,000 in extra taxes over the course of their \nlifetime. Our national debt is nothing less than a mortgage on our \nNation's, and our children's, future.\n  Mr. President, let us not kid ourselves. As we have seen from this \nweek's debate, addressing our burgeoning debt will not be easy. If it \nwas, we would have done it years ago. Instead, it will require a very \nthoughtful, and sometimes difficult, debate over our Nation's \npriorities and what sacrifices [[Page S7430]] we are willing to make in \norder to balance the budget. This means that we are going to have to \ntake a hard look at what we spend the taxpayers' money on. And that \nmeans all of our spending programs--tax expenditures included.\n  The purpose of this amendment is simply to try to draw the Senate's \nattention to the very targeted spending we do through the Tax Code--\nspending that is not subject to the annual appropriations process; \nspending that is not subject to the executive order capping the growth \nof mandatory spending; spending that is rarely ever debated on the \nfloor of the Senate once it becomes part of the Tax Code. The \npreferential deductions or credits or depreciation schedules or timing \nrules that we provide through the Tax Code are simply entitlement \nprograms under another guise. Many of them make sense, Mr. President. \nAnd I would be the first to admit that. Many, however, probably could \nnot stand the light of day if we had to\n vote on them as direct spending programs.\n\n  Given our critical need for deficit reduction, tax spending should \nnot be treated any better or worse then other programs. It should not \nbe protected any more than Social Security payments or crop price \nsupport payments or Medicare payments or welfare payments.\n  What am I really talking about? I am talking about provisions that \nallow wealthy Americans to renounce their citizenship in order to avoid \npaying their fair share of U.S. taxes. That is already in the Tax Code. \nI am talking about letting wealthy taxpayers rent their homes for 2 \nweeks a year without having to report any income. That is already in \nthe Tax Code. I am talking about providing production subsidies in \nexcess of the dollars invested for the production of lead, uranium and \nasbestos--three poisons on which we spend millions of dollars each year \njust trying to clean up. That is already in the code. I am talking \nabout tax credits for clean-fuel vehicles, cancellation of indebtedness \nincome for farmers or real estate developers, special amortization \nperiods for timber companies' reforestation efforts, industrial \ndevelopment bonds for airports or docks, special treatment of capital \nconstruction funds for shipping companies, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear that this bill does not pinpoint \nspecific programs and I am not suggested that we eliminate all tax \nexpenditures. In fact, I support many of them. Instead, I am simply \nsuggesting that we subject them to the same level of scrutiny as all \nother entitlement programs.\n  If we are serious about deficit reduction--and for our Nation's \nfuture I sincerely hope that we are--then every segment of spending \nwill have to be examined. We cannot do it fairly through discretionary \nspending cuts alone. Indeed, that is an area of the budget that is \nshrinking in terms of gross national product. Likewise, we cannot do it \nfairly through entitlement cuts alone. In order to achieve equitable, \nlasting deficit reduction, we will need to consider tax loopholes as \nwell.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for nearly a decade now, one of our \nprimary tasks has been to leash the burgeoning budget deficit and keep \nit under control. As my colleagues well know, the process of reducing \nthe deficit is a painstaking one, during which every item of direct \nspending is scrutinized. Even entitlements are today facing the budget \nax--for example, this budget resolution envisions $256 billion in \nMedicare cuts alone.\n  This scrutiny, however, is reserved for direct spending items. Yet, \none of our largest areas of spending in the Federal budget is tax \nexpenditures--exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential \nrates, and deferrals of tax liability. While, at the margin, we can \ndebate exactly what constitutes a tax expenditure, these items will \ndrain about $480 billion from Federal revenues this year.\n  Let me make it clear that I do not support a massive elimination of \ntax expenditures without regard to merit. However, this very large and \nimportant part of Federal spending--for, clearly, that is what it is--\ndeserves the same scrutiny as direct spending.\n  Currently, tax expenditures receive only minimal attention on an \nannual basis. Nowhere is this information incorporated in the budget \nprocess in a meaningful way--a way that spurs action to limit this form \nof spending. There are no targets for tax expenditures called for in \nthe budget resolution, and there is nothing to force members to view \ntax expenditures by budget function, comparing aggregate spending in \nany given area through both direct spending and tax expenditures.\n  The Bradley amendment would require the annual budget resolution to \nset forth the total amount, if any, by which tax expenditures should be \nincreased or decreased. The resolution would have to include such \ntotals both for the upcoming fiscal year and, for planning purposes, \nfor the following 6 fiscal years. additionally, the total level of tax \nexpenditures for the upcoming fiscal year would need to be broken out \namong the major functional categories. The budget resolution would be \nsubject to a point of order if it failed to include the information on \ntax expenditures that is required by the Bradley amendment.\n  I applaud Senator Bradley for his continued leadership on this very \nimportant issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Very briefly, this Bradley amendment requires Congress to \nset targets for reduction in tax expenditures similar to targets it set \nfor mandatory spending in our budget resolution instructions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is going to be subject to a point \nof order. It establishes a whole new process in treating budget \nresolutions and tax bills, and I do not believe we ought to be doing it \nhere on the floor. When it is appropriate, I will raise the point of \norder.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1193\n\n (Purpose: To restore cuts in Medicare and NIH by raising the tobacco \n                           tax by $1 a pack)\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, this amendment would eliminate 30 percent \nof the proposed Medicare cuts and the entire cut to the NIH budget. \nThese cuts would be offset with revenues generated by increasing the \ntobacco tax.\n  Mr. President, my amendment presents a win-win-win situation. It will \nimprove not one, not two, but three threats to our national health. \nFirst, it dampens the incredibly harsh blow which the proposed budget \nwill deal to our Nation's oldest citizens. Second, it ensures that the \nNIH will be able to continue its current efforts to develop life-saving \ntechnologies. And finally, it will encourage our citizens--particularly \nour children and teenagers--to avoid the addiction, sickness, and death \nwhich result from tobacco use.\n  The first national health threat which my amendment seeks to improve \ninvolves the proposed Medicare cuts. We are all aware that the budget \nresolution would reduce spending for the Medicare program by $256 \nbillion over 7 years. This means that seniors will have to find an \naverage of $3,447 more dollars to pay for their health care over the \nnext 7 years. In my home State of New Jersey, seniors will have to come \nup with an additional $932 in the year 2002 alone just to pay for the \nadditional Medicare costs which this budget imposes on them. For many \nseniors across the country, these new costs will be extremely difficult \nto bear. In 1992, the median income of seniors in this country was only \nabout $17,000 a year, and over 20 percent of this income already goes \nfor health-related costs. For the millions of seniors across the \ncountry who live on fixed incomes, finding an additional $3,447 over 7 \nyears will mean having to give up something else which is important to \nthem. It is estimated that there are already nearly 8 million seniors \nnationwide who are forced to choose each month between paying for their \nmedications and paying for food. I can't help wondering how many \nmillions more seniors will be faced with this horrible choice once the \nproposed cuts go into place.\n  Increased financial burdens on seniors is only one of the negative \nconsequences which will result from the proposed Medicare cuts. Along \nwith having to pay more, seniors will likely find that their ability to \nchoose their [[Page S7432]] own doctor restricted--perhaps not \nexplicitly, but because financial limitations leave them with no choice \nbut to join a managed care plan. Also, doctors, hospitals, and other \nproviders are all likely to face reduced payments. They already receive \nfar lower payments from Medicare than from private insurers, and if\n Medicare rates are reduced much further some may find that they can no \nlonger afford to take Medicare patients. Those which do keep taking \nMedicare will be forced to shift even more costs onto their privately \ninsured patients, creating a hidden tax on employers and individuals.\n\n  Mr. President, the proposed Medicare cuts are bad news for seniors; \nthey are bad news for health care providers; and they are bad news for \nemployers and individuals nationwide. My amendment will make this bad \nnews a little better. It does this by offsetting 30 percent of the \nproposed Medicare cuts with revenues generated by increasing the \nFederal tax on tobacco products. This means that $76 billion will be \nrestored to the Medicare Program. It reduces the amount of additional \nmoney which each senior must find from $3,447 to $2,413 over 7 years. I \nunderstand that $2,413 is still an enormous amount of money for anyone \non a fixed income to part with. But $2,413 is at least better than \n$3,447.\n  Mr. President, Medicare cuts are just one of the national health \nthreats which my amendment seeks to improve. The second threat is the \nproposal, contained in this resolution, to cut the budget of the \nNational Institutes of Health by 10 percent next year and then freeze \nit through the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, cutting the NIH budget is shortsighted policy at its \nworst. NIH-funded research impacts the lives of millions of Americans \nevery day. Technologies and drugs developed with NIH funds not only \nimprove Americans' quality of life; they also save lives. Without the \nbasic research which is funded by the NIH, in a few years the private \nsector will have limited fundamental research upon which to base its \nown efforts. The result will be a dramatic slowdown in the development \nof life-improving and life-saving technologies. I have no way of \nknowing which of us in this room, or which of our loved ones, could \nbenefit in the future from technologies which NIH is developing today. \nBut I do know that we owe it to all present and future Americans to \nensure that their access to these technologies is not limited due to \nshortsighted budget cutting.\n  For those who are not convinced that NIH's role in improving and \nsaving lives warrants restoring its budget, let me make one final \npoint: Much of NIH research reduces health care spending. For example, \nthe NIH recently estimated that approximately $4.3 billion invested in \nNIH research had the potential to realize annual savings of between \n$9.3 and $13.6 billion. This translates into a 200- to 300-percent \nannual return. I challenge my colleagues to find any type of Federal \nspending which provides an annual return of at least 200 percent. Given \nthat payoff, we can't afford to not invest in the NIH.\n  My amendment recognizes these immense benefits generated by NIH, and \nseeks to ensure that this research can continue at its present level \ninto the future. To do this, the amendment\n restores the entire $7.9 million which the Republican resolution cuts \nfrom the NIH budget.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, this amendment addresses the national health \nthreat created by tobacco use. It seeks to encourage our citizens--\nparticularly our children and teenagers--to avoid the addiction, \nsickness, and death which results from using tobacco.\n  Mr. President, I have been on this floor many times talking about the \ndangers of tobacco use. I have repeatedly stated that tobacco use kills \nwell over 400,000 Americans every year--more than alcohol, heroin, \ncrack, automobile and airplane accidents, homicides, suicides, and AIDS \ncombined. Furthermore, secondhand tobacco smoke will cause tens of \nthousands of additional deaths. This year, one out of every five \nAmericans who dies will die from tobacco use.\n  But of all the sad stories which can be told about the impact of \ntobacco use in this country, perhaps the saddest is the alarming rate \nat which children and teenagers are being hooked on tobacco products. \nOver 90 percent of new users of tobacco in this country are teenagers \nor younger. The tobacco companies know children and teenagers are easy \ntargets, so they specifically aim their advertising at them. And their \nefforts are succeeding. Every 30 seconds, a child or teenager in the \nUnited States smokes for the first time.\n  In addition to the enormous human costs of tobacco use--the addition, \nsuffering, and death which could have been avoided--tobacco contributes \nsubstantially to health care costs every year. According to the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, health care expenditures caused \ndirectly by smoking totaled $50 billion in 1993, and $22 billion of \nthose costs were paid by Government funds.\n  My amendment seeks to reduce both the human and the economic costs \ncreated by tobacco use. It does this by increasing the Federal excise \ntax on most tobacco products by a factor of five, which translates to \nan increase of $1 per pack of cigarettes. In addition, my amendment \nwould tax smokeless tobacco products at the same price as cigarettes, \nin order to eliminate cost incentives for people to switch from \ncigarettes to smokeless. By raising the Federal excise tax on tobacco, \nwe can discourage people--especially children--from starting the \ntobacco habit, and we can encourage others to quit. Conservative \nestimates predict that a 10-percent increase in the price of cigarettes \nwill reduce overall smoking by about 4 percent. And for kids, who are \nmore price sensitive than adults, the impact is even greater.\n  The benefits of such decreased demand cannot be overstated. First, \nand most importantly, thousands of lives will be saved and the \nunnecessary suffering will be avoided. In addition, both\n public and private health insurers will save billions of dollars each \nyear, due to reduced costs for treating tobacco-related diseases. \nFinally, the increased tax will yield $84 billion in Federal revenues \nover 7 years. Over half a billion of this amount will be used to help \ntobacco farmers convert to other crops. The rest of the money will go \nto help decrease the national health threats posed by the drastic \nMedicare cuts and by the reduction in the NIH budget. These revenues \nwill enable the entire cut to the NIH budget to be offset, and the \nproposed Medicare cuts to be decreased by 30 percent.\n\n  Some persons may question whether it is appropriate to ask smokers to \nabsorb part of the blow which the proposed budget designates for \nseniors and providers. My response to that question is an unequivocal \n``yes.'' According to a former Secretary of the Department of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare, tobacco use is the largest single drain on the \nMedicare trust fund. This is the trust fund which is predicted to go \ninsolvent in 2002. It strikes me as quite appropriate to ask persons \nwho choose to use tobacco to help offset some of the costs of their \nchoice. And it strikes me as quite inappropriate to ask other persons--\nsuch as nonsmoking seniors and providers--to accept reductions at the \nsame time that they are forced to help pay for the costs of other \npeople's unhealthy choices.\n  By discouraging tobacco use, decreasing Medicare cuts, and restoring \nthe NIH budget to its current level, my amendment presents a win-win-\nwin situation. Our children and teenagers win, because they will be \ndiscouraged from starting down the road of addiction, sickness, and \ndeath caused by tobacco use. Health insurers and employees win, because \nhealth costs for tobacco-related diseases will be reduced. Health care \nproviders and employers win, because this amendment will reduce payment \ncuts and cost-shifting. Seniors win, because the amendment will reduce \nthe financial strains and the concerns about quality and access which \nwill result from steep Medicare cuts. And we all win, as the NIH will \nbe able to continue its current efforts to develop lifesaving \ntechnologies. For the sake of all these affected Americans, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. This Bradley amendment is to offset NIH and Medicare cuts \nwith tobacco tax revenues.\n  The Bradley amendment raises tobacco tax $1 per pack of cigarettes. \nIt also taxes smokeless tobacco products at a similar rate.\n   [[Page S7433]] The revenues from the increased tax are used to \nrestore $76 billion in Medicare cuts, restore the entire cut in the \nNational Institutes of Health budget, $7.9 billion, without the \nHatfield discretionary reduction, and assist tobacco farmers in \nconverting to other crops $500 million.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, is it in order to announce that the Senator \nis going to table this now, make a motion to table now, or wait until \nthe vote comes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wait until the vote comes.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just remind the Senate that even \nthough this sense-of-the-Senate resolution talks about all these good \nthings, essentially you raise a tax and then it is up to the Senate and \nthe Congress to decide what they would do with it. Senator Ford will \nmove to table that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1194\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send to the desk on behalf of Senator \nBradley the third Bradley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Bradley, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1194.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX RATES AND TAX \n                   LOOPHOLES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) lower tax rates lead to increased economic activity and \n     increased economic opportunity;\n       (2) lower tax rates lead to a more efficient economy, with \n     less tax avoidance and investment patterns that rely on \n     competitive market returns and not advantages produced by tax \n     law;\n       (3) the tax code still retains billions of dollars worth of \n     special tax breaks which are available to only limited groups \n     of taxpayers and investors;\n       (4) federal policy should encourage the development of \n     fully competitive markets and not create unique advantages \n     for individual investors, companies or industries.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Congress should, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     remove tax loopholes;\n       (2) the Congress should use the savings from the closing of \n     special interest tax loopholes to reduce tax rates broadly \n     for all classes of taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense of the Senate that \nCongress should remove tax loopholes and use savings to reduce the \nrates for individual taxpayers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. From what we gather, in order to reduce tax rates 1 \npercent, you would have to raise $100 billion from things like the home \nmortgage deduction and the like. I will move to table that also.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the three \namendments that we have just discussed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to ordering the yeas and \nnays on all three?\n  Mr. BYRD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make the point of order this amendment \nis not germane under the Budget Act and it should fall.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I believe we have reached consensus to take \nthe next three up. I will leave it to the explanation of the chairman \nof the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to put three measures up \nnow in the same manner we have done. Then, I would inform the Senate, \nwe have only four amendments left after that. So we are getting there.\n  The measures will be Senator Dorgan on the motion to recommit; \nSenator Wellstone on veterans and tax loopholes; and Senator Wellstone \non defense.\n  If my colleague will explain them, we will stack the votes by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. EXON. For the information of all Senators, the Senator summed it \nup very well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order? There is not order in the \nSenate yet, and we are about to hear a very important explanation as to \nwhat these next three votes are all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the chairman of the Budget Committee has \noutlined this. Just let me summarize so all understand where we are. We \nare moving very well. At the outside, we have six or seven amendments \nleft. At the inside, I think it might be as low as five that will \nrequire that many more votes, of course.\n  Following the pattern that has just been set, after this pattern of \nthree, then we would try to bundle the last three in the same fashion. \nSo I certainly ask unanimous consent it now be in order to offer those \nthree, as agreed to by the chairman of the Budget Committee. I will \nproceed at this time to offer those three with brief explanations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk on behalf of the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. It is a motion to recommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, moves to \n     recommit Senate Concurrent Resolution 13 to the Committee on \n     the Budget with instructions.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] moves to \n     recommit Senate Concurrent Resolution 13 to the Committee on \n     the Budget with instructions to report to the Senate, within \n     3 days (not to include any day the Senate is not in session), \n     a revised concurrent resolution on the budget for the fiscal \n     years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 that \n     provides (in compliance with Section 13301(a)(2) of the \n     Budget Enforcement Act of 1990) for a budget surplus in \n     fiscal year 2002 without counting the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to move that the Senate send the \nbudget resolution back to the Budget Committee. I do this because I \nwould like to see the Committee report a new budget that is truly and \nhonestly balanced in 2002.\n  As my colleagues know, although the resolution before the Senate is \ndescribed as a balanced budget resolution, it actually is not balanced. \nOn page 7 of the resolution, it says that the actual deficit will be \n$114 billion dollars in the year 2002.\n  Why is there this confusion? Because those who claim this budget is \nbalanced are using the surplus in the Social Security System to mask \nthe size of the budget deficit.\n  That is bad policy. It is bad accounting. And it goes against budget \nlaw.\n  Camouflaging the budget deficit in this way is bad policy because we \nintended that Social Security surplus to be used for another important \npurpose. In 1983, with the Social Security changes we made that year, \nCongress decided to build up the Social Security trust fund so that we \ncould meet the retirement claims of the baby boom generation in the \n2010's and 2020's. We were trying to force the Nation to save for that \ntime. To use the surplus for other purposes contradicts the intent of \nthe 1983 law--a law that enjoyed bipartisan support.\n  It is also bad policy because it breaks faith with the American \npeople. We have assured America's workers that the payroll tax that \nthey pay is going into a trust fund and will be used for trust fund \npurposes only. Well, we break that promise if we count the Social \nSecurity surplus as reducing the deficit.\n  If using the Social Security trust fund surplus is bad policy, it is \neven worse accounting. If you take over a trillion dollars in the next \ndecade, put it in the Social Security trust fund, and also count that \nas deficit reduction, you are making one dollar do two things. Double-\nentry accounting does not mean using the same dollar twice. In my view, \nthat kind of bookkeeping is better described as book cooking.\n  Last, the use of the Social Security surplus to mask the size of the \nbudget deficit goes against the law. Section 13301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990, which is similar to provisions that I had \noffered in the House, forbids the Congress from including the Social \nSecurity surplus in the budget resolution.\n  However, the report accompanying this budget says, on page 6, that \nthe budget will be in surplus in 2002. The only way this budget \nbalances in that year is by using the Social Security trust fund \nsurplus. The law says you cannot do that.\n  Now, Mr. President, my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle \nwill say that my motion requires them to find additional further \ndeficit cuts in order to balance the budget. They are right. It does.\n  My Republican colleagues will ask where my deficit reduction plan is. \nWell, I will remind my colleagues that I submitted over $800 billion in \ndeficit reduction recommendations to the Budget Committee. If you put \nthe Domenici budget and the options that I recommended together, and we \ndo not set up a slush fund for tax cuts, then you can balance the \nbudget in 2002 without using the Social Security trust fund surplus.\n  I do not like the Domenici budget because I think its priorities are \nwrong. That is why I have supported a Democratic alternative that \nachieved greater deficit reduction than the Republican plan. And it did \nso without making deep cuts in Medicare and student loans or by doling \nout billions in tax cuts to the wealthiest in this country. However, \nthe Senate defeated that amendment, so the pending budget resolution is \nthe Domenici plan.\n  Let me repeat my point. I hope I will not hear anyone say that I have \nnot offered a plan to do this. If you put my recommendations together \nwith the Domenici recommendations, you are able to meet my motion's \nrequirements.\n  So in closing, I would hope that my colleagues would support honest \nbudgeting. I hope they will stand up for making good policy, for using \naccurate [[Page S7435]] accounting principles and for following the \nlaw.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my motion, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I wish to add Senator Hollings as a \ncosponsor of this amendment--this Dorgan-Hollings motion--which is to \nrecommit, and this motion would recommit the budget resolution to the \nBudget Committee with instructions to report back a budget that is \nbalanced in the fiscal year 2002 according to section 301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from South \nCarolina is added as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as a matter of inquiry, why did the \nclerk read that amendment? We have not been reading the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was a motion to recommit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, and fellow Senators, this is a motion to \nrecommit. This budget resolution before us complies with the law. The \nresolution is presented to Congress just as every other budget \nresolution has been presented, and just as the President presents \nbudgets to us. I see no reason to recommit.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1195\n\n   (Purpose: To restore $74 million in FY 1996 spending for veterans \n          programs by reducing spending for tax expenditures.)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in behalf of \nSenator Wellstone, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1195.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 64, line 24, decrease the amount by $74,000,000.\n       On page 63, line 7, strike the period and insert the \n     following: ``. The Senate Committee on Finance shall report \n     changes in laws within its jurisdiction to increase revenues \n     by $74,000,000 in fiscal year 1996.''\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE-OF-THE-SENATE REGARDING TAX EXPENDITURES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on \n     Finance, in meeting its reconciliation instructions for \n     revenue, will limit or eliminate excessive and unnecessary \n     tax expenditures, including those tax expenditures which \n     provide special tax treatment to a single taxpayer or to a \n     group of taxpayers.\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DELIVERY OF \n                   VETERANS' SERVICES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution relating \n     to Veterans' Programs include the assumption that the \n     delivery of veterans' services will continue to be improved, \n     including further progress in the timely delivery of such \n     services.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the amendment I am proposing is simple \nand straightforward, but vital to Minnesota veterans and veterans \naround the country. It calls for using $74 million in fiscal year 1996 \nfunds earmarked for tax expenditures--in plain English, tax breaks, \nloopholes, and even giveaways to oil and tobacco companies, and other \ncorporate behemoths--to restore projected cuts in VA spending that \nwould have damaging, if not devastating effects, on timely delivery of \nimportant services to veterans.\n  According to the VA, if these cuts should occur there would be a \nsharp rise in claims backlogs and delays in resolving veterans' claims \nfor benefits, increases in already excessive time lags in providing \ndisabled veterans with vocational rehabilitation and employment \nservices, and an inability to provide veterans with timely education \nbenefits earned under the GI bill. For this to happen to those who have \nserved our Nation bravely and without question while corporate welfare \nremains untouched would be unconscionable and clearly unacceptably to \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, while I deplore the damage that would be done to \nservice for our veterans in each of these areas, I would like to focus \nparticularly on the potential negative impact on the timely processing \nof veterans claims.\n  In the countless meetings I have had with Minnesota veterans over the \nlast 4 years the issue of unacceptably long delays in VA claims \nprocessing has consistently been at or near the top of their list of \npriority concerns. As a consequence, it has been and continues to be a \nmajor concern of mine. In 1993, I introduced a bill to improve and \nstreamline VA's system of processing and adjudicating claims which was \nparticularly aimed at reducing delays which had then reached crisis \nproportions.\n  Fortunately, as a result of the leadership of Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, Jessie Brown, the VA has made progress recently in reducing \nbacklogs in processing veterans claims for compensation. At the end of \n1993 the VA had an overall backlog of 575,000 claims which is expected \nto be reduced by the end of this year to 400,000 claims--a decline of \nover 30 percent. Similarly the average time for a VA regional office to \nprocess an original claim dropped from 212 days in May 1994 to 166 days \nin March 1995, a decline of about 22 percent in just 10 months. And I'm \npleased to note that the St. Paul, MN VA Regional Office has made \nsignificant gains over the past 18 months, reducing claims backlogs \nfrom approximately 7,500 to 5,000 and average claims processing times \nfrom 214 days to 122 days.\n  I would like to see the St. Paul VA Regional Office and others like \nit around the country given the support they need from Congress to \ncontinue to improve timeliness--to improve services for veterans. I \nhope to see the St. Paul office process claims in under 100 days on \naverage. That's a worthy goal. What I don't want to see is Congress \ncutting funding for claims processing at a time when it is needed most \nto continue improving services and when it can only nullify the gains \nthe VA has made in this area.\n  Unfortunately, the progress the VA has made in addressing this \ndifficult and complex problem is being seriously imperiled by the \nestimated $74 million cut in funding for the operating budget of the \nVA's Veterans Benefit Administration in fiscal year 1996. In fact, it \nwould reverse the recent progress that has been made in this area, with \nthe VA estimating that if the cut is implemented the claims backlog \nwould revert to over 500,000 cases and average claims processing times \nwould soar to over 1 year.\n  Mr. President, there is much more to this issue than the cold \nstatistics I've cited. There are sometimes enormous human costs too--\ncost that I can only describe as heart rending. About 18 months ago we \ndistributed a questionnaire to Minnesotans to elicit their views about \nthe backlogs in the veterans claims and adjudication process. I found \nand still find many of the comments received with the questionnaire to \nbe terribly disturbing and I want to share a few of these with you. One \nveteran, for example, stressed that the issue of backlogs was a crucial \none ``because it sometimes leads to the death of a veteran\n by suicide over frustration and injustices suffered.'' In other words, \nthis veteran believes that some veterans are committing suicide because \nthey are so frustrated by waiting long periods of time for their claim \nto be resolved. In a similar vein, a county veterans service officer \nlamented that some ``veterans * * * die before their claims have been \nadjudicated,'' and a VA psychologist reported that ``veterans are \nlosing their homes, selling personal belongings, and committing suicide \nwhile waiting * * * for their claims to be adjudicated.'' This is what \nI was told a year and a half ago by people who work every day with the \nVA adjudication system. Since then, as I have said, timeliness has \nimproved at local VA regional offices. So, the last thing we should do \nis cause the backlogs to increase and reverse the trend of progress, \nre-creating the crisis from which we are just emerging.\n\n  In addition to the personal trauma, excessive delays in processing \nveterans claims represent a breach of faith with our veterans who while \nserving in our Armed Forces are led to believe they will receive fair \nand timely compensation if they incur a service-connected disability. \nShould this cut be implemented, we would be moving in precisely the \nwrong direction in terms of improving timeliness. We all know that \njustice deferred is justice denied. Let us not do anything to make the \nadjudication system any slower or to add to the claims backlog.\n  Mr. President, permit me to quote from an eloquent letter recently \nsent by the National Commander of the American Legion to Chairman \nDomenici, copies of which all of my colleagues should have received:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, reducing General Operating Expenses (GOE) \n     within the Veterans Benefits Administration will seriously \n     handicap VA's [[Page S7436]] ability to reduce the \n     extraordinary backlog in veterans claims and appeals cases. \n     VA has made some improvements in this area over the past \n     year. To reduce GOE funding will setback all of the progress \n     VA had made and further delay benefit decisions for veterans \n     and their dependents. A significant part of the problem that \n     has existed in the processing of claims was caused by budget-\n     related staff reductions.\n\n  I could not agree more. If the budget cuts are implemented we will be \ntaking a giant step backward, canceling the progress that has been made \nand returning to a situation wholly unacceptable to our veterans, their \nfamilies, and to all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, thereby keeping faith \nwith the men and women who have served this country faithfully and \nensuring that welfare for corporations doesn't come at the expense of \nthe welfare of our veterans.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment would restore projected cuts \nof $74 million in the Department of Veterans Affairs funding for the \nfiscal year 1996 that would have damaging effects on the timely \ndelivery of important service to veterans, including processing of \nveterans' compensation claims, providing disabled veterans with \nvocational rehabilitation and employment services, and further \neducation benefits earned under the GI bill. It would urge the Finance \nCommittee to cut excessive and unnecessary tax expenditures of $74 \nmillion for fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no explanation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1138\n\n (Purpose: To reduce FY 1996 defense spending by $10 billion and apply \n                   the savings to deficit reduction)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I can sum up very briefly the amendment \nnumber 1138 which is at the desk. This amendment would reduce defense \nspending by $10 billion in fiscal 1996 budget authority and $5 billion \nin outlays.\n  It expresses the sense of the Senate that such reductions should come \nfrom low-priority defense programs, and should, to the maximum extent \npossible, preserve funding for programs and activities which directly \naffect force readiness, or the quality of life of service members and \ntheir families. The savings would be used solely to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment cuts $10 billion \nfrom defense. I think that is enough said.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimously that the motion and the two amendments \nhave rollcall votes. I ask that that be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send up the second amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. I call up the motion and the two amendments for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1138.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $10,000,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 16, decrease the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 7, line 15, decrease the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 7, decrease the amount by $10,000,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 8, decrease the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 65, line 14, decrease the amount by \n     $10,000,000,000.\n       On page 65, line 15, decrease the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DEFENSE SPENDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in reducing defense \n     spending by the amount provided for in this amendment, \n     Congress shall focus on low-priority programs, and to the \n     maximum extend possible should preserve funding for any \n     programs and activities that directly affect force readiness \n     or the quality of life for service members and their \n     families.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment as \npart of a series designed to highlight clearly my budget priorities, as \nopposed to those provided for in the pending budget resolution. While I \nbelieve our Nation must be kept free and secure, and I do not overlook \nthe many risks we face, I am deeply troubled that of all the huge \nspending cuts in this budget, none come from the military budget. That \nmust change. Defense, like everything else, must bear its share of the \ndeficit reduction burden. This amendment is designed to begin to \naddress that problem, at least for the coming year.\n  Even with the ethnic and nationalist conflicts that have spawned \nterrible human tragedies in Bosnia, Somalia, the Middle East, the \nformer Soviet Union, Haiti, and elsewhere, requiring increased \npeacekeeping and other forms of assistance from the United States, we \ncan and should scale back our post-cold-war defense spending \nsubstantially. Likewise, continued concerns about the proliferation of \nchemical, biological, and nuclear weapons are real. But they require us \nto think in new and imaginative ways about the possibilities of using \nsmart diplomacy rather than smart bombs, of placing a greater emphasis \non multilateral efforts to keep the peace, of relying more on a \nstrengthened United Nations, and other multilateral bodies like NATO, \nto maintain a safe, secure, and prosperous world.\n  Instead of this approach, what we have been too often from defense \npolicymakers is bureaucratic inertia, a residual unilateralism, and a \nclinging to the cold war status quo. Despite huge cuts elsewhere in the \nbudget, there are no cuts provided for in military spending. Defense \nspending continues to grow, even in the face of our new post-cold-war \nreality.\n  This budget provides for no cuts from huge and expensive weapons \nsystems that are now obsolete. None from post-cold-war intelligence \nspending that should be curtailed. None from increased contributions \nfrom our allies, or burdensharing. None from the billions in wasteful \nspending that the Pentagon can't even account for, as widely reported \nrecently by the Federal Government's own watchdogs, and in the press. \nIn recent years, they've spent so much money over at the Department of \nDefense, with such sloppy bookkeeping, that they can no longer even \nkeep track of it all. The other day a major Pentagon procurement and \ncontracting official declared that he was giving up on even trying to \naccount for it all. That speaks volumes about how much wasteful and \nunnecessary defense spending could still be wrung from this system. \nThese reports reveal clearly that the Pentagon is still one of the \nlargest sources of wasteful and unnecessary spending in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The U.S. military needs will-trained and well-equipped forces \ntailored to the threats and risks of today. Excessively large forces \nthat were based on war-fighting strategies of another era, or on \nimplausible assumptions that the United States could be required to \nfight two regional wars of about the same size as the Persian Gulf, \nsimultaneously, with no help from our allies, cannot be responsibly \nmaintained at high levels of military readiness. The Pentagon's current \nbudget projections, including elements of the much-touted Bottom-Up \nReview, too often fail to question these kinds of basic assumptions. \nAnd the result is wasteful and unnecessary weapons or delivery systems \nlike the B-2 bomber, star wars, the C-17, the Seawolf submarine, the \nTrident missile, the Milstar satellite system, and a host of other low-\npriority post-cold-war programs, many of which are now obsolete. Under \ncurrent budget constraints, we simply can no longer afford these, if \never we could. Scaling them back would save billions in the coming \nyears. But we must have the courage to make these tough decisions now.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would require a modest cut of $10 billion \nfrom the military budget in 1996. That's only $10 billion out of a \nprojected defense budget of over $260 billion. While many other Federal \nprograms are being slashed by 30, 40, even 50 percent, or more, the \ndefense budget cannot remain immune to budget pressures. The amendment \nwould apply all of the savings from these account to deficit reduction. \nIt is designed to: First, ensure that the modest cuts it provides for \nwill be made in low-priority programs; second, protect the readiness of \nour forces, and third, preserve the living standards of servicemenbers \nand their families. Adopting this amendment would be a small but \nimportant step toward a more responsible Federal budget in which all \nsectors of society bear their fair share of deficit reduction. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\n  Mr. EXON.

If I \nunderstand it, there is one by Senator Snowe, two by Senator Wellstone, \nand one for Senator Bradley. And we can do these in an expeditious \nmatter and put the four together. If that is agreeable to the chairman \nof the committee it is agreeable on this side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So we understand, there are no amendments beyond these.\n  Mr. EXON. No amendments beyond these.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could we agree we have no second-degree \namendment to your amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. It may be a good idea to phrase it as a unanimous-consent, \nthat there will be no more than the four amendments that have just been \nidentified, and there would be no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think it was stated beautifully.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1136\n\n  (Purpose: To direct the Committee on Finance to further reduce the \n   deficit by limiting or eliminating excessive and unnecessary tax \n                             expenditures)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1136.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n       On page 63, line 7, strike the period and insert the \n     following: ``. The Senate Committee on Finance shall report \n     changes in laws within its jurisdiction to increase revenues \n     $10,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1996, $50,000,000,000 for the \n     period of fiscal years 1996 through 2000, and $70,000,000,000 \n     for the period of fiscal yeas 1996 through 2002.''.\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX EXPENDITURES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on \n     Finance, in meeting its reconciliation instructions for \n     revenue, will limit or eliminate excessive and unnecessary \n     tax expenditures, including those tax expenditures which \n     provide special tax treatment to a single taxpayer or to a \n     group of taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment which \nwould direct the Finance Committee to close $70 billion of narrowly \nfocused tax breaks and loopholes over the next 7 years, and apply the \nsavings solely to deficit reduction. This $70 billion figure is more \nthan double the amount of savings from tax expenditures assumed in the \nHouse Budget Committee's budget resolution. Unfortunately, the Senate \nBudget Committee did not include any savings from tax expenditures in \nthe budget resolution we are debating today. I believe that is a \nserious mistake, because unless it is changed it virtually ensures that \npowerful, well-heeled special interests who have fought so hard for so \nlong to protect their special tax breaks could be held harmless under \nthis budget.\n  We must take steps now to reduce the Federal budget deficit in a way \nthat is fair, responsible, and that requires shared sacrifice. This \namendment would help us along that path. The amendment requires the \nclosing of $70 billion of special interest tax loopholes and other \nbreaks which have received far too little scrutiny in this budget \nprocess. Senator Bradley, Senator Feingold, and others have described \nin detail the problems posed by these huge tax breaks, and the savings \nwhich could be generated from these sources. Since a number of \namendments have been defeated which would apply\n at least some of the savings generated by closing corporate loopholes \nand other tax breaks to other priority domestic programs, the time has \nnow come to put to the test the proposition that at least some of these \nsavings ought to be used exclusively for deficit reduction. That is why \nthe savings generated by this amendment would be used exclusively to \nreduce the deficit.\n\n  When this budget resolution slashes funding for Medicare and \nMedicaid, when we are cutting education programs and student loans, \nwhen we are slashing Federal spending for veterans and farmers, when we \nare causing great pain for children and the most vulnerable in our \nsociety, it seems only fair that we should ask wealthy individuals and \ncorporations to pay their fair share. That is why we should plug many \nof the narrowly focused tax breaks and loopholes which allow the \nprivileged few to escape paying their fair share, forcing everyone else \nto pay higher taxes to make up the difference. It is a simple question \nof fairness.\n  Let me make a simple point here that is often overlooked. We can \nspend money just as easily through the tax code, through what are \ncalled tax expenditures, as we can through the normal appropriations \nprocess. Spending is spending, whether it comes in the form of a \nGovernment check or in the form of a tax break for some special \npurpose, like a subsidy, a credit, a deduction, or an accelerated \ndepreciation for this type of investment or that. Some tax expenditures \nare justified, and should be retained. But some are special interest \ntax breaks that should be eliminated, or loopholes that should be \nplugged. These are what this amendment is design to go after.\n  These special interest tax expenditures are simply special exceptions \nto the normal rules, rules that oblige all of us to share the burden of \ncitizenship by paying our taxes. All of these special tax breaks \ndistort, to one degree or another, economic investment decisions, \nusually in favor of wealthy individuals and corporations with the \nhighest paid lobbyists in Washington.\n  It is time to end these special interest tax breaks and close these \ntax loopholes. Various groups from all ideological perspectives--from \nthe National Taxpayers Union and the CATO Institute to the Progressive \nPolicy Institute to the Citizens for Tax Justice--have prepared lists \nof tax expenditures which they believe should be eliminated. Special \ninterest tax breaks are simply a subcategory of the larger group of tax \nprovisions called tax expenditures. The Congressional Joint Tax \nCommittee has estimated that tax expenditures cost the U.S. Treasury \nover $420 billion every single year. And they also estimate that if we \ndon't hold them in check, that amount will grow by $60 billion to over \n$485 billion by 1999. That's why tax breaks must be on the table along \nwith other defense and domestic spending as we look for places to cut \nthe deficit.\n But despite the logic of this approach, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have refused to even consider the possibility of \ncutting tax breaks for wealthy corporate and other interests, making \nthem bear their fair share of the deficit reduction burden. Instead, \nthey have chosen to pursue the path of least political resistance, \nslashing programs for the broad middle class, the vulnerable elderly, \nand the poor.\n\n  Now, not all tax expenditures are bad. Not all should be eliminated. \nSome serve a real public purpose, such as providing incentives to \ninvestment, bolstering the nonprofit sector, encouraging charitable \ncontributions, allowing people to deduct State and local taxes, and \nhelping people to be able to afford to buy a home through the mortgage \ndeduction. But some of them are simply tax dodges that can no longer be \njustified. At the very least, all of these should undergo the same \nscrutiny as other Federal spending, and should bear their fair share of \ndeficit reduction.\n  It is only fair, since these special tax breaks for certain companies \nand industries force other companies and individuals to pay higher \ntaxes to make up the difference. Some of these tax breaks allow \nprivileged industries such as the oil and gas industry to avoid paying \ntheir fair share of taxes. All distort, to one degree or another, \neconomic investment decisions, usually in favor of companies with the \nhighest paid lobbyists in Washington. In many cases, doing away with \nthese special tax breaks for certain industries would allow a more \nefficient allocation of economic resources.\n  I think it is a simple question of fairness. If Congress is really \ngoing to make the over $1.4 trillion in spending cuts and other policy \nchanges that would have to be made to balance the Federal budget by \n2002, then those on the other side of the aisle should make sure that \nwealthy interests in our society, those who have political clout, those \nwho can hire high-priced lobbyists to make their case every day here in \nWashington, are asked to sacrifice at least as much as regular middle \nclass folks whom you and I represent. We should represent those who \nreceive Social Security or Medicare or veterans benefits, and not just \nthose special interests who can afford to pay high-priced hired guns to \nlobby for them.\n  I am amazed that many in the majority party have proposed, among \nother things, expanding corporate tax breaks at the very same time that \nthey are slashing Government spending on programs for the poor, for \nchildren, for education, and for the most vulnerable in our society. \nThey have proposed tax cuts for the wealthy which, according to the \nTreasury Department, would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and at \nthe same time they refuse to subject a broad range of new tax breaks to \nscrutiny in the budget process. And these are the ones who call \nthemselves deficit hawks?\n  Some will charge that by closing tax loopholes and restricting \nspecial interest tax breaks we re somehow proposing to raise taxes. And \nthey will say that over and over and over until some will begin to \nbelieve it. They are wrong. What they fail to understand is that even\n with the reforms of the mid-1980's, which closed many of the most \negregious tax loopholes, the presence of the tax breaks in the current \ntax system forces middle class and working people to pay more in taxes \nthan they otherwise would have to pay. While some are paying less then \ntheir fair share in taxes because of these special tax subsidies, \nothers are being forced to pay more in taxes to make up the difference. \nClosing tax loopholes is not raising taxes. Of course, these subsidies \nare hidden in the tax code because it would be too hard to get the \nvotes in [[Page S7439]] Congress, in the full light of day, to directly \nsubsidize these industries--especially under current budget \nconstraints.\n\n  It is a simple matter of fairness. In our attempts to reduce the \nfederal deficit, all sectors of our society must make some sacrifices. \nSpecific industries and the wealthy are the ones who often benefit most \nfrom special interest tax breaks and loopholes. If we do not treat tax \nbreaks the same as direct spending, the wealthy will avoid making any \nsacrifices as we cut spending programs for the middle class and the \npoor. Just because some special interest has the means to hire a high-\npriced tax lobbyist to get a special tax break written into legislation \ndoes not give them the right to avoid sharing in whatever sacrifices \nare necessary to reduce the budget deficit.\n  The General Accounting Office issued a report last year, and has \nissued several others on tax expenditures. It was titled ``Tax Policy: \nTax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny.'' I commend it to my \ncolleagues' attention. It makes a compelling case for subjecting these \ntax expenditures to greater congressional scrutiny, just as direct \nspending is scrutinized. The GAO report reminds us that spending \nthrough special provisions in the tax code should be treated in the \nsame way as other spending provisions.\n  At a time when we are talking about potentially huge spending cuts in \nmeat inspections designed to insure against outbreaks of disease; or in \nhigher education aid for middle class families; or in protection for \nour air, our lakes, and our land; or in highways; or in community \ndevelopment programs for states and localities; or in sewer and water \nprojects for our big cities; or in safety net programs for vulnerable \nchildren; or to eliminate the school lunch program, we should be \nwilling to weigh these cuts against special tax loopholes that could \ncost hundreds of billions each year. This amendment will have the \nFinance Committee close merely $70 billion worth of these special \ninterest tax breaks and loopholes--a modest $10 billion per year for \nthe next 7 years.\n  Under congressional budget rules, the details of which specific tax \nbreaks to eliminate must be left to the Finance Committee. That is the \nway it should be. But even though I am not a tax lawyer, I have been \nable to identify a number of tax breaks for elimination, and loopholes \nwhich should be closed. For example, for much too long the oil and gas \nindustry has enjoyed special\n tax breaks not available to other industries. These special tax \nloopholes include the ability to expense oil and gas exploration costs \nand the so-called Special Percentage Depletion Allowances. It is time \nto end these costly special tax privileges for a single industry. Why \nshould the oil and gas industry receive special treatment in the tax \ncode which is not available to other kinds of companies? Closing these \nspecial interest tax loopholes could save as much as $10.6 billion over \n5 years.\n\n  Other tax loopholes which should be closed relate to the taxation of \nmultinational corporations. Through complex accounting shell games \ninvolving their foreign subsidiaries, and by locating their plants \noverseas, multinational corporations can avoid paying most of their \nU.S. taxes. According to some estimates, closing these loopholes could \nsave as much as $10 to $15 billion over 5 years. Still other special \ntax breaks allow Americans working overseas to receive their first \n$70,000 of income absolutely tax free, at a cost of $8.6 billion over 5 \nyears. We should also close the loophole which allows billionaires to \nrenounce their U.S. citizenship and avoid paying taxes on the value of \nproperty which increased while they were U.S. citizens. The savings \nfrom closing this loophole would be at least $1.7 billion over 5 years. \nFinally, we should stop the fancy stock swap loophole which allowed \nDuPont and Seagrams to avoid paying over $1.5 billion in taxes that \nwould otherwise be due to the Treasury. And we should consider further \nscaling back, or eliminating outright, section 936 of the Internal \nRevenue Code designed to subsidize certain investments in Puerto Rico. \nThat provision alone would generate an estimated $19.7 billion, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. Eliminating these \nprovisions alone would generate about $50 billion in savings over the \nnext 5 years, with billions more to be saved from other sources.\n  As I have said, it is a simple question of tax fairness. If Congress \nis really serious about making the painful spending cuts and other \npolicy changes that would have to be made under this budget resolution, \nthan those on the other side of the aisle should join us in voting to \nmake sure that wealthy interests in our society, those who have \npolitical clout, those who can hire high-priced lobbyists to make their \ncase every day here in Washington, are asked to sacrifice at least as \nmuch as regular middle class folks whom you and I represent. Just \nbecause some special interest has the means to hire a high-priced tax \nlobbyist to get a special tax break written into legislation does not \ngive them the right to avoid sharing in whatever sacrifices are \nnecessary to reduce the budget deficit. In our efforts to shrink the \nFederal budget deficit, we just cannot let these special interest tax \ndodges continue.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment would instruct the Senate \nCommittee on Finance to report changes in the laws within its \njurisdiction; to increase revenues by $10 billion in fiscal year 1996; \n$50 billion in the years 1996 through 2,000; and $70 billion for the \nyear 1996 to the year 2000; to be generated by scaling back or \neliminating outright a number of unnecessary, excessive or inefficient \ntax expenditures, including those which provide special tax treatment \nto a single taxpayer or a group of taxpayers.\n  The $70 billion goes to deficit reduction.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President I want to respond. This is $130 billion \ntax increase. I move to table the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1141\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding low-priority \n   domestic discretionary funding to be reduced in order to pay for \n partial restoration of funding for the National Institutes of Health)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. EXON], for Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1141.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, insert the following: ``It is the \n     sense of the Senate that the low-priority discretionary funds \n     to be reduced in order to offset funds restored for programs \n     and activities of the National Institutes of Health should \n     come from eliminating low-priority Federal programs like the \n     Space Station, and not from high-priority programs for \n     education, food and nutrition for low-income children, \n     anticrime efforts, veterans programs, job training, health \n     care, infrastructure, and other such investment programs.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, while I was an original cosponsor of \nthe Hatfield amendment to restore critical funding to the National \nInstitutes of Health, I would like to offer a sense of the Senate that \nwould ensure that we do not jeopardize other valued programs in order \nto accomplish this goal. In the budget resolution, funding for the NIH \nwould have been reduced by nearly $8 billion over 7 years. Such a \nreduction would have decimated the biomedical research effort of this \ncountry and could not be permitted. But the offsets necessary to \nrestore funding to the NIH as proposed by Mr. Hatfield should be taken \nfrom low-priority domestic discretionary programs like the Space \nStation, and not from high-priority programs like food and nutrition \nprograms for low-income children, anticrime efforts, veterans programs \ninfrastructure, and other such investment programs. Education, health \ncare, and labor accounts have been protected by the Hatfield amendment \nbut I include further protection for them in my amendment as well.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to point out that the NIH \nserves as the focal point for health research in this country. It \nsupports the work of over 50,000 scientists at over 1,700 institutions, \nas well as conducting biomedical and behavioral research and research \ntraining in its own facilities. The mission of the NIH is the pursuit \nof science ``to expand fundamental knowledge about the nature and \nbehavior of living systems, to apply that knowledge to extend the \nhealth of human lives, and to reduce the burdens \n[[Page S7440]] resulting from disease and disability''. To pursue this \nmission, which is one that is essential to the future of America, \nrequires adequate financial resources, scientists, and infrastructure. \nThe Hatfield amendment will assure that these functions will be able to \ncontinue to improve the lives of the American people.\n  What would the impact have been if the originally proposed reductions \nin NIH funding had been permitted to occur? The NIH is now able to fund \nabout 24 percent of all research proposals submitted each year. A 5-\npercent budget cut would have resulted in an ability to fund between 12 \nand 18 percent of such proposals, according to Dr. Harold Varmus, \nDirector of NIH. A 10-percent cut, as proposed in the Senate budget \nresolution, would have meant that fewer than 1 proposal in 10 submitted \nto the NIH would have received funding. In some areas, where funding is \nalready tight, such as mental health, fewer than 1 proposal in 20 would \nhave received funding. This would have clearly been a tragedy. With \nsuch a low rate of funding for research, clearly less and less research \nwould have been performed.\n  Just as important, however, would have been the effect on the \nresearch work force. Young people considering a career in\n biomedical research are unlikely to choose to do so when they realize \nthat they only have 1 chance in 10 or 20 to be funded to do their work. \nThe loss of young, creative researchers, once it had occured, would \ntaken decades to replace.\n\n  The NIH agenda for the coming years includes a focus on HIV/AIDS, \nbreast cancer and other women's health issues, minority health, \ntuberculosis, brain disorders, gene therapy, drug design, and disease \nprevention, among other topics. Are these important national problems? \nIs progress being made through research? Let's look at some examples:\n  First, breast cancer continues to be the cancer most frequently \ndiagnosed in the United States. In the decade of the 1990s, it is \nestimated that more than 1.5 million new cases of breast cancer will be \ndiagnosed and nearly 500,000 American women will die of breast cancer. \nRecent research, however, has led to the discovery of a gene linked to \nbreast cancer, and the development of more precise screening techniques \nto detect breast cancer. Between 1989 and 1992, the overall death rate \nfor breast cancer in American women declined 4.7 percent--in large \nmeasure due to these and other associated breakthroughs. Vital and \nsuccessful programs that must be continued.\n  Second, Parkinson's disease and other neurologic diseases are \ncontinuing to devastate the lives of sufferers and their families. \nParkinson's disease currently afflicts over one million Americans, and \nI have seen its effects firsthand. Both my mother and father had \nParkinson's disease, and its manifestations seemed incredibly cruel to \nme. My father was a writer, and at the very end of his life I remember \nseeing him in the study trying to type with his hand just shaking--he \nwas unable to do it. Soon thereafter he was unable to walk, and was \nbarely able to speak. At the time of his death, he was confined to bed, \nunable to communicate, and drained of the dignity with which he lived.\n  What is encouraging is that Parkinson's disease is on the threshold \nof substantial scientific breakthroughs. The new science of molecular \nbiology has brought forth dramatic and exciting developments that have \ngiven Parkinson's patients new hope. Scientists are closer to \ndiscovering the cause--or causes--of this disease * * * tissue implants \ninto the brain have been shown to replace the dopamine that is missing \nin the brain of afflicted patients * * * genetically engineered \nmedication or even gene therapy might provide long-lasting, \nsustainable, side-effect-free improvements, or even a cure. Similar \ndramatic advances have occurred in the understanding and diagnosis of \nAlzheimer's disease. Restoring funding to the NIH, as accomplished by \nthe Hatfield amendment, will help assure that these breakthroughs will \nbe pursued, so that no person, and no family need to suffer as my \nparents, and my family did, with neurodegenerative diseases.\n  These are just two examples, and there are many others that \nillustrate the value of the biomedical research effort, and the tragedy \nand human suffering that would occur if it is not supported.\n  A little appreciated benefit of NIH work is a reduction of\n   health care costs, by early diagnosis, more effective treatment, and \ndisease prevention. For example, the NIH recently developed a vaccine \nagainst a common bacterial infection--Haemophilus influ- \nenzae type B--that afflicts children. When severe, this \ninfection can cause meningitis, and result in mental retardation, at a \ngreat cost in suffering to the patient and family, and financially to \nsociety as well. The vaccine that was developed will prevent this \nillness. It is projected that this breakthrough alone will save \nAmericans over $400 million a year.\n\n  Critics of the NIH note that funding has doubled in the past 10 \nyears, and, therefore, claim that cuts could be made without harming \nprograms. Although NIH's budget has increased almost every year, the \navailable money has not grown as rapidly as the demand for it to \nconduct research, largely because of the opening up of so many new, \npromising fields of research in biomedical sciences over the past two \ndecades. Between 1984 and 1993, for example, applications for research \nprojects support increased 33 percent. The number of awards made during \nthis time, however, fluctuated greatly from year to year. The result \nhas been unpredictable variability, with a downward trend, in the \nfraction of projects submitted, that are awarded grants. In 1987, 34.8 \npercent of grants were funded, but this has steadily fallen to 25 \npercent in 1994 overall, and lower in some Institutes of the NIH.\n  In addition to the disastrous effects on investigators, cuts in the \nNIH budget of the magnitude proposed would have had an equally \ndevastating effect on the Nation's medical schools. About half of NIH's \nextramural budget ends up in medical schools, directly to support \nresearch, and indirectly to help maintain the infrastructure necessary \nto carry out the research.\n  The Hatfield amendment will assure that medical schools have the \nresources they need to continue their efforts in research. I hope that \nmy colleagues will also support my amendment to assure that low-\npriority discretionary funding is used to restore the critically needed \nfunds to the National Institutes of Health.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of the \nSenate that low-priority domestic programs and activities of the \nFederal Government, including the space station, should be reduced in \norder to meet the requirement of the Hatfield National Institutes of \nHealth amendment.\n  It ensures that the high-priority programs, including education, food \nand nutrition for low-income children, anticrime efforts, veterans \nprograms, job training, health care, and other similar investments be \nprotected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to note that the tax loopholes that could \nbe closed could include the interest deduction on home mortgage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1196\n\n                   (Purpose: To propose a substitute)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Bradley, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1196.\n\n  (The text of the amendment appears under today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we all know that years and years of Federal \nbudget deficits are a real threat to the future of our economy.\n  We know that they cut into the private savings and investment we need \nto provide for a better future.\n  We know that they require us to borrow from other countries, \nincreasing our exposure to the changeable winds of the global economy.\n  And, Mr. President, we know that those deficits contribute to the \nperception that Government does not work, that it cannot do its own \njob, that we cannot get our own House in order.\n  When I introduced my own balanced budget amendment over 10 years ago, \nand when I voted for the balanced budget amendment earlier this year, I \ndid so in the conviction that regaining [[Page S7441]] control of our \nFederal finances must be at the top of our priorities.\n  But I said when I cast my vote that, a crucial reason for my concern \nabout the deficit is that its very real importance threatens to \noverwhelm our ability to make rational--and yes, compassionate--choices \nfor the future of our country.\n  By its sheer size and seriousness, the Federal deficit is driving all \nother policy choices. It is dictating the terms of debate as we \nconsider what we can do about crime, health care, welfare reform, our \ndecaying infrastructure, military readiness, and the place of our \ncountry in a changing world.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is completely appropriate for us to subject \nevery policy, every dollar we spend, to the strictest standards of cost \neffectiveness.\n  That should be our standard, no matter what shape our books are in.\n  But as I said when I voted for the balanced budget amendment, Mr. \nPresident, we must achieve that standard in a way that is fair, and \nthat covers everything in the budget, including tax expenditures.\n  And, Mr. President, we must understand that a shortsighted focus on \nthe bottom line, on simply cutting spending without a thought for its \nimpact on the future, can threaten our future just as surely as \ncontinued deficits.\n  Mr. President, we must continue on the path we began 2 years ago \ntoward lower and lower deficits--but we must also continue to commit \nour scarce resources where they can do the greatest good, for the \ngreatest number of our citizens, over the long run.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Republican budget plan is not fair, \nand it fails to meet our obligation to invest in the future. Therefore, \nI cannot support it.\n  I regret that I cannot support that budget plan, that on\n   paper--if a lot of heroic assumptions work out--aims at a zero \ndeficit by the year 2002.\n\n  But the refusal to accept amendments--amendments, Mr. President, that \nwould not have changed that zero-deficit goal of a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002--has left us with a budget plan that is not fair and that \nsacrifices our future for shortsighted savings today.\n  And, I am sorry to say, Mr. President, it leaves us with a budget \nplan that puts the burden of deficit reduction on those who are least \nable to bear it. That unfairness, I believe, will have real economic \ncosts that could be avoided by a more careful considered path toward \nthe balanced budget goal.\n  Let us remember, Mr. President, that the amendments that were \nrejected would not have increased the deficit--they would have \ncontinued the path toward a zero deficit--but they would have achieved \nthat goal while maintaining our commitment to investments vital for the \nfuture of our economy and society.\n  I supported an amendment by Senator Rockefeller to restore $100 \nbillion in Medicare cuts, and I cosponsored Senator Johnston's \namendment to restore two-thirds of the Medicare cuts. These amendments \nwould still have eliminated the deficit by 2002. But, instead of tax \ncuts--tax cuts not for the middle class but for those who do not need \nthem--these amendments would have preserved Medicare for those seniors \non fixed incomes.\n  Unfortunately, both Medicare amendments failed. And, the effect of \nthe underlying Republican budget would be to increase the costs of \nMedicare for the average senior citizen by $900 in the year 2002. I \nbelieve this is neither desirable nor necessary to balance the Federal \nbudget.\n  In the same way, Mr. President, the Republican budget plan cuts $21 \nbillion from a program to reward work that President Ronald Reagan \ncalled the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job \ncreation measure to come out of the Congress, the earned income tax \ncredit.\n  Senator Bradley's attempt to restore that cut--to repeal that tax \nincrease on the working poor--was defeated.\n  The Republican cuts in the earned income tax credit come with no \nthought about how they would affect the pressing need for real welfare \nreform.\n  Now we all agree, Mr. President, that the central question in welfare \nreform is how to get people off the dole and back to work. But by \nincreasing the tax burden on low-income working families, the cuts in \nthe earned income tax credit will make work less attractive for the \nvery families that are at the greatest risk of falling into the welfare \nsystem.\n  The Republican budget says, ``cut first,'' Mr. President, ``and ask \nquestions later.''\n  The Republican budget is shortsighted in other ways, Mr. President. \nIt makes education more expensive, and cuts away at crucial supports \nfor the research programs that have--up to\n now--kept our country in the lead internationally in the most critical \nfactor needed for future competitiveness--knowledge.\n\n  I cosponsored and supported amendments that would restore funding to \nstudent loan programs and to the funds available for medical and other \nresearch programs that could sustain our country's international \nleadership in the production of that knowledge.\n  In all of these areas--providing health care, promoting work over \nwelfare, supporting education, and research--I voted for amendments to \nthe Republican budget plan. These changes would have achieved the \nbalanced budget goal we all seek, but without the unwise and \nunnecessary cuts that will weaken the foundations for stronger economic \ngrowth.\n  Those changes I supported, Mr. President, would have also assured \nthat more Americans could participate in that future growth.\n  Those amendments would have achieved the same balanced budget goal as \nthe Republican plan, but in a way that shared the sacrifice more fairly \nnow, and would provide a fairer distribution of the future benefits \nfrom that sacrifice.\n  When I saw the many weaknesses in the Republican plan, Mr. President, \nI resolved to join with Senator Bradley in offering an alternative \nbalanced budget plan that would achieve the benefits from eliminating \ndeficits in ways that did not sacrifice fairness or the foundations of \neconomic growth.\n  As I said, Mr. President, among my first concerns was the unwise and \nunnecessary cuts in Medicare that are the real cornerstone of the \nRepublican budget plan. Without those cuts, there is no Republican plan \nfor balancing the budget.\n  The Bradley-Biden amendment restores $175 billion of the Republican \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid. Our plan would increase Medicare 8 \npercent annually over the next 7 years.\n  However, it is our hope that we can reduce the cost of Medicare in \nthat time through comprehensive health care reform--not with arbitrary \ncuts like those proposed in the Republican budget.\n  By controlling the underlying growth in health care costs--which is \nthe real cause of the increase in Medicare costs--comprehensive health \ncare reform would be a benefit not only to Medicare recipients but to \nall Americans. And the offshoot is that down the road, we can save \nmoney in the Medicare Program--savings that we hope will not require \ncutting how much Medicare pays to doctors and hospitals, and even more \nimportantly, savings that will not mean higher costs to senior citizens \non fixed incomes.\n  The irony is that Republicans have been using the annual report of \nthe Medicare Board of Trustees to justify their draconian cuts in \nMedicare. But, the Republicans are ignoring the Board's recommendation \nto Congress to save the Medicare system as part of broad-based health \ncare reform.\n  But beyond the fact that the Bradley-Biden plan would honor our \ncountry's commitment to provide health care for our elderly, there are \nother, more fundamental differences between our program and the \nRepublican budget.\n  For example, we demand restraint in the growth of tax expenditures, \namong the fastest-growing reasons we continue to pile up deficits.\n  Now, Mr. President, this plan imposes a hard freeze on domestic \nspending--no increase in the dollars spent--and then cuts an additional \n$15 billion. And this plan cuts an additional $10 billion from the \ncurrent projections for defense spending.\n  This is strong medicine for our persistent deficit disease.\n  Unfortunately, we now must take such dramatic--and painful--steps in \nthose areas.\n  But in the name of fundamental fairness, Mr. President, how can we \nask [[Page S7442]] the children, the poor, the elderly, of our country \nto sacrifice without demanding that those who have prospered under the \ncurrent system, and have continued to prosper as deficits have built up \nover the years, to participate in restoring balance to our country's \nfinances?\n  Make no mistake, tax expenditures have the same effect on our \ndeficits as any other kind of Federal program--they increase the gap \nbetween what we spend and what we take in. Why don't we examine them \nwith the same critical accountant's eye that we must apply to defense \nspending, agricultural programs, education, health, and research?\n  Incredibly, Mr. President, the Republican plan refuses to touch this \nrapidly growing drain on the Treasury, choosing instead to permit what \nwill be a $4 trillion entitlement program between now and the year 2002 \nto go untouched.\n  Let me repeat that Mr. President. Tax entitlements--exemptions, \ndeductions, loopholes, call them what you will--will total $4 trillion \nbetween now and the year we seek to achieve a balanced budget.\n  In their search for ways to reduce Federal deficits, the Republicans \nhave taken on spending for children, for the elderly, for the working \npoor, for education, for scientific and medical research. But they \nwon't touch tax expenditures that will cost the Treasury three times \nwhat it will take to balance the budget over the next 7 years.\n  What Senator Bradley and I would do is subject those tax entitlements \nto the same scrutiny that we apply to the rest of the budget--no more \nsacrifice from that source than from others, but no less, either.\n  All told, we would cut only $197 billion over 7 years from that $400 \nbillion--a 5-percent reduction over the 7 years.\n  Of course, not all tax deductions and exemptions have to be cut to \nachieve that modest goal. Our plan would not touch the home mortgage \ndeduction, the deduction for State and local taxes,\n or the deduction for contributions to charities.\n\n  Let me repeat that before I hear that those worthwhile and necessary \nitems are at risk under our plan. They are not. We do not need to touch \nthem to achieve our balanced budget goal in the year 2002.\n  But we would slow the growth--not eliminate, but slow the growth--in \nsuch tax expenditures as the quick tax write-off for timber that will \ncost us $2.3 billion over the next 5 years.\n  I believe that most Americans would agree that such programs--\nprograms that lose money from the Treasury as surely as any other--\ncould share some of the restraint needed to restore balance to the \nFederal budget.\n  By cutting this and other tax breaks, we would save $197 billion that \ncan be used to bring the Federal deficit to zero by the year 2002.\n  By refusing to take on the huge tax expenditure budget, Mr. \nPresident, the Republican plan must find its savings by raising \nMedicare premiums by $900, by adding $3,000 to the cost of a student \nloan, and by increasing taxes by $21 billion on working families.\n  These are cuts that the Bradley-Biden plan does not have to make, Mr. \nPresident, because it spreads the costs of deficit reduction more \nequitably, and thereby requires less sacrifice of those who can least \nafford it.\n  In addition to sharing the near-term sacrifice more evenly, this plan \nalso builds a foundation for future economic growth that will be more \nwidely shared, as well.\n  Our plan provides for full funding of student loans, and makes \nreckless cuts in our Nation's scientific and medical research \nunnecessary. It provides for prudent levels of investment in the \nequipment, the information, and the people who will lead our economy--\nand the world's economy--into the next century.\n  And, Mr. President, the Bradley-Biden plan permits--once a real \ndeficit-reduction plan is in place and its benefits can be accurately \npredicted and scored by the Congressional Budget Office--it permits a \n$10,000 college tuition tax deduction for middle-class families.\n  It helps to underwrite our competitive future, and it helps to \nunderwrite a key element of the American dream.\n  Mr. President, ours is a plan that would achieve the goal we all \nshare--a balanced budget. But we should aspire to more, Mr. President--\nwe should dream of a better future, and we should take the actions now \nthat are needed to make that dream a reality.\n  Without continued support now for education, scientific and medical \nresearch, health care, public infrastructure, and other investments, we \nwill be poorer in the long run, whatever shape our Federal finances are \nin.\n  The Bradley-Biden balanced budget plan not only achieves the mundane, \nbut essential, goal of restoring balance to the Government's books. It \nmakes the investments necessary to keep alive our faith in the future.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Bradley amendment reduces defense \nspending by $5 billion; reduces nondefense discretionary by $15 billion \nmore, than a hard freeze; restores $100 billion of the $256 billion \nRepublican Medicare cut; $85 billion from a $1 a pack increase in the \ntobacco tax; restores $75 billion of the $175 billion Republican \nMedicaid cut; retains Republican agricultural cuts; restores funding of \nstudent loans; restores $60 billion of the $86 billion in income \nassistance cut by the Republican budget plan; reduces the tax loopholes \nfor corporations and the wealthy by $197 billion.\n  If the fiscal dividend materializes, using $70 billion to restore a \nportion of the spending cuts from the Republican proposal; and lastly, \nuses the remaining $100 million of fiscal dividend, if available, to \nprovide a middle-class tax cut.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this proposes $282 billion in tax \nincreases over 7 years. I think that is the record setter. It cuts \noutlays in the agricultural programs and others.\n  I believe it is pretty late to have a full budget before the Senate \ntoday. I move to table it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1197\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the reconciliation instructions to the Committee on \n  Labor and Human Resources (primarily affecting student loans) from \n $13,795,000,000 in outlays over 7 years, to $4,395,000,000 by closing \n                             tax loopholes)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I was extremely happy to see that the \nSenate passed the Snowe-Simon amendment restoring $9.4 billion for the \nstudent loan program. The Senate has agreed to fund this amendment by \nclosing corporate tax loopholes. I want to emphasize, however, that the \nspecific loophole mentioned in the amendment was not binding in any way \nand was intended to serve only as one of many possible suggestions. \nIndeed, on the basis of the very persuasive arguments made by Senators \nMurray, Kerry, Kennedy, and Biden about the high-tech industry in their \nStates and in the nation, I have been persuaded to work with the \nFinance Committee to find a different tax loophole to use as a funding \nsource.\n  Ms. Snowe. I understand the concerns of my colleagues, as well. I too \nwill work with the Finance Committee to find a source of revenue for \nthe student loan program that best serves all the interests of my \ncolleagues. I want to thank Senators Murray, Kerry, Kennedy, and Biden \nfor their help in restoring funding for the student loan program. And I \nespecially thank my Republican cosponsors--Senators Cohen, Kassebaum, \nCampbell, and Jeffords) for their help and assistance on this important \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate returned \nto its tradition of bipartisan support for education to restore $9.4 \nbillion to student loan accounts by an overwhelming majority. These \nfunds provide vital support for the Nation's college students.\n  I also welcome the statement of my colleagues Senators Simon and \nSnowe concerning the offset and our willingness to work closely with \nmembers of the Committee on Finance to insure that the most appropriate \noffset is developed. Clearly, tax expenditures should bear their fair \nshare of any serious effort to balance the budget.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, while I strongly support the goal of the \nSnowe-Simon amendment to lessen the cuts in the education function, I \ncannot vote for this approach because it proposes to raise taxes.\n  Although the authors of this amendment claim that this will be \naccomplished by closing a tax loophole for foreign sales corporation, \nwhich I would support in the context of fundamental tax reform or \noverall tax reduction--as, indeed, I strongly favor closing many tax \nloopholes, and will work to so when a tax bill is under consideration--\nthe practical legislative effect of this amendment would be to instruct \nthe Senate Finance Committee to raise tax revenues by about $9.4 \nbillion over 5 years through any means.\n  Mr. President, that could mean higher taxes on working families, the \nelderly or others whose economic future I care about. Out of the some \n$12 trillion we will spend under this budget, I believe that over the \nnext 7 years, we can find the additional dollars to fully protect needy \nstudents by cutting corporate welfare and unnecessary spending. That is \nwhy I worked with Senator Snowe yesterday on an amendment that would \nprotect student loans by cutting spending.\n  Having said this, if this amendment should pass, I will support this \nbudget resolution and strongly encourage the conferees on the budget to \nretain this resolution in student loan funding, but do so by cutting \nspending in other areas. Further, in my position as a member of the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee I will work to ensure that \nthe Guaranteed Student Loan Program is fully funded under any \ncircumstances I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment reduces the \nreconciliation instruction to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, primarily affecting student loans, from $13,795,000,000 in \noutlays over 7 years to $4,395,000,000 over the same period of time by \nclosing tax loopholes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I think I have a little time left. With \nregard to this, we favor the Snowe amendment and urge its support. It \nwould restore funding needed for student loans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order at this \npoint to ask for the yeas and nays on the four remaining amendments \nthat have been outlined with one request for the yeas and nays, which I \nrequest at this juncture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the first Wellstone \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me ask Members to stay right here \nbecause we are going to go as quickly as we can, hoping to do it in \nless time. We had an hour debate. We are going to ask consent, and I \nask now unanimous consent to reduce that to 40 minutes instead of 1 \nhour on behalf of the managers on each side. Then we will have final \npassage of the budget and then we will move to the terrorism bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion.\n  Mr. DOLE. Did we get the agreement on the 1 hour to 40 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion To Table Amendment No. 1136\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Forty minutes and then final passage. I think it would be \nhelpful if all Members remain in their seats, or if they do not care to \nlisten to final debate, then remove themselves from the Chamber. We \nhope to start the vote about quarter of 6, or 10 of 6. I think the \nfirst speaker will be the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator \nExon.\n  So I urge my colleagues to give the managers our attention here for \nthe next 40 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of the time \nallotted to our side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we should have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair respectfully asks all Senators to \ntake their seats.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, as we reach closure----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make my request again. I think we \nshould have order in the Senate. [[Page S7445]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's point is well taken. The Chair \nrequests all Senators to cease conversation.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, as we come to the closure of debate on this \nvery, very important budget matter, I want to start out my closing \nremarks by taking a moment to thank the Budget Committee staffs, the \nmajority staff and the minority staff, for what I think was a truly \nwonderful job. It takes a lot of hard work and they performed it so \nvery, very well, whether in the minority or majority. I think we all \nrecognize that while we have fractious debates from time to time, our \nstaffs do a particularly outstanding job in working together.\n  Senators on this side of the aisle are certainly most grateful for \nthe contribution of our minority staff and also the important role and \nrelationship we have had with the Senators on that side, headed by my \ngood friend, Senator Domenici, and his excellent staff. I guess few \nrealize the truly monumental task and the intricate time demands and \nthe details--the daunting task, if you will, of budgeting. It was much \ntougher this year than it was in previous years, when we were obviously \nmore restrained about our expenditures.\n  I want to take a moment if I can, then, just to run through some \nnames here that I shall be forever indebted to. I think the Senate will \nbe as a whole. The American people should know it was an able staff \nheaded by my chief of staff, Bill Dauster, whom everyone recognizes is \none of the true experts on our budget. I thank Bill for all he has \ndone. And the excellent staff he has assembled to work with.\n  I want to thank: deputy chief of staff Jerry Slominski; analyst for \nTransportation and Justice Andy Blocker; analyst for Veterans and \nCommerce Kelly Dimock; special assistant to the ranking member Tony \nDresden; analyst for government, community and regional development Meg \nDuncan; general counsel Jodi Grant; senior analyst for Energy and \nenvironment Matt Greenwald; LBJ fellow Nancy Harris; senior analyst for \nincome security, social security and Medicaid Joan Huffer; chief \neconomist Jim Klumpner; staff assistant Nell Mays; director of budget \nreview and analysis and analyst for Mecdicare Sue Nelson; presidential \nmanagement intern Susan Ross; and assistant director for revenue and \nnatural resources David Williams,\n and the others who played key roles in our budget staff.\n\n  Mr. President, let me take a few minutes, if I can, to sum up the \nfeelings this Senator has after a lot of work and effort by a lot of \npeople.\n  I come down to the final debate on the 1996 budget resolution with a \nlot of thoughts and with a lot of appreciation for all the help I have \nhad. I was just thinking the other day, though, that this will be my \n17th budget that I have debated in the U.S. Senate. I voted for some \ngood, creditable budgets, like the one in 1993 that provided nearly \n$500 billion in deficit reduction. I voted against others that I \nbelieved were fiscally unsound and were not in the best interests\n of our great Nation. Each of those budgets was important, but perhaps \nnone as important as this one at this particular time.\n\n  As Nebraska draws me closer to home, I think more about the country I \nwant to leave my fellow citizens. I think about their day-to-day \nstruggle for a better life. I think about their grandchildren and the \nuncertainties they face, I think about how I want to leave them a \ncountry with shoulders broad enough to build a family and a future on.\n  This Republican budget may convey that legacy to some, but not to \nthis fiscally conservative Nebraskan. It is a budget that makes a \ndevil's bargain over tax cuts at a time when we should be appealing to \nour better angels. We should make sure we balance the budget before we \nmake a real or phony commitment to the politically popular promise of a \ntax cut.\n  It is a budget that takes away unfairly from our seniors, children, \nand least fortunate, but disproportionately and unfairly lines the \npockets of the wealthiest among us.\n  It is a budget that keeps the most affluent fling first class, but \nputs rural America in a tail spin.\n  It is a budget that turns a blind eye to working Americans who play \nby the rules.\n  In the final analysis, it is a budget I cannot support.\n  I know what a tough task my good friend, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, has had. I salute him for the masterful job he has done. And \nhe has my condolences for the job that lies ahead that will require the \nwisdom of Solomon and the patience of Job.\n  We may disagree on the shape of this budget. But the Senator from New \nMexico and I truly believe, both of us, in balancing the budget. For \nus, and many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this is not \nan abstraction. We want to make a decisive attack on our country's \nbudget crisis.\n  I wanted a bipartisan balanced budget where all of us would share, \nand share equally, in the painful decisions and sacrifices that are \nnecessary to bring the budget into balance. I wanted a balanced budget \nthat was driven by fairness.\n  On many occasions, before and during this debate, I offered the olive \nbranch to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. In spite of the \nheated rhetoric, I thought that cooler heads could prevail. I offered \ncompromise and reason. I offered unity instead of division. I though we \ncould fine tune this budget and redistribute the cuts within its \nframework. I thought that we could work together to produce a balanced \nbudget that most Republicans and Democrats could support.\n  But the past 50 hours have proven me wrong. The Republicans froze us \nout of the process, basically. We were persona non grata as far as they \nwere concerned. I didn't expect my Republican colleagues to accept all \nof our amendments. But they did not give serious consideration to \nbarely any of the constructive and reasonable amendments we offered. \nAnd none, and I repeat none of the amendments I supported would have \nkept us from balancing the budget by the year 2002, which is the \ncentral element, I think in the plan offered by the majority.\n  The Republican majority put a fence around their budget. We were \nblocked at every turn. We were rebuffed on each critical amendment. It \nwas ``No'' to softening cuts on Medicare. It was ``No'' to the earned \nincome tax credit. It was ``No'' to education. It was ``No'' to rural \nAmerica. It was ``No'' to fairness. It was ``No'' to shared sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, this is not a budget for all seasons, and is certainly \nlacking in reason. This is not a budget for all Americans. This is not \na budget of shared sacrifices. This is not a budget on which our fellow \ncitizens in Nebraska, or elsewhere can build a better life. This is a \nbudget that I cannot support.\n  Where do we go from here? To something workable and more \nconstructive? Given the budget presented us by the House, and this one \nconcocted in the Senate, we go to conference with little hope of a \nfinal budget that will have any semblance of bipartisan support.\n  It follows that the reconciliation bill and the appropriations \nmeasures will be so bound in advance by this unworkable budget that the \nend product will also be devoid of any real semblance of bipartisan \nsupport.\n  There are those who seemingly have reveled in the charges that the \nPresident is ``irrelevant'' in the budget considerations. They will \nfind out how ``irrelevant'' he really is should he veto--and, in my \nopinion, properly so--the end product of all of this partisanship.\n  Beginning now, and up to the point of a possible veto, I will be \nworking with my President and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto attempt to fashion a workable bipartisan compromise that will not be \npainless, but will be fair to all Americans and, most importantly, to \nAmerica.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a few Senators who requested \ntime. Maybe I will do that before I give my closing remarks. Senator \nGramm asked for some time, and I will give him 2 minutes. Senator Robb, \nwho is not here, asked for 2 minutes, and I am going to give him 2 \nminutes. And Senator Nunn asked for 3 minutes; I am going to give him \ntime. Then I will get back to my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair. [[Page S7446]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized to speak \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there are many things to praise in this \nbudget, and I want to begin by praising the man who made it happen, and \nhis name is Pete Domenici.\n  I think he has provided great leadership in the Senate, and given the \nnumbers we had to work with, given the disposition of our Members, I do \nnot think anybody can have anything to say about Pete Domenici other \nthan to give him the credit he is due.\n  But I want all my colleagues to understand exactly where we are as we \npass this budget. With the adoption of the Snowe amendment, this budget \nnow before the Senate spends $184 billion over the 7-year period, more \non nondefense programs than the budget that was adopted in the House. \nThat is $184 billion worth of additional nondefense program spending \nthat is going to have to be taken out in conference, if we are going to \nhave any opportunity to have a real cut in taxes for working families, \nand if we are going to have any real opportunity to provide incentives \nfor growth.\n  I want my colleagues to know that I am going to vote for this budget. \nI want to urge every person in the Senate who wants to balance the \nFederal budget to vote for this budget, and I hope we get a sound vote.\n  But I want my colleagues to understand that unless we cut this \nexcessive spending out, unless we let working families keep more of \nwhat they earn, unless we provide incentives for growth, and unless we \nbalance the budget while doing those things in the final product that \nwill come out of the House Senate conference, I am not going to vote \nfor that budget. I believe we can do these things.\n  Our House colleagues have shown us that it can be done. And I am \nhopeful, when we go to conference with the House, that we will look at \nour mandate from the election, we will look at what our colleagues in \nthe House did, we will take heart and leadership from them, and that we \nwill come back with a budget that is balanced over a 7-year period, \nthat lets working families keep more of what they earn, and that \nprovides incentives for people to work, save, and invest. That is what \nI favor.\n  I believe that is what the American people favor. And by passing this \nbudget today, we have an opportunity to begin to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Nunn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, first I want to commend my friend from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, and my friend from Nebraska, Senator Exon, \nfor handling the management of this bill under very difficult \ncircumstances. I have been in that place many times, and I know how \ndifficult it is and what a challenge it is.\n  Second, I would like to commend the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, for real leadership in putting on the table for all of us to \nboth contemplate, vote on, and study in the future, and the American \npeople to contemplate, all the untouchables that have not been in \nbudget resolutions before.\n  This is first time that I have seen all elements of spending on the \ntable except Social Security. It is my view that will have to be on the \ntable at some point in the future. But that one is not on the table \ntoday.\n  I disagree with a number of the priorities in this resolution, and I \nhave voted differently from my friend from New Mexico on a number of \namendments because I do believe that we have not earned any tax \ndividend at this point. I do not believe we ought to have a tax \ndividend until we really get the budget under control. I think that is \nessential, and that is a priority. And I think that is what the \nAmerican people want.\n  I think moving to reduce taxes before we get spending under control, \nand before we really earn the dividend, is kind of like going on the \nwagon by starting off chug-a-lugging a bottle of whiskey. I do not \nthink that is the way to proceed. However, having said that, I do think \nthis budget is in the right direction. I think it moves in the right \ndirection.\n  I am going to vote for it for that reason, because it does move in \nthe right direction. And moving in the right direction in terms of \ntackling entitlements, in terms of restraining growth and spending in \nthose programs that have been clearly out of control, as difficult as \nthat is going to be to do, I think the direction is enormously \nimportant. It is important for our children. It is important for our \ngrandchildren. It is important for our economy. It is important to \nincrease savings, and thereby investment and productivity, and thereby \nthe real income of the American people over a period of time.\n  Finally, I think that this direction is enormously important for the \ncredibility of this Congress and the credibility of our Federal \nGovernment.\n  So I commend my friend from New Mexico for real leadership, and I \nwill vote for the final passage of this resolution.\n  Like the Senator from Texas, I will be watching the conference very \nclosely, perhaps from a slightly different perspective.\n  Mr. President, again, I rise today to announce my support for the \nfiscal year 1996 budget resolution. I commend my good friends, Senator \nPete Domenici and Senator Jim Exon, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, for their floor management of this bill. \nHaving been a member of the Senate Budget Committee and having worked \nwith Senator Domenici on a 10-year balanced budget plan in our Center \nfor Strategic and International Studies [CSIS] ``Strengthening of \nAmerica Commission,'' I know how daunting a task it is to produce a \nplan to reach a balanced unified budget by 2002. I know that my friend \nPete Domenici had to make many difficult decisions and fall back on \nmany of his own priorities to forge a majority coalition on this bill. \nThis type of leadership is often given sufficient recognition or \npraise.\n  I have followed this debate closely. This is a historic moment. This \nresolution marks the first time the Senate Budget Committee has \nreported a budget resolution that in my view deals with all the \nelements on the spending side of the budget that must be addressed to \nhave any hope of balancing the budget. I commend my friend from New \nMexico for the courage and the leadership he has exhibited in crafting \nthis resolution.\n  The most significant improvement over past attempts to balance the \nbudget is the Senate Budget Committee's inclusion of recommendations to \nrestrain significantly the projected growth of Federal mandatory or \nentitlement spending, which now represents 50 cents of every dollar the \nFederal Government spends.\n  For years, Congress and the executive branch have tried to achieve a \nbalanced budget by cutting the defense and domestic discretionary \nprograms that are appropriated by the Congress and signed by the \nPresident, and by raising taxes. At the same time these budget efforts \ntime after time allowed the mandatory or entitlement programs, which \nare on autopilot, to grow faster than inflation, faster than \ndiscretionary programs were being cut, and faster than taxes could be \nraised.\n  In the 1990 budget summit, half the savings came from cutting the \ndefense budget. While large defense savings were possible due to the \nend of the cold war--and those savings which were made are still \ncontributing to deficit reduction today--that kind of historic \nopportunity is a one-shot deal. That agreement predictably did not \nbalance the budget because defense represented at that time 24 percent \nof the overall budget. As a result of that agreement, defense is only \n18 percent of the budget today, and under this resolution it will fall \nto 14 percent by the end of the century.\n  Over half the deficit reduction in the 1993 reconciliation bill came \nfrom tax increases. Once again, reductions in the growth of \nentitlements contributed only a small portion of the deficit reduction. \nTax increases and defense cuts will never balance the budget as long as \nthe entitlement programs remain unrestrained.\n  These previous attempts, because they failed to address the largest \nand fastest growing part of the budget, were virtually doomed to fail. \nIn my mind, our previous attempts to balance [[Page S7447]] the budget \nwithout seriously addressing the out of control growth of spending in \nentitlement programs were analogous to Bonnie and Clyde robbing parking \nmeters.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution finally goes where the money \nis. Fifty percent of the deficit reduction in this plan comes from \nreducing the projected growth in spending--not the actual spending \nlevels--in entitlement programs. Compared to CBO's baseline \nprojections, it provides spending reductions totaling $1.3 trillion \nover the 7-year period ending in 2002. These reductions are achieved \nthrough reductions in two principal areas: entitlements and nondefense \ndiscretionary programs.\n  This resolution recommends that entitlement spending growth be \nreduced by $650 billion, that nondefense discretionary spending be \nreduced $350 billion, and defense will be reduced by another $100 \nbillion below CBO's baseline. Due to these reduced Federal \nexpenditures, it is estimated that interest payments on the debt will \nbe lessened by $200 billion.\n  Mr. President, over the last few days, many of my colleagues have \nattempted to amend the resolution to correct what they believed to be \nflaws in this proposal. I share many of their concerns, and, if I had \nmy way, I would make a number of changes, including:\n  First, holding the defense budget stable over this period rather than \nhaving it continue to decline as called for in both this resolution and \nPresident Clinton's budget;\n  Second, setting a goal of balancing the budget without using the \nsurpluses from the Social Security Trust Fund, even if it takes 10 \nyears rather than 7.\n  Third, reducing some of the cuts from projected growth in the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs to make the required reforms more \nachievable and sustainable;\n  Fourth, reducing the proposed cuts in Federal education programs to \nacknowledge that human capital is our most precious resource;\n  Fifth, restoring some of the proposed reductions in the Earned Income \nTax Credit, which is essential in helping low-income working people and \nin making work more attractive than welfare;\n  Sixth, mitigating to some extent the proposed cuts to agriculture and \nveterans programs; and\n  Seventh, keeping the National Service program alive and viable. This \nprogram is proving to be both an important and efficient way of \ndelivering human services, and it is also serving as a catalyst for \ncommunity service by thousands of American young people.\n   Mr. President, I will continue to fight to address these priorities \nas this process continues and we debate the specific details in the \nreconciliation legislation that will carry out this plan. I also \nbelieve that tax expenditures should not be exempt from review as we \nlegislate in the summer and fall. Balancing the budget requires shared \nsacrifice, and as we cut spending we should also review revenue-losing \ntax breaks which may not be justified. For these reasons I supported \nthe Conrad alternative to the Committee-reported budget resolution.\n  Notwithstanding these reservations, I will vote for the Domenici \nbudget resolution. We will debate the details for months to come, and \nwe could vote and debate forever in search of a perfect solution, but \nthe general direction required is clear. If there was an easy way to \nbalance the budget without cutting spending on popular programs, we \nwould have done it long ago. But that is simply not possible. This plan \ngives the American people a realistic look at what it takes to balance \nthe budget with spending cuts alone.\n  I believe this resolution points us in the right direction. Mr. \nPresident, most of this debate has focused on specific elements of this \nplan, but what sometimes gets lost in the debate is the fact that the \nstatus quo is not painless either--in fact it is not even sustainable. \nWe simply cannot continue to pile $200 to $300 billion in additional \ndebt each year on our children and grandchildren.\n  I also hope that I will also be able to support the conference \nreport, but that depends on its content. I consider the House's action \nin beginning a $1.2 trillion budget cutting exercise by reducing taxes \nby over $300 billion over 7 years to be fiscally irresponsible. I am \npleased that more than two-thirds of my colleagues voted to \noverwhelmingly defeat this tax cut in the Gramm amendment, which have \nmade the tax cuts contained in the House passed Contract With America \npart of this resolution. The House approach is like an alcoholic \npromising to go on the wagon right after gulping one last bottle of \nwhiskey.\n  In this resolution, there is a reserve fund that makes the fiscal \ndividend resulting from enactment of a balanced budget plan available \nfor tax cuts. This dividend was the focus of most of the proposed \namendments to this resolution. In my view, the Senate should have \nadopted the Feingold amendment, which would have applied that dividend \nto deficit reduction and given us a cushion that would allow us to \nbalance the budget even if the economy does not perform as well as CBO \nhas projected.\n  The budget resolution contains an invitation to use this fiscal \ndividend for tax reductions rather than applying it to deficit \nreduction. I oppose this part of the resolution and I voted against the \namendment which strengthened this invitation from may to shall. The \nSenate will address this question again before any such tax cut passes. \nIf the Senate is unwilling to apply this fiscal dividend to the deficit \nthen I prefer using the dividend to ease the most severe impacts of the \nspending reductions Medicare, education, and programs for low-income \nworking people, rather than for tax cuts. My votes on several \namendments reflect this. But my first choice was to take a more \nconservative approach by applying the fiscal dividend to deficit \nreduction as proposed by the fiscally responsible path in the Feingold \namendment.\n  This budget resolution is tough medicine, and it will be very \ndifficult to carry out some of the reductions called for. I suspect the \nreductions in the growth rate of spending in Medicaid and Medicare, \neducation, agriculture and other areas that are required if we are to \nbalance the budget will generate more and more opposition from \nsubstantial segments of America before the cuts are passed by Congress, \nand certainly before they are fully implemented. There is also a \nprobability that in cutting projected spending by over $1 trillion \ndollars in a 7-year period Congress will inadvertently make some \nserious errors which will have to be corrected. For these reasons, I \nbelieve that reducing taxes by the amount produced in the fiscal \ndividend would be inequitable and premature until the spending cuts and \nrestraints have been locked in.\n  I would remind all of my colleagues who believe, as I do, that we \nshould be balancing the budget without using the Social Security \nsurplus, that leaving the fiscal dividend alone and applying it to \ndeficit reduction, as we would have done if the Feingold amendment had \nbeen adopted, would also help move us toward the goal of a real \nbalanced budget. Balancing only the unified budget by continuing to \nborrow the Social Security surplus simply postpones the day of pain \nwhen the general fund must repay the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  The budget resolution before us balances the budget in 2002, \nincluding the Social Security surplus. But without that surplus, the \ndeficit in 2002 would still be about $100 billion. While the exact size \nof the fiscal dividend would depend on what savings and enforcement \nprovisions were enacted in a reconciliation bill, CBO's previous \nestimate of the fiscal dividend in 2002 was about $50 billion. If we \nhad applied that to deficit reduction, we could have cut the deficit in \n2002, excluding Social Security, in half, from about $100 billion to \n$50 billion.\n  Today, the general fund already owes the Social Security Trust Fund \n$500 billion. By 2002, when we finally get the budget back in balance \nincluding using these Social Security surpluses, the general fund will \nowe the Social Security Trust Fund $1.1 trillion. When the baby boom \ngeneration starts retiring around the year 2015, just 20 years from \ntoday, we will owe the Social Security trust fund about $3 trillion.\n  We all know that Congress and the President have to face up to the \nSocial Security problem. We all know the Social Security system is not \ngoing to be the same for those who are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s today \nas it is for people who are already retired and receiving \n[[Page S7448]] Social Security benefits today. It cannot be. And the \nlonger we avoid facing up to that problem, the worse the problem is \ngoing to be. Balancing the budget without the continued use of the \nSocial Security surplus to finance other Government spending is an \nabsolute necessary first step in that effort. Unfortunately, this \nbudget resolution does not meet that test or even have that goal.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to congratulate Senator Domenici \nfor his leadership on this budget resolution. This budget resolution is \nbut the first step of a long and difficult journey, but we are headed \nin the right direction--the direction that will bring our budget into \nbalance.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague.\n  I want to say that, as I look at the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Nebraska, I want to say my friend from New Mexico, the \nchairman of the committee, if I could get his attention, that I think \nthe Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Nebraska really are a \nmodel for this U.S. Senate. You can disagree without being \ndisagreeable. I think we have had a tough and important debate, and I \ncongratulate both of them on it.\n  I want to say that, from my perspective as a Senator from California \nwho ran because I wanted to fight for the people of California, that \nthis budget as it comes before us now is the broadest retreat on the \nAmerican dream that I have ever seen in my time as an adult.\n  I will say that we tried to change this budget. We at every chance \nsaid that the tax cuts should go to the middle class, not to the \nwealthy. We offered broad restorations to education. We tried to make \nthis better. We tried to ease the pain on the seniors, on the students. \nAnd I say to my friends on both sides of the aisle that if ever we were \nhere to fight for anyone, should it not be the children? Should it not \nbe the elderly? Should it not be the hard-working middle-class families \nwho will have a tax increase, those who earn $28,000 a year and less?\n  So this budget turns its back on those people while maintaining tax \nloopholes, keeping military spending harmless and, frankly again, \nretreating from the American dream that I was so fortunate to be a part \nof in my lifetime.\n  I hope as this process continues we will have enough votes to turn \nback some of these priorities. I hope we will bring common sense to the \ndebate in the days that lie ahead.\n  I will be voting against this budget. If it does anything, it shows \nthe difference between the parties. I think that is good for this \ncountry, to see the differences between the parties.\n  I wish to thank my colleague and again the committee chairman for \nworking with me, although we have disagreed many times. I think the \nstaff on both sides have just been extraordinary as well as the \nchairman and the ranking member.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator D'Amato from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am proud to support this budget. \nSenator Domenici and the Budget Committee deserve to be commended. \nSenator Domenici's plan, for the first time, meets what the American \npeople have been asking for--responsible and courageous leadership.\n  It is not easy to balance the budget. It is not easy to cut those \nprograms, yes, that the people want and get used to. It is not easy to \ntackle Medicare. But let me tell you something. We were not elected and \nsent here to do things the easy way. That program will be bankrupt. We \nowe it to today's seniors and those in the future to protect it, \npreserve it, to strengthen it. We owe it to our children in the future \nto give them the opportunities we have had. Unless we achieve a \nbalanced budget and cut spending, that will not be the legacy we leave \nto them.\n  There are those who preach fear and divisiveness. I have heard talk \nalready about how this is going to help the wealthy. It seems to me, \nwhen we balance the budget and reduce interest costs that make it \npossible for people to have jobs and opportunity, we are helping \nAmerica.\n  I do not believe that the administration or my Democratic friends for \nthe most part have given the kind of leadership that this Nation needs. \nCriticize, create fear, create doubt, turn their backs on their own \nreports, a report that this administration came down with, which \nindicated that Medicare would run out of funds within the next 6 or 7 \nyears.\n  We have an obligation to move boldly. We are. It is the right time, \nand it is about time, and I hope we can pass this budget \noverwhelmingly. I support it.\n  I commend Senator Domenici and all who have worked with him to bring \nus to this point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from New York. I yield 2 minutes to \nSenator Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Robb would like 2 minutes on my time.\n  I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Mexico will yield 2 \nminutes, I would be very pleased.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Budget Committee for their leadership and \nthe long, hard work that brought us to this particular point.\n  If this were a budget and not a budget resolution, Mr. President, I \nmight take a different course of action. I happen to believe that most \nof the choices, most of the priorities that we establish in terms of \nguidelines as to how we get to our destination are not the priorities \nthat I would embrace and, indeed, I have voted with my Democratic \ncolleagues on a number of occasions to try to change those priorities. \nBut we did not prevail.\n  I believe that Republicans were wrong in 1993, when they felt as \nstrongly as they did about deficit reduction, not to try to assist \nPresident Clinton and Democrats. And feeling as strongly as I do about \nthe importance of deficit reduction, I believe it would be wrong for me \nnot to assist with the heavy lifting.\n  Mr. President, the lifting is going to be very, very heavy. I do not \nthink many of the Members who may be fully supportive of this \nresolution have considered all of the implications that are ultimately \ngoing to have to be considered when making the tough individual choices \nabout cutting specific programs or cutting tax expenditures, raising \nrevenues, whatever the case may be. But I am prepared to assist in that \neffort. I think it is important that, to the extent we can, we engage \nin this most important task on a bipartisan basis.\n  So, Mr. President, I will be pleased to vote for this resolution, \nnotwithstanding significant differences with respect to the \ndistribution of the burden and the pain and a very significant \ndifference with respect to whether or not we ought to have any tax cuts \nin this measure at this time.\n  Nonetheless, I applaud the leadership for moving us to this point, \nfor setting a very clear and important goal. I am embracing the \ndestination and not the road as to how we get there, and I am going to \nwork to try to make some course directions as we move down that road.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the ranking member as well \nas the chairman of the Budget Committee for their hard work, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for the remarks. And I thank the \nSenator for the support with the vote today.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have no ill will at all toward some of the \nDemocrats, some of my closest friends and associates, but I have tried \nto conduct this matter with a sense of dedication but still in good \nhumor. I just want to say that if there are any Republicans who wish to \nvote against the budget, I will be glad to yield them time if they come \nto the Senate as quickly as possible. [[Page S7449]] \n  I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I regret to tell the Senator he will have to do it all \nhimself.\n  Mr. EXON. I so anticipated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution marks \nthe beginning of the end of an era. There can be no avoiding of the \nfact that the resolution in many ways lays out a plan for the effective \ndismantlement of progressive government as we have come to know and \nbenefit from for half a century.\n  This I believe is a lamentable turn of events in my view, all the \nmore so because I believe we could bring the Federal budget under \ncontrol by less extreme and less destructive means.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1961, the political climate was keyed to \nnational circumstances far different from those prevailing today. Most \nof us had vivid memories, first, of the era of active, interventionist \ngovernment that resulted from the economic stresses of the 1930's; and \nsecond, of the dominant role of the Federal Government in the \nsuccessful prosecution of our role in World War II, a role which was to \ncontinue through the cold war era.\n  From that basis of a dominant Federal role in opposition to foreign \ntyranny, there was a natural evolution to the historic role of the \nFederal Government in greatly expanding our national commitment to \nsocial justice at home. This found expression in the civil rights \nrevolution of the 1960's, and in a host of other fields, including \nhealth, education, welfare, occupational safety, and environmental \nprotection to name only a few.\n  To be sure, there were excesses and mistakes that were committed in \nthe name of an activist central government, and their elimination is \none of the benefits of the current swing of the pendulum of history \nback in the direction of less government and less intervention.\n  But as one who has been privileged to serve here during this \nremarkable cycle, I want to record the view that there is much that we \nhave done over the past four decades that has made our country a better \nplace, and those accomplishments should not be rejected in a willy-\nnilly rush to diminish the role of government.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution lays the groundwork for just \nsuch an evisceration of progressive government and I, therefore, cannot \nsupport it.\n  I am appalled at the implications of drastic cuts in the\n   international affairs account, presaging a trend to isolationism and \nwithdrawal from a half century of activist leadership in world affairs. \nThis resolution envisions a progressive phasing back of assessed \ncontributions for United Nations peacekeeping, as well as drastic cuts \nin foreign aid. These are radical and regressive changes and I reject \nthem.\n\n  I am likewise dismayed at the assumed reduction in Federal spending \nfor education by as much as $32 billion over 7 years. This would place \nat risk or threaten curtailment of a number of worthy programs which \nhave evolved over the past 30 years to assert a Federal interest in \nthis most basic area of public investment. So these cuts too are not \nacceptable.\n  I deeply regret also the assumptions underlying this resolution which \nwould curtail the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, and AMTRAK, while at the same time \nthreatening to turn back the clock of post-Watergate reform by \nabolishing the Presidential campaign financing system. I hope the \nSenate amendment restoring the funding for this system will prevail.\n  These are but a few of the programs now in jeopardy in which I have a \nspecial interest. In combination with other provisions which likewise \ncancel out or curtail major elements of the Federal commitment to \nsocial justice--provisions such as the Medicare cutbacks and the cut in \nfunding for the earned income tax credit--they serve to demonstrate how \nnegative and regressive this resolution truly is.\n  The pity is, Mr. President, that much of this programmatic slaughter \nmay be needless. The fact is that it was ordained by a commitment to \nsuspect goals which were dictated by political expediency rather than \nnational selection, namely, the idea that the Federal budget must be \nbrought into exact balance, and the corollary idea that it must be \nbrought into balance in the arbitrary time frame of 7 years.\n  With all due respect to the leadership of my own party, I must simply \nsay that in my view these goals are specious and should not be the \ndriving force for this sweeping revision of Federal policy.\n  When I opposed the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nearlier this year, I took the position that the Federal budget is not \nsupposed to be in perpetual balance, but that, as John Maynard Keynes \nwisely noted, it should remain a flexible\n instrument of national economic policy, registering a surplus in good \ntimes and engaging in stimulative spending in downtimes.\n\n  The resolution before us puts us on an inflexible course, both in \nterms of achieving absolute balance and doing so by a date certain. It \nmakes no allowance for all of the unforeseen contingencies, including \nnatural disasters, international emergencies, or economic recessions, \nthat might require us at some point in the next 7 years, to engage in \nunexpected spending and thus not meet the goal so confidently embraced.\n  And even if the magical goal were somehow to be reached, there is a \nrespectable body of opinion that warns that the deliberate withdrawal \nof $1.3 trillion in Federal spending in the arbitrary timeframe of 7 \nyears could wreak havoc with the economy.\n  It seems to me that the far wiser course would be to continue a \nvigorous but more reasoned program of deficit reduction that would not \nrule out revenue increases and certainly would not exempt defense from \nfurther budget cuts. I would generally avoid tax cuts, although I must \nsay that I continue to believe that a more liberal treatment of capital \ngains would have a beneficial effect in promoting economic growth.\n  Further, it seems to me that we ought to substitute flexible and \nrational measures of deficit control for the arbitrary goals which I \nbelieve have been too hastily accepted as a basis for a wholesale \nchange of approach of Government. One useful measure is the ratio \nbetween the annual deficit and gross domestic product. Just as any \nprudent household should limit debt in proportion to income, it would \nmake sense for the Federal Government to do likewise with respect to \nits annual deficit.\n  For the present, we must act on the basis of goals and assumptions \nthat, while widely accepted, may not be valid. To my mind, the budget \nresolution takes us in the wrong direction and does so for the wrong \nreasons. I hope the time will come when others will see the matter in \nthe same light.\n OPPOSITION TO CHANGES IN THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT--A TAX INCREASE \n                          ON WORKING FAMILIES\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe proposed cut in the earned income tax credit [EITC].\n  The other day I spoke about this budget, its attacks on Medicare and \nhow it affects senior citizens and their families. Today, I rise to \nspeak about how the reduction in the earned income tax credit will \naffect their families and their children.\n  Today, I want to speak about how this is also a fight for the \nchildren and grandchildren of the senior citizens who are hit by cuts \nin Medicare.\n  In 1993 we dramatically increased the earned income tax credit, which \ncut taxes for middle and lower income families.\n  We cut taxes for parents working hard to stay out of poverty and off \nwelfare. The first step to welfare reform is to make work pay. The EITC \nhelps us to make work pay.\n  If this budget resolution passes we will increase taxes on millions \nof working parents. What do we say to these mothers and fathers? What \ndo we say to any working family making less than $28,000 a year?\n  Who is affected? A mother who makes ends meet by waiting on tables. A \nmother who counts on every tip, every nickel and quarter left on the \nlunch counter. A mother who can make ends meet because of the earned \nincome tax credit. [[Page S7450]] \n  A father who lost a good-paying factory job and lost a piece of the \nAmerican dream. A father who works a second job just to support his \nchildren, but still makes less than $28,000.\n  This budget cuts taxes for the wealthy by taking $21 billion from the \nEITC and the families who use it. This budget cut will hit over 12 \nmillion taxpayers, 199,000 in Maryland alone. For those Marylanders \nmaking $28,000, they will pay $1,500 in taxes if the EITC is cut.\n  This is not welfare reform. We cannot tell people to get off welfare \nand then cut what they will get in a paying job, and cut their \nMedicaid.\n  We cannot tell a mother on welfare to take a low-paying job that will \nbe even lower paying if we cut this program. We must reward people who \nwork.\n  It is time that we returned to the bipartisan spirit of this tax \nbreak. Let us return to the support that had President Reagan praise \nthe EITC as, ``the best antipoverty and pro-family'' measure to ever \ncome out of Congress.\n  When I spoke the other day on another occasion, I reminded the \naudience of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and how she explained that \nthis is ``no ordinary time.'' This is no ordinary time. It is a time to \nfight for these families who have worked hard and have earned a break.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I reluctantly voted against the budget \nresolution, but I believe it does represent a serious, and significant \nstatement on my highest priority: deficit reduction.\n  My own 82-point plan reduces the deficit further and faster than this \nbudget resolution does, and I cosponsored and voted for an alternative \non the floor of the Senate that reduces the deficit more and achieves \ntrue balance sooner than the budget resolution. Nevertheless, the \nbudget resolution does achieve significant deficit reduction, and if \nnothing else, it clearly demonstrates that we do not need to change our \nConstitution in order to balance the Federal books.\n  The purpose of a budget resolution is to establish the boundaries \nwithin which we formulate the details of the Federal budget. The most \nsignificant flaw in this resolution is that those boundaries \neffectively preclude us from going after three sacred cows: tax cuts, \ntax loopholes, and the defense budget.\n  If those three areas had been left on the table, we could have taken \na much more balanced approach to deficit reduction, lessening the \nseverity of the cuts to those on Medicare and Medicaid, farmers, \nstudents, veterans, and others, while also eliminating the deficit by \nthe year 2000, not 2002 or 2004 or 2008.\n  There were some bright points to the resolution. One important \nimprovement the Senate resolution makes to the one passed by the House \nis the elimination of what has been called the crown jewel of the \nContract With America: the fiscally irresponsible $350 billion tax cut. \nIn a resounding, bipartisan vote of 69 to 31, the Senate rejected an \namendment to implement that reckless policy.\n  There are also a number of provisions assumed in the resolution that \nrightly slate outdated, wasteful, or low priority programs for cuts or \nelimination.\n  I was particularly pleased to see the Helium program terminated under \nthis budget resolution. I introduced legislation on the first day of \nthe 104th Congress to kill the national helium program, and this budget \nresolution is an important step in eliminating this vestige of the \n1920's.\n  Though the broad budget outlines established by this resolution are \nskewed, I very much hope we will approach the details of the budget \nwith the kind of bipartisan spirit demonstrated by the strong, \nbipartisan vote defeating the reckless House Republican tax cuts.\n  If the Senate takes that approach to the specific budget bills, and \nespecially the reconciliation legislation that will determine how cuts \nare made to Medicare and Medicaid, we may be able to fashion a sensible \nbudget that achieves the significant deficit reduction envisioned in \nthe resolution without harming the most vulnerable.\n                           amendment no. 1150\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep regret \nthat the amendment offered by Senators Roth and Lieberman seeking to \nprotect one of the last pristine wilderness areas of this Nation, the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge [ANWR], was defeated.\n  In 1980, the 96th Congress approved the Alaska National Interest Land \nConservation Act. This important law, which set aside over a million \nacres of Federal land for national parks, wildlife refuges, and other \nconservation areas, prohibited oil and gas development in 1.5 million \nacres of ANWR's coastal plain, leaving the fate of this land in the \nhands of future Congresses.\n  Since 1980, the Congress has vigorously and consistently expressed \nits opposition to oil and gas leasing in the biological heart of the \nArctic Refuge. This area on the coastal plain of ANWR, often referred \nto as the ``American Serengeti,'' is home to about 165 different \nspecies of animals. It is the calving ground for the Porcupine Caribou \nherd, the denning area for the Beaufort Sea polar bear population, and \nthe nesting habitat for a variety of waterfowl and shorebirds, \nincluding snow geese, tundra swans and black brant.\n  There is little doubt that extensive development of this sensitive \nwilderness area would have a negative impact on the vast wildlife \nresources located there. A 1987 report prepared by the Department of \nthe Interior and submitted to the Congress stated that oil development \nin ANWR would result in long-term changes in the wilderness \nenvironment, wildlife habitat, and Native subsistence hunting \nopportunities.\n  In my view, it is critical that we as a nation do not allow the \ndestruction of one of our last remaining unprotected ecosystems. The \nRepublican budget proposal recommends that the Federal Government lease \n8 percent of ANWR for oil and gas development. While this backdoor \nassault on the Arctic Refuge claims to affect only a small portion of \nthe wilderness area, oil development activity will affect the entire \ncoastal plain. In addition, the expectations for oil and gas finds are \nexcessive. The 1987 Interior Department report found there to be only a \none in five chance of finding an economically viable oil field on the \ncoastal plain.\n  Wilderness areas constitute only 2 percent of all land in the United \nStates. If we fail to protect the integrity of the Arctic Refuge now, \nits wealth of natural beauty and treasures will be lost to future \ngenerations. This is too precious a resource to squander.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1166\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment was submitted on behalf \nof myself, Senators Rockefeller, Murray, Harkin, Wellstone, Reid, \nDaschle, and Mikulski.\n  The Senate considered this amendment yesterday. Mr. President, this \namendment could not be more simple. It closes the ``Ex-Patriots'' \nbillionaires tax loophole and takes the money and restores some of the \ndrastic cuts in veterans programs contained in this resolution. I call \nthis amendment--take from ``ex-patriots and give to American \npatriots.''\n  This is the same amendment that I offered in committee. While this \namendment failed on a tie 11 to 11 vote, it did enjoy bi-partisan \nsupport. The distinguished junior Senator from Maine [Senator Snowe] \nvoted for my amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have now all heard about this so-called ``Benedict \nArnold'' tax loophole. This loophole allows billionaires and multi-\nmillionaires who have made their fortunes in this country to renounce \ntheir citizenship and avoid paying Federal taxes like estate taxes and \nflee to some Caribbean island with their money.\n  This is no minor loophole. It costs the Treasury more than $3 billion \nover 10 years. And as a recent story in Fortune Magazine showed, \nwealthy individuals deliberately look at using this loophole to avoid \npaying taxes.\n  My amendment will close this loophole. And it will take the proceeds \nand put them into restoring the massive cuts in veterans programs \ncontained in the Republican budget.\n  This Republican budget cuts discretionary spending on veterans \nprograms by a whopping $26 billion over the next 7 years. But this is \nonly discretionary spending on items like VA hospitals and outpatient \nclinics.\n  This budget also cuts veterans' entitlement programs by $10 billion \nover 7 years. That is a $36 billion slap in the face to our Nation's \nveterans.\n  What kind of reward is this for our Nation's veterans? Isn't it \nironic that [[Page S7451]] on the 50th anniversary of V-E Day, we are \ndestroying the VA system for those heros who saved us from Fascism?\n  The Republican budget will force cuts in veterans' pensions, payments \nto those with service-connected disabilities, the GI bill, and numerous \nother health and benefit programs.\n  My amendment will help alleviate some of these cuts. It will not \nrestore all of the funding but it will make a start in trying to \ncushion the coming blow.\n  Mr. President, the men and women who have put their lives on the line \nfor this country deserve better. They deserve to be treated with \nrespect.\n  Their benefits should not be cut while we are providing tax cuts for \nthe rich. The Republican budget represents the wrong priorities.\n  Mr. President, I want to deal with one issue up front. Republicans \nmay argue that we passed an amendment in the Budget Committee to close \nthe Benedict Arnold tax loophole.\n  The fact is we did not. We passed a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate \namendment concerning this issue. However, we did not change any numbers \nin the resolution to force the Finance Committee to in fact close this \nloophole.\n  So the Finance Committee can do as it wishes regarding this tax \nloophole. It will not be required to do this in any way. So if \nRepublican say that they already voted to get rid of the loophole, they \nare not shooting straight with the American people.\n  This amendment again poses the same question to the Senate as other \namendments. The question is, ``Whose side are you on?''\n  Are you on the side of billionaires who revoke their citizenship to \navoid paying taxes? Or are you on the side of our Nation's veterans--\nthe men and women who have fought for their country--who have laid \ntheir lives on the line to defend freedom?\n  I stand firmly with American Patriots not ex-patriots.\n  I hope my colleagues will do the same. The veterans of our country \ndeserve much better than the cuts contained in this Republican budget.\n  (The following statement was inadvertently omitted from the Record of \nMay 24, and appears here at the request of Mr. Rockefeller.\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 1166\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues, Senators \nLautenberg, Daschle, Mikulski, Wellstone, Murray, Harkin, and Reid, in \ncosponsoring an amendment to the budget resolution, Senate Concurrent \nResolution 13.\n  This amendment--known as the ``Ex-Patriots to Patriots'' amendment--\nwould assume the repeal of the tax loophole that enables U.S. citizens \nto renounce their citizenship to avoid paying U.S. taxes. This would \ngenerate $3.633 billion in revenues for the Treasury over 10 years, \nfrom 1995 to 2005. Our amendment would restore funds from this \nrevenue--$1.7 billion over the 7 years covered by the resolution--to \nFunction 700, veterans programs, so as to offset some of the $15.4 \nbillion in reductions contained in the budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, emigration and expatriation are fundamental rights of \nall Americans. They are guaranteed by the American Constitution and \ninternational human rights laws. Expatriation to avoid taxation is \npermitted by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n  We believe this provision in the Tax Code should be repealed for \nseveral reasons. First, it is unfair to all Americans who work hard \nevery day to support their families and who pay taxes to support their \ncountry. It offends our sense of justice that some of the wealthiest \nAmericans--who can afford to pay taxes, whose fortunes blossomed in the \nfreedom and bounty of our Nation--can take such a drastic measure to \navoid paying their fair share. Second, at a time when we are all \ncommitted to reducing the Federal deficit, the Treasury losses \nsignificant revenue because of the actions of the approximately 25 \nindividuals a year who choose expatriation to take advantage of this \ntax loophole. And finally, if these funds were available, they could be \ntargeted toward needed programs and services which are in jeopardy--and \nwhich benefit far more than 25 people.\n  Mr. President, the matter of this ``Ex-Patriots'' tax loophole has \ncome before the Senate earlier in this session of Congress and is on \nthe table again. We passed the ``Ex-Patriots'' provision as part of the \nsmall business health care deduction bill in March, but it was dropped \nin the House-Senate conference in April. Later, the Senate voted again \nto repeal this tax loophole, this time by a vote of 96-4 in a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. And on May 15, Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, \nas passed by the Budget Committee, does repeal this tax loophole for \nwealthy Americans. However, it does not go far enough, it does not \ntarget any of the revenue for veterans' programs.\n  On May 11, Senate Lautenberg wisely linked the two issues--repeal of \nthe expatriates' tax break and restoration and funding\n to America's true patriots--in Budget Committee action. The tie vote \nof 11-11 demonstrated the bipartisan support for changing the tax code \nand helping maintain veterans' programs. Our amendment links the repeal \nof the tax loophole for expatriates to the restoration of funds for \nAmerica's true patriots--her veterans. It does so because approximately \n$15 billion in reductions for veterans programs--including health care \nservices for service-connected veterans and poor veterans--are on the \nchopping block. As ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I believe the patriotism demonstrated by the men and \nwomen who have worn our country's uniform--those who put themselves in \nharm's way, those whose lives have been irrevocably changed by injuries \nsustained in the line of duty, those who lost comrades in the heat of \nbattle--speaks for itself. The repeal of the expatriates' tax loophole \nmakes sense, and our veterans deserve no less.\n\n  Let us remember once again, in this 50th anniversary year of the end \nof World War II, the persons who enlisted in service to their country \nwhen tyranny threatened to obliterate peace and prosperity for \ngenerations to come. Science fiction writers and filmmakers have \nconjured up images of the unimaginable--what the world would have been \nlike had our soldiers and sailors not made the world safe for \ndemocracy, safe for their children and grandchildren. Thankfully, many \nof these men and women are alive and well. But while many have their \nmemories, their honor, and their dignity, they may not have their \nhealth or the material wealth with which to purchase the care they \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to understand some of the ways \nthe underlying budget resolution, as reported by the Budget Committee, \nwill affect the people who use the VA health care system. Under the \nresolution, VA would be forced to operate at a level below current \nservices. In human terms, almost 150,000 eligible veterans would be \ndenied inpatient and outpatient care in 1996 alone, and almost 1 \nmillion veterans would be denied care in 2002. In terms of VA's \ncapacity to provide a full range of health care services nationwide, \nthe equivalent of 5 VA hospitals would have to be shut down in 1996, \nand 35 VA hospitals would have to close their doors in 2002. In the \nfirst year of implementation, 8,200 VA health care professionals would \nlose their jobs, and by the end of this 7-year period, 53,000 VA \nmedical facility employees would lose theirs.\n  Another equally disturbing effect of the Budget Committee's action \nwould be the cut in VA research programs of $15 million and 142 FTEE. \nThis amounts to 10 percent of all VA research projects, or 150 fewer \nmedical research projects each year. VA research is geared toward some \nof the special illnesses and disabilities which affect veterans, among \nthem blindness,\n posttraumatic stress, and spinal cord injury. These and other subjects \nof VA research endeavors--everything from Alzheimer's disease to heart \ndisease to women's health--also benefit the general population by \nfinding the causes of disease and aiding in developing the best \ndiagnostic, treatment, and preventive methods. Today's research results \nare tomorrow's cures. By eliminating the opportunity for our Nation's \nmedical professionals--VA research is conducted by VA clinicians and \nresearchers and also by those from our Nation's medical schools which \nare affiliated with VA medical centers--we cut off a source of \nknowledge that is crucial to the health of our Nation's citizens.\n\n  Last, Mr. President, under the resolution, VA's construction program \nwould be affected beyond repair. In [[Page S7452]] fact, the program \nwould be decimated. This program, which upgrades and maintains VA's $25 \nbillion physical plant infrastructure, should cease to exist. All 200 \npending projects, totaling $3.4 billion, would have to be canceled. \nThese are not new projects, new hospitals, or new buildings. These are \nessential modernization projects. They are essential because 65 percent \nof VA medical centers, or 114 hospitals, are at least 30 years old. And \n73 percent of VA hospital, domiciliary, and nursing home beds, that is \nmore than 74,000 beds, do not comply with patient privacy standards. In \nthis day and age, no hospital should have more than two beds per room, \ncongregate bathing facilities, or inadequate space. If we suspend all \nwork on these projects, VA's plans to upgrade its patient environment \nwill never be realized.\n  Mr. President, because this amendment is budget neutral, there is \nevery reason why we should use these new funds to minimize the negative \nimpact on veterans' programs of the Budget Resolution. The link between \nthe two, thoughtfully and rightfully, proposed by Senator Lautenberg \nshould be adopted by the full Senate. It is within our power to do so, \nand it is the right to do. As ranking minority member of the Veterans \nAffairs Committee, I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  (The following statement was inadvertently omitted from the Record of \nMay 24, and appears here at the request of Ms. Mikulski.)\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1166\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Lautenberg and Rockefeller that would partially \nrestore funding for VA programs by closing the ex-patriot tax loophole.\n  The ex-patriot tax loophole is a provision of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 that allows billionaires to renounce their citizenship and \navoid paying Federal taxes. By closing this loophole, an additional \n$3.6 billion will be added to the Treasury between 1995 and 2005. I \nthink it is appropriate, Mr. President, that we apply the revenues \ngenerated by closing the ex-patriot loophole to help restore funding \nfor veterans programs.\n  In supporting the Lautenberg/Rockefeller amendment, I rise in defense \nof the GI Joe generation--the World War II generation--our fathers who \nfought on the battlefront overseas and our mothers who fought on the \nhomefront here in our communities.\n  Those wonderful Rosie the Riveters who kept the United States of \nAmerica running while the men fought for democracy around the world.\n  These are the women--the Rosies--who made sure that not only the \nschools and businesses operated, but that we built airplanes, mobilized \nour defenses.\n  Mr. President, these are the men who fought from the shores of \nNormandy to Iwo Jima. America's veterans fought to save Americans; they \nfought to save Western civilization; and they fought to save the very \nprinciples that this country was founded upon.\n  And when the war was over, the GI Joe generation went back home to \nraise their families and contribute to the greatest prosperity that \nthis country has ever known.\n  Mr. President, we would not be here as a nation today, we would not \nbe a superpower today, if it had not been for the GI Joe generation.\n  We just commemorated V-E Day. In a few months we will commemorate V-J \nDay and the end of World War II. And now, here we are on the eve of \nMemorial Day.\n  And, how are we remembering these gallant men and women? With our \nthanks, with our commitment, with our compassion?\n  No, Mr. President. With this budget resolution, we are telling the GI \nJoe generation that promises made are not promises kept. We are telling \nthese brave men and women that we intend to cut VA medical care by more \nthan $5.5 billion over the next 7 years.\n  What we are telling our mothers and our fathers is that we are going \nto close 35 VA medical centers and that we are canceling 200 medical \nconstruction projects needed to bring existing facilities up to current \nhealth delivery standards.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution will force the VA to eliminate \n53,000 full-time jobs including physicians, nurses, lab technicians, x-\nray technicians, and mental health counselors.\n  Treatment will be denied to over 1 million patients, including deep \nreductions in patient visits for primary care, acute medical and \npsychiatric care, treatment for the chronically mentally ill, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, cardiovascular disease, and extended care.\n  In addition, this budget resolution adds insult to the injury we \nwould inflict on our veterans. By forcing the elimination of almost \n1,000 VA jobs in benefit services, the VA claims backlog will increase \nfrom 500,000 to over 1 million claims. Having served on the front \nlines, we will now ask our veterans to stand in line for 2 to 4 years \nin order to receive their benefits.\n  Finally, this budget resolution would limit future benefits for \ndisabilities to those resulting directly from a veteran's performance \nof military duty, would phase in higher veteran prescription \ncopayments, and increase the amount a servicemember must contribute in \norder to be eligible for benefits under the Montgomery G.I. bill.\n  Mr. President, we have gone from the New Deal and the Fair Deal--to \nthe raw deal in this budget. I urge my colleagues to honor our veterans \nthis Memorial Day with more than parades, plaques, and platitudes. Let \nus honor the GI Joe generation with our gratitude and our commitment. \nLet us stand and fight for them, the way they fought for us.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Lautenberg-Rockefeller \namendment.\n                           amendment no. 1179\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate adopted an \namendment, numbered 1179, proposed by Senator Levin, to express the \nsense of the Senate that overhead expenses of defense agencies should \nbe reduced in fiscal year 1996 by at least 3 percent. I supported that \namendment.\n  With the serious and continuing decline in the defense budget, it is \nimperative that every defense dollar be spent wisely. Cutting back on \noverhead expenses by 3 percent, or even more, is necessary to ensure \nthat more of our scarce defense resources will be available for high-\npriority military requirements. Because the level of defense spending \nprovided in the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution is, in my view, \nseriously inadequate to meet our national security needs, I supported \nthe amendment to minimize low-priority and wasteful administrative \nexpenses of the Department of Defense and defense agencies.\n  However, because of the rather vague language of the amendment, there \nmay be some confusion as to its intent. Let me state my understanding \nof the content of the amendment.\n  The amendment merely expresses the sense of the Senate that \nunnecessary overhead costs be reduced by 3 percent this fiscal year. \nThe amendment makes no change whatsoever in the functional totals for \nNational Defense, function 050, nor does it reduce the total amount of \ndiscretionary spending available for defense in fiscal year 1996.\n  It is my understanding that, since the amendment did not explicitly \nreduce either the defense functional totals or the discretionary \nspending cap for defense, savings achievable by reducing overhead \nexpenses will remain available for defense programs. Certainly, this \nunderstanding was central to my support for the amendment.\n  I will work to reduce the overhead expenses of all defense agencies \nand departments, as I will do for all Federal agencies. Unnecessary \nexpenditures of taxpayer dollars, in whatever account, should be \neliminated. However, any savings from reduced overhead, in DOD may, \nunder this amendment, be reallocated to other defense programs. In my \nview, such savings must be used to fund force modernization, readiness, \nand quality of life programs which are inadequately funded under the \nClinton adminsitration defense budget proposals incorporated into this \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President. I cannot support Senate Concurrent \nResolution 13, the congressional budget resolution which has been \npresented to the Senate by the Republican majority. That budget \nproposal which the Senate will likely approve today, has been described \nby our Republican colleagues as balanced in the year 2002 although it \nwill not be. It relies heavily on surpluses in the Social Security \ntrust funds to achieve balance. In fact, in 2002, there will remain, \nunder the terms of the budget before us, a more [[Page S7453]] than \n$113 billion deficit, masked by the use of the Social Security trust \nfunds. This is one crucial reason that I supported the Conrad \nsubstitute which would have reduced the deficit even farther than the \nRepublican budget by 2002 and which is truly balanced, without the use \nof Social Security funds, by the year 2004.\n  The Republican proposed budget resolution before us is unbalanced in \nanother important way. The budget blueprint penalizes middle-income \nworking families, reduces our investment in education, and penalizes \nour senior citizens, in order to provide for a tax reduction which will \nbenefit mostly the wealthiest of Americans. The budget before us has \nits priorities wrong. It is simply a question of fairness.\n  The Conrad substitute and the Bradley substitute, each while not the \nbudget in every respect that I would have crafted, reflected a more \nequitable set of priorities than the Republican budget.\n  One of the most inequitable aspects of the Republican proposal before \nus is that to pay for tax cuts which will principally benefit the most \nwell off among us, it raises taxes on working families. The proposal to \ncut back the earned income tax credit for working families making less \nthan $28,000 per year would, for instance, raise taxes by $354 on a \nsingle parent with two children making only $8,840 a year. That is \nminimum wage.\n  The earned income tax credit has a long history of bipartisan \nsupport. President Reagan called the EITC, ``The best anti-poverty, the \nbest pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of the \nCongress.'' The EITC has played an important role in providing \nincentives to keep people working who are struggling to get on the \nlowest rungs of America's economic ladder and to stay off the welfare \nroles.\n  The budget resolution before us aims a $21 billion tax increase at \nthe working families. In Michigan, this means a $457 million tax hike \nover 7 years on nearly 316,000 hard-working taxpayers making less than \n$28,000 a year. Over the next 7 years, they will pay an average of \nnearly $1,500 more.\n  While working families making less than $28,000 pay more, there is no \neffort in this budget to control the growth of corporate tax \ndeductions, no effort to restrain the growing tax breaks for the \nlargest and wealthiest among us.\n  The Republican budget also hits our senior citizens very hard. \nMedicare would be cut by $256 billion, by far the largest Medicare cut \nin history. It is the most vulnerable who are hit hardest. Nearly 83 \npercent of Medicare benefits go to beneficiaries with incomes less than \n$25,000. Two-thirds are below $15,000. Only 3 percent go to individuals \nor couples with incomes in excess of $50,000.\n  I supported the Rockefeller amendment which would have restored $100 \nbillion for Medicare to the budget, without changing the target date \nfor a balanced budget, and without increasing the deficit, by cutting \nfunds the Republicans have earmarked for a tax cut for the wealthiest \namong us. The Rockefeller amendment was also defeated on a near party \nline vote.\n  Another $175 billion, under the Republican budget, is cut from \nMedicaid. Many people don't realize that 70 percent of Medicaid costs \nare long-term care for the elderly and the disabled. Many middle-income \nelderly wind up relying on Medicaid for nursing home and other care \nafter their resources are expended.\n  The Conrad substitute, which I supported, provided more funds for \nMedicare and Medicaid, reduced the deficit by more than the Republican \nbudget does by 2002, and would have balanced the budget honestly \nwithout using the Social Security trust fund to mask the real deficit.\n  Another way in which the Republican priorities are wrong is that in \norder to pay for a tax increase for the most well-off among us, they \nhave cut funding for college loans and educational improvement. This is \nperhaps the most short-sighted aspect of their budget proposal. \nInvestment in the education of our children is investment in America's \nfuture. There are few ways to better and more efficiently spend our \ndollars than educating America's future generations.\n  The Republican budget before us would increase college loan costs for \nfour million students each year, by eliminating the in-school interest \nsubsidy. The average student could pay $2,000-$3,000 more for his or \nher education and an additional 1 million college students could lose \ntheir financial aid or have their aid drastically reduced under the \nplan to freeze Pell grants.\n  I supported the Harkin-Hollings amendment which would have used funds \nwhich the Republicans have reserved for a tax cut for wealthier \nAmericans to restore $40 billion in funds for affordable student loans \nand for better schools. That amendment which was rejected on a near \nparty line vote would have provided the additional funding to invest in \nthe education of our children without adding to the deficit or changing \nthe target date for a balanced budget. The Conrad substitute which I \nalso supported would include more funding for education and would \nbalance the budget without using funds from the Social Security trust \nfund as the Republican budget does.\n  The majority also made clear their intentions when they rejected the \nBoxer amendment on Wednesday. That amendment, which I supported, would \nhave assured that any tax cut be targeted to middle-income people. The \nBoxer amendment was defeated on a near party line vote.\n  Mr. President, the issue before us is not whether the Federal budget \nshould be balanced in years ahead. The issue is how we do that. What \nare the priorities and who bears the burden. I believe that the \npriorities in the budget which our Republican colleagues have proposed \nare wrong. They place the burden squarely on the backs of the elderly, \nstudents in school, and working families, while cutting taxes for the \nmost well off. That budget is simply not fair. And, Mr. President, it \nfails to get the job done. It continues to use the Social Security \ntrust fund to hide the real deficit.\n  I have supported many amendments aimed at improving the budget \nresolution, making it more fair, without affecting the deficit \nreduction Virtually all were rejected by the Republican majority along \nnearly straight party lines. I cannot support the resolution before us.\n            the budget resolution and the agriculture budget\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like today to make a very \nsimple point. It is a point that I and other of my colleagues have been \nmaking over the course of recent weeks since the ``Chairman's Mark'' of \nthis fiscal year 1996 budget resolution was issued. My point is this. \nThe cuts to the agriculture category of spending in this budget \nresolution will cause significant harm--harm both to rural America and \nto low-income Americans throughout the country. That is why I have been \nvoting for a number of amendments to reduce the size of the cuts to \nagriculture spending in this resolution.\n  As my colleagues know, the resolution proposes dramatic cuts to the \nagriculture category of the Federal budget. It proposes cuts of $28 \nbillion over 5 years to the agriculture category, and suggests cuts of \n$45 billion over 7 years.\n  Mr. President, these cuts will seriously reduce farm income, and they \nwill damage our rural economy. They will drive down agricultural land \nvalues, and they will diminish conservation benefits that are important \nto our quality of life--both in the present and in the future. \nReductions of this magnitude will take from $380 to $400 million from \nfarmers in my State over just 5 years. Furthermore, if we pass cuts \nthis dramatic, we will devastate nutrition programs such as food \nstamps, the WIC Program, and the Child Adult Care Feeding Program.\n  Cuts to nutrition programs are contained in the same budget category \nas cuts to farm programs. As a result, it is clear that reductions as \ndrastic as those in this resolution--$28 billion over 5 years, to be \nfound by the Agriculture Committee--will pit struggling farmers against \nlow- and moderate-income families for increasingly scarce Federal \ndollars.\n  We all support Federal deficit reduction. Every farmer knows the \nvalue of lower interest rates, which would be one result of Federal \nfiscal responsibility. Indeed American agriculture and rural America \nhave contributed a heavy share to deficit reduction. They \n[[Page S7454]] will continue to do their share to reduce the deficit, \nand they will do so willingly.\n  But why must this budget impose the most pain on those for whom it \nwill be most difficult to bear? Why are we not cutting more unneeded \nmilitary and corporate-welfare spending? Why are we not eliminating \nlucrative tax breaks for special interests? Why are we, in fact, \nconsidering a tax cut for wealthy Americans? This resolution makes the \nwrong choices and takes our country in the wrong direction.\n  Mr. President, now is not the time to abandon rural America or the \nnutritional needs of struggling families. I share with the President \nand the Secretary of Agriculture a desire to have a real debate on a \nreal 1995 farm bill--not just a budget-cutting exercise. There are \nexciting prospects for rural America, and we are at a crucial historic \nmoment for the social and economic health of our rural communities. We \ncannot simply slash and burn in such an important area of Federal \npolicy and the Federal budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I pointed out in my remarks earlier this \nweek, this is not the first budget resolution to project a balanced \nbudget. In fact, it is the fifth budget resolution to do so. The budget \nresolutions of 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1991 also purported to balance the \nFederal budget. The latest of these prior budget resolutions, 1991, was \npassed by both Houses of Congress after the 1990 Budget Summit was \ncompleted. That budget resolution conference report (101-820) purported \nto balance the Federal budget over a five-year period without using the \nSocial Security surplus. In fact, for the fifth year of that budget \nresolution--fiscal year 1995--the 1991 budget resolution conference \nreport showed a surplus of $20.5 billion without using the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  As has been noted repeatedly during the debate on the pending budget \nresolution, it does not balance the budget even at the end of seven \nyears without using the Social Security surplus. In other words, the \nbudget resolution before the Senate purports to balance the Federal \nbudget in the year 2002 and, in fact, shows a surplus in that year of \n$1.3 billion, but only does so by using the Social Security surplus to \nmask the true deficit. The committee report on page 5 states that if \none does not use the Social Security surplus to mask the deficit, there \nwill in fact be a deficit of $113.5 billion in the year 2002.\n  As I also noted in my earlier remarks, all of the previous efforts to \nachieve a balanced Federal budget, while being undertaken based on the \nbest information available at the time of passage of the budget \nresolutions that purported to balance the budget, nevertheless failed \nto do so. This is because human beings cannot accurately predict the \nfuture and, therefore, cannot accurately project inflation, interest \nrates, revenues, etc., for a period of even one year, much less for a \nperiod of five years or seven years, as the pending budget resolution \nattempts to do.\n  Having said that, however, I again applaud the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, for his efforts to reduce the Federal \ndeficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next seven years.\n  I do not agree in a number of areas with the specific proposals \ncontained in the pending budget resolution. For example, the budget \nresolution proposed by the Budget Committee would not make any cuts in \nmilitary spending over the next seven years, but would cut non-military \ndiscretionary spending by $190 billion below a freeze, or $300 billion \nbelow the amounts contained in the President's budget. This amounts to \nan overall non-military discretionary spending cut of almost one-third. \nFurther, the existing hold-harmless provisions under the Budget \nEnforcement Act would be eliminated, thereby jeopardizing even the \nreduced funding levels for non-military discretionary spending \ncontained\n in the resolution. Additionally, emergency spending in the future, in \norder to be exempt from the discretionary caps, would require 60 votes \nin the Senate.\n\n  For these reasons, plus the fact that this resolution would take a \nso-called ``fiscal dividend'' of $170 billion and apply that phantom \ndividend toward a massive tax cut for the wealthy, I shall vote against \nthe pending budget resolution.\n  In doing so, however, I am not unaware of the fact that we must \ncontinue our efforts to achieve a balanced budget just as quickly as is \nprudently possible. But, we must do so in a way that is fair and in a \nway that does not negatively impact on the overall economy.\n  I believe that the alternative budget by the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Conrad] which I cosponsored, laid out a far superior \nblueprint for balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002 (if one \nuses the Social Security surplus to offset the deficit), and by 2004 \nwithout using the Social Security surplus.\n  Under the Conrad amendment, which I was pleased to co-sponsor and for \nwhich I voted, non-military discretionary spending would be frozen over \nseven years. This would have amounted to an increase of $190 billion \nabove the committee-reported budget resolution. Medicare would have \nbeen reduced by $156 billion, or $100 billion less than under the \ncommittee-reported resolution. No tax cut would have been provided for \nunder the Conrad amendment, rather $228 billion in additional revenues \nwould have been achieved through the closing or tax loopholes for the \nwealthy and big corporations. Four trillion dollars was projected to be \nspent on tax preferences over the next seven years. The Conrad \namendment would have limited the growth in such preferences by $228 \nbillion, or 5.7 percent. In other words, even under the Conrad \namendment, tax preferences would have still grown at the rate of \ninflation plus one percent.\n  For all of these reasons, the Conrad amendment was, in my view, a far \nmore rational, fair, and even-handed approach toward balancing the \nFederal budget. It would have removed many of the deficiencies in the \ncommittee-reported budget resolution by restoring funding for \ninvestments in the nation's future through discretionary spending on \nphysical and human infrastructure, and it would have been far less \ndevastating to the nation's elderly and those who could least afford to \ntake cuts necessary to balance the Federal budget. Rather, it required \nthose who are the wealthiest in our nation to pay their fair share.\n  Finally, the Conrad alternative budget proposal proved the point that \nI have made repeatedly during debate on the constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment--namely, that Congress does not need a constitutional \namendment to enable it to balance the Federal budget. Rather, as I have \npointed out, the Conrad amendment did all that is humanly possible in \nattempting to balance the Federal budget based on the best information \navailable at this time in a fair, responsible, and even-handed way.\n  It is for these reasons that I voted for the Conrad ``Fair Share \nBalanced Budget Proposal'' and why I shall vote against the committee-\nreported budget resolution.\n                              function 150\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President--\n\n       Once upon a time the oceans were moats around our bastions. \n     Once upon a time it was a miracle to travel round the world \n     in 90 days. Now it is done in as many hours. Once upon a time \n     we were a comfortably isolated land. Now we are unavoidably \n     the leader and the reliance of freemen throughout this free \n     world. We cannot escape from our prestige nor from its hazard \n     * * * There is no longer such a thing as isolated security.\n\n  In 1949, when the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Arthur Vandenberg, made these remarks he was urging \nhis colleagues to ratify NATO. He made his case before a reluctant \nSenate, one weary of the costs of war in blood and treasure. But, \nVandenberg understood that the defense of our Nation and the conduct of \nits foreign policy were the unique responsibilities of the Federal \nGovernment. He persuaded his colleagues not only to support NATO, but \npay the costs of containment spelled out in the Truman Doctrine and the \nMarshall Plan.\n  Senator Vandenberg was not indifferent to his colleagues caution. He \ntook note of their objections--he understood that many of President \nTruman's initiatives, and NATO in particular, were considered by some a \nsharp departure from our historic foreign policy of nonentanglement in \nthe affairs of others.\n  Senator Vandenberg was a Republican who closely cooperated with a \nDemocratic President and his administration. That bipartisan \ncooperation [[Page S7455]] secured the foundation for treaties and \nalliances that continue to guard our interests to this day. That \ncooperation rebuilt Europe yielding trade, prosperity, and stability.\n  Today, the challenge is to rebuild Armenia and Ukraine, not Belgium \nand France. Our challenge is to include Poland and the Czech Republic \nand other nations in a new European security alliance.\n  Our challenge is a choice much like that faced by the Senate in \n1949--to provide the resources to support American resolve, to secure \nAmerican interests.\n  Today, the choice is to advance democracy and free markets or retreat \nin our fight against the threats of international terrorism, nuclear \nproliferation, crime, and narcotics. Today, we win exports, jobs, and \npartners in peace or we lose to ethnic genocide, trade wars, \nterrorists, and tyrants.\n  I am not so naive as to believe the choices we face are simple and \nstark. In some ways, if the choices were crystal clear,\n absolutely obvious, support for foreign aid and our global role would \nbe much stronger. But it is the murky ambiguities of this day and age \nthat give rise to both confusion and a general apathy about our place \nin the world. And, it is that confusion that risks our isolation.\n\n  In his State of the Union Address in January 1945, President \nRoosevelt issued a sharp warning to the Nation. ``Let us not forget \nthat the retreat to isolationism a quarter of a century ago was started \nnot by a direct attack against international cooperation but against \nthe alleged imperfections of the peace.''\n  Every one of us has been critical of the imperfections of foreign \naid. Every Member has expressed opposition to waste, fraud, and abuses. \nA majority could identify programs, embassies, and consulates which \ncould be shut down.\n  But, the costs of these imperfections should not be our international \nleadership. We must not pay the permanent price of retreat from the \nworld, because we were troubled by the inefficiencies or problems in \nour foreign aid program.\n  Foreign aid must be fixed. It must more clearly serve our national \npolitical, economic, and security interests. The public must understand \nexactly what we do with the 1 percent of the Federal budget foreign aid \nexpends.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I hear from constituents who are \nuncertain about why we have a foreign aid program at all. To each of \nthem, I offer my firm commitment that we will reduce spending by \neliminating unnecessary programs, consolidating responsibilities, and \nassuring we only spend our spare resources where we can achieve \nconcrete results.\n  I believe foreign aid is an important tool essential to maintaining \nour leadership around the globe. We cannot preserve, let alone promote, \nour interests for free.\n  And, why should that matter. First, we are a compassionate nation by \ntradition; in fact it is one of our finest traditions as exemplified by \nthe outpouring of support for Oklahomans. But for the moment let's set \naside altruistic motives--set aside what I like to call the CNN \nsyndrome--where they broadcast a famine, funds will naturally follow.\n  Effective foreign assistance serves our interests. Let me review what \nI think we lose by the cuts proposed in the budget resolution.\n  First and foremost, the budget resolution assumes we will cut nearly \n$800 million from the trade promotion activities. Programs at the \nExport Import Bank, OPIC, and the Trade Development Agency are not \nlining the pockets of foreigners. These are programs which directly \naffect American jobs and exports.\n  Over the past 2 years Ex-Im has supported over $32 billion in exports \nand 300,000 jobs. In key sectors, such as power, telecommunications, \nand major construction, Ex-Im financed accounts for close to 30 percent \nof all new sales to developing countries and 15 percent of all U.S. \nproduction. In high growth developing markets, Ex-Im is financing \nanywhere from 10 to 40 percent of all U.S. capital goods.\n  That is why the Coalition for Employment through Exports is \nsupporting an increase in the Function 150 account--a Coalition that is \na broad based organization of exporters, labor unions, and State \ngovernors enjoying substantial bipartisan support. That is why I have \nheard from bankers and businessmen across the country supporting an \nincrease in the Function 150 account. They understand that this is \nabout American jobs, American exports, American income.\n  But there are other constituents who are concerned about the budget \nresolution cuts. The resolution assumes all aid to Eastern Europe and \nthe Baltic nations will be zeroed out. Let me tell you what that means \nfor just one country--Poland. After considerable effort by Congress, I \nthink the administration has turned the corner and made the commitment \nto expand NATO. Poland is clearly first in line of the potential \nentrants. Just as the point where we are likely to make this offer, we \nzero out military assistance and training key to the effective \nintegration of their forces.\n  Criteria under consideration for admission to NATO is civilian \ncontrol of the armed services and transparency of the defense budget. \nHere too, we would be cutting off parliamentary exchanges, expanded \nIMET and democratization initiatives key to meeting these admission \nstandards.\n  The budget resolution also assumes we will cut our program to the NIS \nfrom nearly $800 to $100 million. Just at the point when we are finally \nshifting emphasis from Russia to the other republics, we gut the \nprogram. Armenia and Ukraine are important partners in the region. \nMillions of Americans trace their roots to these countries--nations \nwhich deserve our support as they struggle down the perilous road of \neconomic and political reforms. For the benefit of some of my \ncolleagues who may not know about this constituency, let me offer a few \nstatistics drawn up by the census bureau. Central and Eastern Europeans \nconstitute: 18 percent of Pennsylvanians; 17 percent of New Jersey; 12 \npercent of Ohio; 18 percent of Connecticut; 15 percent of Illinois; 11 \npercent of Massachusetts; and nearly 2 million Californians.\n  Which one of us wants to apologize to our children for a nuclear \ncatastrophe because we failed to help Ukraine safeguard its aging \nChernobyl reactors? Which one of us wants to answer to the American \nArmenian with a grandmother in Yerevan who has not had heat or light \nfor months? Which one will shrug their shoulders at the market \nopportunities to a region of hundreds of millions of people?\n  And, let's not forget Russia. With over 5,000 organized criminal \nenterprises with tentacles reaching our shores and access to nuclear \nmaterial, do we really want to terminate the FBI's joint training and \ninvestigation efforts?\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution decimates support for these new \nrepublics and that is why many of us have heard from local, State, and \nnational organizations representing Americans of European descent who \nsupport increasing the level of the 150 account to guarantee adequate \nfunding for foreign aid programs. The Central and Eastern European \nCoalition which includes the Armenian Assembly, the Estonian World \nCouncil, the Lithuanian American Community, the Polish American \nCongress, the Ukrainian Congress Committee, the Ukrainian National \nAssociation, the Joint Baltic American National Committee, the U.S. \nBaltic Foundation, the Hungarian American Coalition, the Czecho-Slovak \nCouncil of America, the National Federation of Hungarian Americans, and \nseveral other groups all support this amendment.\n  I have only highlighted some of my specific concerns about the \nassumptions included in the budget resolution. I did not mention the \nfact that it assumes a cutoff of assistance to Greece and Turkey. I did \nnot detail the devastating impact it will have on development \nassistance, peacekeeping, and the National Endowment for Democracy. I \ndid not review country by country the consequence of terminating \ninternational lending to the world's poorest countries. I have only \nhighlighted my concerns--concerns shared by many of our constituents. I \nhoped that this discussion would help all of us understand that this is \nnot a debate about giving away tax dollars to foreigners or pouring our \nmoney down rat holes.\n  [[Page S7456]] Our constituents recognize, as I do, that the budget \nresolution before the Senate will leave this President, the next \nPresident, our Nation and citizens with virtually no options except \nmilitary intervention. In the last decade foreign aid has already \nsuffered a 40- percent reduction. The reductions in the budget \nresolution, to an account that already represents only 1 percent of our \nspending, amounts to eliminating foreign aid.\n  I think that is a mistake which jeopardizes our interests. \nEliminating foreign aid does not eliminate crises and needs. \nEliminating foreign aid will not constrain a President from addressing \nthese reqirements--from carrying out his policies, from serving our \nnational interests.\n  Eliminating foreign aid will simply transfer the burden directly to \nthe Pentagon. The costs DOD assumed for taking care of Cuban and \nHaitian refugees at Guantanamo will become routine, not rare. We can \nsupport private voluntary organizations carrying out feeding missions \nin Rwanda or we can deploy our National Guard. We can help train the \nmilitary in Mexico to interdict narcotics, or we can drain the \nPentagon's accounts to patrol our borders intercepting drug flights. We \ncan fund the FBI's work with their Russian counterpart's to combat \ncriminal organizations engaged in smuggling chemical, biological, and \nnuclear material, or the Pentagon can pay a price to manage the threat.\n  Crisis prevention costs less than crisis.\n  Much has been made by the administration of the isolationist symptoms \ntwitching in this body. And there certainly are Members, Senators who I \nhave a deep respect for who believe the United States should withdraw \nfrom the world stage.\n  But, I do not believe we have that option any more. The world is no \nlonger conveniently divided into cold war camps. Our friends and \nallies, the emerging democracies, all turn to the sole remaining \nsuperpower for leadership and support. A time when the international \nlandscape is troubled and confused is precisely the wrong time to \nwithdraw. It is precisely the wrong time to create a vacuum for the \nSaddam Husseins and other ambitious tyrants to fill. We can pay a small \nprice now to secure American interests or we will surely pay an \nenormous cost later.\n  Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes and I had intended to offer an \namendment to increase the level of the function 150 account. We were \nsupported in this effort by Senators Hatfield, Leahy, and other members \nof the Foreign Operations Subcommittee and Foreign Relations Committee \nwho were concerned about the budget resolution's impact.\n  We had worked hard to achieve a bipartisan base of support for an \namendment to raise the level of resources for function 150. \nUnfortunately, these efforts were undercut by comments made by \nSecretary Christopher before the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. \nThe Secretary made clear he was concerned about the level of resources \nthe Congress might make available. Nonetheless, when I asked him, as I \nhad asked the Administrator for A.I.D. and other members of the Clinton \nadministration, to work to secure congressional support to increase the \naccount, he declined. He made it absolutely clear to all of us that the \nadministration intended to sit on the sidelines as the resolution was \ndebated.\n  I believe this reluctance directly affected our support for an \namendment. many Members I spoke with commented that if it isn't \nimportant enough to the President and the State Department to work to \nimprove the resolution, why should I go out on a limb to increase \nforeign aid?\n  Ironically, just yesterday the President decided to lash out and \nthreaten to veto the House bill which authorizes priorities and \npolicies related to foreign assistance spending. The President is a day \nlate and is attacking a bill that the budget process leaves billions of \ndollars short.\n  He refused to weigh in at the time that the crucial battle was being \nfought--the administration simply did not show up to participate in a \nbipartisan effort to secure adequate funds to administer our Nation's \nforeign affairs.\n  On other occasions in the course of our history similar mistakes have \nbeen made. By the time Gen. J.E.B. Stuart showed up at Gettysburg, \nGeneral Lee had not only lost the battle, but ultimately the war. \nStuart had wandered Pennsylvania aimlessly, leaving his commander blind \nto the strength and the position of Union troops.\n  This week, we saw aimless wandering not in the hills of Pennsylvania, \nbut down the Avenue. Many of my colleagues understood the importance of \nthe budget battle--understood it has significant implications for our \nlong-term national interests. But the critical support for an effort to \nsave the 150 account failed to arrive in time.\n                          transportation cuts\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President the Senate proposal before us reduces \ntransportation spending significantly more than the House. The \ndifference between the Senate and the House is primarily attributable \nto unrealistic savings associated with privatizing certain air traffic \ncontrol functions of the FAA. Beginning in 1997, the Senate assumes \nthat this proposal will achieve savings of $3.675 billion a year.\n  The feasibility of the Senate Republican's air traffic control \nprivatization proposal is highly suspect because it asks users to pay \ntwice. Not only will users continue to pay the Federal Government, via \nthe ticket tax, but users will have to pay an additional tax to the new \nprivate entity.\n  While the Republican plan may help reduce the deficit, it is clearly \nnot fair. Asking users to continue to pay the ticket tax to help reduce \nthe deficit and then asking them to pay an additional tax to pay for an \nair traffic control service they already receive is asking too much and \nhas little chance of succeeding.\n  Given the fact that the Senate Republican's FAA proposal is totally \nunrealistic, the Department of transportation would then be forced to \nvirtually eliminate new highway, Transit, and Airport Improvement Grant \nfunding in fiscal year 1997 to even get close to achieving its Senate \nfiscal year 1997 budget\n  In addition, deep cuts of 20 percent or more in Coast Guard and FAA \noperations would be required to actually make the cuts proposed in \nSenate budget for fiscal year 1997.\n  We should not jeopardize the safety and viability of the Nation's \ntransportation system with unrealistic budget assumptions. Let's have a \nmore realistic budget for transportation, a budget that won't put vital \ntransportation functions at risk.\n                  privatization of air traffic control\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, for 50 hours, we have debated the real \nimpacts of the Republican budget proposal. I have talked at length \nabout the Republican budget, and I won't restate my objections here. I \ndo, however, want to point out the folly of one part of this plan.\n  All too often around here, someone hears an idea and runs with it. \nBuried in this budget is an assumption that the air traffic control \nservices now provided by the Federal Aviation Administration will be \nprivatized. The savings, through the year 2000, are projected to be \n$14.7 billion. The assumption raises many serious concerns, not the \nleast of which are the potential impacts on safety, the traveling \npublic, the airline industry, and travel and tourism.\n  Travel and tourism is the largest service export of the United \nStates, producing a $22 billion export surplus. The industry employs \nsix million Americans, and generates a $99.2 billion payroll. Travel \nand tourism is dependent on a U.S. aviation industry that over the last \n5 years has lost $13 billion. We have seen carriers like Eastern \nAirlines and Pan American Airways, which paved the way for \ninternational aviation in the world, shut their doors. In reviewing the \nDomenici budget, and in particular the assumption to privatize air \ntraffic control, it is important to bear in mind the tourism industry's \nimportance to our economy and the airlines' current financial morass.\n  No matter what, we know that air traffic control services and the \nother FAA safety programs must continue. Someone will have to pay for \nthose services. Right now, the users pay money into an airport and \nairway trust fund. It is a dedicated fund. The users pay approximately \n$6 billion per year into the trust fund.\n  Under the Domenici assumption, Federal spending for the FAA would be \ncut by a total of $14.7 billion, or $3.7 [[Page S7457]] billion per \nyear. We can cut the Federal Government's outlays for the FAA, but the \nneed for the services does not end. This is not one of those unneeded \nservices or programs that ceases as soon as Federal funding stops. Air \ntraffic control services will need to be provided and paid for no \nmatter what happens under the Budget resolution. Yet, Senate Concurrent \nResolution 13 asks the users to continue to pay $6 billion to the \nFederal Government, but then calls for air traffic control services to \nbe privatized. As a result, the Federal Government will not use the \ntrust fund for those services, and the users must pay again for them. \nEssentially, the users will get double billed. We could solve the \ndeficit very quickly if we charged every industry twice for the service \nprovided by the Government, or simply continued to charge them for \nservices that the Federal Government would no longer provide.\n  Over the last year, there has been a prolonged battle over the future \nof the FAA. The administration came up with a proposal to split up the \nFAA into a successor FAA and a Government corporation for air traffic \ncontrol, which I and many others oppose. The plan was never proposed as \na way to save money, but rather as a way to modernize the system and to \nmaintain the current safety standards of the system. The Secretary of \nTransportation did not state that he expected huge savings from the \nbreakup; instead he expected a more effective organization. The \ncommercial aviation industry, initially thought to favor the air \ntraffic control corporation, ultimately concluded that it could not \nendorse the Secretary's program. The general aviation sector also said \nno. So has Congress.\n  Now we get an assumption to privatize a key element of the FAA in \nthis budget plan. What are we talking about? There are many \nprivatization options that I can think of, but all of them would wreak \nhavoc with the world's safest air transportation system. For example, \ndo we really want to create a Postal Service for the air traffic \ncontrol system? I get mad when\n letters are misplaced, but to think of misplacing aircraft is \nsomething else.\n\n  Should we consider contracting out these services to a private group? \nDo you really want your air traffic control system being run by the \nlowest bidder? In the alternative, we could auction off the system to \nthe highest bidder, gaining lots of revenue for the Federal Government. \nStop and think about those two possibilities. Consider the winner of \nthe auction--the winning bidder would need to recoup its investment, \noperate and modernize the system, and earn a return on the investment. \nDoing a little shorthand math, let's say the air traffic control system \nis worth $15 billion, and using the Domenici assumption of $14.7 \nbillion, it would cost another $15 billion to modernize and operate the \nsystem. The company also would want at least a 10 percent return on the \ninvestment. Congress would have created a winning formula for helping \nthe aviation industry--a $30-$35 billion increase in costs. Remember, \nthe industry lost $13 billion over the last 5 years. An industry \nfurther weakened could result in safety problems.\n  In addition, the winner of the auction would then be running a \nmonopoly. Do we really want to have a complete laissez-faire attitude \ntoward safety? Let's stop and think about this for a minute: a monopoly \nwould need to be regulated--fees for air traffic control services would \nneed oversight and safety functions would need monitoring. Are we \nreally willing to tell the traveling public that the Government is no \nlonger responsible for aviation safety? This proposal to privatize does \nnot create efficiencies or facilitate competition for air traffic \ncontrol services. It merely turns over to a private entity the function \nof providing those services. That corporation would have no incentives \nto make the system efficient--it would be a monopoly.\n  We could avoid the monopoly situation by creating competing air \ntraffic control systems, so that New York could have its own system, \nChicago another, and so on. Of course, small communities might have \ntrouble paying for high quality air traffic control services. So they \nwould either have to sacrifice safety by providing inferior services or \nclose down their airports for lack of services. The free market can be \ncounted on to eliminate inefficiencies, but our constituents can't be \nblamed for not applauding such results.\n  Let's begin by understanding that the air traffic control system is \nthe heart of the safety network that the Government provides to people \nwho fly. Admittedly, the system is not perfect, but most agree that it \nis by far the best in the world. Comparisons to other countries that \nhave privatized air traffic control services are irrelevant and \nridiculous. These countries--New Zealand, Switzerland, and Germany--\ncombined probably have less air traffic than Atlanta. Our system is \nmuch more complex, much more integrated. Privatization of the air \ntraffic control system is opposed by the vast majority of aviation \nindustry experts.\n  The General Aviation manufacturers Association [GAMA] recently wrote \nto me and reminded me that the Office of Technology Assessment in 1988 \nstated that ``the ATC function is inextricably linked with aviation \nsafety and is a central component of an integrated FAA safety system.'' \nThe GAMA letter went on to say that the Aviation Safety Commission, \nappointed by President Reagan, ``stressed that the Federal government \nmust continue to play the central role in ensuring safe operation of \nthe U.S. aviation system.'' The GAMA letter included the following \nquotation from that Commission's report: ``Since the Commission is not \ninclined to gamble in sorting out conflicting assertions about whether \nsafety regulatory functions can be separated organizationally from air \ntraffic control and facilities operations activities, the Commission \ncannot endorse the proposition that the air traffic control function \nshould be privatized.'' The Senate Budget Committee's assumptions take \nthat gamble.\n  We do not want to put the safety of the national air transportation \nsystem at risk. Ask the controllers who toil throughout the country if \nthey want to privatize. Those folks work hard to make sure that all of \nus get home safely. They oppose privatization and seek meaningful \nreform.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on meaningful reform--\nnot privatization or corporatization of air traffic control services. \nThe process should proceed with caution before we assume in this or any \nbudget that we should destroy the safest air traffic control system in \nthe world.\n                food and nutrition programs for children\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on March 29 of this year, the Senate \nunanimously adopted a resolution I offered opposing any measure that \nwould increase the number of hungry or homeless children. Now, less \nthan 2 months later, here we are considering a budget resolution that \nwould drastically cut funding for important nutrition programs, \nincluding the Food Stamp Program and the Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram. The cut would be $20 billion over 5 years in these programs.\n  This budget represents a massive set-back in fighting hunger in this \ncountry. We do know the following about who is hungry in this country:\n  In 1991 FRAC's Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project \nestimated that there are 5.5 million children under 12 years of age who \nare hungry in the United States.\n  The group Second Harvest estimated that in 1993, the emergency food \nprograms served 10,798,375 children.\n  The U.S. Council on Mayor's Status Report on Hunger and Homelessness \nin America's Cities: 1994 found that 64 percent of the persons \nreceiving food assistance were from families with children.\n  A Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition Policy \nStudy estimated that 12 million children were hungry in the United \nStates in 1991.\n  A Carnegie Foundation study found that 68 percent of public school \nteachers in 1987 reported that undernourished children/youths are a \nproblem in school.\n  There is a serious problem with hunger in this country--particularly \nfor children. Our reaction should be outrage, but instead we are \nresponding by cutting the most important nutritional program this \ncountry has. These two programs are critical supports to children's \nnutrition.\n  The Child and Adult Care Food Program [CACFP] is designed to ensure \nthat children up to age 12 enrolled in child care centers, family care \ncenters, [[Page S7458]] before-and-after school programs, as well as \nHead Start centers receive nutritious meals. In 1994 the program cost \nabout $1.3 billion and served slightly more than two million children. \nThe budget proposal will cut at least $1.9 billion over 5 years and \n$3.21 billion over 7 years. This is the only program that is easily \naccessible to family day care centers, the majority of day care \nproviders in this country. The\n CACFP is the single biggest incentive for family day care providers to \nbecome licensed or registered.\n\n  The chairman's assumption is that the savings will come from \ntargeting lower income children through census tract eligibility. I \nworry how such a strategy will work in Minnesota, where rural districts \ncan be rich or poor depending upon a very small number of people. The \nalternative that these homes will have is to means test each family \nmonthly, an appalling paperwork morass for such small operations. We \nare afraid these homes may go back underground by leaving the program.\n  An even larger concern is the impact of this budget resolution on the \nFood Stamps Program. Food Stamps is the program that feeds the hungry \nin this country.\n  Who are the people on Food Stamps? Well, we know that over half of \nFood Stamp recipients are children. Some 13 million children received \nbenefits in 1992. Families with children received 81.9 percent of food \nstamp benefits. Elderly and disabled households received 12.9 percent \nof food stamp benefits. The program targets the population in need very \nwell with 56 percent of food stamps benefits going to households with \ngross incomes below half of the poverty line and 76 percent are at or \nbelow the poverty level. So you see, most of the people we will be \ncutting off or restricting benefits to will be the most vulnerable, the \npoorest in our society. And yet again we are making poor children pay. \nOver half of these benefits go to poor children, but that is the \nprogram we pick to slash.\n  The Food Stamp Program works. A recent overview of the literature \nindicated there is considerable evidence that the Food Stamp Program is \nan important factor in helping low-income households have better \nnutrition intakes. Participants have a higher level of recommended \ndietary allowances than do eligible nonparticipants. Under-nutrition \nhas serious health consequences and is associated with an array of \nmedical problems including longer healing of wounds and injuries, \nsusceptibility to disease and extended recovery time when contracted. \nIn children, under-nutrition is associated with cognitive deficits and \nimpaired development.\n  This is a temporary program for the majority of recipients. Half of \nall food stamp recipients leave the program within 6 months and two-\nthirds leave within 1 year. This is not a dependency-producing subsidy, \na point of great concern to many.\n  Yet the program does this with very little money. In 1994, the \nprogram provided an average benefit of $69 per person per month, or 76 \ncents per person per meal. The maximum benefit--received by less than \n23 percent of households--is $368 for a family of four or $1.06 per \nperson per meal. All food assistance programs represent only 2.4 \npercent of Federal outlays and this percentage is expected to decline \nslightly in the future as a\n share of total spending.\n\n  This is not to say that the Food Stamps Program does not have its \nproblems. There is evidence of fraud and waste, yet one estimate is \nthat the amount of money saved by fraud will only make up 0.1 percent \nof the savings the House welfare reform bill intends to gain by cutting \nthe food program. I certainly agree with those who would like to reduce \nfraud through reasonable means. Those who waste these benefits or who \nfraudulently use them are wasting taxpayers' money. I am afraid that \nthe desire to cut this program is too strongly influenced by a run-away \ndesire to correct this wrong-doing, with little examination of the \nconsequences to those in need.\n  People will go without because of the reductions proposed in this \nresolution, and we need to recognize that. These cuts are massive, and \nwill dramatically reduce the money available to feed hungry people. \nGiven the very real possibility that this body will pass a welfare \nreform bill which ends the AFDC entitlement, food stamps will be the \nonly program with entitlement status that will cushion our poor \nfamilies against recessions. We are shortsighted in taking food from \nthose who need it to pay for tax cut primarily for wealthy people and \ncorporations.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose these unwise reductions, and to \nsupport amendments to restore critically needed food assistance to \nchildren and others who rely on these programs.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Grams.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the time and effort \nthe majority leader has put into this bill.\n  Mr. President, during my campaign for the Senate, I promised the \npeople of Minnesota I will do everything that I can do to get \ngovernment off their backs and out of their back pockets. I told them \nmy fight for them was to turn legislation like my families first plan, \nand its $500 per child tax credit and economic growth incentives, into \nlaw. I believe that this tax credit should be available starting next \nyear for all children under age 18. Today, I am pleased that the U.S. \nSenate has taken the first step to provide families with the tax relief \nthey want and deserve. The budget resolution reported out of the Budget \nCommittee included a substantial fiscal dividend which may have been \nused for family tax relief. The Grams-Abraham amendment guarantees that \nthe dividend will be used for family tax relief. Mr. Leader, I would \nlike you to clarify the phrase ``tax relief.''\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator for his inquiry. While the\n   phrase ``family tax relief'' is not specific, my interpretation is \nthat the phrase could include a $500 per child family tax credit. It is \nof course up to the Finance Committee to determine exactly how the \nfiscal dividend will be given back to Americans in the form of tax \ncuts. But I can assure you that as a senior member of the Finance \nCommittee and its former chairman, and a majority leader, when the \nFinance Committee determines how to provide specific tax cuts, I will \nbe there fighting for tax credits for children, such as that provided \nby the $500 per child credit. We should provide tax credits for \nfamilies that adopt children, expanded IRA's for homemakers, estate tax \nrelief for family businesses, and other benefits targeted to the \nfamily.\n\n  The amendment also calls for the fiscal dividend to be used for tax \nincentives for savings and investment, job creation and economic \ngrowth. I would work to ensure that, as a result of the Grams-Abraham \namendment, we cut the capital gains tax to stimulate economic growth \nand create jobs.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Also, on behalf of Senator Hutchison, I would like to ask \nif spousal IRA's would be included in the definition of ``family tax \nrelief''?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would say while the specifics of family \ntax relief and incentives to increase savings and investment will be \ndetermined by the Finance Committee, expanded spousal IRA's would \ncertainly be considered in the context of providing family tax relief.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Would the majority leader yield for another question?\n  Mr. DOLE. Certainly.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Like the Senator from Minnesota, I also campaigned on a \nplatform that emphasized tax relief for all Americans including the \n$500 per child family tax credit, and savings and investment incentives \nsuch as estate tax reform for family-owned businesses. The fiscal \ndividend included in the budget resolution will provide approximately \n$79 billion in tax relief over the next 5 years. Now, our amendment \ndirects the Committee on Finance to use this dividend for family tax \nrelief and incentives to stimulate savings, investment, job creation, \nand economic growth. By including these directions, I believe we have \nsubstantially improved the Senate's position when entering into \nnegotiations with the House over tax cuts. Is it the majority leader's \nintention to work for additional tax cuts in the budget resolution \nconference to ensure that the largest possible family\n and pro-growth cuts are enacted this year?\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator for the question. Let me indicate as I \nhave before, I have always said that balancing the budget is my first \npriority. But we can balance the budget and cut [[Page S7459]] taxes \ntoo. The Senate budget resolution will ensure that we do both. Any \nfiscal dividend that results from enacting balanced budget legislation \nwill be returned to the American people in the form of reduced taxes. \nThere are significant differences between the House and Senate budget \nresolutions, and I will encourage the Senate conferees to increase the \ndeficit reduction achieved in this budget to the maximum extent \npossible. If we achieve even more savings, then I will fight to ensure \nthat further tax cuts are provided to the American people.\n  Let me just say to both my colleagues from Minnesota and Michigan \nthat I appreciate their willingness throughout the last several days to \ntry to come to some agreement that would provide the relief that they \nwere seeking. This does not quite reach everything they wanted, but I \ncommend them for their efforts.\n  I think this is a very significant amendment that was adopted today \non the floor, with bipartisan support, I might add. And it was due to \nthe efforts of the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], and the Senator \nfrom Michigan [Mr. Abraham].\n  If I can say one word that would follow the statement of the Senator \nfrom Delaware on the antiterrorism bill, I thank Senator Hatch and \nSenator Biden for their willingness to try to pass this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle, to help us enter \ninto some time agreements to make it possible. It might be--and it may \nnot happen--that we can reach a time agreement on a number of \namendments and not be in very long tomorrow. We will have a couple of \nvotes, and we will take it up the day we are back. I promised we would \ntake up telecommunications on that day. Without an agreement, I do not \nhave any idea how long it will take if we bring up or continue on this \nbill when we come back on June 5.\n  I will be working with Senators Daschle and Biden and Hatch. We \npromised the President we would bring this up before the Memorial Day \nrecess, and we have done that now. We have not completed action, but we \nhave had a little debate. Had we been able to start on this last night, \nwe may have been able to finish it tonight or tomorrow. It may not be \npossible to do that now. I know colleagues have other commitments \nstarting early afternoon tomorrow, and some have them in the morning. I \nhope that on both sides we can have the cooperation of our colleagues \nworking with the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, and the \nranking Democratic member, Senator Biden.\n  Mr. BIDEN. While the majority leader is still on the floor, I can say \nfor the minority that I am confident we can agree on time agreements on \nall of the amendments I am aware of thus far. We are continuing to \nhotline this to see if there are any amendments other than the ones \nthat I am aware of.\n  I doubt whether we can get an agreement on a final passage time. But \nI would suggest that if we can get narrowed down time agreements \ntomorrow on each of the amendments, we should do all we can to lock it \nin. I thank the leader for honoring his commitment to bring this up. It \nwas a bit beyond his control, having 50 some votes in the last 2 days. \nTo the best of my knowledge, the House has not acted on this at all. \nEven if we passed a bill tonight, we are not in a position to be able \nto send it to the President or even go to conference. I do not think \nthere is any damage done by not doing that.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7423-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7459-S7474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IMPACT STATEMENTS ON FUNDING FOR THE NIH\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on May 18 of this year, the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Health, Human Services, Education and \nLabor held a hearing on the funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth, and at that time a request was made by the representatives of \nthe various units of the NIH to submit impact statements as to what the \nbudget reductions would do. A good bit of this information was used by \nme in my statement on an amendment offered by Senator Hatfield.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Record contain these impact \nstatements.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      A Guide to the Impact Statements About NIH Budget Reductions\n\n       The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has identified 15 \n     specific areas of research that would be severely affected by \n     the cuts recommended by the Senate Budget Committee. These \n     are only a representative sampling of the many research \n     activities that would be significantly slowed, halted, or \n     never started due to the proposed reductions. The effects are \n     likely to be especially dramatic and long-lasting for several \n     reasons:\n       NIH now funds less than one in four grant applications, so \n     that any reduction in support would affect only those \n     investigators already judged by expert peer reviewers to be \n     among the best in the nation.\n       It is in the nature of medical research to find that the \n     most important discoveries are made in unexpected places. If \n     funding is reduced to what are deemed bare essentials, much \n     of the best research may be eliminated because it is not \n     obviously connected to immediate medical goals.\n       Over 80 percent of the NIH budget supports research at many \n     colleges, universities, medical schools, and institutes in \n     every state in the country. These awards are essential not \n     only for generating new knowledge; they also improve the \n     quality of medical care and training, help to recruit new \n     biomedical scientists, and strengthen educational programs. A \n     major reduction in funding will undermine these important \n     aspects of American life; the effect will be felt for many \n     years. Bright, young people, recognizing that the future for \n     biomedical research has dimmed, would pursue other career \n     options.\n       The research that NIH supports in the areas discussed in \n     our samples is different from the kind of work conducted at \n     biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms, where a commercial \n     product is the central goal. Without the basic knowledge \n     generated by NIH-sponsored investigators, our international \n     leadership in the industrial sector will be threatened.\n        IMPACT STATEMENTS FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n       Alcoholism.\n       Alzheimer's Disease.\n       Anti-Cocaine Agent.\n       Blinding Diseases.\n       Breast Cancer.\n       Cancer Vaccines.\n       Conquering Genetic Diseases (mapping the human genome).\n       New and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases.\n       The Obesity Gene.\n       Otitis Media (a serious childhood infection).\n       Parkinson's Disease.\n       Prostate Cancer.\n       Sexually Transmitted Diseases.\n       Sickle Cell Disease.\n       Stem Cell Research.\n       Stroke.\n       Vaccines to Prevent Stomach Ulcers and Stomach Cancer.\n\n\n              IMPACT OF NIH BUDGET CUTS ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH\n\n       Alcoholism: Naltrexone, the first medication approved for \n     treating alcoholism in forty years, is a major step forward.\n       The Promise: Researchers supported by the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) have shown that naltrexone, an \n     opiate-blocker used for treating heroin addiction, is an \n     effective treatment for alcohol addiction. The combination of \n     naltrexone and skilled counseling resulted in alcohol-\n     dependent people staying sober twice as long as placebo-\n     treated patients. Even if naltrexone-treated alcoholics \n     drank, they rarely ``binged.''\n       The Next Steps: Naltrexone is the first medication approved \n     for the treatment of alcoholism in forty years. However, that \n     approval is only for three months of use in any patient. \n     Further research is needed to make this treatment more \n     effective and to exploit what insights it may provide into \n     underlying biological and behavioral mechanisms. NIH is \n     currently studying naltrexone's longer-term use, side \n     effects, and most importantly, how naltrexone--an opiate \n     blocker--reduces alcohol craving.\n       Improved technologies are also aiding in the study of \n     alcohol addiction. New brain imaging systems can actually \n     show what alcohol craving looks like, including blood flow \n     changes. Computer-aided design of new drugs to treat \n     alcoholism has begun, using recently discovered information \n     on how alcohol affects the surface of nerve cells. And \n     investigators are narrowing in on the genes which account for \n     inherited vulnerability to alcoholism.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: The clinical trials of the longer-\n     term use of naltrexone would have to be curtailed or not \n     initiated. Other promising leads in alcoholism research would \n     either have to be delayed or dropped.\n       Alcohol kills over 100,000 Americans every year. Some 20 to \n     40 percent of adult hospital beds in large urban hospitals \n     are occupied by people being treated for alcohol-caused organ \n     damage. Alcoholism and alcohol abuse costs the Nation about \n     $100 billion every year in medical costs, social costs, and \n     loss of productivity. Slowing advances in the treatment of \n     alcoholism could cost tens of billions of dollars.\n       Comment: Alcohol addiction is the number one drug problem \n     in the United States. New treatments to help alcohol-\n     dependent people stay sober are showing positive results, and \n     the biological roots of alcoholism are being uncovered.\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\n       Alzheimer's Disease: Delaying or preventing the onset of \n     symptoms and loss of mental capacity.\n       The Promise: Just in the last year, scientists working with \n     support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have: \n     discovered a gene that is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's \n     disease and found ways to detect early changes in the brain \n     (by combining brain imaging and genetic analysis) before \n     obvious symptoms of Alzheimer's develop\n       The Next Steps: Now scientists are ready to conduct \n     critical studies to find the direct role played by genes in \n     Alzheimer's disease so that they can find ways to prevent the \n     disease or at least delay the loss of mental capacity that \n     devastates the patients and their families.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: NIH's ability to continue these \n     studies on Alzheimer's disease depends on maintaining a \n     network of scientists, patients, and research institutions. A \n     budget cut would cripple this network, delaying the \n     translation of research advances to the next step--effective \n     treatments.\n       Today, there is no effective treatment for Alzheimer's \n     disease, which affects 4 million Americans. If no treatment \n     is developed, by the year 2050, there will be over 14 million \n     people affected by some form of dementia requiring care and \n     institutionalization.\n       Comment: No family is immune from Alzheimer's disease--that \n     became clear earlier this year when former President Reagan \n     chose to reveal his diagnosis.\n       Total national cost to care for patients with Alzheimer's \n     disease is about $100 billion annually. If we don't find ways \n     to delay, prevent or treat the disease, our health care \n     system will be overwhelmed early in the 21st Century. The \n     total NIH budget--for all diseases--is a small fraction of \n     those health care costs and a small price to pay for the hope \n     that Alzheimer's disease can be conquered.\n       Anti-cocaine Agent: To help combat the escalating epidemic \n     of cocaine use, including ``crack'' cocaine.\n       The Promise: Because of breakthroughs in brain and \n     immunology research in the last five years, scientists \n     supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are on \n     the threshold of providing an effective anti-cocaine \n     medication or ``cocaine blocker''.\n       In the last two years, scientists have: identified the \n     major sites (receptors) where cocaine works on the brain; \n     discovered how cocaine works on the brain; and uncovered 4 \n     biological targets at which to aim medication development, \n     with more than 12 compounds in the pipeline\n       The Next Steps: Medical scientists are now ready to study \n     more closely the new, candidate compounds and select the most \n     promising for tests in patients.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A reduction in the budget would \n     freeze this program in its infancy, shut down the pipeline of \n     new candidate medications, and preclude testing in patients \n     of even the most promising drugs. It would delay by at least \n     5 years the development of an effective anti-cocaine agent.\n       Currently there is no way to treat cocaine overdose and \n     there are no medications available to treat cocaine \n     addiction. Large numbers of people die of overdose, and the \n     Nation pays dearly for the violence, family disruption, and \n     health care costs that result from growing cocaine use.\n       Comment: The single most important need in this Nation's \n     battle against drug abuse and addiction is an effective anti-\n     cocaine medication. Today we have none. Research is \n     desperately needed to develop a useful drug to help us \n     control the cocaine epidemic.\n       Blindness: Finding ways to treat eye diseases causing \n     blindness.\n       The Promise: Scientists have recently identified a gene \n     related to glaucoma in young people. This discovery provides \n     great opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment of a \n     disease that is the second leading cause of blindness in this \n     country.\n       Other scientists have developed micro-surgical techniques \n     in animals to ``rescue'' degenerated macular cells--cells in \n     the part of the eye that allows the clearest, sharpest \n     vision. If this surgical ``rescue'' proves successful in \n     humans, it would be a major breakthrough in treating macular \n     degeneration, the leading cause of blindness of people over \n     age 60.\n       The Next Steps: Scientists supported by the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) are now ready to capitalize on the \n     genetic discovery relating to glaucoma in young people by \n     developing ways to identify at-risk patients early so that \n     effective treatment can be begun.\n       Other scientists supported by the NIH are set to apply \n     microsurgical techniques for macular cell ``rescue'' in \n     humans. Advances are desperately needed in macular \n     degeneration, a disease for which, in most cases, no \n     treatment currently exists.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: Budget reductions would slow \n     scientists' ability to move these two promising early \n     findings into larger scale studies involving humans.\n       Comment: Blindness from glaucoma is estimated to cost the \n     U.S. more than $1.5 billion annually in Social Security \n     benefits, lost tax revenues, and health care expenditures. \n     Macular degeneration, which affects one of ten Americans over \n     age 60, will become an increasingly important national health \n     problem as the U.S. population ages. We need to continue this \n     potentially sight-saving research.\n       Breast Cancer: Gene discoveries promise clinical advances.\n       The Promise: Scientists are on the verge of major clinical \n     advances in breast cancer, thanks to long-awaited gene \n     discoveries made in the last year. BRCA1, a breast cancer \n     susceptibility gene, has been isolated and characterized, and \n     scientists are closing in on other breast cancer genes, \n     including BRCA2. Such breast cancer genes--when inherited in \n     a mutated form--can cause breast cancers that strike early \n     and afflict many women in the same family through \n     generations.\n       These gene discoveries will permit the development of \n     diagnostic tests to identify women who are at risk and will \n     speed research to develop effective methods of prevention, \n     early detection, and treatment.\n       The Next Steps: Scientists are eager to take the next \n     steps:\n       Determine the role BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes play in converting \n     a normal breast cell into a cancer cell;\n       Develop cost-effective, accurate diagnostic tests to \n     identify those women at risk in order to intervene early;\n       Establish genetic counseling services to help women who \n     believe--from family history--they are at risk make informed \n     decisions and cope with the emotional trauma; and\n       Continue research to fully understand all the mutations \n     involved in breast cancer including those involved in the \n     spread of the disease (metastasis) in order to improve our \n     ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat this disease.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A budget cut would slow or even \n     curtail the enormous promise of these gene discoveries at the \n     very time women are anticipating the real possibility of \n     changing the previously depressing outcomes of breast cancer.\n       Comment: 182,000 women will be diagnosed as having breast \n     cancer in 1995 and 46,000 women will die of breast cancer. \n     Five to ten percent of these woman will be classified as \n     genetically prone to early onset familial breast cancer \n     through BRCA1 and related genes. A diagnosis of breast cancer \n     is most dreaded by American women. The widespread publicity \n     attendant on the discovery of these breast cancer genes has \n     led to optimism that this disease may be prevented or cured. \n     The women's health movement would be devastated if this \n     research is curtailed.\n       Cancer Vaccines: Strengthening the body's own natural \n     defense against diseases that have already developed.\n       The Promise: Just a month ago, medical scientists working \n     with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that \n     they had reversed the course of disease in a 43-year-old \n     woman dying of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that \n     is nearly always fatal. They accomplished this by immunizing \n     a healthy bone marrow donor against the cancer and then \n     transferring the immunity to the sick woman through a bone \n     marrow transplant. Two years later, she is free of detectable \n     cancer.\n       Long-term follow-up of cancer patients receiving \n     immunotherapy shows that this approach can bring dramatic \n     response in melanoma and kidney cancer. In addition, last \n     year, scientists identified a gene for one of the principal \n     proteins that elicits natural immunity against melanoma. \n     Potentially, this gene or its corresponding protein, could be \n     used to produce a melanoma vaccine.\n       The Next Steps: In the next few years, this and other \n     ``vaccine'' approaches to curing cancer need to be tested. \n     Eight different vaccines for breast cancer and 13 for skin \n     cancer (melanoma) are in early stages of testing in patients. \n     If these efforts offer promise, they could someday be applied \n     to other cancers such as prostate, colon, and lung cancer.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A budget cut would curtail or slow \n     the testing of the 21 cancer ``vaccines'' already being used \n     in patients. The entire ``vaccine'' approach to cancer \n     treatment would be held back--an approach that offers hope \n     for the thousands of cancer patients who die every year \n     despite treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.\n       Comment: The American public desperately needs new ways to \n     treat cancer. Today many people are cured of cancer through \n     surgery, radiation, and the drugs--thanks to research \n     supported for many years by the NIH--but 550,000 die of \n     cancer each year and are counting on these vital research \n     advances.\n       Conquering Genetic Diseases: Jump-started by mapping the \n     human genome.\n       The Promise: Creating detailed maps of the human genome and \n     understanding the make-up of the estimated 100,000 human \n     genes will certainly speed the discovery of the approximately \n     5,000 genes that cause human disease.\n       Discovery of disease genes will dramatically improve our \n     ability to develop tests for individuals who are at risk for \n     the diseases, and enhance early treatment.\n       Scientists supported by the National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH) have already:\n       A full year ahead of schedule, created a detailed genetic \n     map of the human genome (this provides landmarks along the \n     chromosomes, a powerful tool aiding scientists in search of \n     disease genes);\n       Nearly completed a physical map of the human genome (this \n     provides even more information for the gene-hunters); and\n       Discovered 42 disease genes, including those for early \n     onset breast cancer, hereditary colon cancer, polycystic \n     kidney disease, and Huntington's disease.\n       The Next Steps: Mapping alone will greatly increase the \n     number of disease genes isolated. In addition, scientists are \n     now ready [[Page S7461]] to begin``sequencing''--analyzing \n     the chemical makeup of the genes--a year ahead of schedule. \n     The entire sequencing project is expected to be completed by \n     2005 and tremendously speed the discovery of disease genes \n     and new avenues for diagnosis, prevention and treatment.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A reduction in resources will mean \n     that large-scale gene ``sequencing'' will not be started and \n     the project will not be completed by 2005, because funds are \n     needed to improve sequencing technology.\n       Scientists are on the brink of finding genes for prostate \n     cancer, diabetes, familial Alzheimer's, obesity, \n     schizophrenia and manic depression. A cut in funding will \n     delay these discoveries.\n       Comment: If the U.S. fails to follow through, Japan, \n     Britain and Germany are poised to finish the project \n     themselves and they will be first to reap the health and \n     economic benefits. The hopes of many patients and families \n     will be dashed.\n       New and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases: Changes in \n     microbes and our environment, overuse of antibiotics, and \n     increasing global travel present new challenges.\n       The Promise: One of the triumphs of the twentieth century \n     is the conquest and control of many infectious diseases. This \n     conquest was a result of research on vaccines, antibiotics, \n     and the basic properties of microbes (much of it conducted by \n     the National Institutes of Health). But in the past 15 years, \n     new and re-emerging microbes and antibiotic-resistant \n     organisms have eroded that victory.\n       The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is establishing a \n     ``New and Re-emerging Infectious Disease Initiative.'' This \n     initiative addresses the threat of new microbes (such as \n     Ebola virus and HIV), re-emerging infectious diseases (such \n     as cholera and hantavirus), and drug-resistant strains of \n     previously treatable infections (such as tuberculosis and \n     streptococcus). The focal point of this initiative will be \n     the development of vaccines, the most cost-effective and \n     dependable method to combat new and re-emerging infectious \n     diseases, particularly in light of increasing resistance to \n     virtually all of the currently available antibiotics.\n       The NIH is uniquely positioned to launch this initiative \n     because of its many infectious disease research \n     collaborations with the World Health Organization, the \n     Centers for Disease Control, the Agency for International \n     Development and many individual nations. All of these \n     collaborations assist in the attempt to identify and to \n     control outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging microbes.\n       Additionally the NIH has established:\n       Seven U.S. university-based programs working in countries \n     where tropical diseases are common;\n       Three tropical medicine research centers located in \n     Colombia, Brazil and the Philippines;\n       Four tropical disease research units at U.S. academic \n     medical centers;\n       An intramural Center for International Disease Research \n     which is focused on parasitic diseases; and\n       Eight Regional Primate Research Centers across the U.S. \n     Non-human primates are the natural reservoirs of many \n     emerging diseases. These primate centers facilitate the rapid \n     identification, study, and containment of these threats to \n     our Nation's health.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A budget cut would curtail or \n     significantly slow all of these efforts, both the launching \n     of the ``New and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases Initiative'' \n     and the continuation of NIH's network of national and \n     international tropical, parasitic and primate research \n     centers. International collaborations are especially \n     vulnerable to budget cuts, but the ongoing crisis concerning \n     the Ebola virus demonstrates the obvious need for sustained, \n     stable funding.\n       The seriousness of this challenge cannot be overstated. \n     Events of the past year have demonstrated our increasing \n     vulnerability to infectious diseases that may rapidly assume \n     epidemic proportions. Many new and re-emerging microbes \n     threaten our Nation's health. Vaccine development, continued \n     international collaboration, and rapid identification of new \n     strains are our best hope for the future.\n       Comment: The ``antibiotic holiday'' is over. We need a \n     sustained strategic approach to new and re-emerging \n     infectious diseases.\n       The Obesity Gene: Revolutionary advance providing hope for \n     reducing obesity and its complications.\n       The Promise: Last year, scientists supported by the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH) discovered a gene in mice \n     related to a protein that regulates body weight. A very \n     similar ``obesity gene'' was also found in humans.\n       This finding has great potential for developing a totally \n     new kind of agent for regulating body weight in humans. Over \n     50 million Americans are obese, and the number of obese \n     adults has increased by one third in just one decade. An \n     effective new obesity treatment could also combat the serious \n     complications of obesity--heart disease, diabetes, stroke and \n     cancer.\n       The current economic costs of the obesity epidemic are \n     estimated at almost $70 billion annually, to which can be \n     added an estimated $33 billion spent each year on weight \n     reduction products and services, for a total of $100 billion \n     annually. Thus, the potential economic impact of the obesity \n     gene discovery is tremendous.\n       The Next Steps: To capitalize on this important discovery, \n     scientists supported by NIH now need to:\n       Study the protein made by the obesity gene to understand \n     how the gene acts on the body and prepare an experimental \n     form of the protein to learn its biological activity;\n       Conduct tests of the effects of the protein on obese and \n     normal animals; and\n       Initiate clinical studies in humans to determine the \n     potential of the gene product in obesity prevention or \n     treatment.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: Decreases in the budget would mean \n     that NIH could fund fewer new research grants, thus slowing \n     the basic, early research steps that scientists are eager to \n     begin. Human studies would be put off into the future, \n     awaiting the results of basic research.\n       Comment: The discovery of the obesity gene was met with \n     great interest by the scientific community and the public. \n     Research should push on to bring the public the benefits of \n     this advance.\n       Otitis Media: A serious childhood infection in need of a \n     better solution.\n       The Promise: Scientists funded by the National Institutes \n     of Health (NIH) have recently been successful in developing a \n     candidate vaccine to combat otitis media (oh-TIGHT-iss MEE-\n     dee-ah), a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear \n     common in young children ages 3 months to 3 years.\n       Further development and testing of this candidate vaccine \n     would offer hope that children might be spared the severe \n     pain and sometimes serious side-effects of these middle ear \n     infections. A useful vaccine could also significantly reduce \n     the estimated health care costs of this disease--$1 billion \n     annually.\n       The Next Steps: Having developed a promising candidate \n     vaccine, scientists are now ready to progress into the \n     testing phase, initially in animals and later in children, \n     looking first at safety and in later stages for clinical \n     effectiveness.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: It is estimated that a reduction \n     in the budget at this time would delay development of a \n     clinically useful vaccine by three years.\n       Comment: Otitis media is the major reason cited for taking \n     a young child to the emergency room or to a physician's \n     office and is the most frequent reason that doctors prescribe \n     antibiotics for children. The disease causes little children \n     and their families great distress. Each year of delay in the \n     development of a vaccine costs the country $1 billion in \n     health care bills. Securing a vaccine to fight otitis media \n     would reduce this toll on children, their families and the \n     health care system.\n       Parkinson's Disease: New treatments for degenerating nerve \n     cells.\n       The Promise: Parkinson's disease is caused by the \n     degeneration of the cells that make dopamine, a chemical \n     messenger in the brain. Lack of dopamine produces tremor, \n     rigidity, gait abnormalities, and often changes in behavior. \n     Replacement of the missing neurotransmitter, dopamine, with \n     L-dopa has a limited effect and undesirable side effects.\n       Researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH) have discovered a drug, deprenyl, which delays the need \n     for L-dopa therapy in Parkinson's disease patients, thereby \n     significantly improving their quality of life. In addition, \n     possible surgical intervention and other new treatment \n     developments--including growth factors--are on the horizon.\n       The Next Steps: Scientists are ready to:\n       Develop new drugs with fewer side effects, building on \n     deprenyl;\n       Evaluate surgery that restores brain functions impaired by \n     the disease and surgical methods to implant dopamine-\n     producing cells;\n       Assess whether a recently discovered growth factor can \n     restore function by protecting dopamine-producing cells; and\n       Develop new methods, using biotechnology and genetic \n     engineering, to deliver treatments to the targeted cells.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: Budget cuts would slow the basic \n     and applied research that has led to the first real progress \n     against Parkinson's in forty years. Clinical trials of \n     promising treatments would have to be delayed and the \n     momentum created by the discovery of deprenyl would be lost.\n       A budget cut would diminish the hopes of the approximately \n     500,000 Americans--one percent of those over 50--who suffer \n     from Parkinson's disease. The economic burden of Parkinson's \n     disease, currently estimated at $6 billion per year, will \n     only increase as the U.S. population ages.\n       Prostate Cancer: New discoveries may lead to clinical \n     advances.\n       The Promise: Clinical advances in prostate cancer have been \n     slow in coming, but recent new discoveries offer hope:\n       Some useful animal models of the disease have been found;\n       The drug finasteride (Proscar), which is useful in \n     controlling a non-cancerous prostate condition that may be a \n     precursor to prostate cancer, could offer a way to prevent \n     the cancer;\n       Male sex hormones have been shown to exert a strong \n     influence on the prostate, and new reports indicate that \n     mutations occur in receptor genes for male sex hormones when \n     prostate cancer worsens; and\n       Chemical markers--such as the prostate specific antigen (or \n     PSA)--show promise for diagnosing prostate cancer.\n       The Next Steps: NIH-supported scientists have recently \n     begun studies of: [[Page S7462]] \n       The role of oncogenes (cancer-causing genes) and suppressor \n     (cancer-blocking) genes in transforming a normal prostate \n     cell into a malignant cancer cell that can be spread \n     throughout the body;\n       The roles of the male hormone (androgen) and its receptor \n     in the transition of prostate cancers from hormone \n     sensitivity to hormone resistance;\n       Hormone treatment in combination with surgery in an attempt \n     to develop better therapy;\n       The drug finasteride (Proscar) to prevent prostate cancer \n     in human trials; and\n       Diagnosis of prostate cancer using a blood test to detect \n     prostate specific antigen (PSA) in combination with \n     ultrasound.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A budget cut would curtail or \n     significantly slow all of these studies. This will, in turn, \n     inhibit development of new and improved methods of \n     prevention, early diagnosis and treatment for this very \n     serious disease.\n       Comment: Prostate cancer, although it receives less \n     attention than breast cancer, is a significant public health \n     problem. New, promising leads should be followed so as to \n     have an impact on this disease. This year 244,000 American \n     men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Some 40,400 \n     deaths will occur this year as a result of metastatic disease \n     (the spread of cancer throughout the body) due to prostate \n     cancer.\n       Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Topical microbicides for \n     women could reduce the spread of HIV [the AIDS virus] and \n     other sexually transmitted diseases.\n       The Promise: Scientists supported by the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) are researching safe, effective \n     ``topical microbicides'' which may be applied by women to \n     block the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases \n     (STDs). Currently several promising topical microbicides are \n     being evaluated that kill the infectious microbes that cause \n     HIV and other STDs. The successful development of these \n     products will enable women to take control of their own \n     reproductive health and significantly reduce the incidence of \n     STDS, including HIV.\n       The Next Steps: Evaluation of these promising topical \n     agents requires clinical trials to prove that a proposed \n     microbicide is both safe and effective. Development of better \n     microbicide products based on the results of these trials, as \n     well as further basic research in the laboratory is also a \n     part of the overall research program.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A budget cut would significantly \n     impair the ability of the NIH to move these products from the \n     laboratory into clinical trials. This would result in a delay \n     in making safe and effective topical microbicides available \n     to women, and thereby diminish any impact on the current \n     epidemic of STDs and HIV. The significant cost savings and \n     the reduction in illness and death associated with STDs and \n     HIV will be severely delayed and possibly lost entirely.\n       Comment: A sexually transmitted disease, including HIV, is \n     acquired each year by an estimated 12 million Americans--a \n     disproportionate number of whom are women. Adolescents and \n     young adults under 25 account for 63 percent of these cases. \n     STDs account for over $6 billion in health care costs alone. \n     Up to forty percent of women with certain forms of STDs \n     become infertile. STDs contribute excessively to illnesses, \n     deaths, and health care costs among women as well as among \n     newborns, who can be infected before or during birth.\n       Topical microbicides would greatly increase the empowerment \n     of women in the prevention of all sexually transmitted \n     diseases, including AIDS.\n       Sickle Cell Disease: The first effective treatment nearly \n     ready for wide application\n       The Promise: People who suffer the painful, debilitating \n     effects of sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder \n     that primarily affects African-Americans, can now look \n     forward to a better quality of life.\n       After many years of research investment, scientists \n     supported by the National Institutes of Health (HIH) this \n     year developed the first effective treatment for the disease.\n       A drug--hydroxyurea (hy-DROX-ee-urEE-ah)--relieves the pain \n     and reduces by half the number of episodes or ``crises'' \n     afflicting people with sickle cell disease.\n       The drug was also proven to reduce the number of blood \n     transfusions and hospitalizations for sickle cell ``crises'', \n     which are estimated to cost about $350 million annually.\n       The Next Steps: Having proven success in treating adults \n     with sickle cell disease, medical scientists are now ready to \n     test the drug in children. The challenge is to test whether \n     the drug is as effective in children as in adults, and \n     whether the drug harms growing children.\n       Additional clinical studies are needed to find the optimal \n     dosage, consider long-term effects of the drug, and look at \n     combination therapy to improve treatment further.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A reduction in funding would put a \n     hold on the availability of this promising treatment for \n     children, because the needed clinical studies would be \n     slowed. This would prolong the suffering of both the children \n     and their families. The likely reduction in health care costs \n     would not materialize.\n       Comment: Thanks to 20 years of research investment, tens of \n     thousands of adults who suffer from the excruciating pain of \n     sickle cell disease now have hope for relief. We cannot turn \n     our backs on children who might also benefit from treatment.\n       STEM CELL RESEARCH: A revolutionary approach to a variety \n     of diseases\n       The Promise: Bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy \n     are currently being used to treat disease, but their utility \n     is limited by the availability of blood stem cells.\n       Scientists are beginning to understand and harness the \n     incredible promise of stem cells--cells that give rise to all \n     the different cells found in blood. These stem cells may make \n     ideal ``universal donor cells'' because they maintain the \n     capability for cell division and can accept genes from other \n     cells.\n       Recently, scientists have learned how better to isolate \n     these cells, not only from bone marrow, but also from \n     umbilical and peripheral blood. They have also learned how to \n     increase the number of stem cells produced in animal models \n     and in human volunteers.\n       There is great hope that stem cells can be used to:\n       Improve the prospects for people--such as those with \n     aplastic anemia, a serious blood disorder--waiting for \n     suitable bone marrow donors; the goal is to perform \n     transplants from sources other than bone marrow, perhaps from \n     blood itself;\n       Re-populate blood cells necessarily killed off when cancer \n     patients undergo life-saving chemotherapy; and\n       Advance human gene therapy for patients with genetic \n     disorders, AIDS and cancer.\n       The Next Steps: Scientists supported by the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) are eager to move quickly to:\n       Search for sources of stem cells and test their usefulness \n     for patients;\n       Explore potential for using stem cells for gene therapy;\n       Continue basic research to better understand how blood is \n     formed; and\n       Create special facilities needed to isolate and grow stem \n     cells under sterile conditions so they can be used in \n     patients.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A budget reduction would mean that \n     the research--both basic and clinical--would move more slowly \n     and the clinical payoffs would be significantly delayed. A \n     delay would deny the great potential of this revolutionary \n     approach.\n       Stroke: Preventing stroke and limiting brain damage.\n       The Promise: Research supported by the National Institutes \n     of Health (NIH) has recently provided important new advances \n     and insights:\n       Surgery to open blocked arteries in the neck can prevent \n     stroke or stroke death;\n       Aspirin can protect against stroke in certain patients; and\n       New treatments to protect brain cells from damage during \n     stroke are emerging from animals studies\n       The Next Steps: Further research could show how to prevent \n     more strokes, limit brain damage when stroke occurs, and help \n     people regain normal life after a stroke.\n       Scientists are ready to begin new studies in patients to:\n       Compare drug treatment and surgical approaches to episodes \n     of bleeding within the brain;\n       Learn more about differences in stroke and in optimal \n     treatment for stroke in different racial groups; and\n       Refine ways to reduce the occurrence and severity of brain \n     bleeding in low birth weight infants.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A reduction in the budget would \n     come just as scientists are poised to take a new approach by \n     aggressively treating acute stroke to prevent brain damage.\n       Basic research would be curtained just as promising new \n     opportunities are coming to light, such as the effects of \n     vitamin supplements, clot-dissolving medications, and agents \n     such as calcium channel blockers to protect brain cells.\n       Comment: Research has brought us a dramatic decline in \n     stroke death in the U.S. in the last 25 years, but stroke is \n     still the third leading cause of death. Every year, over \n     500,000 Americans experience a stroke and many are left \n     disabled, costing more than $25 billion annually for medical \n     treatment, rehabilitation, long-term care, and lost wages. \n     These numbers and costs will only increase as the U.S. \n     population ages.\n       Additional research--capitalizing on scientific \n     opportunities--can help us learn how to prevent stroke and \n     limit its damage when it does occur.\n         Vaccines to Prevent Stomach Ulcers and Stomach Cancer\n\n       The Promise: Tremendous opportunity now exists for \n     scientists supported by the National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH) to develop a vaccine to prevent gastric (stomach) ulcer \n     and to create the possibility of preventing stomach cancer.\n       This opportunity flows from the recent discovery that \n     stomach ulcers are caused by a bacterium, H. pylori (pie-LOR-\n     ee), and that recurrence of ulcers can be prevented with a \n     simple antibiotic treatment. This finding can save an \n     estimated $400-$800 million annually by preventing ulcer \n     recurrence alone.\n       It is also known that H. pylori is strongly linked to \n     stomach cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer death \n     throughout the world. Today only about 18 percent of patients \n     survive stomach cancer in the U.S., where there are 23,000 \n     cases per year.\n       The Next Steps: Scientists are now ready to:\n       Isolate the genes from the bacterium in order to develop a \n     vaccine;\n       Study how the bacterium might cause cancer; and\n       Follow up on preliminary evidence that other types of H. \n     pylori may cause other intestinal cancers such as liver \n     cancer. [[Page S7463]] \n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A reduction in the budget would \n     impede scientists' ability to pursue the many steps needed to \n     develop a vaccine against H. pylori, conduct critical human \n     trials on ulcer prevention, and understand more fully the \n     role of the bacterium in various cancers and how to prevent \n     them.\n       A budget reduction would diminish the number of scientists \n     working on this important problem. Cuts would delay by years \n     the development of a simple vaccine that might bring life-\n     long protection from some of the most deadly cancers.\n       Comment: Recent understanding that stomach ulcers, and \n     probably stomach cancers, are caused by a bacterium offers \n     tremendous opportunity to develop a protective vaccine. We \n     should not turn our backs on this opportunity to have a major \n     impact on a serious public health problem.\n       Schizophrenia: Identifying the genetic factors involved in \n     the onset of Schizophrenia.\n       The Promise: In the past few months, NIH-supported \n     scientists reported and subsequently verified that a specific \n     gene located on chromosome 6 is one trigger to the \n     expression, or onset, of schizophrenia. While more than one \n     gene is likely to have a role in causing this complex \n     disease, this finding is of major importance to researchers \n     seeking to develop more effective methods to diagnose, treat, \n     and even prevent schizophrenia.\n       The Next Steps: For the first time, because of advanced \n     genetic research and the possibility of locating the family \n     of genes that underlay the vulnerability to schizophrenia, it \n     may be ultimately possible to prevent a mental illness. This \n     concept was virtually unthinkable 5 years ago. Having located \n     a single gene loci associated with schizophrenia, it is vital \n     that we pursue this lead aggressively to search for other \n     relevant genes. In this manner, the complexity of this \n     disease will be delineated and heretofore unknown approaches \n     to treatment and prevention will be elucidated.\n       Effects of a Budget Cut: A budget cut at this time would \n     have the effect of extending by years efforts to devise and \n     apply molecular genetic strategies to the prevention of \n     schizophrenia.\n       Comment: Schizophrenia, the most devastating mental \n     illness, affects approximately 2 million Americans annually. \n     Although there is no known single cause, scientists believe \n     that genetic factors produce a vulnerability that may be \n     triggered by environmental factors. Most currently available \n     medications are only palliative and have severe side effects. \n     In addition to the distress and disability caused by \n     schizophrenia, the financial cost to society is great: \n     treatment costs alone exceed $7 billion per year, and social \n     costs are estimated to be $20 billion annually.\n                             change of vote\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on rollcall 229 I voted no. It was my \nintention to vote yes. It was a tabling motion.\n  Therefore I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my \nvote. This will in no way change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senate \nconcurrent resolution 13, the fiscal year 1996 congressional budget \nresolution.\n  I want to commend the hard work undertaken, and the excellent results \nobtained, by the chairman of the Budget Committee, the senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico [Mr. Domenici]. We all know that his expertise in \nbudget matters is unequalled and that he has great respect within this \nbody and without as an opponent of deficit spending. I also appreciate \nhow he has sought to work with and accommodate Senators with a wide \nvariety of concerns.\n  This budget is not perfect; but then, no document produced by a \ncommittee--or a Senate--ever is. It is a good budget. More importantly, \nit is an essential budget, because it is a balanced budget.\n  My perfect budget would have included instructions for tax relief \nthat is pro-family, pro-saving, pro-investment, and pro-economic \ngrowth.\n  We had a chance to vote on such a package yesterday, in the amendment \noffered by Senator Gramm of Texas. That amendment was similar to the \nContract With America tax relief bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. It was also similar to the Coats-Grams-Craig bill, S. \n568, the first bill--the Family, Investment, Retirement, Savings, and \nTax Fairness Act.\n  I'm disappointed that the Gramm amendment was not adopted. But I \napplaud Senator Domenici for designating a ``fiscal dividend'' reserve \nfund that takes the additional deficit reduction and surpluses expected \nunder this budget, which will come from an improved economy and lower \ninterest rates, and dedicates them to tax relief.\n  Senators have spent much time these last few days debating over this \nand many other budget priorities. This is what should happen when we \nconsider a budget resolution. But this budget fulfills what is, by far, \nthe single most important priority:\n  It sets us firmly on a course toward a balanced budget by the year \n2002.\n  For most of our Nation's history, the moral imperative to balance the \nbudget was considered part of what has been called our ``unwritten \nconstitution''--those traditions so firmly imbedded in the American \nsystem, like political parties and the actual operation of the \nelectoral college that they have the status of virtual constitutional \nstatus. For more than 60 years now, and especially over the last 30 \nyears, this balanced budget rule has been repealed.\n  Because Congresses and Presidents did not have to set priorities, \nevery item of spending has been treated like a priority. To qualify, an \nitem needs only some well-intentioned supporters. We all know what has \nhappened as a result:\n  The sum total of these individually pleasant programs exceeds the \ncapacity or the willingness of the American people to pay for all of \nthem.\n  Without a binding requirement, or at least an extraordinary \ncommitment, to balance the budget, there is no constituency to limit \nspending to the amount the American people are willing or able to pay \nin taxes.\n  This dynamic has become a systemic problem, a fundamental flaw, in \nhow our Government operates. It has led us to the point where the \nGovernment has saddled its citizens with almost $5 trillion in debt. It \nhas put the economic security of every American on a collision course \nwith catastrophe.\n  This isn't just one Senator or one political party talking. The \nrealization is bipartisan. The status quo is the least tolerable \nalternative. The experts agree:\n  The General Accounting Office's 1992 report, entitled Prompt Action \nNecessary to Avert Long-Term Damage to the Economy, said, ``[I]naction \nis not a sustainable policy. * * * [T]he Nation cannot continue on the \ncurrent path.''\n  The Bipartisan Entitlement Commission's Final Report, issued in \nJanuary of this year, said, ``The present trend is not sustainable.''\n  DRI/McGraw-Hill, one of the world's leading economic forecasting \nfirms, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee in January, \nsaid, ``[T]he current economic strength is not sustainable. * * * A \nbalanced budget would be a major boost to the long-term growth of the \nU.S. economy.''\n  This is the year, and this is the budget, in which Congress finally \nmakes that extraordinary commitment necessary to balance the budget.\n  By definition, an extraordinary commitment is not permanent. That's \nwhy we still will need to return to, and pass, the balanced budget \namendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  When we debated that amendment on the floor of the Senate earlier \nthis year, opponents said, ``You don't need a constitutional amendment; \nall you need is the political will.'' They also raised the taunt, \n``Where's your plan? Show us which way you'll balance the budget.''\n  Well, the first Republican Congress in 40 years is showing the \nprofessional skeptics in Washington, DC, and the people across America \nthat it has the will and the way.\n  This budget resolution is a blueprint for hope, full of promise for \ncurrent and future generations. This budget is the one that will \nrestore opportunity and growth. This is the budget for America's \nfuture.\n  My colleagues know, and it is important to remind others watching, \nthat a budget resolution is just a blueprint. The details will be \nfilled in during the coming weeks and months by the Appropriations \nCommittee and the various authorizing committees. I, for one, look \nforward to carrying this process forward within my assignments on the \nAgriculture, Energy, and Veterans Affairs Committees.\n  There's been plenty of blame to go around for not balancing the \nbudget. That blame has extended, for years, to both political parties \nand both the legislative and executive branches of Government. With \ntoday's vote, we will see if the solution is bipartisan, as it should \nbe and as I hope it is.\n  In the coming weeks, we will see if the President is willing to \nbecome part [[Page S7464]] of the solution. I was sad to see the \nPresident become a conscientious objector to the war on deficit \nspending when he submitted his official budget this past February.\n  The law said the President had to submit a budget, so he did. But \nthat budget dodged responsibility, dodged deficit reduction, and \ndeclared unconditional surrender to bigger deficits and more debt as \nfar as the eye could see. In contrast, the budget before us today \nenlists, fights, and promises to win the war on the deficit.\n  The President still will have the chance to choose whether to be a \nfiscal freedom fighter or a member of the status quo resistance. \nCongress will give him that chance in the coming weeks as we send him \n13 appropriations bills and a budget reconciliation bill. Those bills, \ntaken all together, will enact into law a 7-year plan that finally, in \nfiscal year 2002, for the first time in 33 years, and only the second \ntime in 42 years, will balance the budget.\n  It's very tempting to make the perfect into the enemy of the very \ngood. And probably not one Senator thinks this budget is perfect. Many \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have come to the floor \nto say how much they are for balancing the budget. Then they add that \none little word, those three little letters, that cause so much \nmischief in this town: ``B-U-T.'' We keep hearing, ``I'm for a balanced \nbudget, but * * *.''\n  Maybe they think 7 years is too soon. Or too late. Or they say it's \nnot really balanced unless you don't count Social Security. Or they \nwant to take interest savings that aren't officially counted yet and \nuse that for more social spending. Or they don't want to rescue and \nreform a Medicare System that is on the verge of bankruptcy. Or they \ndemand the cart come before the horse and they want Medicare to be \ncompletely overhauled before we assume in a budget blueprint that it's \ngoing to be overhauled. Or they do want to reform Medicare, but not \nwithout the Federal Government taking over everybody's health care, or \nthe list goes on.\n  The easy thing is to vote no and say you wished someone had given you \nsomething on which to vote yes. There are always excuses available, if \nyou want to say you're for a balanced budget but you want to vote \nagainst the real balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, the only balanced budget that counts is the one that \npasses, the one that can be translated into binding law as the budget \nprocess continues this summer.\n  A balanced budget is not an abstract goal or a political sound bite. \nIt's an absolute necessity.\n  The vote that counts today is a ``yes'' vote on final passage of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 13. I'm proud to cast that vote. I'm proud \nof the Budget Committee for writing a fair, reasonable, balanced budget \nresolution. I expect to be proud of the Senate when the vote is \ncomplete, and I believe the American people will feel the same way.\n  Mr. President, I spoke briefly on Monday about what I consider the \ntop ten reasons why the budget must be balanced, as it will be under \nthis resolution. I would like to reiterate some of those points now, \nand expand on why this conclusion is inescapable.\n\n\nthe top ten reasons to pass senate concurrent resolution 13 and balance \n                               the budget\n\n                       10. the will of the people\n\n  A vote for the balanced budget resolution is the vote consistent with \nthe will of the American people that the Federal Government get its \nhouse in order: 70 percent in some polls, 80 percent-plus in others.\n\n\n                        9. reasonable glidepath\n\n  Under this budget resolution, overall spending still increases 3 \npercent a year through 2002, compared with the current rate of 5.4 \npercent a year.\n  The real dividend comes after a successful glidepath to balance. \nAfter fiscal year 2002, all it takes to keep the budget balanced is to \nmatch future spending growth to revenue growth. That would again allow \nmore than 5.2 percent a year growth in spending after 2002, based on \nCBO projections.\n  It is critical to keep in mind: balancing the budget will be easier \nnow than it will be later.\n  In the mid-1980's, a glidepath comparable to that in Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 13 would have produced a balanced budget within 2 \nto 4 years. Now, it will take 7 years. The longer we wait, the harder \nit will get to balance the budget ever. Anyone who has any experience \nwith debt accumulation understands why. Anyone who understands the \nexplosive growth in Federal programs under current trends understands \nwhy.\n  This year, fiscal year 1995,\n  The $175 billion Federal budget deficit is 11.4 percent of total \noutlays, 12.9 percent of revenues, and 2.5 percent of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Total revenues are enough to cover all entitlement spending plus \ninterest payments plus 68 percent of discretionary spending, in other \nwords, enough to cover 88.5 percent of outlays.\n  Total Federal outlays are 21.8 percent of GDP.\n  According to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, \nunder current trends, by the year 2030:\n  The deficit will be almost 50 percent of outlays and almost 19 \npercent of GDP.\n  ``Projected spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and \nFederal employee retirement programs alone will consume all tax \nrevenues collected by the Federal Government.'' That is, revenues will \ncover barely 50 percent of all outlays.\n  Total Federal outlays could exceed 37 percent of the economy.\n  This is why a number of us have said during this debate that this is \nnot only our best chance of passing a balanced budget--it may be our \nlast.\n\n\n            8. preserving flexibility to address priorities\n\n  Families and businesses understand that, if you have discipline in \nthe short term, if you forego instant gratification, you will have more \nlater, more money and more options.\n  The increasing share of the Federal budget consumed by interest \npayments on the debt means a decreasing share which Congress controls, \never-higher taxes, or both.\n  More debt means more interest payments on that debt. Interest costs \nsqueeze other spending priorities and threaten to swallow the options \nof our kids and grandchildren.\n  Already, by fiscal year 1994, net interest payments were five and \none-half times as much as outlays for all education, job training, and \nemployment programs combined.\n  GAO's 1992 report found that, if current policies continue, Congress \nmay be forced to enact one-half trillion dollars in deficit reduction \neach year just to hold annual deficits to a constant 3 percent of GDP.\n  According to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform:\n  If current trends continue, by the year 2030 net interest payments \nwill consume 30 percent of the Federal budget--double the rate of \ntoday.\n  Under current trends, net interest payments on the Federal debt will \nmore than triple as a percentage of GDP. Net interest is currently 3.3 \npercent of GDP and is projected at more than 10 percent of GDP by 2030.\n  Beyond the deficit reduction already built into this budget \nresolution, CBO has acknowledged a possible $170 billion ``reserve \nfund,'' or ``Domenici dividend,'' in debt service savings and increased \nrevenues from economic growth. This could result in an additional $170 \nbillion in deficit reduction and surpluses over 7 years, which frees up \nmore money for other budget priorities, such as tax relief.\n  DRI/McGraw-Hill went even further, saying that, by 2002, half of all \nthe $1 trillion in spending restraint necessary to balance the budget \ncould come from interest savings alone.\n\n\n         7. stopping the regressive/overseas transfer of wealth\n\n  Interest on the Federal debt is largely a transfer from middle-income \ntaxpayers to large institutions, wealthy individuals and foreign \ninvestors.\n  In fiscal year 1994, 22.8 percent, $44.5 billion, of the interest on \ndebt held by the public was paid to foreign investors. Also in fiscal \nyear 1994, 33.9 percent--$62.6 billion--of the dollars borrowed from \nthe public came from overseas.\n  Interest on the Federal debt is actually the biggest foreign aid \nprogram in history. In fact, these payments amount to more than twice \nthe amount spent on everything in the international affairs budget \nfunction, $17.1 billion in fiscal year 1994, $18.9 billion in fiscal \nyear 1995.\n  I do not mean to imply here that there is anything wrong with being \n[[Page S7465]] wealthy, a lender, or investor. To the contrary, these \npersons supply the capital that creates jobs, raises living standards, \nand legitimately finances the Government in time of war or dire \nemergency.\n  But it is unfair to taxpayers, and bad for the entire economy, for \nwealth to be arbitrarily and artificially redistributed through \ninterest payments on a growing and excessive debt that has been \naccumulated over the decades, merely because spending and borrowing was \nthe course of least political resistance.\n  This actually was one of the reasons why the original Jeffersonian \nRepublicans were so opposed to Government indebtedness. The \nRepublicans, representing them, as now, farmers, merchants, and other \nworking Americans, did not want to see the fruits of their labors taxed \nexcessively to pay interest to the monied class, represented by the \nbig-government Federalists.\n\n\n                    6. interest rates and investment\n\n  Lower interest rates and greater economic growth, of course, do not \nbenefit only the Federal budget, but all Americans.\n  In an appendix to its April ``Analysis of the President's Budgetary \nProposals,'' CBO discussed the drop in interest rates that could result \nfrom balancing the budget, noting:\n\n       Good arguments exist for * * * a range of from 100 to 200 \n     basis points. A drop of that magnitude from CBO's baseline \n     forecast would leave real long-term rates at between 1 and 2 \n     percent--lower than they have been since the 1950's--and real \n     short-term rates close to zero * * * (R)eal short-term \n     interest rates have already been as low as zero.\n       One widely used model, developed by Data Resources, Inc. \n     (DRI), predicts an exceptionally large drop in interest rates \n     as the deficit falls, nearly 400 basis points * * *.\n\n  We know what these interest-rate drops mean to American families: \nbuying a house, buying a car, or financing a college education would be \nmore affordable than today, by hundreds and even thousands of dollars.\n  DRI/McGraw-Hill says that balancing the budget could result in \nnonresidential investment increasing 4 to 5 percent by 2002, over what \nit would be with today's $200 billion annual deficits.\n\n\n                           5. economic growth\n\n  Balancing the budget means preserving, in the near term and \nespecially for our children, the American dream of economic \nopportunity. The damage being done by the borrow-and-spend status quo \nmust be stopped. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed \nthat America lost 5 percent growth in GNP--and 3.75 million jobs--from \n1978-89 because of deficit and debt. DRI/McGraw-Hill estimates that \nbalancing the budget by fiscal year 2002 would raise real gross \nnational product by about 2.5 percent. That means putting about $1,000 \na year into the average household's pockets, at today's prices, by \n2005.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has cited a Laurence H. Meyer & \nAssociates study showing that economic output would rise between 1 to \n1.6 percent within 5 years after balancing the budget.\n  Even the Congressional Budget Office, using a more cautious model, \nprojects a GNP in 2002 that is 0.8 percent--almost 1 percent--higher \nthan in its baseline projections.\n  The idea that balanced budgets produce economic growth is not a new \none. More than 160 years ago, President Andrew Jackson said:\n\n       Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our \n     population will be relieved from a considerable portion of \n     its present burdens and will find not only new motives to \n     patriotic affection, but additional means for the display of \n     individual enterprise.\n\n\n                             4. lower taxes\n\n  Balancing the budget and keeping it balanced will remove pressure for \nfuture tax increases. Since every dollar borrowed today has to be \nrepaid eventually, with interest, the status quo promises ruinous \nlevels of taxation in the future.\n  According to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, for every year \nin which the Federal Government runs a $200 billion deficit, the \naverage child of today will pay $5,000 in additional taxes over his or \nher lifetime. The status quo and the Clinton budget show deficits that \nlarge and larger for as long as the eye can see.\n  President Clinton's fiscal year 1995 budget included a section on \n``generational accounting.'' It projected that failure to change \ncurrent trends will force generations to face a lifetime net tax rate \nof 82 percent to pay off the current generation's bills, counting taxes \nat all levels of government.\n\n\n                         3. protecting seniors\n\n  The debt is the threat to Social Security, Medicare, and the economic \nsecurity of seniors on fixed incomes.\n  Gross interest payments on debt are the second largest single \nspending item for the Federal Government, and under the status quo or \nthe President's budget, would overtake Social Security within a few \nyears.\n  Growing interest payments crowd out other spending, regardless of \nwhether an item is off-budget or on-budget or financed through a trust \nfund. When the Government faces the need to make good on its \nobligations, its ability to do so is going to be affected by the total \ndebt load it is carrying.\n  More debt and a bigger chunk of the budget going for interest \npayments ultimately threatens the Government's ability to pay for \nanything else.\n  This becomes more obvious and more true when we remember that, under \ncurrent trends: Medicare goes into deficit in 1996 and runs out of \nmoney in 2002; and Social Security taxes no longer cover benefits in \n2013, the system goes into deficit in 2019, and it runs out of money in \n2029.\n\n\n                                2. jobs\n\n  DRI/McGraw-Hill projects that balancing the Federal budget can create \n2.5 million new jobs by 2002.\n  The last Federal balanced budget was in 1969. According to Investor's \nBusiness Daily, unemployment from 1970-1990 averaged 6.7 percent as \ncompared to the post-war period as a whole which was 5.7 percent. In \nthe first three decades of this century, before deficit spending was \nthe rule and not the exception, unemployment averaged 4.5 percent.\n\n\n                            1. our children\n\n  The future for our children and grandchildren depends on the future \nof the economy.\n  The General Accounting Office, in its 1992 report, showed gains in \nstandard of living of between 7 percent and 36 percent in 2020 \nresulting from balanced Federal budgets. More recent economic and \nbudget developments would still keep projections well within this \nrange.\n  In fact, remembering the late 1970's, there's every reason to believe \nthat the borrow-and-spend trends of the status quo and the President's \nbudget would provoke a return of high interest rates and make GAO's \n``no action'' scenario positively optimistic.\n  We all have become familiar with Thomas Jefferson's admonition in \nthis regard:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  Now is the time to act on that principle, by passing Senate \nCongressional Resolution 13, the balanced budget resolution.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I would like to preface my remarks by \ncommending Senator Domenici for his efforts to help tame the Federal \nGovernment's runaway deficits.\n  As you know, Mr. President, under 12 years of Republican \nadministrations, the Federal debt quintupled. In 1980, when Republicans \ntook over both the White House and the Senate, the Federal debt stood \nat about $800 billion. After 12 years of Republican leadership, the \ndebt stood at roughly $4 trillion. If it were not for the almost $200 \nbillion in interest that we pay each and every year on the debt that \nwas amassed under successive Republican administrations, we would \nalready have a balanced budget. In 1993, in order to begin to tackle \nthe problems posed by this mountain of debt, Congress passed the \nlargest deficit reduction passage in history. We did this without a \nsingle Republican joining in the effort.\n  Time and time again, I have stated that we cannot gain control over \nthe Government's fiscal crisis with gimmicks. No amendment to the \nConstitution will ever balance the budget. No rosy projections about \neconomic [[Page S7466]] growth and supply-side impacts will balance the \nbudget. Only strong and consistent leadership will balance the budget. \nIf we want to restore the Federal Government to fiscal sanity, we \ncannot abrogate our leadership responsibilities or refuse to join the \ndebate for fear of the political consequences of tough decisions. \nInstead, we must act decisively to continue to move toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  We could adopt a ``scorched earth'' approach to balancing the budget, \nslashing and burning everything which gets in our way. But what good \nhave we done for our children if we reduce their debt burden but deny \nthem a decent education and adequate health care? How much have we \nimproved our workers' ability to compete in the world economy if we \ndeny them the funding necessary to improve their skills?\n  Presenting numbers which add up to a balanced budget is one thing; \ndeciding how to reach those numbers is an altogether different task. It \nis in deciding how to reach those numbers--deciding what our priorities \nreally are--that we reveal who we are as individuals and what we stand \nfor as a nation. So, Mr. President, while I am pleased that the \nproposed budget resolution moves us toward a balanced budget, I am \nconcerned about the means used to achieve this end.\n  Mr. President, the Republicans' choices distort the principle of \nshared sacrifice. They have balanced the budget on the backs of \nchildren, students, families, and seniors. They have chosen to cut \nprograms for those most in need in our society, while asking little or \nnothing of large corporations and the wealthy.\n  Mr. President, no matter how the Republicans phrase their assault on \nMedicare, it's just that--an assault. Their cuts will force millions of \nseniors to suffer drastically reduced benefits, a much lower quality of \ncare, and significantly higher medical bills. We desperately need \nMedicare reform, but we cannot simply let seniors free-fall until these \nreforms take place.\n  The Republicans' Medicare cuts mean that, on average, seniors will \nhave to find an additional $3,447 to pay for their health care over the \nnext 7 years. For the majority of seniors, this will be no easy task. \nIn 1992, the median income of seniors in this country was only about \n$17,000 a year, and about a quarter of elderly households had incomes \nunder $10,000. These seniors already spend more than $1 of every $5 on \nmedical care. For the millions of seniors across the country who live \non fixed incomes, finding an additional $3,447 will mean sacrificing \nsomething else which is important to them. It has been stated that each \nmonth millions of American seniors are forced to choose between food \nand necessary medication. I can't help wondering how many more will be \nfaced with this horrible choice once the proposed cuts are put into \nplace.\n  In addition to higher costs, seniors are likely to have fewer \nchoices. In many cases, financial limitations will leave them with no \nchoice but to join a managed care plan. Doctors, hospitals, and others \nproviders are all likely to face even lower reimbursement rates. As a \nresult, many health care providers may no longer be able to afford to \naccept Medicare patients. Those that can will be forced to shift even \nmore costs onto their privately insured patients, creating a hidden tax \non employers and individuals.\n  Mr. President, that's just Medicare. This budget proposal also cuts \nMedicaid by $175 billion. Again, I think it is important that we all \nunderstand exactly who these cuts will affect. Medicaid now insures \nabout one of every four American children. It helps to pay for roughly \none of every three births in this country. It also provides aid to over \nthree-fifths of the people who need long-term care services, either in \nnursing homes or at home. Most elderly recipients of Medicaid are \npeople who spent their whole lives as members of the middle class. But \nwhen faced with nursing home costs averaging almost $40,000 a year, it \ndoesn't take long for their entire life's savings to disappear. Once \nthey reach this point, these people have nowhere\n else to turn. Thankfully, Medicaid has been there to provide a safety \nnet for them.\n\n  This resolution caps Federal Medicaid spending at an average annual \ngrowth rate of 5 percent. We all know that Medicaid spending is \nexpected to grow faster than that in the future. By setting a 5-percent \ncap, the Federal Government is essentially saying to the States: ``It's \nall your problem now. We can't figure out how to deal with the growing \nnumber of uninsured and the rising costs of health care, so you do it. \nWe wash our hands of any responsibility to help you deal with these \ncritical needs.'' But, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit \nthat States can't cope with these problems alone.\n  So, Mr. President, let me tell you what is expected to happen once \nthese proposed Medicaid cuts go into effect. By the year 2002, the \nnumber of uninsured children in America is predicted to rise by more \nthan 6 million. By that same year, there will be an additional 3 \nmillion persons who need, but will not receive assistance with, the \ncosts of long-term care. These individuals will not be able to obtain \nnursing home care, despite the fact that they will need more care than \ntheir family and friends will be able to provide. For those individuals \nwho will be able to enter and remain in nursing homes the picture will \nnot be much brighter. Medicaid now pays significantly less than the \nprivate sector for long-term care. When Medicaid cuts these payments \neven further--as it will have to do in response to the budget cuts--\nnursing homes will have to do even more with less. This means that \nstaff will be stretched even thinner, and each resident will receive \neven less personal attention. The proposed cuts will mean that the \nquality of life of nursing home residents will deteriorate even \nfurther.\n  There is no doubt that Medicare and Medicaid have taken the brunt of \nthe proposed cuts. But they are not the only examples of shortsighted \ncuts contained in this budget proposal. Consider the cuts to the earned \nincome tax credit and education funding. The EITC provides tax relief \nto lower income working families. By proposing to cut the EITC, this \nbudget deals a strong blow to the working families. While I strongly \nbelieve that sacrifice is needed to balance the budget, I have to ask: \nIs it fair to ask working families to make a sacrifice of this \nmagnitude at the same time the Republican budget proposals contemplate \ntax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans?\n  At the same time, this budget significantly cuts funding for student \nloans. We all recognize that we must balance the budget so that our \ncitizens will be able to compete successfully in the next century. \nWhile I agree with the need to prepare for increased global \ncompetition, it is difficult to understand how we will become more \ncompetitive without the skills and knowledge that an education \nprovides.\n  At the same time that this budget makes drastic cuts in critical \nprograms, it completely ignores the billions of dollars we spend each \nyear on special-interest tax loopholes. The tax code provides special \nexceptions that will total over $480 billion in 1996, more than double \nthe entire Federal deficit and nearly one-quarter of total Federal \nspending. Because many of these tax code provisions single out narrow \nsubclasses for benefit, the rest of us must pay more in taxes.\n  Balancing the budget will not be easy. It will require significant \nsacrifices. However, how can we argue that we are fairly balancing the \nbudget when we raise taxes on working families and make dramatic cuts \nin Medicare, Medicaid, and education, yet continue to spend billions \neach year in tax pork?\n  Mr. President, to help correct many of the problems contained in the \nRepublican budget proposal, I have offered a substitute balanced budget \nproposal. In fact, under my proposal, the Federal Government would have \na significant budget surplus by the year 2002.\n  The main difference between the proposals the Republicans and I have \noffered is in the priorities that they set. I believe that our Nation's \nfuture success will depend on the choices we make today. To ensure this \nsuccess, I believe that our priorities must be placed on our children. \nThe most important step we can take to build a better life for our \nchildren will be to balance the budget, which my proposal would do. \nHowever, in our efforts to put the budget in balance over the long run, \nwe cannot ignore the needs of our [[Page S7467]] children today. \nTherefore, my proposal would fully fund the education and child \nnutrition programs cut under the Republican proposal.\n  At the same time we are attempting to create a better future for our \nchildren, we cannot ignore the legitimate needs of older citizens \ntoday. To ensure that the elderly and the least well off in our society \nare not forced to bear the bulk of the sacrifices that balancing the \nbudget will require, my proposal restores $100 billion in Medicare \nfunding and replaces $75 billion in Medicaid cuts.\n  I would also repeal the Republican tax increase on those families \nthat are trying to work their way out of poverty. Although we need to \nbalance the Federal budget, it would be short-sighted to do so on the \nbacks of America's working and middle-class families. In the face of \ndeclining real wages and Republican proposals to cut important aid \nprograms, more and more American families are facing increasingly tough \ntimes. These are working families who need every penny of the wages \nthey earn just to make ends meet. We simply should not tax these \nfamilies into poverty by cutting the EITC.\n  My budget would pay for these changes by reducing defense spending by \njust $5 billion below the current baseline, cutting $15 billion in \nwasteful, pork-barrel spending, eliminating $46 billion in unnecessary \nagriculture subsidies, and raising the tobacco tax by $1 per pack to \nrestore much of the funds lost in the Republican Medicare cuts.\n  I would also close $197 billion in special-interest tax loopholes. My \nbudget explicitly provides that individual tax rates will not be raised \nand that the deductions for mortgage interest, charitable \ncontributions, and State and local taxes will not be affected. Instead, \nthese savings will be realized by simply slowing the rate of growth in \nspecial-interest loopholes enjoyed by corporations and the very \nwealthy. Left unchanged, between now and the year 2002, the Federal \nGovernment will spend roughly $4 trillion on tax subsidies; my proposal \nwould affect less than 5 percent of this amount.\n  Rather than reducing the deficit by singling out children, working \nfamilies, and the elderly for especially harsh treatment, I would \noffset a portion of these potential cuts by setting specific targets \nfor eliminating tax loopholes. I believe that this approach would allow \nus to balance the needs of the many with the desires of the few.\n  Mr. President, I expect that some will attempt to mischaracterize my \nefforts to close special interest tax loopholes as a tax increase. If \nthere was a special tax credit for Members of Congress, and we closed \nthat loophole, no one would claim that we were raising taxes. However, \nwhen we attempt to close tax loopholes for the oil and gas industry, \nthe agricultural industry, or other industries, we hear the champions \nof these special interests claim that we are trying to raise taxes.\n  Tax loopholes give some individuals and corporations a special \nexception from the rules that oblige everyone to share in the \nresponsibility of our national defense and protecting the young, the \naged, and the infirm. The only way to let everyone keep more of what \nthey have earned is to minimize these tax expenditures so that we can \nreduce the burden of the national debt and bring down tax rates fairly, \nfor everyone.\n  Finally, if, by balancing the budget, we realize additional savings, \nmy budget provides that these savings may be used to provide a middle-\nclass tax cut. This tax cut would not be available until after we have \nachieved the savings necessary to put us on a path toward a balanced \nbudget. It is my strongest hope that we will have these savings in \norder to provide much needed tax relief to working families in New \nJersey and across the country.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I do not expect my budget proposal to pass. \nBy asking the Defense Department, the tobacco industry, agribusiness, \nand other special interests to share in the burdens of balancing the \nbudget, my proposal takes a small bite out of a number of sacred cows. \nAs a result, I anticipate that my budget proposal will raise a good \ndeal of organized opposition. Unfortunately, unlike defense, tobacco, \nand the wealthy, most Americans cannot afford high-paid lobbyists to \nprotect their interests. So, in all likelihood, my budget proposal will \nbe defeated, average Americans will be left bearing the burden of \nbalancing the budget, and special interests will continue to enjoy all \nof their same benefits at the expense of the rest of us.\n  Mr. President, fundamentally, my budget proposal is about setting \npriorities. There's no serious disagreement between Democrats and \nRepublicans on the need to balance the budget. In fact, my proposal \nwould reduce the deficit by even more than the Republican proposal. \nHowever, the real question that my proposal raises is how we should \nbalance the budget. Either we can balance the budget by raising taxes \non working families and cutting needed assistance for children and the \nelderly--as the Republican proposal would do--or we can spread the \nburden for balancing the budget more fairly--as my proposal would do.\n  I am very pleased that our Republican colleagues have chosen to join \nthe fight to eliminate budget deficits. Again, I commend Senator \nDomenici for introducing a budget resolution which seeks to achieve \nthat goal. At the same time, however, I have serious concerns about \nmany of the specific proposals contained in this budget. I am deeply \nconcerned for our Nation's children, families, and seniors. And, I am \nconcerned that many of the cuts in the Republican budget proposal are \nnecessary because of a refusal to simply slow the rate of growth in \nspecial interest loopholes.\n  Mr. President, America needs a balanced budget. But it deserves a \nmuch better balanced budget than that proposed by our Republican \ncolleagues. The budget I have proposed will balance the budget without \nlosing sight of the obligations we have as a nation to our children, \nfamilies, and seniors.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, by voting for the amendment \noffered by Senator Conrad, I voted to balance the Federal budget by the \nyear 2002. I was pleased to work with Senator Conrad in recent days on \nhis amendment, and I am particularly pleased that it restored funds for \neducation, economic growth, job training, and environmental protection. \nSenator Conrad's amendment would have balanced the budget by making \ntough choices: it drastically slowed the increase in spending on \nMedicare and Medicaid; it froze discretionary spending, meaning no real \ngrowth in spending over the next 7 years; it closed tax loopholes and \neliminated wasteful subsidies.\n  I did not agree with every detail of this amendment, but it came \nclosest to my priorities in terms of what we need to preserve and what \nwe need to reduce or get rid of to reach the goal of a balanced budget. \nIt balanced the budget without harming our Nation's defense or reducing \nour fight against crime. It did so without slashing Government's \ncommitment to helping businesses create jobs, helping children receive \na good education, and helping protect our environment from pollution.\n  I am sorry that the amendment did not pass, but I do not regret my \ndecision to support it, because I believe achieving a balanced budget \nis essential if we are to keep our economy strong and keep hope for a \nbrighter future alive for our children.\n  After careful consideration of the budget offered by Senator \nDomenici, I decided to vote against it. I have great admiration for \nwhat he has done: he brought a serious balanced budget to the floor and \nshaped a historic debate over the direction of our country. Senator \nDomenici deserves much credit for putting us on the path toward a \nbalanced budget.\n  But I concluded the path his budget takes to achieve that goal is too \nstrewn with policies that I do not support. The worthy end does not \njustify the harsh means. I decided to oppose the Budget Committee's \nbudget because it: reduces government's key role in promoting \neducation, research, technology, and trade promotion, all of which are \ncrucial to our children's economic future; turns back the clock on \nenvironmental protection, threatening to foul our waters and beaches \nand pollute our lands; and increases the tax burden on working families \nby canceling the expansion of the earned income tax credit.\n  I could not reconcile the Budget Committee's balanced budget with the \n[[Page S7468]] steps taken to achieve that balance. If there were no \nother way to achieve a balanced budget, I would have had no choice. But \nthe Conrad Amendment proved that there is a better way.\n  One final point: this has been, for the most part, a sober, \nsubstantive debate over a serious, precedent-setting budget resolution. \nBut too much politics was being played by both parties. Unfortunately, \nsome Democrats used this occasion too frivolously by simply sniping at \nthe Budget Committee's plan for short-term, partisan gain. As a \nconsequence, they have helped reinforce an image of our party as \nreflexively committed to spending and the status quo. I also regret \nthat the leadership of the Republican party failed to reach out to \nthose of us on the other side of the aisle who share a genuine \ncommitment to a balanced budget to fashion a budget that could have won \nsubstantial bipartisan support. By acting alone, I believe they have \ngone too far.\n  This is the first step of a long process, however, and I hope we can \nbegin to work together so that, in the end, we can pass a bipartisan \nbalanced budget.\n                         the budget resolution\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, America has three deficits--not one. And we \nhave to address all three if we are to solve our fiscal and social \nproblems. We have to cut the budget and reduce the fiscal deficit, but, \nas I have said before, we also have an investment deficit and a \nspiritual deficit that require our collective commitment to retool and \nrebuild our communities, our politics, and our culture for the next \ncentury.\n  This budget, Mr. President, is wrong-headed and misdirected in \nconcept as well as in substance. It is at best myopic and at worst \ndestructive.\n  I have come, once again, to the floor to talk about the three \nAmerican deficits, not one about a commonsense approach to the budget \nand about fair cuts. These things seem to have eluded my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, and I submit that this budget proposal, Mr. \nPresident, proves it.\n  I have to say, first, I think the American people are looking for an \nhonest, truthful budget that tells them what really is being cut and \nwho will bear the burden.\n  Mr. President, we all want to eliminate the deficit. It is \nbankrupting this country, but to cut Medicare and break a generational \ncompact with American mothers and fathers who are retired and \nstruggling to make ends meet in order to pay for tax cuts for the \nwealthiest among us is not the way to do it.\n  I was both troubled and in a way amused to see, Mr. President, that \nthe Republican cuts in Medicare actually take ``choice'' in health care \naway from senior citizens. They will not be able to chose their own \ndoctors. That is exactly what my friends on the other side complained \nabout last year when they rejected the President's health care plan \nbecause working Americans would not have a choice of doctors.\n  And now, here they are doing what they said was wrong for workers \nlast year, but in their minds is apparently right for senior citizens \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, this is the height of hypocrisy. We saw television \ncommercials that played on those fears, and here we are today with \nthose same Republicans doing what they claimed a year ago was dead \nwrong.\n  If that is not a flip-flop on the fundamental issue of health care \nreform, then I don't now what is.\n  Let me say a few things about Medicare, Mr. President.\n  Medicare was a Democratic compact and I--for one--will not trade it \nfor an ill-conceived attempt to score political points.\n  It is a bedrock program that provides adequate health care to one out \nof every seven Americans--that's 38.3 million people--38.3 million \nAmericans who worked hard, played by the rules, and made plans based on \nour contract with them, and we won't break it.\n  Without these benefits many if not most of our seniors would have \nlimited access to adequate care, and in many cases no treatment at all.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to Medicare, turning our back on our \ncommitment to the elderly and disabled by asking them to pay almost \n$900 more per year in premiums, $1200 for home health services, and \n$100 more per year to meet their deductible may be what the Republicans \nthink they need to do to keep their promise to protect the wealthiest \nand the strongest in this society, but it is not part of the Democratic \ncommitment to protect average, hard-working Americans.\n  That is not to say that Medicare doesn't need to be fixed, but this \nis not how we ought to fix it.\n  Mr. President, I find it very interesting that the proposed cuts in \nthe Medicare program under this Republican plan virtually equal the \ntotal amount the Republicans have budgeted for a tax cut for the \nwealthy.\n  They have to break a promise to millions of Americans who live on \nfixed incomes and have made careful plans based on our commitment to \nthem to achieve their goal.\n  It is absolutely outrageous. It is fundamentally unfair. And it's \njust plain wrong.\n  We need to fix the system, Mr. President, but fixing it does not mean \nusing it to balance the budget or win some ideological points.\n  The system is, indeed, costly. This year's estimated Medicare \nexpenditures will be 10.4 percent higher than last year. But that is \nnot the function of government largesse. It is the function of a number \nof factors: including a rapidly aging population resulting in more \nbeneficiaries, increases in the costs of medical procedures, \ninefficiencies in the utilization of medical services, and the costs of \nnew technologies for increased medical care.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. President, Democrats supported \ncomprehensive health care reform last year, and my colleagues on the \nother side took a walk on it; and now I am amazed to hear my colleagues \ndemanding that the Democrats should take the lead on the budget and do \nsomething about health care costs.\n  We did, and they said no. Now it is time for them--now that they are \nin the majority--to stand and deliver.\n  The truth is that the President's proposals to accomplish this last \nyear were shot down by the Republicans without their offering even a \nsingle alternative--and despite all the publicity of the Contract With \nAmerica, it has not produced even the beginnings of a broad health care \nreform proposal, much less a comprehensive plan this year.\n  Mr. President, it has been my belief that we must gain control over \nthe increases in Medicare costs. But it should be done in the context \nof comprehensive reform of our health care system, not by willy-nilly \ncutting benefits to the elderly.\n  The problem with Medicare is nothing new. It has been articulated by \nthe trustees, and by every responsible government official. For this \nreason, Mr. President, when this latest political effort to trade \nMedicare for tax cuts is over, I anticipate that this Congress, \nRepublicans and Democrats, will support a broad range of bi-partisan \nreforms that will make the Medicare trust fund solvent--just as we did \nfor Social Security in 1981.\n  I do not support dumping those problems on the States, or \nthoughtlessly cutting eligibility for these programs or the services \nthey finance for the elderly.\n  And I am not for cutting reimbursement rates to providers so deeply \nthat they leave the program, go out of business, or simply shift costs \nto individuals who pay for their care directly or with private \ninsurance.\n  Mr. President, I will support only thoughtfully-devised approaches \ndesigned to address these six basic reforms to Medicare: eliminate \nunneeded care and treatment; put a stop to paying for ineffective \ntreatments; increase inefficiency of the entire medical care delivery \nsystem; emphasize preventive rather than remedial care; emphasize \noutpatient rather than inpatient care; and implement financial reforms \nthat build-in disincentives to excessive use of medical services \nwithout inhibiting needed preventive care.\n  Any plan that addresses these six basic areas will represent the kind \nof comprehensive reform we need.\n  But, Mr. President, we must approach reform intelligently and \ncompassionately with a deep and abiding regard for the promises we've \nmade to elderly Americans who have reached the age of 65 and have \nplanned on Medicare benefits.\n  Medicare needs to be fixed--not raided. [[Page S7469]] \n  Having said that Mr. President, I believe that Medicare is hardly the \nonly problem with this proposed budget.\n  I have said on this floor, and I will say it again, that we face an \nenormous fiscal deficit and I am prepared to make the cuts necessary to \nreduce the deficit and avoid bankrupting our children and \ngrandchildren, if they pass the fairness test and the common sense \ntests.\n  But I want to discuss how this budget fails to address the two other \nAmerican deficits.\n  Yes, we face a growing fiscal deficit, but we also face a growing\n   investment deficit and a growing spiritual deficit, and this budget \nis wrongheaded in not understanding or appreciating the significance \nand interrelation of the three American deficits that are ruining this \nnation.\n\n  As much as we need to reduce the fiscal deficit we also need to \nincrease living standards, create jobs, educate our children and our \nworkforce, and preserve and protect the quality of life that \ngenerations of Americans have come to expect.\n  I believe the budget debate should focus on attacking all three of \nthese deficits:\n  The first is the fiscal deficit. The national debt has more than \ntripled since 1979 and will soon top $5 billion. Just the interest \npayments on the debt affect every other budget decision we can make. We \nknow that.\n  We know that if we let this continue, we will be crowding out all the \nother choices we can make: how much we can spend on national defense \nand on essential social programs like drug treatment and prevention.\n  The second deficit is the investment deficit. We need to find ways to \ninvest in our infrastructure as well as in our people. A nation that \ndoes not invest is a nation that has given up hope for the future. We \nare not such a nation.\n  And let me tell you, we are a nation that has always found a way to \nbuild and grow--re-tool and re-invest in education, in business, in the \narts and sciences, in our culture and in our families. We need to \nremove unnecessary regulations so business can create jobs while, at \nthe same time, we maintain the health and safety of every American.\n  The third deficit is the spiritual deficit. Values, my friends, do \nnot come from laws and speeches. They come from families, teachers, and \nchurches.\n  There are millions of young Americans today who no longer have \nsignificant contact with any of these sources.\n  If this country is going to have children having children; if \nfamilies are going to continue to erode--then our ability to reach \nthese kids is essential. If that means investing in community \norganizations with a track record of success, then we should do it.\n  So, I submit that this budget debate needs to go beyond the political \nrhetoric about our fiscal deficit. We all agree that we need to \ndownsize and streamline government, but we must not lose sight of our \nobligation to re-invest in our people and in our nation to keep both \nstrong.\n  Mr. President, let me quote from an editorial on this budget debate \nin the Washington Post on Tuesday by E.J. Dionne. I think he asks an \nimportant question that must be addressed.\n  He asks, ``Will Democrats be bold enough to question the Republicans' \ncore assumptions about government? The issue in this debate,'' he said, \n``should not be whether to reduce the deficit, but how that can be done \nin ways that will increase living standards and average wages, which \nhave been dropping for two decades.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I am challenging those core assumptions of the \nRepublicans because I believe they are short-sighted and wrong. And I \nbelieve that we will not be in an economic position to increase living \nstandards until we have a budget that addresses the three American \ndeficits simultaneously.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I submit that if we pass this budget we will \ndramatically increase our investment and our spiritual deficits because \nwe will not have committed ourselves to creating opportunities and \njobs. We will not have committed to preserving the fundamental \nstructural integrity of our nation--whether it's our roads, railroads, \nand bridges, or our values and our belief in citizenship and in the \nconcept of community.\n  This budget, Mr. President, is, therefore, wrong-headed, misdirected. \nIt doesn't make any sense. It fails the common sense test. It fails the \nfairness test.\n  This budget disinvests in people and makes us less competitive.\n  It cuts Medicare by $256 billion; it cuts student aid by $14 billion; \nit terminates AMTRAK by the year 2000--terminates it.\n  Do you know that we are 34th in the world in our commitment to our \nrail system which industry and commerce rely on. We are behind Ecuador \nand just\n ahead of Bangladesh. And the Republicans now want to cut all support \nfor the railroads.\n\n  The proposed budget decimates environmental programs and cuts all the \ncrime prevention programs we passed last year.\n  It cuts $34 billion from food and nutrition programs.\n  It cuts unemployment compensation, SSI, and other programs under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee by $66 billion.\n  But this so called revolution doesn't stop there. It disinvests in \nour infrastructure by cutting $3 billion for airports, highways and \nschool improvements.\n  It disinvests in job training for young people by cutting $272 \nmillion. It disinvests in summer jobs for kids by cutting $871 million. \nIt even disinvests in safe drinking water with a $1.3 billion cut in \ngrants to the states to keep our water clean.\n  These are not just draconian cuts that go to the heart of our ability \nto address the three deficits we face. They are the symbol, Mr. \nPresident, of a wrong-headed political philosophy that does not \nrepresent the mainstream of America.\n  So, I submit that this budget is fundamentally flawed in its concept \nand is designed simply to achieve the political goals of a minority of \nanti-government zealots who are blind to the real needs of this nation. \nThey cut what we need and keep what we don't.\n  Let me conclude by saying, Mr. President, that I am emphatically for \na balanced budget. I voted for the Bradley and Conrad alternative \nbudgets because, though they are not perfect, they better protect \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, and other critical government services \nand they make better choices than the Republican leadership's budget.\n  What the Bradley and Conrad alternatives prove is that we can balance \nthe budget in less than ten years without increasing income tax rates \nfor lower- and middle-income Americans. They prove in some what \ndifferent ways that we can balance the budget without pillaging or \neliminating key government services on which tens of millions of \nAmericans depend and which are critical to keeping our nation \ncompetitive and our people healthy, happy, and safe.\n  Both of these alternatives balance the budget in a fairer fashion \nthan the Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate has \ntried to persuade the American people is possible.\n  Mr. President, until my Republican colleagues understand that this \nbudget is about people and their future and the future of our nations, \nand that there are three deficits we face as a nation--until they \nchange their core assumptions about what we must preserve as well as \nwhat we must cut, then they will have failed, as the majority party, to \nlegislate in the best interest of the people who have entrusted them \nwith the fundamental process of this democracy. As I oppose this Budget \nResolution, I commit to continue working to place us on a different \ncourse that will permit us to realize our potential as a nation.\n                           amendment no. 1150\n\n       oil and gas leasing in the arctic national wildlife refuge\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Yesterday the Senate voted on an amendment sponsored by \nSenator Roth which removed from the budget all savings attributable to \nenactment of legislation to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n(ANWR) to oil and gas leasing. The Arctic Refuge is often referred to \nas America's Serengeti because of its outstanding wildlife, beauty and \nrecreation opportunities. ANWR serves as the staging area for thousands \nof migratory birds, denning habitat for polar bears, and calving \ngrounds for the 160,000 member Porcupine Caribou Herd. Moreover, the \nRefuge plays an integral part in the [[Page S7470]] lives of the \nGwich'in people, whose members depend upon the seasonal migrations of \nthe caribou for both survival and cultural identity. The biological \nheart of this pristine wilderness is the 1.5 million acre coastal \nplain.\n  The fate of ANWR has been the subject of a complex and highly \ncontested debate for more than a decade. That is why I am deeply \nsaddened that the Budget Committee would use this back door approach \nvia the budget process to try to open one of the Nation's last great \nwilderness areas to oil drilling.\n  Under current law, receipts generated from assets sales and leases \ncannot be used for deficit reduction. I fear using the\n anticipated $1.4 billion proceeds from opening ANWR to drilling for \ndeficit reduction may signal the beginning of a ``fire sale'' of \nnatural resources such as the ANWR. For many Americans, trading the \nArctic Refuge wilderness for a one-time budget reduction, and the \npossibility but only the possibility of finding oil, is simply not \nworth it. The environmental costs of opening the Refuge to leasing are \nnot worth the estimated benefits, especially when the oil--estimated to \nsupply only a 200 days supply of oil for the nation--is not needed \nbecause small gains in energy conservation could provide both more \nenergy and more job creation than developing all of the potential for \noil available in ANWR. It is very ironic that, while taking the first \nstep towards opening up ANWR for exploration for petroleum, this budget \nwill cut funding for energy conservation programs that could decrease \nour dependence on petroleum and create more U.S. jobs. A national \nenergy efficiency program would create, on average, ten times the \nnumber of jobs that might be produced from Arctic Refuge drilling.\n\n  All Americans have a stake in our national wildlife refuges and \nparks. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the crown jewel of the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System. The Refuge is a wilderness area unique \nnot only in the United States but in the world. The words of the \nrenowned naturalist, George Schaller, say it all:\n\n       Based on my experience, I conclude that the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge in all its magnificent diversity, from \n     mountain range to coastal plain, is unique and irreplaceable \n     not just on a national basis, but also on an international \n     basis. It is sometimes thought that there are still many \n     remote and untouched wilderness areas in which the earth's \n     biological diversity will be protected . . . Most remote \n     ecosystems, both inside and outside reserves, are rapidly \n     being modified. The Refuge has remained a rare exception. It \n     represents one of the last and true large wilderness areas \n     left on earth, an area unspoiled, its biological systems \n     intact. Our civilization will be measured by what we leave \n     behind. The Refuge was established not for economic value but \n     as a statement of our nation's vision. There are certain \n     places on earth that are so unique that they must be \n     preserved without compromise . . . Such places include the \n     Virunga Volcanoes with its mountain gorillas, the Serengeti \n     plains, the Chang Tang of Tibet--and the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  Mr. President, I voted for the Roth amendment primarily because I \nbelieve it is unconscionable to allow the degradation of the \n``biological heart'' of the only complete arctic ecosystem protected in \nNorth America without a thorough and substantive debate undertaken in \nfull view of the American public. I terribly regret a majority of the \nSenate did not vote the same way and that we moved one step closer to \nwhat I believe is an unacceptable outcome.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank the ranking member.\n  I wish to commend the chairman of the Budget Committee and commend \nthe ranking member for really an exceptional effort. The chairman of \nthe Budget Committee has been truly dedicated to balancing the budget \nand deficit reduction for as long as I have been a Member of this body, \nand I wish to pay respect to that commitment.\n  The goal is absolutely right. This is precisely what we must do for \nthe country's future. I think all of us who have worked on the budget \nunderstand that we must rein in the growth of entitlements, we must \nlook at freezing defense spending and domestic discretionary spending \nif we are going to have a chance to do what is the right economic \npolicy for this Nation's future. It will mean a better future for \nAmerica if we achieve a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe the specifics that we have in this \nplan are yet a fair sharing of the burden of deficit reduction.\n  It seems to me that the middle-class children and the elderly have \nbeen ordered into the front lines, but the wealthiest among us have \nbeen ushered to the sidelines. More than that, they have been put at \nthe head of the line for additional tax preferences, tax breaks, and \ntax loopholes.\n  Mr. President, I do not think that is right. A group of us offered an \nalternative. We called it the fair share plan because we think it had a \nmore equitable distribution of the burden of reaching a balanced \nbudget, and we reached a balanced budget in the year 2004 without \ncounting the Social Security surpluses. We had more deficit reduction \nin the year 2002 than the plan we will vote on momentarily.\n  But perhaps the most interesting irony is that as part of our plan, \nwe proposed closing tax preferences and tax loopholes. Yesterday, the \nother side said that was a tax increase. But interestingly enough, the \nlast vote that we had on an amendment offered by a Republican Senator \nwas to do precisely what we advocated.\n  The Senator from Maine offered an amendment to restore funding to \neducation priorities and do it by closing tax preferences and tax \nloopholes. I am glad they have put it on the table. It got 67 votes, \nwhen that was the last amendment adopted because that is precisely what \ndirection we ought to take to reach a fair conclusion when we vote on \nreconciliation. I hope we do that, Mr. President. I hope we do that.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we have reached an important point in \ndealing with the budget deficit. The Senator from New Mexico has \nproposed a deficit reduction budget that is real. The Senator from \nNebraska and the Senator from the State of North Dakota and Senator \nBradley and I, although they are different plans, have introduced \nproposals that are real, genuine reductions in working on a balanced \nbudget and moving to a balanced budget within 7 years.\n  But there is a big difference here. I believe the one we are about to \nvote on is simply not fair. We can get there from here fairly. There is \na fundamental difference in the approach taken by Senator Bradley and \nmyself and the Senator from North Dakota, and others, and the \nRepublican proposal, and that is, we put a lot less burden on the \nelderly, a lot less burden, or no burden, on college loans, a lot less \nburden on middle-class folks. We increase the burden on other elements \nof society. The point is, we do look at and do play a major part in \ndealing with closing tax loopholes.\n  It is a big difference. It is a fundamental difference, but this is \nonly the first round of the fight. This is a budget resolution that \ndoes not mean a darn thing other than as it guides us. It is not a law. \nIt does not change anything. The President does not get to veto it or \nsign it. We now get into the hard stuff, the hard part.\n  I am confident that as the American people understand the commitment \non both sides to move to a balanced budget, they are going to be able \nto begin to weigh what the real costs are, and they are going to make a \njudgment whether or not cutting Medicare and Medicaid by $400 billion \nis a better way to go than closing $176 billion worth of tax loopholes. \nThey are going to make those basic judgments. I think we will be back \nat it again. I compliment the managers of the bill for their diligent \neffort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 minute to Senator Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate \nis recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have the greatest nation in the \nworld. It has given us more freedom, more justice, more opportunity and \nmore hope [[Page S7471]] than any nation has given its people in the \nhistory of the world. If we are going to keep it free, though, and \nenjoy freedom and democracy, we have to do at least two things: We have \nto keep a defense that is strong to protect us from our enemies. And \nthe other thing is, we have to take steps to handle our finances \ncorrectly. We have not balanced this budget but once in 32 years, eight \ntimes in 64 years. We cannot keep on like this.\n  I want to commend Senator Domenici, the chairman, for the great job \nhe has done. I also commend the able Senator from Nebraska for how he \nhas handled this bill on the floor. In addition I commend Senator Dole, \nfor the leadership he provides.\n  Mr. President, we must take steps to take care of our finances. If we \ndo that, and protect our defense, we can continue as the greatest \nnation in the world. I hope we will take a step tonight toward putting \nour fiscal house in order, and pass this Budget Resolution. I thank the \nchair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding both the \ndistinguished minority leader and the majority leader each have 5 \nminutes of the allotted 40 minutes. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9 minutes left for the Senator from \nNew Mexico and 2 minutes left for the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wonder if I might inquire of the Democratic leader, will \nhe speak following the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the order, I thought, was I would speak, \nSenator Domenici would speak, Senator Daschle, and then Senator Dole. \nThat is what we tentatively agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes so the \nSenator from Kansas can make the final remarks on our side.\n  Mr. President, there are so many people to thank. I do not believe I \nam going to try to thank them name by name, because I am going to \nforget some. But I must say, there are 11 Senators that I must thank \nvery personally and very specifically.\n  Senator Dole, on January 6, assigned the Budget Committee and I was \nits chairman. As I looked at the Senators that were assigned and the \nSenators that were left from previous years, I wondered how would I get \n12 Senators to vote together.\n  Maybe to those on the outside they would not understand this, but let \nme just read off the names as I thank them individually and share with \nour leader how difficult and daunting I thought the chore was on \nJanuary 6:\n  Senator Grassley, Senator Nickles, Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator \nBond, Senator Lott, Senator Brown, Senator Gregg, Senator Gorton, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Abraham, and Senator Frist. That is a very \ndiverse group of Republican Senators.\n  But let me say to the American people, a very significant event is \ngoing to occur tonight when we vote on this balanced budget. And as it \nis recorded and as we look back on it, while many deserve credit, none \ndeserve the credit more than these 11 Senators who joined with me in \nproducing what I am absolutely convinced is a fair budget, is a good \nbudget and will, indeed, protect today and tomorrow. It is a budget for \ntoday and a budget for tomorrow.\n  The tomorrow part is shown right here behind me. I am not going to go \nthrough each one. Here are five little children and a set of twins.\n  Mr. President, if you look at those big numbers on each of these \nincluding--let us pick whatever you want, Sam and Nicholas. You can \nguess about how old they are. You see that $151,000. Mr. President, I \nsay to my fellow Senators that $151,000 is what those children will pay \nout of their income to pay the interest on the national debt if we were \nto adopt the President's budget and stay at current law.\n  Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, we can talk all we want \nabout who this budget helps and who it hurts. But I want to tell you, \nfor one thing, you cannot continue to do that to our children or there \nwill be no America, there will be no future. For what will young people \nhave to work for if they work for us to pay our interest on our debts \nwhich we adult leaders refuse to pay?\n  Frankly, what we are saying today is a very simple vision. For the \nfirst time in 25 years, the grown-up leadership of America is going to \nsay we are going to pay our own bills. If we want to give citizens of \nthe United States benefits, if we want to have programs that we herald \nacross America, we are going to pay for them or we are not going to \nhave them. That is what this budget says, 7 years from now, not \ntomorrow, for some would say, is it not too quick?\n  How quick is too quick? Twenty-five years in deficit and 7 more in \ndeficit--that is 32, I say to my friend. When is it enough? Mr. \nPresident, let me suggest that Senator Exon has been a marvelous \nranking member, and I thank him, his great staff and my great staff. \nBut I do not believe it is fair to say that there was no room for \ncooperation. It is now many, many days since we put forth a \ncomprehensive budget that everyone that has looked at it says not only \nis it fair, but it is filled with integrity. It is honest, it has no \nsmoke and mirrors, and, if implemented, its probability for a balance \nis very, very high. We cannot do much better for our people than to \nproduce that.\n  Now, frankly, I have not seen any real serious effort to try to \naddress the issues that we put before the Budget Committee or here on \nthe floor. Frankly, in the committee they have an argument. The first \ncouple of days they did not know enough about it. Even after they found \nout about it, the amendments all went to spending more money but taking \nit out of the reserve fund.\n  I close today saying to my fellow Americans--young, old, seniors, \nmilitary men--you all ought to be proud of the Senate tonight because \nwe will vote about 56 or 57 strong to preserve today and make sure that \nwe are strong and powerful in the future and that our children live in \na land of opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and a half minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico, 2 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use additional leader time, if I must, to \naccommodate whatever time is required for my remarks.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by commending the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee and the ranking member for what I consider to \nbe an outstanding job. They have led this Senate in the last several \ndays in a very good-faith effort, and I applaud their work, and I \napplaud the staff, especially, for what has been an extraordinarily \narduous and extremely meaningful project for which we can all be very \nproud.\n  Let me also say there is absolutely no disagreement with what the \nchairman said about those children. There is no disagreement about how \nconcerned we are about the debt they are incurring. There is no \ndisagreement whatsoever about their futures and how important it is \nthat we address this budget. The only disagreement is how we got the \ninterest amounts that were designated under each picture. The amounts \nthose children have to pay, in large measure, were run up in the Reagan \nand Bush administration years, and everyone understands that.\n  The question now is: How do we get out of it? Because for the last \ncouple of years, that is what this administration has given us the \nopportunity to do--to begin making the downpayment on a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  So this debate is about priorities. It is not about goals. Everyone \nunderstands the importance of the goal. We agree on the need for a \nbalanced budget. We agree on the need for a date certain by which the \nbudget should be balanced. We agree on the tough choices that have to \nbe made.\n  We offered over 50 amendments to this budget resolution and not one--\nnot one, Mr. President--would have increased the debt. Not $1. Only one \nmoved back the date, because it was honest, because it did what we said \na couple of months ago we had to do, and [[Page S7472]] that was to \nexclude Social Security. In fact, this budget resolution does not bring \nabout a balanced Federal budget by the year 2002 as touted. On page 7, \non line 21, it shows that we will still have a $113 billion debt, money \nborrowed from the Social Security trust fund to make the budget appear \nbalanced.\n  Whether or not Social Security is included, let me reiterate that \nthis debate is about priorities. This debate is about what is \nimportant. With or without Social Security, we agree on the goal.\n  When it comes to those priorities, this budget resolution, in the \nopinion of most Senators on this side of the aisle, is fundamentally \nflawed. We have many substantive disagreements, but most of them boil \ndown to one core difference--the Republican majority has insisted on \ntax cuts for the wealthiest 1 million Americans, and they have made \nthat the highest priority above everything else. As a result, this \nbudget takes the side of the privileged few. It virtually abandons \nordinary Americans, families, students, veterans, seniors, and \nchildren. It demands deep sacrifice from America's middle class, while \nit showers tax cuts on the elite.\n  We knew the Republicans had the votes to pass this resolution. That \nwas never in doubt. What Democrats have tried to do is to reveal the \ntruth about this budget and to try as best we can to improve it.\n  Without increasing the debt, Mr. President, our priority was to \nensure that millions of older Americans have access to health care, by \ntaking $100 billion in tax cuts for the most prosperous among us and \ninvesting in the health of senior citizens. The Republicans said \n``no.''\n  Without increasing the debt, we tried to help millions of young \nAmericans by investing $40 billion in education and averting the \nlargest educational cuts in our Nation's history. The Republicans said \n``no.''\n  Without increasing the debt, we tried to assist 12 million working \nAmericans by repealing a $21 billion tax increase by slightly reducing \nthe huge tax breaks going to the 1 million wealthiest among us. The \nRepublicans said ``no.''\n  Without increasing the debt, we tried to invest a small part of the \ntax cuts in science, technology and research. The Republicans said \n``no.''\n  We tried to use the tax cuts to reduce the deficit. The Republicans \nsaid ``no.''\n  With our amendments--and without increasing the debt--we tried to \nhelp seniors, to lower the heavy burden on students, to attempt to be \nfair to veterans and to farmers and to small businessmen and to \nfamilies, to reduce the deficit. And on virtually every occasion, the \nRepublicans said ``no.''\n  We even tried to ensure that the middle class would be the \nbeneficiaries if we had a tax cut, and that 90 percent of the benefit \nwould not go to the 10 percent of us who are the most well-to-do. And \nagain, the Republicans said ``no.''\n  Time after time, amendment after amendment, the wealthy won and the \nmiddle class lost.\n  Fairness and equal sacrifice were great goals, but they were lost to \nthe higher Republican priority--a tax cut we simply cannot afford.\n  This budget is fundamentally flawed, Mr. President. It does not \nstrengthen America; it weakens it. It does not bring us together; it \nmoves us apart.\n  The ``haves'' will have more and the rest will have less.\n  It is not what the American people would have as their priorities, \nnot when you put tax cuts for the privileged ahead of seniors, \nstudents, families and deficit reduction.\n  But this is a long process. It is only the beginning. Today is the \neasy part. When the American people understand whose side this budget \nis on, I believe they will demand that we change it. By the time the \ncommittees confront the hard choices in reconciliation, the public will \nunderstand who is sacrificing and who is benefitting. This budget will \nbe altered, or it will not become law.\n  Democrats remain committed to balancing the budget. We remain open to \nworking with Republicans to fashion a bipartisan budget. But it must be \na budget that asks equal sacrifice and does not exclude the privileged \nfew.\n  It must be a budget that invests in America, even as we reduce \nspending, a budget that pulls Americans together, rather than divide \nus. We can do that, Mr. President. It is not beyond our reach. And the \nAmerican people expect no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, like most Senators, I have lost track of the \nmeetings I have attended. But a few years back, I was in a meeting that \nI will never forget.\n  These people were not presidents or prime ministers. They did not run \nbig businesses. In fact, most of them did not even have a job.\n  Who were they? They were high school seniors--100 of them--one boy \nand one girl from each State.\n  The reason why I will never forget that day is because of what they \ntaught me--and what they should teach all of us.\n  Sometime during our meeting, one young man stood up and said, \n``Senator, it seems like every group of Americans is represented in \nWashington. Everyone has somebody who speaks for them.'' ``But who \nspeaks for us?'' He asked me, ``Who speaks for the future?''\n  It was a good question then. And it is a good question now.\n  And for far too long, the answer has been that ``No one speaks for \nthe future.'' Instead, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging \nour children's future for the temporary convenience of the present.\n  But today, the Senate will make a statement, and we will make history \nin the process.\n  We will finally begin to unpile the deficits. We will finally begin \nto speak for the future. And we will do it with one word--leadership.\n  Harry Truman was right when he said:\n\n       Where there is no leadership, society stands still. \n     Progress occurs when courageous leaders seize the opportunity \n     to change things for the better.\n\n  And let us be frank. When it comes to reducing the deficit, Congress \nhas stood still--frozen in place year after year after year, as our \ndebt grew bigger and bigger and bigger.\n  But in November 1994, Americans voted to change all that. For the \nfirst time in 40 years, they gave control of Congress to the Republican \nParty. And with that control came a responsibility.\n  A responsibility to do what we promised--a responsibility to act \ncourageously--a responsibility to change things for the better.\n  And under the leadership of Senator Domenici that is exactly what we \nhave done. We have accepted the responsibility of leadership. We have \nmade the tough choices. We have put a plan on the table that will \nresult in a balanced budget within 7 years.\n  This budget is based on the underlying principle that we simply \ncannot go on spending our children's money.\n  In fulfilling that principle, those bureaucracies and programs \ncounting on their usual big spending increases must learn to make do \nwith less--$961 billion less over the next 7 years, to be exact.\n  And we begin right here in Congress, as this budget reduces \nlegislative branch spending by some $200 million.\n  Those who are used to more and more power flowing to Washington, DC, \nwill have to adjust to a new tide, where power is carried back to the \nStates and to the people.\n  And we will have to learn how to make do without the Department of \nCommerce, and its more than 140 Federal departments, agencies, and \nprograms. This Senator is confident that we will do just fine, thank \nyou.\n  And despite the rhetoric coming out of the White House, this budget \nalso recognizes that Government has certain responsibilities.\n  Responsibilities like taking the steps necessary to preserve, \nimprove, and protect Medicare, which three of the President's Cabinet \nmembers tell us will go bankrupt in 7 years if we do nothing. We do \nthis by slowing the growth rate of Medicare--while still allowing \nMedicare spending to increase by $1.6 trillion.\n  This budget also recognizes that there are those in need who depend \non Government programs, and who often have nowhere else to turn.\n  Therefore, it provides for an additional $36 billion in spending for \nMedicaid.\n  It increases funding for the Women/Infant/Children Program by $2 \nbillion. [[Page S7473]] \n  It increases funding for food stamps, for aid to families with \ndependent children, for supplemental security income.\n and for the earned income tax credit.\n\n  Is the budget perfect? Of course not. Some of us would have reduced \nspending in other programs than the ones chosen. Some of us would have \nincreased spending in others. And some of us--including this Senator--\nwould have dedicated more funds to reducing the tax burden on \nAmericans.\n  But make no mistake about it, this budget does provide tax relief.\n  The $170 billion fund this budget creates must and will be devoted to \ntax reductions that will help America's families, stimulate savings, \nincrease investment, create jobs, and promote economic growth.\n  Family tax credits, spousal IRA's, estate tax relief for family \nbusinesses, and a capital gains rate reduction are some of the actions \nI will promote as Senate majority leader, and as a member of the \nFinance Committee.\n  Additionally, it's no secret that when the House and Senate return \nfrom conference on our respective budgets, we are likely to to return \nwith a budget that will dedicate even more funds to tax relief.\n  Mr. President, when Republicans drew up our plan to reach a balanced \nbudget, we also drew a line in the sand.\n  And we said that those who are serious about balancing the budget \nwill cross that line and work with us, or propose an alternative.\n  And those who are not serious will stay on the other side of the line \nand offer no leadership. I regret to say that President Clinton has \nnever come close to crossing that line.\n  While he says we have the wrong plan, he never comes close to saying \nwhat the right plan is--except one that gave America $200 to $300 \nbillion deficits well into the next century, and that would have added \n$1.2 trillion to our debt in the next 5 years.\n  Thankfully, that plan was defeated by a vote of 99-0.\n  Instead of leadership, the President offers fear. And he casts his \nnet far and wide. Seniors, children, the so-called middle class, the \nneedy, farmers, students, the list goes on and on. Each day, the \nPresident tells them they should be afraid of our budget, they should \nbe afraid of Republicans.\n  Let me again quote the words of Harry Truman. Truman said:\n\n       America was not built on fear. America was built on \n     courage, on imagination, and an unbeatable determination to \n     do the job at hand.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we will win this vote today. We will take our \nbudget to conference. We will work with the Republican majority in the \nHouse. And we will return with a plan that will balance the budget in 7 \nyears. We will do it with the help of the American people--people who \nhave always exhibited courage, imagination, and an unbeatable \ndetermination to do the job at hand.\n  I conclude where I began. With speaking for the future. And I \nconclude not by quoting Harry Truman, but by quoting another President.\n\n       Somewhere at this very moment, another child is born in \n     America. Let it be our cause to give that child a happy home, \n     a healthy family, a hopeful future. Let it be our cause to \n     see that child reach the fullest of their God-given \n     abilities.\n\n  Those words were spoken by Bill Clinton in 1992, as he accepted his \nparty's nomination for President.\n  And with passage of this budget, Republicans will turn those words \ninto action. Because somewhere at this very moment, another child is \nborn in America.\n  And that child comes into the world already owing $18,500 as his or \nher share of the national debt.\n  That child comes into the world with the knowledge that he or she \nwill pay $163,300 in taxes during his working life just to pay off \ninterest on the debt. That child comes into a world facing a future of \nfewer jobs, fewer opportunities, and higher interest rates.\n  Today, with this vote, we begin to change that child's world for \nbetter.\n  Today, we begin to speak for all the children born today and in the \ndays to come.\n  Today, we begin to speak for the future.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of Calendar No. 115, the House budget \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con.

Mr. President, the Subcommittee on Terrorism of the \nJudiciary Committee was scheduled to have hearings on terrorism today.\n  Those hearings could not be held because the Senate was in session \ncontinuously from 9 a.m. with rollcall votes of 9 minutes. So those \nhearings had to be postponed. They are going to be held on Thursday, \nJune 8.\n  A good many people came from substantial distances. I expressed our \nregrets that we could not hold the hearing. But it was not possible to \ndo so. But I did tell them that the statements which had been submitted \nwould be put in the Record at this time so that their prepared \nstatements could at least be read by Members of the Senate or those \ninterested in reading them.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of attorney \nJohn W. DeCamp, the statement of Mr. Norman Olson, the statement of Mr. \nLeroy Crenshaw, and the statement of the Militia of Montana be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n     Memorandum from: Senator John W. DeCamp, Atty.\n     To: Sub Committee on Terrorism, U.S. Senator Judiciary \n         Committee.\n     Re: Testimony to Committee.\n       To paraphrase an old saying. . . . ``Five months ago I \n     couldn't spell `Militia' and now I represent one.''\n       It was five months ago I agreed to PROVIDE LEGAL ASSISTANCE \n     TO the leaders of the Montana Militia on a dozen felonies. \n     Why? I felt the felony charges involved open and shut first \n     amendment issues of freedom of speech, assembly and right to \n     petition Government issues, and have learned a wealth of \n     information since that time--particularly in light of the \n     Oklahoma bombing and the anti-militia movement.\n       Before I go too much further, let me give brief background \n     on myself and let me answer the first questions that press \n     and your staff asked of me.\n       Question: Are you a white supremacist?\n       My wife is Vietnamese--one of the Boatpeople. Our four home \n     made AMERASIAN children are the four most beautiful and \n     talented mixed race children on the planet. My business \n     partner is African-American. My Comptroller is Indian from \n     Bombay & my legal associates over the years have been mostly \n     Jewish. You make your own conclusions.\n       Question: Are these militias dangerous?\n       Absolutely yes, and absolutely no.\n       First, the media and MOST OF US have made the same \n     fundamental error (``Cat Bagging'' I call it) as was made \n     during the McCarthy Era, during the Vietnam War Protest \n     Movement, and during Watergate.\n       That is, we lump all the Militias, the So Called Patriot \n     groups, and Tax Protesters and Free Men & Survivalist Groups \n     together as identical cats and then put them all into one \n     bag.\n       Second, we SELECT An individual or entity that is simply \n     off the spectrum in their beliefs, one not tethered to \n     reality and attribute those horrible characteristics to all \n     the militias. In short, we ``demonize'' them. Quickly, they \n     are all labeled as white supremacist, racist, anti-\n     government, paranoid revolutionaries fixing to blow up the \n     world.\n       The truth is that there is as much diversity among these \n     groups as there is among religious groups. As a young boy, I \n     remember sitting in the front pew and hearing the Priest in \n     my small town of 1,800 people explain why the Protestants \n     were all going to hell. And, on Monday morning at school my \n     best friend, a Protestant kid named Jimmy, would explain to \n     me that his preacher had told him the same thing about us \n     Catholics the day before.\n       It has been my observation that many of these groups--\n     particularly the ones I considered not tethered to reality--\n     are a bit like the Priest and the Preacher * * *. That is, \n     much of their effort is devoted to explaining to their \n     members why the other group are not real patriots, or why Bo \n     Gritz or John Trochman are really C.I.A. agents.\n       In truth, most of the militia groups--Montana Militia, \n     Oklahoma Militia, New Hampshire Militia--could be classified \n     as middle of the road among hard conservatives. What do I \n     mean?\n       Ten, twenty and thirty years ago they are the individuals \n     who were clamoring for ``Law and Order.'\n       I suppose it is ironic, some might say poetic, that what \n     many of them sought, ``Law and Order'' has now come to pass \n     in a FORM they deem to be excess * * * that is too much \n     oppressive law and abuse of the Constitution. And ``order'' \n     has become what they fear to be ``a new world order.'' And \n     thru speaking out, they want everyone to know this attitude \n     on their part and their fears and concerns.\n       But are they dangerous?\n       They are a political movement. All political movements are \n     dangerous to some other political movement they run counter \n     to.\n       That is how our system of government evolves * * * thru \n     political conflict and wars fought with words instead of \n     bullets and fought in the press and from the bully pulpit \n     instead of on the battlefield.\n       Ultimately, that is the only truly distinguishing feature \n     separating our 200-year-old political system from all others \n     that went before it. Namely, the ability thru verbal conflict \n     and battle for our system to reverse itself (revolution) and \n     go in an opposite direction without the necessity of a \n     violent revolution.\n       But are they physically dangerous or a threat to our \n     Government or our Constitution?\n       You judge * * * but do it on the facts, not on innuendo or \n     the words of the natural enemies of these militias, namely, \n     other political groups opposed to their philosophy.\n       To the best of my knowledge, there are no reported \n     incidents of any significance of militias being involved in \n     any of the following:\n       1. Drive by shootings.\n       2. The drug trade.\n       3. Use of children for pornography, pedophilia & drug \n     couriers.\n       4. Gang wars.\n       5. Auto theft.\n       6. Murder, rape, robbery, trafficking in illegal arms.\n       If militias are involved in these somebody is not reporting \n     them. And I doubt that.\n       For benefit of those who might differ with me on this, I \n     would point out that in each of the incidents you might be \n     familiar with, Gordon Kahl, Radny Weaver, Waco, the events \n     were initiated by the Government in an attempt to serve \n     usually misdemeanor warrants on contested tax matters using \n     overwhelming force and what in hindsight seems rather poor \n     judgement.\n       In short, an analysis by you will show that the militias \n     themselves have been the victim of violence rather than the \n     perpetrator or initiator.\n       As an example to prove my point, I challenge this committee \n     to examine the most notorious & deadly event in American \n     history involving U.S. marshals * * * namely, the Gordon Kahl \n     shoot-out 12 years ago in which about a half-dozen marshals \n     were shot, and Kahl escaped resulting in the largest manhunt \n     in American history.\n       Have the courage to OBJECTIVELY examine this event--same \n     with Waco--, and you will begin to understand the origins of \n     the militia movement, their disenchantment and fear of law \n     enforcement and Government.\n       Whether you believe Kahl was the most notorious and crazy \n     tax\n      protester in American History or whether you believe he was \n     a martyr responsible for triggering the militia movement, \n     it is only by understanding this case in depth that you \n     can understand the origins of the Militia movement.\n       Question: Are you, John DeCamp, a member of a militia?\n       Sure, about twenty-five years ago I was a member. We called \n     it the United States Army. We had training sessions and \n     exercises in a place called Vietnam. I was an Infantry \n     Captain there specially assigned to a man named Bill Colby. \n     Bill subsequently became my friend, Godfather, advisor and \n     Legal Associate on a case or two. Bill was the individual who \n     insisted I write the book, the Franklin Coverup--which book \n     resulted in some of the Militias asking me to represent them. \n     You may remember Bill as the former head of a group called \n     the C.I.A., Central Intelligence Agency.\n       So, since Colby told me to write my book the Franklin \n     Cover-up; and since the book resulted in my representing the \n     Montana militia and being here today, I suppose I'm here \n     because of the C.I.A. just kidding. . . .\n       My Militia leader, a chap named McNamara, told us in \n     Vietnam that we were winning; that our government was sincere \n     . . . and a lot of other nice things that inspired us to get \n     our heads blown off. Then a couple weeks ago, I understand \n     Mr. McNamara told the world that he was only ``funnin'' us \n     when he told us those things during the war. McNamara said \n     that he or our other leader Lyndon knew all along that they \n     were lying to us. [[Page S7475]] \n       That is the about the same thing those war protesters were \n     saying twenty-five years ago. But twenty-five years ago Mr. \n     McNamara and Lyndon said the war protesters were lying and \n     Mr. McNamara and Lyndon tried to suspend their right to \n     criticize or question government. Lyndon tried to beat their \n     heads in, lock them up and shut them up using government \n     agencies. Now, I get a little gun-shy when I see the \n     Government taking the same approach to the Militias today. \n     Instead of raiding them, threatening them, indicting them for \n     what they say and believe, let's keep open minds and listen \n     to their arguments the same as any other political debate.\n       Who knows, we might discover that ``truth lies somewhere in \n     the middle'' as it frequently does in all things in life.\n       There is no proof at this point, nor any indication of \n     proof, that the militias themselves--unlike Vietnam war \n     protesters--have blown up any buildings, media and political \n     innuendo to the contrary notwithstanding.\n       Question: How should government treat the militias?\n       The same as any other political movement or group. Give \n     them the full benefit of the First Amendment. Let the war be \n     fought in the press and with words. The legitimate ones will \n     survive and maybe evolve. In open debate, any crazies will \n     self-destruct.\n       The only real danger from the militias is if you try to \n     suspend pieces of the Constitution to shut them up or destroy \n     them.\n       For God's sake . . . for America's sake . . . don't rip off \n     a corner of our Constitution to address a crisis or threat \n     that has yet to be proven to even exist.\n       Three times in my short life, I have watched panic set in \n     with Government Leaders. Those three times are: McCarthyism, \n     Vietnam war protest movement, Watergate.\n       Each time, government reacted by trying to suspend our \n     Fundamental First Amendment Rights.\n       McCarthyism: I remember * * * teachers taking loyalty oaths \n     * * * neighbors questioning and accusing their neighbor or \n     competitor of being a Communist. J. Edgar being given free \n     reign to suspend the Constitution. And everybody was paranoid \n     about their neighbor.\n       Vietnam war protesters: I sure remember that. First \n     reaction was to try to shut them up. That simply resulted in \n     violence.\n       Watergate: My hero Dick Nixon panicked and for his own \n     security also tried to rip off a corner of the Constitution \n     and shut up his critics. That resulted in a brutal First \n     Amendment ``caning.''\n       But, in each case, it was not the Government which saved \n     the Constitution for the people; rather it was the free and \n     unfettered press using their First Amendment which saved the \n     Constitution from the Government abuse.\n       That First Amendment--and the free press and robust and \n     wild and wooly free speech it promotes--is our ultimate check \n     and balance to preserve the Constitution.\n       Whether it is Edward R. Murrow exposing McCarthy as a \n     Charlatan; or the New York Times daring to print the Pentagon \n     Papers; or, God Forbid, the Washington Post taking on Nixon \n     and the entire government in Watergate, it has been the press \n     operating under the First Amendment that has saved our \n     Constitution and Americans from Government abuse rather than \n     the Government saving our Constitution from press or American \n     citizen abuse.\n       So what ever you do, don't overreact and trade pieces of \n     our Constitution for an instant solution to some perceived \n     but unproved problem.\n       Let me conclude by simply saying this: the best way to \n     understand the militias, their motives, their agenda, their \n     danger or their benefit to America is to understand their \n     origins.\n       And, you can only understand their origins if you will as a \n     governing body publicly, openly and thoroughly examine Waco \n     and Gordon Kahl and Randy Weaver.\n       This is what we ask of you. An open, public, above-board \n     Senate examination of those events that will help re-\n     establish, no matter the outcome of that objective \n     examination, trust and credibility in our Government agencies \n     when they speak.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          (From The Alanson Armory: Wolverines, May 24, 1995)\n\n                     Testimony of Mr. Norman Olson\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. The \n     following statement will attempt to answer the question of \n     the legitimacy and the need of the citizen militia.\n       Not only does the Constitution specifically allow the \n     formation of a Federal army, it also recognizes the inherent \n     right of the people to form militia. Further, it recognizes \n     that the citizen and his personal armaments are the \n     foundation of the militia. The arming of the militia is not \n     left to the state but to the citizen. However, should the \n     state choose to arm its citizen militia, it is free to do \n     (bearing in mind that the Constitution is not a document \n     limiting the citizen, but rather limiting the power of \n     government). But should the state fail to arm its citizen \n     militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     becomes the source of the guarantee that the state will not \n     be found defenseless in the presence of a threat to its \n     security. It makes no sense whatsoever to look at the \n     Constitution of the United States or that of any state for \n     permission to form a citizen militia since logically, the \n     power to permit is also the power to deny. If brought to its \n     logical conclusion in this case, government may deny the \n     citizen the right to form a militia. If this were to happen, \n     the state would assert itself as the principle of the \n     contract making the people the agents. Liberty then would \n     depend on the state's grant of liberty. Such a concept is \n     foreign to American thought.\n       While the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n     acknowledges the existence of state militia and recognizes \n     their necessity for the security of a free state; and, while \n     it also recognizes that the right of the people to keep and \n     bear arms shall not be infringed, the Second Amendment is not \n     the source of the right to form a militia nor to keep and \n     bear arms. Those rights existed in the states prior to the \n     formation of the federal union. In fact, the right to form \n     militia and to keep and bear arms existed from antiquity. The \n     enumeration of those rights in the Constitution only \n     underscores their natural occurrence and importance.\n       According to the Tenth Amendment, ultimate power over the \n     militia is not delegated to the Federal government by the \n     Constitution nor to the states, but resides with the people. \n     Consequently, the power of the militia remains in the hands \n     of the people. Again, the fundamental function of the militia \n     in society remains with the people. Therefore, the Second \n     Amendment recognizes that the militia's existence and the \n     security of the state rests ultimately in the people who \n     volunteer their persons to constitute the militia and their \n     arms to supply its firepower. The primary defense of the \n     state rests with the citizen militia bearing its own arms. \n     Fundamentally, it is not the state that defends the people, \n     but the people who defend the state.\n       The second line of defense of the state consists in the \n     statutory organization known as the National Guard. Whereas \n     the National Guard is solely the creation of statutory law, \n     the militia derives its existence from the inherent \n     inalienable rights which existed before the Constitution and \n     whose importance are such that they merited specific \n     recognition in that document. While the National Guard came \n     into existence as a result of legislative activity, the \n     militia existed before there was a nation or a constitutional \n     form of government. The militia consisting of people owning \n     and bearing personal weapons is the very authority out of \n     which the United States Constitution grew. This point must be \n     emphasized. Neither the citizen's militia nor the citizen's \n     private arsenal can be an appropriate subject for federal \n     regulation. It was the armed militia of the American colonies \n     whose own efforts ultimately led to the establishment of the \n     United States of\n      America! While some say that the right to keep and bear arms \n     is granted to Americans by the Constitution, just the \n     opposite is true. The Federal Government itself is the \n     child of the armed citizen. We the people are the parent \n     of the child we call government. You, Senators, are part \n     of the child that We The People gave life to. The \n     increasing amount of Federal encroachment into our lives \n     indicates the need for parental corrective action. In \n     short, the Federal government needs a good spanking to \n     make it behave.\n       One other important point needs to be made. Since the \n     Constitution is the limiting document upon the government, \n     the government cannot become greater than the granting power, \n     that is the servant cannot become greater than his master. \n     Therefore, should the Chief Executive or other branch of \n     government, or all branches together act to suspend the \n     Constitution under a rule of martial law, all power granted \n     to government would be canceled and defer back to the \n     granting power, the people. Martial law shall not be possible \n     in this country as long as the people recognize the Bill of \n     Rights as inalienable.\n       Since the power of self defense and the defense of the \n     state is ultimately vested in the people, there is no \n     possible way that a Governor or the Chief Executive of the \n     United States, or any legislative body can ``outlaw'' the \n     citizen militia for to do so would rob inherent power from \n     the people. If that were to happen, our entire form of \n     government would cease.\n       Historically, we have found that the Governor's militia, \n     that is the National Guard, is intended to reduce the need \n     for the citizen militia. Simply, if the National Guard did \n     it's job in securing the state, the citizen militia would not \n     emerge. That it has emerged so dramatically seems to indicate \n     that the people do not feel secure. Simply stated, the \n     growing threat of centralized Federal government is \n     frightening America, hence the emergence of the citizen \n     militia. When government is given back to the people at the \n     lowest level, the citizen militia will return to its natural \n     place, resident within the body of the people. Civil war and \n     revolution can be avoided by re-investing governing power to \n     the people.\n       To summarize: Citizen militia are historic lawful entities \n     predating constitutions. Such militia are ``grandfathered'' \n     into the very system of government they created. The \n     Constitution grants no right to form militia, but merely \n     recognize the existing natural right of all people to defend \n     and protect themselves. The governments created out of well \n     armed and free people are to be constantly obedient to the \n     people. Any attempt to take the means of freedom from the \n     people is an act of rebellion against the people.\n       In order to resist a rebellious and disobedient government, \n     the citizen militia must [[Page S7476]] not be connected in \n     any way with that government lest the body politic loose its \n     fearful countenance as the only sure threat to a government \n     bent on converting free people into slaves.\n                                                                    ____\n\n    Testimony of Leroy Crenshaw Before the Senate Committee on the \n                        Judiciary, May 25, 1995\n\n       Good Morning Chairman Hatch and Distinguished Members of \n     this Committee.\n       My name is Leroy Crenshaw, and I would request that this \n     Committee accept my prepared statement as a part of the \n     record of these proceedings.\n       I was born and raised in the beautiful State of Alabama, \n     and I now live and teach school in the great State of \n     Massachusetts. I have a faithful and supporting wife and we \n     have raised six fine children.\n       We all feel privileged to have been born in these times \n     when the promise of our forefathers has begun to spread to \n     all races, colors, and creeds, of our countrymen. Ironically \n     however, these times have evolved all too soon into conflicts \n     between my countrymen of all races and the officers of their \n     government. For many of my friends who are not Black \n     Americans, these times have brought circumstances into their \n     lives that have no memorable precedent. For me and my wife, \n     we see emerging official conduct that is all too reminiscent \n     of earlier days of ``us'' and ``them'' that Black Americans \n     have known as their daily diet since our country began. We \n     welcome our white brethren to our sides in this time of \n     burgeoning oppression.\n       During recent times, we ordinary Americans have experienced \n     repeated episodes of authoritarian confrontation provoked and \n     executed by our federal government. We have witnessed with \n     horror as each of our individual rights, as enumerated in the \n     first Ten Amendments to our Constitution, has fallen to \n     attack by our federal government at the highest levels. We \n     have repeatedly attempted redress through our courts, through \n     our elected Representatives and Senators, and through \n     pleading with the agencies of our government, all to no avail \n     after a consistent pattern of restatement of our issues into \n     ``non-issues'', in order to avoid dealing with the substance \n     of our complaints.\n       We have witnessed our federal Government make itself a \n     party to the collapse of our banking and Savings and Loan \n     institutions.\n       We have witnessed our Government commit our young men to \n     foreign military adventurism upon false premise, and upon an \n     usurped authority.\n       We have all been victims of federal incursion into our \n     private financial affairs to the point of our right invasion \n     of the sanctity of our family domain, under the guise of \n     routing out fraud by us working Americans.\n       We have witnessed out right and provable lies told to the \n     records of our federal courts by the judges appointed to \n     these high positions.\n       We have witnessed our own President disclaim our Bill of \n     Rights as ``radical'' liberties to be granted to ordinary \n     people.\n       We have witnessed one Vice President (Quayle), along with \n     at least one Attorney General (Barr), attempt to convince us \n     to abandon our right to jury trials in all criminal cases and \n     an civil case in excess of twenty dollars (1990-1991).\n       We have discovered that the CIA, the Department of Justice, \n     and the DEA, along with other agencies of government have \n     worked in concert to engage and profiteer from drug \n     trafficking.\n       We have witnessed the compromise of the sovereignty of our \n     state governments by federal funding schemes that always \n     contain a myriad of control strings.\n       We have witnessed our community controlled school systems \n     invaded by ``better idea'' federally funded concepts that \n     offer no rational solutions, except mind conditioning of our \n     young into ``interdependent'' concepts that scorn the virtue \n     of self reliance and fundamental education.\n       We have witnessed repeated instances when officers of our \n     federal government, acting under color of federal law, have \n     committed multiple crimes against us, in the form of actual \n     violence, and in the form of `white collar' extortion, theft, \n     embezzlement, and provable fraud.\n       We have witnessed the consistent official forgiving of \n     these crimes without any authority under our Constitution to \n     grant these officers any reprieve for their offenses against \n     our laws and our Constitution.\n       We have studied our Law, and we have found there our \n     fundamental rights still stated to be ``protected''.\n       We also have found within our Constitution, the \n     prescription for dealing with these perversions to our \n     security that trouble us so much.\n       We find in the First Amendment to the Constitution that the \n     Congress shall pass no law abridging our right ``peaceably to \n     assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of \n     grievances.'', but Congress has passed such laws.\n       We find the Second Amendment constitutionally prescribed \n     protection of our individual duty to take arms if need be in \n     defense of our Constitution, to be under attack by our own \n     Congressmen.\n       We find in the Fourth Amendment, our protection of our \n     right to be secure in our homes from official threats against \n     our persons, our papers, and our effects, against searches \n     and seizures upon non-existent or warrantless incursions into \n     our private domains, but we know of repeated incidents of \n     just such incursions into the homes of persons who are later \n     found to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing, and some \n     of such persons have died as a result.\n       We find in the Fifth amendment that none of us is to be \n     deprived of our life, without due process of law, but we know \n     now of many unarguably innocent people who have been killed \n     by our federal officers who knew of the innocence of their \n     victims before their killing acts.\n       We find in the Fifth Amendment that none of us is to be \n     deprived of our liberty without due process of law, but we \n     know that many of us have been imprisoned upon trumped up \n     charges that are ultimately shown to have been knowingly \n     brought upon fraudulent grounds.\n       We find in the Fifth Amendment that none of us is to be \n     deprived of our property without due process of law, but we \n     know that many of us has had his cash, possessions, and \n     future means of earning a living, seized without any \n     opportunity to oppose such seizure before the fact.\n       We find in the Fifth Amendment that each of us is entitle \n     to obtain ``just compensation'' as payment from our \n     government before our property of any sort is taken for \n     public purposes, but our government is depriving us of that \n     which is ours upon a daily basis without any payment what so \n     ever.\n       For all the above findings, the officers of our government \n     are acting in clear repugnance to our Constitution. Those in \n     government who control the course of redress within our \n     institutions know that we have suffered these crimes under \n     our Constitution. Yet, they do nothing, and these facts \n     constitute a condition of officials acting in insurrection \n     and rebellion against our Constitution, as meant in section 3 \n     of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       We all know that should our government fail to immediately \n     purge itself of such manner of conduct, that we each are \n     empowered by Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment to \n     suppress any such manner of insurrection and rebellion--at \n     the expense of our National Treasury.\n       Now let us all understand:\n       That we the people have always had, and still possess, the \n     right, the duty, and the power, to ``effect [our] Safety and \n     Happiness.''\n       That, ``Prudence . . . will dictate that Governments long \n     established [such as ours] should not be changed for light \n     and transient causes; and . . . all [our] experience has \n     shown, that mankind is more disposed to suffer, while evils \n     are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the \n     forms to which [we] are accustomed. But when a long train of \n     abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object \n     evinces a design to reduce [us] under absolute Despotism, it \n     is [our] right, it is our duty, to throw off such government \n     [or usurping officers within], and to provide new Guards for \n     [our] future security.''\n       ``Such has been the patient sufferance of [my countrymen]; \n     and such is now the necessity which constrains [us] to alter \n     [our present state of oppression].'' To this end, we have \n     commenced to keep and bear our Arms upon common respect and \n     allegiance to the defense of our Constitution, and to those \n     long suffering public servants of our government who are \n     compelled to remain silent while a small arrogant elitist \n     sect wield powers never granted to them by us, and destroy \n     our nation.\n       My humble message to this panel is that we know you and \n     your counterparts in the House of Representatives are aware \n     of these problems, and your sworn duty to suppress those \n     federal officials acting against us. We urge you to do your \n     duty. We shall not fail to do ours.\n       Thank you all for your kind attention.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Leroy Crenshaw,\n\n                                    Springfield, MA, May 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Goldberg,\n     Subcommittee on Terrorism, Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I come before this subcommittee on \n     terrorism to state my views, establish for the record the \n     basic concepts behind the Militia movement, and for all \n     American's who are unable to receive justice from a system \n     that is bogged down in red tape and corruption.\n       First, I speak for myself. My dealings with the Internal \n     Revenue Service [IRS] began at a time when I was personally \n     involved with two deaths in my immediate family. One was our \n     daughter, the other was my wife's mother. The IRS claimed we \n     owed an additional $1,000.00 to $2,000.00 in taxes. This \n     figure skyrocketed from that level to $12,000.00 after \n     application of penalties and fines. Upon advice of the \n     federal judge who heard our case, we paid nothing pending a \n     class action suit against the tax shelter. The IRS \n     subsequently closed down the tax shelter, and all \n     participants who were assessed additional taxes, fines, and \n     penalties, by the IRS for their good faith money management. \n     As I said, at that time I was under stress, having just lost \n     two loved ones, and so we paid the $12,000.00. We were given \n     forms to complete that we were told would allow the debt to \n     be forgiven. However, nothing has come of this assurance to \n     date. The forms were returned to the IRS, and we made several \n     telephone calls on this matter only to be told that no one \n     knew anything about this. Justice has not been served in our \n     matter, and I petition this chamber to launch an \n     investigation and return to myself and every other individual \n     that has been targeted by the IRS any and all moneys that \n     have been taken under duress and threat of \n     prosecution. [[Page S7477]] \n       Another case is that of Thomas M. Read v. The United States \n     of America, et al. This case went to the U.S. Supreme Court \n     upon dismissals all along the way (Supreme Court Docket No. \n     92-1952). Thomas Read, and his wife Sandy, had been hounded \n     for six and one-half years by corrupted federal court \n     appointees in the Northern California bankruptcy system. \n     Neither Read, nor his wife, has any connection to any \n     bankruptcy--except by the fraudulent and false claims lodged \n     under Connecticut law against them. In October of 1986, Read \n     underwent a two week jury trail, and he and his wife were \n     found to have been completely innocent of the allegations \n     lodged against them. It was a jury trial, and the jury \n     determined that the plaintiff, a bankruptcy trustee, was \n     guilty of knowingly inducing the Reads into a fraud, a tort \n     offense under Connecticut law. But the trustee ran to his \n     bankruptcy judge in California, and sought and received a \n     ``Permanent Injunction'' against the Reads from ever acting \n     upon their judgment upon the issues he (the trustee) had \n     brought to trial in Connecticut Superior Court. The case had \n     not been removed to federal jurisdiction--because a prior \n     federal action brought against the Reads had resulted in an \n     abstention by the federal courts of exercise of federal \n     jurisdiction over this case, and also because the time \n     limitations for removal to federal jurisdiction had long \n     since expired. Mr. Read was not aware of the corruption that \n     existed in the Northern California bankruptcy system, and \n     filed an appeal to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That court \n     misstated facts, and proceeded to proclaim bankruptcy \n     trustees immune from personal liability upon the false \n     premise that they possessed ``derived judicial immunity'' \n     (This case was mentioned in Rodney Stitch's Book Defrauding \n     America, pp. 109 and 110), even though these trustees do not \n     function in a judicial capacity. The Reads had already \n     suffered a $346,000.00 loss resulting from the years of \n     fraudulent suit, and ultimately suffered a complete financial \n     collapse, in 1989.\n       Since that time, Mr. Read has been railed upon by our \n     federal courts when he has stated the facts of this case. The \n     fact remains, a jury determined that court appointees did \n     conceive and work in concert to perpetrate a fraud upon the \n     Reads. If our government, in order to serve the public, must \n     commit acts constituting torts against ordinary citizens and \n     protect its appointed federal actors, then the government \n     assumes the burden of justly compensating the damaged parties \n     under the Fifth Amendment Taking Clause. In this case, and \n     many others, it did not.\n       Finally we come to the militia movement. Because of all of \n     the above incidents, and many more, the citizens of this \n     country have become disenchanted, skeptical, and suspicious, \n     of our federal government on all levels. I, myself, am not a \n     member of any militia, but having been involved in a dispute \n     with the government in the form of the IRS, and having seen \n     many friends who have become involved in incidents that were \n     not of their making or choosing, I have come to realize that \n     we must force our elected officials to do our bidding because \n     they refuse to respond to us. I must conclude that, since \n     there is so much corruption in government, and there seems to \n     be no way that the ``good guys'' can be differentiated from \n     the ``bad guys'', by the government, then, we have to \n     eliminate the ``bad guys'' ourselves. I am here to advise you \n     that the American people are waking up, and these awakening \n     Americans are seeing the truth of our times. They are seeing \n     many of you, and many of your colleagues, lie and deceive us \n     without even a thought of remorse.\n       The militia movement started because the majority of the \n     politicians are not telling the truth and the people have no \n     redress for their grievances. The politicians are liars and \n     the news media are purveyors of these lies as if they were \n     the truth. The militia movement is comprised of ordinary \n     every day people who love their country and the way of life \n     that is slowly being sucked away by government officers \n     acting upon an usurped authority. You were all put in office \n     by people who are in the militia, who are teachers, like \n     myself, and who are more likely than ever to be unemployed \n     individuals due to unconstitutional laws passed by this \n     Congress, and Executive Orders signed into law that should \n     never see the light of day.\n       Certain actions by the ATF, CIA, IRS, and other federal \n     agencies have brought attention to themselves and their \n     ``Jack booted thugs'' by the few who need to be eliminated \n     from the ranks of federal government. There is no justice if \n     the ones who shoot nursing mothers and dogs, and little \n     children in the back, later get promoted instead of \n     prosecuted. Case in point is Special Agent Potts. Let's get \n     some justice for the American people by putting this murdered \n     (Potts) in jail. We don't want him promoted, we want him, and \n     others of his ilk, out of office, with NO benefits, NO \n     retirement, and NO chance of ever later acquiring them. If a \n     public officer dishonors his oath to defend and protect the \n     Constitution, that officer should relinquish any rights he or \n     she thought that were theirs, but instead it is the people of \n     America who end up relinquishing their individual rights. \n     That IS a crime. People who break the law need to be \n     punished, that includes politicians, judges, trustees, or \n     anyone who has acted in violation of the public trust.\n       The terrorism that has been perpetrated against America, \n     has been against all Americans. How dare they insinuate that \n     loyal Americans would stoop to hurt other Americans. Yet, \n     individuals in the person of Ms. Janet Reno, have the nerve \n     to sit there and act indignant about charges spoken against \n     her on the Waco massacre. Make no mistake, it was a massacre, \n     and I doubt if the truth will ever be told because of the \n     corruption and graft that permeates the entire justice \n     system. These harsh words, but not nearly as harsh as the \n     reality that American citizens endure each day.\n       There is today in America, a resurgence of loyalty and if \n     you are not corrupt, if you work for the people, and if you \n     uphold the Constitution, you have nothing to fear from \n     anyone, much less a militia movement. Unfortunately, payoffs, \n     underhanded money deals, corruption and illegal use of the \n     power of office is the rule rather than the exception. Some \n     believe that the only terrorism instigated in this country \n     today, has been at the hands of government officials. I don't \n     see the people of this country putting up concrete barriers \n     around their homes. This country was founded on the premise \n     that the government worked for the people, not the other way \n     around. If we are being denied access to our ``elected \n     officials'' what is the next step? The saying ``A guilty mind \n     needs no accuser'' applies here! Only the guilty flee, when \n     no one pursues.\n       If Larry Nichols and Terry Reed are wrong in their \n     accusations of massive drug trafficking against Mr. Clinton, \n     let's put them in jail after a fair trial. But, if as we all \n     suspect, they are truthful, let's put Mr. Clinton on the \n     line, Impeach and prosecute and do not under any circumstance \n     allow him to grant immunity or to pardon anyone. Is this too \n     much to ask? I ask all of you, how many members of Congress \n     as well as judges, etc., would remain in office of forced to \n     be held accountable to the laws of the ordinary man.\n       As a black man born and raised in Alabama, I've been \n     subjected to things most Americans only read about in History \n     books. Now, today, in this country, land of the free home of \n     the brave, white Americans are beginning to be subjected to \n     the same types of discrimination and random acts of violence \n     that are really not targeted at any one group, but at all \n     Americans who love their country and are trying to get rid of \n     the corruption and graft that lines our courtrooms and legal \n     professions. The few bad applies do spoil it for the ``good \n     guys'' every time.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leroy Crenshaw.\n                                                                    ____\n\nExcerpt From Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial \n        Law of the Committee on the Judiciary, November 6, 1991\n\n       Hamilton described another bankruptcy-related killing, in \n     which attorney John Scott was murdered as his charges of \n     bankruptcy corruption started to threaten the established \n     racketeering enterprise and the involved federal judges, \n     trustees and law firms. Someone killed Scott near Austin, \n     Texas.\n\n\n              giving themselves immunity from their crimes\n\n       Federal judges of the Ninth Circuit held that the private \n     trustees, including embezzler Charles Duck, who committed the \n     nation's worst Chapter 11 corruption, were officers of the \n     court, and were therefore immune from liability. Federal \n     judges, therefore, held that a citizen has no claim against \n     an officer of the court (i.e., trustee, attorney, judge, or \n     one of their employees) arising from the criminal acts of \n     that federal official, even though the acts are criminal and \n     inflict enormous harm upon an innocent person. They held in \n     effect that officers of the court could inflict any type of \n     outrage upon the public, and the public has no remedy.\n       One of the many people victimized by the judicial \n     corruption was Thomas Read of Connecticut. Read had not \n     sought relief in Chapter 11, but was affected by Charles \n     Duck, and the federal judges seeking to protect the admitted \n     embezzler. Read obtained a Connecticut judgment against Duck. \n     Bankruptcy Judge Alan Jaroslovsky of Santa Rosa, who had \n     protected Duck's criminal activities, issued an injunction \n     forever barring Read from enforcing the judgment. Read argued \n     that the injunctive order exceeded the judge's authority. \n     Read filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy \n     Appellate Panel (composed of Chapter 11 judges. The appellate \n     panel rendered a published decision:\n       ``Federal judges, seeking to protect these criminal acts \n     and themselves, have rendered decisions holding that \n     ``judicial immunity not only protects judges against suit \n     from acts done within their jurisdiction, but also spreads \n     outward to shield related public servants, including trustees \n     in bankruptcy.''\n       ``This circuit has adopted a . . . rationale stating that a \n     trustee or an official acting under the authority of the \n     bankruptcy judge is entitled to derived judicial immunity \n     because he is performing an integral part of the judicial \n     process. . . . a trustee, who obtains court approval for \n     actions under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, is \n     entitled to derived immunity.\n       ``It is well settled that the trustee in bankruptcy is an \n     officer of the appointing court. Courts other than the \n     appointing court have no jurisdiction to entertain suits \n     against the trustee, without leave from the appointing court, \n     for acts done in an official capacity and within his \n     authority as an officer of the court. . . . It is . . . \n     axiomatic that the Trustee, `as a trustee in bankruptcy [and] \n     as an official acting under the authority of the \n     [[Page S7478]] bankruptcy judge, is entitled to derived \n     judicial immunity because he is performing an integral part \n     of the judicial process.'\n       ``Sound policy also mandates immunizing the trustee. The \n     possibility that we would hold trustees personally liable for \n     judgments rendered against them in their representative \n     capacity would invariably lessen the vigor with which \n     trustees pursue their obligations. Immunity is essential \n     because, as Judge Learned Hand noted, ``to submit all \n     officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden \n     of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would \n     dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most \n     irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties. \n     . . . Accordingly, we hold that the trustee [Charles Duck], \n     acting under the authority of the court, is entitled to \n     derived judicial immunity.''\n       As the judicial involvement in the Chapter 11 corruption \n     surfaced, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rendered a \n     judgment\\103\\ protecting judges against responsibility for \n     their criminal acts. The Ninth Circuit rendered the decision \n     holding that regardless of any criminal conduct committed \n     against the public or an individual by a judge or person \n     acting on his behalf, such as a trustee, the public had no \n     remedy against the judges, or anyone acting with the judges. \n     The need for these self-protective and unconstitutional \n     decisions is rapidly increasing as federal judges are heavily \n     implicated in some of the worst criminal activities ever \n     exposed in the history of the United States. Worse judicial \n     corruption has yet to be described.\n       Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court enlarged upon the \n     protection against their own criminal acts (and they may need \n     this protection shortly). The Supreme Court Justices held in \n     Stump v. Sparkman\\104\\ that a judge could deliberately commit \n     unlawful, unconstitutional, and corrupt acts upon a citizen, \n     destroy personal and property rights, and be immune from \n     financial liability. This decision was repeatedly stated by \n     U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel, San Francisco, as I sought \n     relief against California and federal judges.\n       The Constitution and statutes disagree with judge-made law, \n     federal civil rights statutes and constitutional rights to \n     seek relief clearly do not provide immunity to federal judges \n     when they violate clear and settled civil and constitutional \n     rights, or against corrupt or criminal acts, and who inflict \n     harm upon any member of the American public.\n       In Stump v. Sparkman the judge entered into a conspiracy, \n     ordering a young girl permanently sterilized. The Supreme \n     Court held that the girl had no remedy against the judge, as \n     the public's welfare requires that a judge be free to \n     exercise his duties without fear of the consequences. That is \n     a farce, and the public's welfare isn't protected by \n     protecting crooked judges.\n                                                                    ____\n\n    Appearance Before the Senate Subcommit- tee on Anti-\n                        Terrorism, May 25, 1995\n\n       Not only is it a pleasure to have this opportunity to \n     define for your and America who and what the militia is, what \n     they stand for and why all Americans have the constitutional \n     obligation to participate in patriotic or militia groups, but \n     it is also saddening that this opportunity arose out of the \n     Oklahoma tragedy.\n       Contrary to popular opinion, the Militia Of Montana does \n     not base its existence upon the legal definition of militia. \n     The foundation for the right to exist is clearly a First \n     Amendment issue, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, \n     as a private organization. At this time there are \n     approximately ten million American citizens participating in \n     patriot/militia activities in all fifty states, with the \n     numbers growing steadily every day.\n       The Militia Of Montana, created by a few loyal American \n     citizens, has become a national ``guide-post'' for newly \n     founded patriot groups.\n       Why people need to participate in militia/patriot \n     organizations and activities is best shown in the Declaration \n     of Independence. It is too lengthy to read at this time, \n     however it speaks for itself and for American patriots. We \n     would like to request that this document be entered into the \n     permanent record at this time, as a partial support document \n     to our statements.\n       The Declaration of Independence gives excellent insight and \n     explanation as to why individuals go to extreme measures when \n     flagrant injustices continue by ``out of control'', \n     oppressive public servants. This same restrictive oppression \n     is once again rearing its ugly head, only this time in \n     America.\n       The following are just a few examples as to why American \n     citizens are becoming more and more involved in militia/\n     patriot organizations:\n       The high Office of the Presidency has turned into a \n     position of a Dictator through the abusive use of Executive \n     Orders and Directives. This must be stopped. The Senate and \n     the House of Representatives have been stripped of their \n     power and authority and act only as mouth pieces for ``public \n     policy''. When the President over rules the Congress by \n     Executive Order, Senators and Representatives wonder why \n     their constituents are so upset.\n       When government corruption, fraud, deception and secret \n     government theft has not been tried and adjudicated, Senators \n     and Representatives wonder why their constituents are so \n     upset.\n       When government plans and authorizes the assassination of \n     87 Americans in their home and church, or directs the sniper \n     to kill a mother while holding her infant in her arms and \n     then awards those responsible with a job promotion, Senators \n     and Representatives wonder why their constituents are so \n     upset.\n       When government takes private property from American \n     Citizens to protect the kangaroo rat, Senators and \n     Representatives wonder why their constituents are so upset.\n       When government law enforcers, dressed like local gang \n     members in total black, bust down your door, often the wrong \n     door, Senators and Representatives wonder why their \n     constituents are so upset.\n       When the President, Senate and House of Representatives \n     infringed upon the Second Amendment, are attempting to \n     infringe upon the Fourth Amendment (H.R. 666) and are now, \n     through these hearings, contemplating on infringing upon the \n     First Amendment, Senators and Representatives wonder why \n     their constituents are so upset.\n       When private interest groups like ``The World Government of \n     World Citizens'' can sell their own stamps and their own \n     passports to their own members and the government allows and \n     accepts them as valid, contrary to the law, Senators and \n     Representatives wonder why their constituents are so upset.\n       When government allows our military to be ordered and \n     controlled by foreigners, Senators and Representatives wonder \n     why their constituents are so upset.\n       When government allows foreign armies (some of whom are \n     using them to kill their own citizens) to train in our land, \n     Senators and Representatives wonder why their constituents \n     are so upset.\n       When government allows the military to label patriots as \n     the enemy, Senators and Representatives wonder why their \n     constituents are so upset.\n       When government defines human beings as a biological \n     resource under ecosystem management, Senators and \n     Representatives wonder why their constituents are so upset.\n       When government sends billions of dollars in aid to foreign \n     countries while there are millions of homeless and starving \n     Americans, Senators and Representatives wonder why their \n     constituents are so upset.\n       When government forces Americans to work over five months \n     to pay their income taxes alone, Senators and Representatives \n     wonder why their constituents are so upset.\n       When government refuses to hold hearings on government \n     sanctioned abuses, Senators and Representatives wonder why \n     their constituents are so upset.\n       When government tampers with and destroys evidence needed \n     to solve a crime, Senators and Representatives wonder why \n     their constituents are so upset.\n       When government now considers the very idea of infringing \n     upon the people's rights of freedom of speech, assembly and \n     the right to redress, Senators and Representatives wonder why \n     their constituents are so upset.\n       ``The Law perverted and the police powers of the state \n     perverted along with it!! The law not only turns from its \n     proper-purpose, but made to follow a totally contrary \n     purpose, the law becomes the weapon of every kind of greed.\n       Instead of checking crime the law itself becomes guilty of \n     the evils it is supposed to pursue.\n       Since this is now true, it is a grave and serious fact. \n     Moral duty to my fellow man requires us to call these facts \n     to the attention of our fellow citizens.''\n       These were the words of a French Patriot, Frederick \n     Bastiat, in 1884 as he watched his nation move into Socialism \n     and an oppressive police state.\n       These are identical concerns echoed today by the militia/\n     patriot groups and organizations. These groups and \n     organizations represent lawyers, doctors, soldiers and \n     laborers.\n       Militia/patriot organizations are not terroristic, \n     aggressive or offensive in structure or design. We have, and \n     presently deplore and denounce the senseless act of violence \n     that took place in Oklahoma. We have and will continue to \n     assist in any manner to apprehend all persons that may have \n     planned or carried out that deed. At whatever level they may \n     hide.\n       Militia/patriot groups are only aggressive in our means by \n     which we educate a docile American public. Our singular \n     mandate, which is public and overt, is the preservation of \n     the Constitution of the United States (a Republic), as it was \n     founded and the Sovereignty of this great nation.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives the people would like to know where and when \n     it will end? Will it end with America turning into a \n     Socialist Republic (which we all know is the end result of a \n     Democracy)? Or, will you do your duty to fulfill your oath \n     which all of you took to defend this country from all enemies \n     foreign and domestic?\n       If you decide to fulfill your oath the first thing you must \n     do is stop relying upon rumor and gossip. Do not rely upon \n     the press or other organizations which have their own \n     agendas. Rely upon your own investigations.\n       As one example, we would like to refer you to the \n     Congressional Record of the 92d Congress, First Session, Vol. \n     117, No. 189, Monday, December 6, 1971, House of \n     Representatives. Congressman John R. Rarick (D-La.) exposed \n     the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL) vast world-wide spy \n     network. According to Congressman Rarick the ADL provides \n     information to the press which accepts it as truth, \n     Congressman Rarick also stated the [[Page S7479]] ADL uses \n     its information ``to suppress free speech and discussion and \n     to influence public thought and sentiment of an unsuspecting \n     citizenry.''\n       Lo and behold what do we now have? Legislation that will \n     suppress freedom of speech and discussion.\n       In 1983 the Department of Justice (DOJ) paid the ADL \n     $20,000 in taxpayers' money to produce a report on so-called \n     ``hate groups''. The DOJ refused to publish the report \n     because it was so sensationalized that the DOJ could not \n     consider it credible. The ADL went ahead with it's own \n     copyright and published the report anyway, feeding it to the \n     press. The DOJ forced the ADL to relinquish the copyright. \n     Now the ADL is once again feeding the press lies, rumor and \n     gossip which the press accepts as gospel.\n       The press then takes this mis-information, rumor and \n     gossip, sensationalizes it to spin a tale until it grows and \n     grows so out of proportion that the press starts scrambling \n     to create a better story than the other guy. Law enforcement, \n     military and government officials then pick up on it \n     believing in a literal ``feeding-frenzy'' of the press. This \n     has become a story that had lost control and those who do not \n     investigate it for themselves are totally irresponsible, \n     especially law makers.\n       As we are now witnessing, Americans are questioning the \n     press. This is evidenced by the phenomenal growth of the \n     patriot/militia movement.\n       As this patriotic awareness expands, millions of Americans \n     will expect a new view from a more responsive government. A \n     new re-birth of responsibility from a government that has \n     strayed from it's ``job-description'' as mandated by the \n     Constitution. A government created by the people and for the \n     people. Not the limited few.\n       May God be with all America as he watches over the \n     shoulders of you who write her laws. A nation can survive \n     it's fools and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive \n     treason from within.\n       America has nothing to fear from patriots maintaining \n     ``vigilance.'' She should, however, fear those that would \n     ``outlaw'' vigilance.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7474-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     WACO AND RUBY RIDGE INQUIRIES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1199\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for Mr. Dole, for \n     himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Gramm, and \n     Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 1199.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nthe Dole-Hatch Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995. This \namendment has within it one of the most important pieces of criminal \nlaw in this country's history, and that is the Dole-Specter-Hatch \nhabeas corpus reform bill. That is only one part of it, but that is the \none part that will make a difference with regard to the Oklahoma City \nbombing.\n  This legislation represents a landmark bipartisan effort to address \nthe issue of grave national importance; that is, the prevention and \npunishment of acts of domestic and international terrorism.\n  This legislation adds important tools to the Government's fight \nagainst terrorism and does so in a temperate manner that is protective \nof civil liberties. In short, I believe that this bill is the most \ncomprehensive antiterrorism bill ever considered in the Senate.\n  This legislation increases the penalties for acts of foreign and \ndomestic terrorism, including the use of weapons of mass destruction, \nattacks on officials and employees of the United States, and conspiracy \nto commit terrorist acts.\n  It gives the President enhanced tools to use his foreign policy \npowers to combat terrorism overseas, and it gives those of our citizens \nharmed by terrorist acts of outlaw states the right to sue their \nattackers in our own courts of law.\n  Our bill provides a constitutional mechanism to the Government to \ndeport aliens suspected of engaging in terrorist activity without \ndivulging our national security secrets.\n  It also includes a provision that constitutionally limits the ability \nof foreign terrorist organizations to raise funds within the United \nStates.\n  Our bill also provides measured enhancements to the authority of \nFederal law enforcement to investigate terrorist threats and acts. In \naddition to giving law enforcement the legal tools they need to do the \njob, our bill also authorizes increased resources for law enforcement \nto carry out its mission. The bill provides for $1.8 billion over 5 \nyears for an enhanced antiterrorism effort at both the Federal and the \nState level.\n  The bill also implements the convention on the marking of plastic \nexplosives. It requires that the makers of plastic explosives make the \nexplosives detectable.\n  Finally, the bill appropriately reforms habeas corpus, as I mentioned \nbefore.\n  The Specter-Hatch habeas corpus bill will correct some of the \ndeficiencies in criminal law that exist today. It will stop the \nfrivolous appeals that have been driving people nuts throughout this \ncountry and subjecting victims and families of victims to unnecessary \npain for year after year after year.\n  Habeas corpus allows those convicted of brutal crimes, including \nterrorism, to delay the just imposition of punishment for years. And \nthis will correct that while still preserving and protecting the \nconstitutional rights of those who are accused.\n  Several points, however, should be addressed. I have long opposed the \nunchecked expansion of Federal authority and will continue to do so. \nStill, the Federal Government does have a legitimate role to play in \nour national life and in law enforcement. In particular, the Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to protect all of our citizens from \nserious criminal threats emanating from abroad or those that involve \nthe national interest. Over 140 years ago, Abraham Lincoln had this to \nsay about the role of Government.\n  The legitimate object of Government is--\n\n       . . . to do for the people what needs to be done, but which \n     they cannot, by individual effort, do at all, or do so well, \n     for themselves. If some men will kill, it is a common object \n     with peaceful and just men to prevent it.\n\n  Similarly, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to \nassist the States in meeting those threats that none alone can \nadequately meet. The terrorist threat, whether posed by foreign \nentities or domestic interests, meets this test.\n  We must, nevertheless, remember that our response to terrorism \ncarries with it the grave risk of impinging on the rights of free \nspeech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the right \nto keep and bear arms. We cannot allow this to happen. It would be \ncruel irony if, in response to the acts of evil and misguided men \nhostile to our Government, we stifled true debate on the proper role of \nGovernment.\n  Nor shall we exchange our precious Constitution which has protected \nus for over 200 years for false promises of ``increased security.'' For \nas Ben Franklin said:\n\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\n       Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase \n     temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation the Senate begins consideration of \ntoday enhances our safety without sacrificing the liberty of American \ncitizens. Each of the provisions in the bill strikes a careful balance \nbetween necessary vigilance against a terrorist threat and the \npreservation of our cherished freedom. Several of the provisions \ndeserve special mention.\n  First, I would like to briefly discuss the Alien Terrorist Removal \nAct. I firmly believe it is time to give our law enforcement and courts \nthe tools they need to quickly remove alien terrorists from within our \nmidst without jeopardizing, for example, national security or the lives \nof law enforcement personnel.\n  This provision in this bill provides the Justice Department with a \nmechanism to do this. It allows for a special deportation hearing and \nin camera, ex parte review by a special panel of Federal judges when \nthe disclosure in open court of Government evidence would pose a threat \nto national security.\n  It is entirely within the power of Congress to establish special \nadjudicatory proceedings and to specify the procedural rights of aliens \ninvolved in terrorist acts. As the Supreme Court noted over 10 years \nago, ``control over matters of immigration is a sovereign prerogative, \nlargely within the control of the Executive and the Legislature.'' \n[Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34-35 (1982).] So long as the \nprocedures established by Congress are essentially fair, they satisfy \nthe requirement of Due Process.\n  Moreover, we have the power as well to distinguish between classes of \naliens and accord separate procedures to different classes. Congress \nhas plenary power over immigration and naturalization. The legitimate \ndistinction between aliens and citizens justifies and permits both \nseparate procedures for aliens and the congressional determination that \nnot all aliens should be treated alike. [Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 \n(1976).]\n  Mr. President, sound policy dictates that we take steps to ensure \nthat we deport alien terrorists without disclosing to them and their \npartners our national security secrets. The success of our counter-\nterrorism efforts depends on the effective use of classified \ninformation used to infiltrate foreign terrorist groups. We cannot \nafford to turn over these secrets in open court, jeopardizing both the \nfuture success of these programs and the lives of those who carry them \nout.\n  Some raise heart-felt concerns about the precedence of this \nprovision. I believe their opposition is sincere, and I respect their \nviews. Yet, these special proceedings are not criminal proceedings for \nwhich the alien will be incarcerated. Rather, the result will simply be \nthe removal of these aliens from U.S. soil--that is all.\n  Americans are a fair people. Our Nation has always emphasized that \nits procedures be just and fair. And the procedures in this bill are in \nkeeping with that tradition. The special court would have to determine \nthat:\n  First, the alien in question was an alien terrorist;\n  Second, that an ordinary deportation hearing would pose a security \nrisk; and\n  Third, that the threat by the alien's physical presence is grave and \nimmediate.\n  The alien would be provided with counsel, given all information which \nwould not pose a risk if disclosed, would be provided with a summary of \nthe evidence, and would have the right of appeal. Still, in our effort \nto be fair, we must not provide to terrorists and to their supporters \nabroad the informational means to wreak more havoc on our society. This \nprovision is an appropriate means to ensure that we do not.\n  Second, this bill includes provisions making it a crime to knowingly \nprovide material support to the terrorist functions of foreign groups \ndesignated by a presidential finding to be engaged in terrorist \nactivities.\n  I am sensitive to the concerns of some that this provision impinges \non freedoms protected by the first amendment. I have worked hard to \nensure that this provision will not violate the Constitution or place \ninappropriate restrictions on cherished first amendment freedoms. In \nfact, we have made significant changes to the original version of this \nmeasure proposed by the Clinton administration. For example, we have \nsubjected the executive branch's designation of a group as an \ninternational terrorist group to judicial review. In addition, we have \nremoved troubling licensing requirements that were in the original bill \nsubmitted by the administration.\n  Nothing in the Dole-Hatch version of this provision prohibits the \nfree exercise of religion or speech, or impinges on the freedom of \nassociation. Moreover, nothing in the Constitution provides the right \nto engage in violence against fellow citizens. Aiding and financing \nterrorist bombings is not constitutionally protected activity. \nAdditionally, I have to believe that honest donors to any organization \nwould want to know if their contributions were being used for such \nscurrilous purposes.\n  And finally, Mr. President, I would like to address an issue which \nhas inappropriately overshadowed all of the other fine provisions of \nthis legislation--the inclusion of the Specter-Hatch habeas corpus \nreform in this bill. Some have stated that the inclusion of habeas \nreform in this bill is political opportunism. Mr. President, nothing \ncould be further from the truth. The plain truth is, habeas corpus \nreform is entirely germane to this legislation. The President has asked \nfor this reform. And the American people are demanding it.\n  Let me just read this letter that is shown here on this particular \nchart. It is dated May 10, 1995. It is to the Honorable Bill Clinton, \nthe President of the United States. Let me just read one paragraph.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                     May 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Bill Clinton,\n     The President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: As a bi-partisan group of Attorneys \n     General from our respective states, we would like to express \n     our support for your efforts to bring the American people \n     together in a common expression of support for those who have \n     suffered from the tragic events in Oklahoma City. We also \n     appreciate your clear expression of support for the rule of \n     law, at a time when these acts of lawlessness have brought \n     about such human tragedy.\n       In this regard, your comments on CBS' 60 Minutes program \n     regarding the need for the reform of federal habeas corpus \n     procedures is most appropriate. In our own states, we \n     continue to experience endless appeals and continuous delay. \n     We believe that such abuse of the criminal justice system \n     produces a disrespect for the law, and serves to undermine \n     deterrence.\n       This is particularly true with respect to the enforcement \n     of the death penalty. As the Powell Committee Report noted:\n       ``The relatively small number of executions as well as the \n     delay in cases where an execution has occurred makes clear \n     that the present system of collateral review operates to \n     frustrate the law of the 37 states.''\n       This accurately describes the current status of capital \n     punishment in the states and unfortunately portends a similar \n     fortune for the recently enacted death penalty provisions of \n     Title VI of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994. Motions under current Title 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 will \n     produce the same morass of endless delay and procedural \n     manipulation that the states have encountered under Title 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2254. Thus, if we are to have an effective death \n     penalty on the state and federal levels, legislative action \n     is necessary.\n       In this regard, expedited consideration of such legislation \n     in the context of the anti-terrorism bill is entirely \n     appropriate. Unless habeas corpus reform is enacted, capital \n     sentences for such acts of senseless violence will face \n     endless legal obstacles. This will undermine the credibility \n     of the sanctions, and the expression of our level of \n     opprobrium as a nation for acts of terrorism.\n       It is our belief that S. 623, the Habeas Corpus Reform Act \n     of 1995, is the appropriate vehicle to bring about an \n     effective and enforceable death penalty with respect to both \n     state and federal levels of jurisdiction. The enactment of \n     these provisions is essential to our states, and critical to \n     Federal anti-terrorism legislation, if the maximum sanctions \n     our society has to offer will have real meaning.\n       We again, offer our support for your efforts to lead the \n     nation out of the abyss of a terrible tragedy. We also offer \n     our commitment to help deliver legislation to the American \n     people that will provide an enforceable death penalty for the \n     most heinous crimes against our citizens. Thank you again for \n     your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         W.A. Drew Edmondson, Attorney General of Oklahoma; Daniel \n           E. Lungren, Attorney General of California; Jeff \n           Sessions, Attorney General of Alabama; Ernest D. \n           Preate, Jr., Attorney General of Pennsylvania; Dan \n           Morales, Attorney General of Texas; [[Page S7481]] Gale \n           A. Norton, Attorney General of Colorado, Joseph P. \n           Mazurek; Attorney General of Montana, Don Stenberg, \n           Attorney General of Nebraska; Richard P. Ieyoub, \n           Attorney General of Louisiana; Grant Woods, Attorney \n           General of Arizona; Alan G. Lance, Attorney General of \n           Idaho; Mike Moore, Attorney General of Mississippi.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me emphasize this one paragraph right here.\n  This is from, I might add, a bipartisan group of attorneys general \nfrom respective States, both Democrats and Republicans. This is what \nthey say in this paragraph:\n\n       It is our belief that S. 623, the Habeas Corpus Reform Act \n     of 1995, is the appropriate vehicle to bring about an \n     effective and enforceable death penalty with respect to both \n     State and Federal levels of jurisdiction. The enactment of \n     these provisions is essential to our states, and critical to \n     Federal anti-terrorism legislation, if the maximum sanction \n     our society has to offer will have real meaning.\n\n  This is signed by W.A. Drew Edmondson, Democrat Attorney General of \nOklahoma; Daniel E. Lungren, Republican Attorney General of California; \nJeff Sessions, Attorney General of Alabama, Ernest D. Preate, Jr., \nAttorney General of Pennsylvania; Dan Morales, Attorney General of \nTexas, who also is a Democrat; Gale A. Norton, Attorney General of \nColorado; Joseph P. Mazurek, Attorney General of Montana; Don Stenberg, \nAttorney General of Nebraska; Richard P. Ieyoub, Attorney General of \nLouisiana; Grant Woods, Attorney General of Arizona; Alan G. Lance, \nAttorney General of Idaho; and Mike Moore, Attorney General of \nMississippi, who is also a Democrat.\n  So this is a bipartisan group of attorneys general. And I believe \nmost attorneys general are in agreement that habeas corpus reform is \nabsolutely essential if we are going to solve some of the problems that \nexists in the terrorist area.\n  President Clinton, on ``60 Minutes'' right after the Oklahoma \nbombing, or shortly after, had this to say:\n\n       I do believe the habeas corpus provision of the Federal law \n     which permit these appeals sometimes to be delayed seven, \n     eight, nine years should be changed. I have advocated that. . \n     . .\n       I hope the Congress will pass--a reform of the Habeas \n     Corpus provisions because it should not take eight or nine \n     years and three trips to the Supreme Court to finalize \n     whether a person in fact was properly convicted or not.\n\n  The President's instincts were right at that time and they are right \ntoday.\n  Now, let me just say one other thing, so people understand the rule \nof law is being mocked in our society.\n  This chart shows the number of inmates on death row versus the actual \nexecutions. These are people who have been convicted of heinous crimes, \nhave been proven to be guilty of the murders involved. There were 2,976 \nas of January 1995. Since 1977, almost 20 years ago, 18 years ago, \nthere are only 281 who have had to suffer the punishment. In 20 years, \nonly 281 have had to face the punishment that they were assessed by \ntheir respective juries and the States. And in almost every one of \nthose cases there have been habeas appeals one right after the other.\n  For those who think habeas corpus reform is not appropriate, let them \nlisten to those victims of the Oklahoma bombing who called me \nyesterday, who lost their wives, their children, members of their \nfamily, and who said, ``Please pass your habeas corpus reform,'' \nSenator Specter's and your habeas corpus reform.\n  I spoke with several family members of victims of the Oklahoma City \nbombing. They held a press conference yesterday and said this is the \nonly thing we could do to prevent even further suffering by these \npeople.\n  I have to say, under our habeas corpus reform provisions, under those \nprovisions, people's rights will be protected. There will be a full \nright of appeal all the way up the State courts, from the lowest court \nto the Supreme Court of the State. There will be a full right of appeal \nall the way up the Federal courts, from Federal court to district court \nto the Supreme Court of the United States, and their rights will be \nprotected. But that is all they are going to have, unless they can show \nnewly discovered evidence of innocence or unless the Supreme Court \napplies retroactively future cases to these problems.\n  So, rather than exploiting the devastation of Oklahoma City, I \nbelieve that by including this provision in the antiterrorism \nlegislation, we are protecting the families of victims.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a series of letters from \nthe victims in this matter be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: On April 19, 1995, each of us lost a \n     dear member of our family in the devastating bombing that \n     occurred in downtown Oklahoma City. Our families and many \n     other families will never recover from this tragedy.\n       When the blast occurred, Oklahoma City was helped by \n     experienced and skilled professionals. Our state placed the \n     care of our victims and family members in their hands and \n     they responded with all of the expertise that we expected. \n     Their jobs were performed efficiently and with tremendous \n     ability.\n       Now, we find that we must place our faith in the abilities \n     of prosecutors and lawmakers and hope they can repair the \n     appeals process so that it takes not a moment longer than is \n     required by the Constitution. As ordinary citizens we are \n     unable to fully understand all of the legal implications that \n     are found within the Dole-Hatch-Specter habeas corpus \n     provision in Senate Bill 735. We believe that Oklahoma \n     Attorney General Drew Edmondson is acting in our behalf by \n     trying to change the laws so that criminals may be brought to \n     justice quickly. This measure must not be weakened.\n       President Clinton made a promise to the victim's families \n     during his visit at the Oklahoma City Memorial Service. \n     Please help him keep his promise to use and see that this \n     bill is passed.\n         Dan McKinney Diane Leonard; Glenn A.

Murrah building. She worded for Secret Service, I \n     work for GSA. On April 19th my sisters life along with many \n     others was taken away. I'll never be able to forget the sound \n     or the terrible feeling of death that was in the air that \n     day. My first thought was to try to find my sister. When I \n     reached the 9th floor I knew there was no way she would have \n     survived the explosion, my only hope was that she stayed home \n     that day. But unfortunately she didn't. Now the only way I \n     can focus my anger, loneliness and the piece of my heart that \n     is now empty, is to try to get the Hatch/Spector bill passed. \n     Mr. Clinton promised swift justice to the persons responsible \n     for this crime. We need to have change. We need your support \n     and help to bring change.\n           Sincerely,\n     Clifford Davis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: My name is Diane Leonard. My husband, Secret \n     Service Agent Donald R. Leonard, was murdered along with 167 \n     innocent people in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah \n     Federal Building on April 19, 1995. The employees in this \n     building were abiding by and upholding the laws of this \n     country. We now need your support, not only for the families \n     of this tragedy, but for all American families who have lost \n     loved ones at the hands of murderers. Please lend all your \n     support to seeing that the habeas reform contained in the \n     Hatch-Specter bill is passed as expeditiously as possible.\n       We have been promised justice, but we feel justice will not \n     be accomplished until the verdict of a jury is carried out.\n       Please help us in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Leonard.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n\n    Media Advisory From Drew Edmondson, Attorney General of Oklahoma\n\n       Victims of the Murrah Building bombing who have family \n     members scheduled to be represented at this news conference \n     are Kathy Lynn Seidl, 39, investigative assistant, Secret \n     Service; Scott Williams, 24, who had made a delivery to the \n     day care center April 19; Mickey Maroney, 50, special agent, \n     Secret Service; Don Leonard, 50, special agent, Secret \n     Service; Linda McKinney, office manager, Secret Service; \n     Shelly Turner Bland, 25, Drug Enforcement Administration; and \n     Sonja Sanders, Federal Employees Credit Union.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       To Judge Mikva: My name is Dan McKinney, my wife (Linda \n     McKinney) office manager for the secret service was murdered \n     on April 19, 1995. Please accept my heartfelt gratitude for \n     you and your staffs effort in [[Page S7482]] trying to pass \n     the Dole, Hatch, Spector, Habeas Reform Bill. Criminals have \n     been allowed too much time in appealing their sentences. Lets \n     give them fair opportunity but not ten to twenty years to \n     live and waste taxpayers dollars. Attorney General Drew \n     Edmondson and his staff are working and speaking for us here \n     in Oklahoma. They are doing a wonderful job and we stand \n     behind them 100%.

Murrah building April 19th, 1995. The habeas \n     corpus reform bill presented by Hatch-Specter as I understand \n     will shorten the appeals process. We need change, my family \n     wants justice. Here in Oklahoma we have a man on death row. \n     This man committed several brutal murders. Roger Dale \n     Stafford has been on death row for 17 years. This is not \n     right. When the remains of the Murrah building was imploded \n     May 23rd there was some relief. When the people responsible \n     for this terrible act are found guilty and executed, our \n     families can begin a very important step of the healing \n     process.\n           Thank you,\n     Glenn Seidl.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: My name is Alice Maroney-Denison. My father, \n     Mickey B. Maroney, was murdered in the Oklahoma City bombing \n     on April 19th. On that day my life fell apart. You see my \n     father was my life and in one second he was gone. I didn't \n     get to say goodbye or I love you. I did get to see a war zone \n     in downtown Oklahoma City and a federal building that was \n     blown apart. You might have seen it on T.V. but you didn't \n     feel the glass on your feet or the pain in your heart like I \n     did.\n       I'm telling you this because I need your help. I need your \n     support in passing Habeas reform. The murderers who committed \n     this crime should be executed as soon as possible, not in 15-\n     20 years. My father will not get to live another 15-20 years \n     so why should the convicted?\n       I cannot put all of my feelings about my father on paper, \n     but I can tell you one thing, I loved him with all of my \n     heart.

We don't want to see the individuals who committed \n     this horrible crime to sit in prison for 15-20 years, I am 8 \n     months pregnant and my husband Scott did not have a chance to \n     even see his child!\n       Just as the President said, we want this to be swift and \n     quick so that we can start the healing process.\n       We will be eternally grateful.\n           Thank you,\n     Nicole Williams.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       Senator: My 24 year old son, Scott Williams, was murdered \n     along with 166 other innocent victims in the Oklahoma City \n     Murrah Building bombing. On behalf of my son, and the others \n     who lost their voices on April 19, 1995, because of this \n     senseless tragedy, I urge you to help enact much needed \n     reform of habeas corpus.\n       Those who are brought to trial and convicted must be \n     punished to the full extent of the law. It is certainly my \n     hope that the death penalty will be carried out as soon as \n     possible in this case. My son and the other victims surely \n     deserve no less.\n           Sincerely,\n     Connie Williams.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       Senator: I am the mother-in-law of Scott Williams, one of \n     the victims in the Oklahoma City bombing. We would ask you to \n     please pass Senate Bill 623 the Hatch and Spector bill. We \n     feel that if you are sentenced to die, it should be as swift \n     as our President said. Our loved ones did not have ten to \n     twenty years to prepare for their deaths. So please see to it \n     that the people who commit these crimes are given swift \n     justice.\n           Thank you for your help,\n     Carolyn Templin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       Senator: My sister, Kathy Seidl, was murdered on April 19, \n     1995 at the federal building in Oklahoma City.\n       Our family is afraid that the people responsible for this \n     act will be allowed to sit in federal prison for many long \n     years before execution takes place.\n       Kathy wasn't allowed to say goodbye to her family or to \n     share any more of her wonderful presence with us. If the \n     murderers are sitting in federal prison for 10-20 years they \n     will be given the right to visit with their families and to \n     say their goodbyes. How does this give justice to us?\n       We would like to see that habeas corpus reform presented by \n     Hatch-Spector is adopted. We thank you and are eternally \n     grateful for your support of habeas corpus reform.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wanda Fincher.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: My name is Dan McKinney. I lost my \n     wife (Linda McKinney), my niece (Shelly (Turner) Bland) in \n     the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building on April 19, \n     1995. My wife was the office manager for the Secret Service \n     here in Oklahoma City. She and my niece have never hurt \n     anyone. I am very angry at the perpetrators of this heinous \n     crime. I'm sorry that it has taken such a tragedy to bring \n     forth the effort to try to get a change in our appeals \n     system. But I want my voice to have a vote in the strongest \n     bill we can possibly pass to keep these animal from reaching \n     old age before they have to account for their total disregard \n     for our judicial system, but most of all human life. We, the \n     survivor's of the victims of the bombing want the nation to \n     know, we are fed up. We want justice to be fair, but we want \n     it to be swift for all parties that are found guilty. Please \n     support the strongest habeas reform bill presented by \n     Specter-Hatch that we can get. No more living off the \n     taxpayers for ten to twenty years.\n           Thank you for your support,\n     Dan McKinney.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       My sister Kathy Seidl and myself both work downtown at the \n     Alfred P. Murrah building. She worked for Secret Service, I \n     work for GSA. On April 19th my sisters life along with many \n     others was taken away. I'll never be able to forget the sound \n     or the terrible feeling of death that was in the air that \n     day. My first thought was to try to find my sister. When I \n     reached the 9th floor I knew there was no way she would have \n     survived the explosion, my only hope was that she stayed home \n     that day. But unfortunately she didn't. Now the only way I \n     can focus my anger, loneliness and the piece of my heart that \n     is now empty, is to try to get the Hatch/Spector bill passed. \n     Mr. Clinton promised swift justice to the persons responsible \n     for this crime. We need to have change. We need your support \n     and help to bring change.\n           Sincerely,\n     Clifford Davis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: My name is Diane Leonard. My husband, Secret \n     Service Agent Donald R. Leonard, was murdered along with 167 \n     innocent people in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah \n     Federal Building on April 19, 1995. The employees in this \n     building were abiding by and upholding the laws of this \n     country. We now need your support, not only for the families \n     of this tragedy, but for all American families who have lost \n     loved ones at the hands of murderers. Please lend all your \n     support to seeing that the habeas reform contained in the \n     Hatch-Specter bill is passed as expeditiously as possible.\n       We have been promised justice, but we feel justice will not \n     be accomplished until the verdict of a jury is carried out.\n       Please help us in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Diane Leonard.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just read one of them to the folks who are \nlistening. This is dated May 24, yesterday:\n\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: On April 19, 1995, each of us lost a \n     dear member of our family in the devastating bombing that \n     occurred in downtown Oklahoma City. Our families and many \n     other families will never recover from this tragedy.\n       When the blast occurred, Oklahoma City was helped by \n     experienced and skilled professionals. Our state placed the \n     care of our victims and family members in their hands and \n     they responded with all of the expertise that we expected. \n     Their jobs were performed efficiently and with tremendous \n     ability.\n       Now, we find that we must place our faith in the abilities \n     of prosecutors and lawmakers and hope they can repair the \n     appeals process so that it takes not a moment longer than is \n     required by the Constitution. As ordinary citizens we are \n     unable to fully understand all of the legal implications that \n     are found within the Dole-Hatch-Specter habeas corpus \n     provision in Senate Bill 735. We believe that Oklahoma \n     Attorney General Drew Edmondson is acting in our behalf by \n     trying to change the laws so that criminals may be brought to \n     justice quickly. This measure must not be weakened.\n       President Clinton made a promise to the victims' families \n     during his visit at the Oklahoma City Memorial Service. \n     Please help him keep his promise to us and see that this bill \n     is passed.\n\n  [[Page S7483]] Again, we will put all these letters into the Record. \nI wish I had time to read them all.\n  By including this provision in the anti-terrorism legislation we are \nprotecting the families of the victims. Comprehensive habeas corpus \nreform is the only legislation Congress can pass as part of the \nterrorism bill that will have a direct effect on the Oklahoma City \nbombing case. It is the one thing Congress can pass now to ensure that \nPresident Clinton's promise of ``swift'' justice is kept.\n  President Clinton recognized this fact during his April 23, 1995, \nappearance on the television program 60 Minutes, when, in response to a \nquestion about whether those responsible would actually be executed \nwithout the adoption of habeas corpus reform, he said:\n\n       I do believe the habeas corpus provisions of the federal \n     law which permit these appeals sometimes to be delayed seven, \n     eight, nine years should be changed. I have advocated that. * \n     * * I hope the Congress will pass a * * * reform of the \n     habeas corpus provisions because it should not take eight or \n     nine years and three trips to the Supreme Court to finalize \n     whether a person in fact was properly convicted or not.\n\n  In one case in Utah, a heinous crime, where the murderers murdered \npeople but before they did, tortured them, rammed pencils through their \neardrums, poured Drano down their throats. One person survived who will \nnever be the same. They were sentenced to death. In one of those cases \nit took 18 years, 28 appeals, all the way up through the State courts, \nall the way up through the Federal courts, before the sentence could be \ncarried out. And in every one of those appeals the victims had to be \nthere and had to go through the complete process one more time. It is \ntime to get some reason into this system.\n  The claim that habeas corpus reform is tangential or unrelated to \nfighting terrorism is ludicrous. We can be confident that those \nresponsible for the bombing in Oklahoma will be brought to justice. The \nAmerican people do not want to witness the spectacle of these \nterrorists abusing our judicial system, and delaying the imposition of \na just sentence, by filing appeal after meritless appeal; frivolous \nappeal after frivolous appeal. A system which permits such a result \ndoes not provide justice to the victims of terrorism, and must be \nchanged.\n  Although most capital cases are State cases, and the State of \nOklahoma could still prosecute this case, the habeas reform proposal in \nthis bill would apply to federal death penalty cases as well. It would \ndirectly affect the Government's prosecution of the Oklahoma bombing \ncase.\n  First, it would place a one year limit for the filing of a habeas \npetition on all death row inmates--state and federal inmates.\n  Second, it would limit condemned killers convicted in state and \nFederal court to one habeas corpus petition. In contrast, under current \nlaw, there is currently no limit to the number of petitions he or she \nmay file.\n  Third, it requires the Federal courts, once a petition is filed, to \ncomplete judicial action within a specified time period.\n  Therefore, if the Federal Government prosecutes this case and the \ndeath penalty is sought and imposed, the execution of sentence could \ntake as little as one year if our proposal passes. This stands in stark \ncontrast to the 8 to 10 years of delay we are so used to under the \ncurrent system.\n  Last week, 13 state attorneys general, including\n   Oklahoma Democrat Drew Edmondson, sent a bipartisan letter to \nPresident Clinton that I read into the Record, supporting the \nincorporation of comprehensive habeas corpus reform in the anti-\nterrorism bill.\n\n  President Clinton vowed that justice in the wake of the Oklahoma \ntragedy would be ``swift, certain, and severe.'' We must help President \nClinton keep this promise to the families of those who were murdered in \nOklahoma City by passing comprehensive habeas corpus reform.\n  As I have stated, the Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995 \nprovides for numerous other needed improvements in the law to fight the \nscourge of terrorism, including the authorization of additional \nappropriations--nearly $1.6 billion--to law enforcement to beef up \ncounter-terrorism efforts and increasing the maximum rewards permitted \nfor information concerning international terrorism.\n  I would note that many of the provisions in this bill enjoy broad, \nbipartisan support and, in several cases, have passed the Senate on \nprevious occasions.\n  In that regard I would like to pay special tribute to our former \nchairman and the current ranking minority member on the committee, \nSenator Biden. He has done an excellent job in working on these \nbipartisan provisions. And I want to pay tribute to the White House, to \nthe Justice Department, and the General Counsel's office in the White \nHouse for working with us throughout this process. Working together, we \nhave come to a broad, bipartisan consensus.\n  Indeed, we have worked closely with the administration during the \ndevelopment of this legislation, and many of the provisions in this \nbill have the administration's strong support. And the administration \ndeserves a great deal of credit for having helped with that. In fact, \nwe have taken a lot of provisions right out of the administration's \nbill and have tried to help them in every way, tried to cooperate with \nthem in every way. And I believe we have done so and have strengthened \nthis bill in many respects.\n  I would like to compliment the President and his Administration, \nparticularly Attorney General Reno and FBI Director Freeh, and Deputy \nAttorney General Jamie Gorelick on their handling of the investigation \nof the Oklahoma City bombing and their work with us on this bill.\n  The people of the United States and around the world must know that \nterrorism is an issue that transcends politics and political parties. \nOur resolve in this matter must be clear: Our response to the terrorist \nthreat, and to acts of terrorism, will be certain, swift, and unified.\n  Mr. President, ours is a free society. Our liberties, the openness of \nour institutions, and our freedom of movement are what make America a \nNation we are willing to defend. These freedoms are cherished by \nvirtually every American.\n  But this freedom is not without its costs. Since our society is so \nopen, we are vulnerable to those who would take advantage of our \nliberty to inflict terror on us. The horrific events of last month in \nOklahoma City tragically demonstrate the price we pay for our liberty. \nIndeed, anyone who would do such an act, and call it a defense of \nliberty, mocks that word.\n  We must now redouble our efforts to combat terrorism and to protect \nour citizens. A worthy first step is the enactment of these sound \nprovisions to provide law enforcement with the tools to fight \nterrorism.\n  In closing, what is shocking to so many of us is the apparent fact \nthat those responsible for the Oklahoma atrocity are U.S. citizens. To \nthink that Americans could do this to one another. Yet, these killers \nare not true Americans--not in my book. Americans are the men, women \nand children who died under a sea of concrete and steel. Americans are \nthe rescue workers, the volunteers, the law enforcement officials and \ninvestigators who are cleaning up the chaos in Oklahoma City.\n  The genuine Americans are the overwhelming majority who will forever \nreel at the senselessness and the horror of April 19, 1995. It falls on \nall Americans in heart and spirit to condemn that sort of political \nextremism and to take responsible steps to limit the prospect for its \nrecurrence.\n  Can the Congress pass legislation which will guarantee an end to \ndomestic and international terrorism? We cannot. Nevertheless, the \nCongress has a responsibility to minimize the prospect that something \nlike this could ever happen again.\n  We must resolve that anarchistic radicalism, be it from the left or \nfrom the right, will not prevail in our freedom-loving democracy. The \nrule of law and popular government will prevail.\n  For these reasons I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues who are \nstill here and those who are still left standing after 20-some votes \ntoday, I will be mercifully short. I will take about 15 to 20 minutes \nto make this opening statement on the bill. [[Page S7484]] \n  Today, to state the obvious, the Senate turns to consideration of the \ncounterterrorism legislation. Earlier this year, I, along with Senator \nKohl and Senator Specter, introduced the President's original \ncounterterrorism bill which responded to our experience with the World \nTrade Tower Center bombings 2 years ago.\n  Since that time, our attention to the threat of terrorism has been \nheightened by the tragedy in Oklahoma City, which teaches that the \nthreat of homegrown terrorism must be taken every bit as seriously as \nthe threat of terrorism from abroad.\n  Before the two tragedies occurred--that is, Oklahoma City and the \nWorld Trade Tower--many in America had thought ourselves immune from \nthe bombs and other mass killing devices that were employed elsewhere, \nin other parts of the world.\n  Americans enjoy freedoms unlike those of any other people in any \nother country on the planet. For decades, we have enjoyed those \nfreedoms innocently and without fear here at home.\n  We have always understood that freedom brings certain risks. The \nchallenge before the Senate now, as we consider this legislation, is to \nimprove our responsiveness to the risk, to the threat of terrorism, \nwithout losing the very freedoms we hold dear, without allowing the \nterrorists to succeed by forcing us, in order to deal with them, to \ngive up the very freedoms they do not cherish but we do.\n  Responding to this risk means standing against those who seek to \ndestroy our democratic form of government, whether they come from the \nleft or the right, from home or abroad. Incidents like Oklahoma City's \nbombing have no place in our free and democratic society, which allows \nfull expression of all types of political views through legitimate \nmeans.\n  There is simply no excuse, ever, in this country for turning to \nviolence in a society where all the airwaves are open, uncensored \nnewspapers exist, regular and free elections of the people's \nrepresentatives take place, and we have a first amendment that \nguarantees the right of the people to be ignorant as well as informed; \nto be stupid as well as bright; to say outrageous things as well as \ninformed things. So there is no excuse to turn to anything but the \nairwaves to deal with that issue.\n  Mr. President, the Oklahoma City bombing and earlier bombing of the \nWorld Trade Center demonstrate clearly that the United States must \nrespond seriously to those, whether foreign or domestic, who kill and \nseek to make their point through killings and mass killings of \nAmericans.\n  These events demand that we examine our current laws and practices to \nensure that we are doing everything that is necessary and appropriate \nto guard against the threat.\n  Mr. President, let me suggest that the overall point I wish to make \nat this juncture is that it is arguable by some that in other societies \nwhere there is no expression or outlet for one's frustration, anger, or \ncynicism, that they resort to physical force. If there is any country \nin the world where there is no justification to resort to physical \nforce, it is this country. As I said, all you have to do is listen to \nsome of the talk radio shows and some of the people that call in, and \nsome of us on the floor--myself included--and you will know we even \nprotect the right to be stupid and say crazy things. So there is \ncertainly no need for anybody to suggest that they have to react to \ntheir frustration by the use of force.\n  But the events in New York City and, most recently, in Oklahoma City, \ndemand that we examine our current laws and practices to ensure that we \nare doing everything that is necessary to appropriately guard against \nthreat. We have to take strong action to counteract terrorism, both \nforeign and domestic.\n  There are steps we can take and should take, and the President has \nproposed a number of them in his bill. Of course, at the same time, we \nshould not, in the heat of the moment, pass legislation that we and the \nAmerican public will later regret. Our freedoms and our Constitution \nare simply too valuable to be put at risk in a hurried rush to respond \nto a terrible tragedy.\n  Those of us working on the President's proposal over the last month \nhave done so with an eye to ensuring that all of our constitutional \nprotections remain fully intact.\n  The President's original bill, introduced in February, laid out a \ncore set of terrorist proposals. The Republican substitute bill, as the \nchairman of the committee has indicated, is built largely around these \nproposals.\n  I might add, humorously, it continues to be built. We just got the \nfinal copy of a bill that is 160 pages long. So I am assuming what I am \nabout to say is accurate. It was accurate as of a few hours ago. But I \nam told there are additional changes made in the Republican bill. The \nRepublican bill is comprised primarily of, as I understood it 2 hours \nago, measures from the terrorism bill that Senator Kohl and Specter and \nmyself introduced on behalf of the President in February. There are a \nfew new proposals by the President, in the wake of the Oklahoma City \nbombing, and several proposals were added by Senator Dole, plus habeas \ncorpus provisions added by Senator Hatch and Senator Dole.\n  We tried to reach agreement with Senator Hatch on many of the \nprovisions of this bill, and I continue to believe that most all of us \nhere can agree on the core terrorism provisions.\n  Unfortunately, in my view, the Republican substitute does not include \nseveral provisions sought by the President of the United States after \nthe Oklahoma City bombing, which focused on domestic terrorism. While I \nagree that a few of the provisions in the President's bill need further \nwork, several of those rejected by the Republican bill are reasonable \nand limited expansions of the law, which would greatly enhance our \nability to fight terrorism without damaging our civil liberties. But \nfor reasons that will be explained, I am certain, they were not \nincluded by the Republicans in their bill.\n  I expect that these needed provisions, which I will outline in a \nmoment, will be offered as amendments to the Republican substitute, and \nI hope that all my colleagues will support their addition to the bill.\n  But, first, let me outline the key terrorism proposals from the \nPresident's bill that are contained in the Republican substitute. These \nprovisions include the following: A new offense to assure Federal \njurisdiction over all violent acts, violent acts which are motivated by \ninternational terrorism. This provision will cover gaps in current \nFederal law. For example, a terrorist who commits mass murder on a \nprivate or State-owned property may now be subject only to State court \njurisdiction, not to Federal jurisdiction, not to the FBI, but the \nlocal police.\n  This new provision that the President had in his proposal, and the \nRepublicans included, carries a new death penalty, complementing the \nterrorism death penalty in last year's crime bill. Parenthetically, I \nmight note that the person or persons who get convicted of the World \nTrade Center bombing for having killed people cannot get the death \npenalty under Federal law. But the person or persons convicted in the \nOklahoma City bombing will get the death penalty or can get the death \npenalty because of the crime bill we passed last year. Had we defeated \nthe crime bill, there would be no death penalty for whomever is \nconvicted in Oklahoma City.\n  The Republican bill will also implement an international treaty to \nrequire a detection agent to be added to plastic explosives. That was \nin the President's bill. It will enhance the Government's ability to \nobtain consumer credit report and hotel and motel vehicle records in \nforeign intelligence investigations. It does not change the law \ngoverning such information as it relates to domestic investigations.\n  It also gives the Government greater ability to exclude from entering \ninto the United States those aliens who are involved in terrorist \nactivity--a power the President does not now presently possess.\n  But, unfortunately, the Republicans dropped some very important \nprovisions from the President's terrorism legislation. Among those \nprovisions sought by the President that were dropped by the Republican \nsubstitute, and which will be subject to amendments to this bill, are \ntwo limited changes in wiretap authority. I believe that the two \nchanges make sense.\n   [[Page S7485]] As my friend from Utah and others would acknowledge, \nI suspect, I have not been one who has been very ready to limit civil \nliberties. I have jealously guarded the civil liberties of folks, and I \nhave interfered with efforts to change--such as the exclusionary rule--\nchange rules which may, in my view, limit the civil liberties and \nconstitutional rights of Americans.\n  But I believe, notwithstanding my 23-year record here in the Senate \non those issues, that we can change the wiretap law, giving the police \nmore authority, without violating the civil liberties of Americans. The \nchanges do not affect the basic requirement built into our present law \nto protect legitimate privacy interests or--put another way--the basic \nprotections, including a requirement that the Government must show \nthere is probable cause. And by must show I mean they have to go to a \njudge and say, ``We want to do this, and we have probable cause to \nbelieve that a crime is being committed, or a crime has been committed, \nand we want you to give us authority to do a wiretap.''\n  So the basic protections include a requirement that the Government \nmust show there is probable cause to believe that a criminal violation \noccurred, and a current requirement that the Government must minimize \nthe intrusion of the civil wiretap by turning the wire off whenever a \nconversation has nothing to do with the commission of a crime.\n  I want to make it clear. The extension of wiretap authority that I \nand Senator Lieberman are going to seek, that the President wants, \nstarts off with two basic requirements that are now in the Federal law: \nA, there has to be probable cause; and, B--most of my colleagues \nunderstandably do not realize this--under Federal law now, if a Federal \ncourt gives an FBI agent and the FBI authority, a warrant, to tap \nsomeone's phone, they must engage in minimization procedures.\n  So if they are to tap the phone because they think someone is engaged \nin racketeering, prostitution, or whatever--murder, anything--and the \nperson picks up that phone and calls his daughter at school and starts \ntalking about her latest lacrosse game, they must turn off the wiretap. \nThey are not allowed to keep the wiretap on 24 hours a day. We do not \nchange that. So the protections built in stay built in.\n  One of the changes, though, sought by the President but not included \nby my friend from Utah in his bill, is to allow emergency wiretaps \nwhich are now available in organized crime cases to be obtained for \ndomestic terrorism offenses. Quite simply, if we can use this tool of \nemergency wiretaps against the Mafia, I do not understand why we ought \nnot be able to use it against domestic terrorists. But for some reason, \nmy friends on the Republican side have not included that in this bill. \nI hope it is an oversight, but I do not think it is. We will have an \nattempt to correct that.\n  The Republican substitute also does not include a provision on what \nis called a multipoint, or roving, wiretap. Let me take a moment to \nexplain what these multipoint wiretaps are.\n  Right now, most wiretap orders identify both the person whom we want \nto listen in on, and a telephone number from which we expect that \nperson to call. That is the line that they are allowed to go tap. \nCurrent law permits the Government to get a multipoint wiretap, \nallowing the Government to tap any line it sees the subject using when \nthe Government can prove that the subject under surveillance is \nchanging phones with the intent to thwart surveillance.\n  So the way it goes now is, let us say the FBI gets a wiretap on John \nDoe's home, and John Doe decides that phone may be tapped. So he does \nnot use that phone. He always goes to the same phone booth on the \ncorner. And he often makes calls from his mother's home. Well, if they \ncan show a judge that John Doe is using those, and perhaps other phones \nwith the intent to evade possible detection of what he says on his \nphone, they can get a multipoint tap. They can tap all three of those \nphones. But in order to do so, they have to prove that he is doing that \nwith an intent to avoid, to thwart the surveillance.\n  Because of the proliferation of mobile telephones, the President \nwants to eliminate the intent requirement to allow the Government to \nobtain multipoint wiretaps where the subject may not know he is under \nsurveillance but is, nonetheless, changing phones rapidly with the \neffect, if not the intent, of thwarting the surveillance. For some \nreason, my Republican friends do not include that in this bill. The \nPresident wants it. The FBI wants it. I think it makes sense. We are \ngoing to try to put it back in.\n  I have long shared the concern that wiretaps are an intrusive law \nenforcement tool. When Congress first gave the FBI authority to use \nwiretaps in criminal investigations, we placed special protections \ndirectly in the statute precisely to protect legitimate privacy \ninterests. I will detail how these protections work in practice when we \nget to the amendment on this subject.\n  In my view, the changes sought by the President are limited and \nreasonable, and we should add those provisions back to the bill, the \nprovisions deleted by the Republican proposal.\n  A second area the President has asked the Congress to address is that \nof adding so-called taggants to explosives. What are taggants? Taggants \nare microscopic particles that are added to the explosive during the \nmanufacturing process. Those particles survive the explosion when that \nexplosive is detonated, and can later be used, if necessary, to trace \nwhere and when the explosive materials were purchased.\n  That just seems to me to be a pretty logical thing to do. It does not \naffect the ability of the explosive to function. But, if it does \nfunction, some of these are like little pieces of microscopic plastic. \nThe investigators can go in with, in effect, a magnet, pick up these \nparticles from the dust of the explosion, identify through those \nparticles where that explosive was purchased, when it was purchased, \nand when it was made. That gives them an investigative tool then to go \ntrace, just like they trace a bullet in a gun. They shoot a gun; the \nbullet is in the wall. The investigator takes the bullet out of the \nwall and tries to trace the manufacturer of the gun, to trace the \npurchaser, to trace the owner, and so forth. This is the same \nprinciple. But for some reason, folks do not like that idea. The \nPresident seeks a study to identify the most effective and cost-\nefficient ways to tag explosives during the manufacturing process.\n  Then it gives the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to \npromulgate regulations requiring chemical manufacturers and other \nmanufacturers to use taggants and to make the violation of that \nregulation, when they are promulgated, a violation of the law, a crime. \nThe President's proposal also requires a study of whether fertilizers \nand other readily available materials can be used to build bombs that \ncan be rendered inert.\n  I was at a conference with General Rose, a British general, who is in \ncharge of the U.N. military force in Sarajevo, in Bosnia. We were \nmeeting on the issue of Bosnia when the god-awful news came about \nOklahoma City.\n  We immediately cut off our meeting, and we repaired to the \ntelevision. As General Rose and I and others sat there watching the \nhorror on the screen, General Rose, a British general, turned to me and \nsaid something that startled me. Just looking at the building, he said, \n``That's a fertilizer bomb.'' And I said, ``I beg your pardon?'' He \nsaid, ``That bomb, that building was blown up by fertilizer.''\n  And I thought, how in the Lord's name could he know that? And about 3 \nhours later on the television, investigators came on and said that it \nwas a fertilizer bomb that caused this damage. So I asked him how did \nhe know that? He said he could tell by the jagged way in which the \nbuilding was ripped apart from his experience in Northern Ireland. And \nhe said, you know what we did in England with this because the IRA was \nusing these kinds of bombs? We reduced the amount of nitrogen in \nfertilizer and we added a requirement to fertilizer that an inert \nmaterial--that is, something that will not affect the effectiveness of \nthe fertilizer--an inert material can be added to fertilizer to make it \nimpossible, or diminish the possibility that it can be used to blow up \nsomething.\n  Now, it seems to me that makes sense. Unless someone can prove to me \nthat by adding this inert subject to the production of fertilizer, you \nare going to render the fertilizer useless for its \n[[Page S7486]] purpose on the field, it seems to me we should do that.\n  The Republican substitute includes a study of taggants and whether or \nnot fertilizer can be made inert, but it does not grant authority for \nregulations requiring taggants, and this is an issue that has already \nbeen the subject of significant study.\n  The Republicans rejected the President's request to move from the \ntheoretical to the real and authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to \nrequire the inclusion of taggants in explosives. My question is why? \nWhy? Why will they not include that?\n  Well, Senator Feinstein and I will have an amendment to reinstate the \nPresident's language in his terrorism bill. In my view, it is time to \nact and require the ATF, the agency with expertise and jurisdiction \nover explosives, to gather the best information and promulgate the \nnecessary regulations.\n  Finally, the Republican substitute does not include a proposal to \nallow the use of the military to assist in investigations of biological \nand chemical weapons. The President proposed a narrow exception to what \nis called the Posse Comitatus Act, a narrow exemption to permit law \nenforcement to use the unique expertise of the Defense Department in \ncombating biological and chemical weapons in terrorism similar to what \nthe law now permits with regard to nuclear material.\n  Right now, we can use the military in a domestic situation where \nnuclear material is involved, an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act. \nThe Posse Comitatus Act, for people listening, is a fancy name, but it \nmerely says we do not want the military having arrest power in the \nUnited States of America. The military is to fight enemies foreign, not \ndomestic. And that is a good thing. We all agree with that. We are one \nof the countries in the world that does not have the military dictating \nthe day-to-day operations of the country. I do not want to change that. \nBut the military has the expertise on nuclear weapons, the military has \nthe expertise on biological weapons and the expertise on chemical \nweapons, and it seems to me we should provide a similar exception for \nthem to be able to be involved in domestic investigation where it \naffects biological agents and where it affects chemical agents, just as \nwe do now allow them to be involved where it involves nuclear material.\n  Negotiations among interested parties on the Armed Services and the \nJudiciary Committees have occurred over the last few days, and we are \nnearing a bipartisan agreement on this, I hope. If, however, an \nagreement is not reached, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nNunn, and I plan to offer a proposal to permit the use of the military \nin these limited circumstances of biological weapons and chemical \nweapons. We must be in a position to respond immediately should we \never, God forbid, have an event like that which occurred in the Tokyo \nsubway. And to be ready to respond, we should avoid wasted duplication \nof setting up a new bureaucracy to be able to handle chemical and \nbiological weapons, and we certainly should avoid any more delay. So we \nwill have an amendment, if an agreement is not reached, to provide an \nadditional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act as it relates to \nchemical agents and biological agents.\n  Now, habeas corpus. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I have \nbeen debating habeas corpus for as long as we have been here, and in \nhis opening statement--I may be mistaken, but I would estimate 40 \npercent of his statement related to habeas corpus, or a large portion \nthat I heard. And so he includes habeas corpus in this proposal.\n  Now, the President asked that this be kept, to use the parlance of \nthe Senate, a clean bill; that we deal with terrorism.\n  Well, that is not going to happen. And although habeas corpus as \nexplained by Senator Hatch has little to do with fighting terrorism, we \nare going to have to debate it anyway.\n  Now, the Republican provision to reform habeas corpus procedures \nwould require Federal courts to defer to State court decisions even \nwhen the State court has made an incorrect decision on habeas corpus. \nThis provision is what everyone around here knows as the full and fair \nrule. The need for habeas corpus reform is clear. All of us want to end \nthe delay and abuse in habeas corpus and all of us have supported \nprovisions in the past that would limit a prisoner's right to appeal, \nwould allow a very narrow window in which a habeas corpus petition \ncould be filed, and would place strict limits on when that petition had \nto be filed.\n  However, the Republican proposal goes much further. The standard \nproposed in the Republican substitute would direct a Federal court to \ndefer to a State court decision as long as it is not unreasonable. In \nother words, if reasonable minds could disagree, the State court \ndecision would stand in Federal court even if it is incorrect.\n  Now, this is a dressed up version of what is known around here as the \nfull and fair rule. Reasonableness is a highly deferential standard, \none never before used in habeas corpus. And current law permits Federal \ncourts to make a merit-based decision and to correct harmful State \ncourt errors.\n  I believe we must reform habeas corpus, and I believe we can reform \nhabeas corpus to adopt limits on the number of petitions and the time \nlimits on the petitions such as those contained in the Republican \nsubstitute, but without stopping Federal courts from correcting serious \nState court errors in interpreting the United States Constitution.\n  In addition, the Republican substitute changes current law which \nmandates appointment of a lawyer in Federal habeas corpus cases to make \nsuch appointments discretionary, not mandatory. I support limiting a \nprisoner's right to petition. I support limiting prisoners to one \nhabeas corpus petition and giving them a very short period within which \nit must be filed, but I cannot fathom why we would deny that same \npetitioner a lawyer at the same time. Such a step serves neither \nefficiency nor justice.\n  Now, I noted that the habeas corpus provision in the Republican bill \nis not directly related to terrorism in that it applies primarily to \nprisoners who are prosecuted in State courts.\n  It is particularly inappropriate, in my view, to work such a \ndevastating change in the law on a bill which is designed for a very \nnarrow purpose, for which the Senate is working to move quickly.\n  Now, when we get to the debate on habeas corpus, we will have what \nhas become known around here as ``dueling charts.'' I will show that \nthe Biden habeas corpus provision would not allow those outrageous \nexamples that the Senator uses where a petitioner sat on death row 2, \n5, 10, 12, 18 years after having committed a heinous crime and avoiding \nthe death penalty for that period as a consequence of filing petitions. \nWe want to allow only one bite out of the apple.\n  But I want to make a point. My friend from Utah made an impassioned \nstatement tonight about how it would be horrible if we find and convict \nthe murderer, the man or woman, or men or women, who murdered those \npeople in Oklahoma and that person was able to avoid execution by \nfiling repetitive petitions.\n  Well, his proposal has nothing to do with that. So I will have an \namendment that says: Limit their habeas corpus changes to Federal court \nmatters.\n  For example, all the horror stories the Senator pointed out tonight, \nnone of them have to do with somebody who has been tried in Federal \ncourt. If you have been tried in a Federal court--which this bill says, \nby the way, the terrorism bill says, the only purpose of it is to say \nyou do these bad things, you go to a Federal court, you go to a Federal \njudge, you have the Federal FBI investigate you, you go to a Federal \nprison, you have a Federal executioner. That is the only reason for the \nbill. That is why we are doing it.\n  So if the Senator is as concerned as he appears to be about these \nexorbitant delays, let us apply it to Federal court.\n  Now, the reason I am going to offer that amendment is not that I \nthink his idea as to how he wants to limit it in Federal court makes \nmuch sense, but just to prove that this is a sham. This has nothing to \ndo with it.\n  I will have a chart tomorrow, or whenever we get to this, showing all \nthe prisoners in Federal court sitting on death row who are filing \nFederal habeas petitions. What he is talking about is a need to remedy \nthe State court problem. And I am willing to do that; I have been \ntrying to do it for 10 years, but not on this bill. [[Page S7487]] \n  Why are we getting into this debate on this bill? But I will leave \nthat for another moment, another day, another hour to debate it, \nbecause we have debated it before.\n  Finally, the Republican substitute contains two very controversial \nprovisions from the administration's proposal that I believe are \ntroubling. The first is that it includes a provision that I must \nacknowledge the President's included, a provision to create new \ndeportation procedures for aliens in the United States who are alleged \nto be terrorists.\n  In the administration's bill, the Government could, in some \ncircumstances, use secret information, not disclosed to the defendant, \nnot disclosed to the defendant's lawyers, in order to make a case.\n  We have never had such a procedure in history, to the best of my \nknowledge, in America, where someone can bring a charge against an \nindividual, go into a Federal court, have the prosecutor meet alone \nwith the judge and say:\n  ``Judge, these are all the horrible things that the defendant did. \nWe're not going to tell the defendant what evidence there is that he \ndid these horrible things. We're not going to let the defendant know \nwhat that evidence is. We're not going to let the defendant's lawyer \nknow what it is. We're not going to let the defendant's lawyer answer \nthese questions. You and me judge''--me, the prosecutor; you, the \njudge--``let's deport him in a secret hearing, using secret evidence. \nLet's walk out of this courtroom, out of your chambers, walk out and \nsay, `OK, Smedlap, you're deported. We find you're a terrorist. You're \nout of here.'\"\n  And Smedlap looks and says, ``Hey, tell me who said I was a \nterrorist. How do you know that?'' We say, ``Oh, no, we can't tell you. \nWe know you did it, and we can't tell you how we know.''\n  Now I think that is about as un-American as it gets.\n  Now what we will hear is--and I think the President is dead wrong on \nthis--but what we will hear is, ``Well, look, these folks are not \nAmerican citizens. They are not entitled to the same privileges as \nAmerican citizens in a courtroom.''\n  Well, that is technically true. But, my lord, I do not want to be \npart of anything that establishes that kind of Star Chamber proceeding. \nTechnically, they may be right; philosophically, it is dead wrong.\n  But it is interesting, my Republican friends do not include taggants. \nThey do not include additional wiretaps. But they include this. I mean, \nwho, as my little daughter used to say, ``Go fish.'' How can you figure \nthat one out? I cannot, anyway.\n  Our judicial system generally requires that a defendant be given \nevidence that is to be used against him so that he can prepare a \ndefense. Unseen, unheard evidence simply cannot be defended against and \nit creates the possibility of erroneous decisions.\n  The Republican substitute, unlike the prior version of the Republican \nbill, moves back toward allowing what the President wrongheadedly put \nin his bill, in my view.\n  The bill also includes a radically revised version of an \nadministration proposal to bar fundraising within the United States for \norganizations which the Secretary of State designates as terrorists. \nThe President's proposal guarded against first amendment concerns by \nallowing persons to send funds to designated organizations if it could \nbe shown that the funds were going to a legitimate purpose, for \nhumanitarian effort or for political advocacy only.\n  For example, the substitute bill revises this proposal. First, it \nchanges the Presidential determination to one made by the Secretary of \nState and then subjects the determination to searching judicial review. \nWhile this addresses some of the first amendment concerns in the \nadministration's proposal, it is also problematic because Presidential \ndesignations of this sort are not usually litigated in Federal court.\n  Second, the substitute eliminates any opportunity for persons to make \ndonations for proper purposes, in my view increasing the first \namendment concerns on that aspect of the bill.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me say that I would have preferred \nto have come to this floor on a bill that was wholly bipartisan without \ncontroversial and irrelevant provisions, but the majority has not \nchosen to proceed that way. I would also, frankly, have preferred to \nhave seen the bill we are considering in advance of the day we are \nconsidering the bill on the floor. But, in fairness to my Republican \nfriends, they have been working hard to put it together to try to meet \nthe deadline to get it in before the recess. But, nonetheless, it puts \nus in a difficult position.\n  Having received a final version of the bill at only about 6:30 \ntonight, I have not been able to review it carefully to see whether any \nof my concerns have already been addressed in the bill--maybe some of \nthe things I have said now have been addressed by this new version--or \nwhether or not additional concerns have been raised by the new bill.\n  It is my hope and belief that, with certain changes, the substitute \noffered today by my Republican friends can become a true pro-law-\nenforcement, pro-civil-liberties, counter-terrorism, bipartisan bill.\n It is my hope and belief that all Senators will listen to the director \nof the FBI, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, and the President, and not to groups who believe \nviolence, not voting, is the means to change the system--not that \nanyone is listening to anyone who is advocating violence, but those who \ndo not think we should expand the ability of law enforcement to look \nmore closely at those groups who believe violence and not voting is the \nmeans to change the system.\n\n  All Federal law enforcement is part of a team of brave men and women \nwho protect the lives of all Americans from terrorist attacks. Let us \nstand with law enforcement as we consider this bill, and give them the \ntools that they badly need. Even as we protect our constitutional \nfreedoms, we can make this legislation a truly effective tool in \nfighting terrorism, the threat that comes from distant shores as well \nas those that come from the American heartland. We have a duty to \nprotect law-abiding Americans and that is what this bill must do.\n  In conclusion, I believe we can enter into a time agreement on most \nof the amendments that we will have and hopefully we can move quickly, \nafter the recess, to finish and to complete this bill. Because, as I \nunderstand the majority leader, he is looking for a couple of \namendments to be brought up tomorrow--whether that means one, two or \nfive, I do not know--but several amendments tomorrow, which we are \nready to do. We will give time agreements on those amendments and then \nwe will move back to the bill when we come back.\n  Again, I thank my Republican colleague, the chairman of the \ncommittee, for the areas in which we have cooperated. I look forward to \nvigorous and substantive debate on those areas where we do not agree. \nBut ultimately we will produce a bill.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the ranking member on \nthe committee. I have enjoyed his remarks this evening. Literally some \nof his concerns we have addressed in the bill, in the substitute that \nhas been filed. We cannot address all of his concerns in the way he \nwould like them to be addressed because of differences. But some have \nbeen, and I think he will be pleased with those.\n  We will continue to work with him to try to perfect this bill in the \ninterests of everybody, including the administration.\n  As I understand it, Senator Thurmond would like to make a short \nstatement, and also Senator DeWine. I do not know if there is anybody \nelse who does, but as soon as the last few statements are made, we will \nshut the Senate down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nsubstitute amendment to S. 735, offered by the able chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee of the Senate, Senator Hatch, and others who joined \non this matter. As an original cosponsor of this legislation and the \nsubstitute amendment, I believe it builds upon a solid foundation to \nassist law enforcement in their fight against \nterrorism. [[Page S7488]] \n  We must send a clear message that the people of America will not \ntolerate cowardly acts of terrorism, in any fashion--whether their \nsource is international or domestic. It is important that the Congress \nwork closely with Federal law enforcement to provide the necessary \ntools and authority to prevent terrorism. I am ever mindful that an \nappropriate balance between individual rights guaranteed in the \nConstitution and the needs of law enforcement must be achieved as we \nmeet our responsibility. The American people appropriately look to \ntheir Government to maintain a peaceable society but do not want law \nenforcement to stray into the private lives of law-abiding citizens. \nThe balance is to provide reasonable authority to law enforcement to \ninvestigate and prevent terrorism while respecting the rights of the \nAmerican people to form groups, gather, and engage in dialog even when \nthat dialog involves harsh antigovernment rhetoric. The recent bombing \nin Oklahoma City compels us to address this issue.\n  Mr. President, it is my belief that this legislation will enhance law \nenforcement capabilities to combat terrorism while respecting our \ncherished rights under the Constitution. This bill contains provisions \nto increase penalties for conspiracies involving explosives and the \nunauthorized use of explosives. Additionally, our legislation will \nassist law enforcement in fighting international terrorism, including \nlanguage to prohibit U.S. aid to countries that provide military \nequipment to terrorist nations. The United States must send a strong \nsignal to our allies and adversaries that America's policy is one of \nzero tolerance for aiding terrorists.\n  Also, I am pleased that this legislation contains the much needed \nlanguage on alien terrorist removal. These provisions create a new \n``terrorism court'' made up of sitting district court judges appointed \nby the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. This specialty court would \nhave the authority to hear deportation cases involving alien terrorists \nand would ensure, through the use of a limited ex parte procedure, that \nthe United States can expeditiously deport alien terrorists without \ndisclosing national security secrets to them and their criminal \nassociates.\n  There are other provisions to provide anti-terrorism assistance to \nFederal law enforcement agencies. Further, one of the most important \nsections of this legislation, which I will now address, is designed to \ncurb the abuse of habeas corpus appeals.\n  Mr. President, for years, as both chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I have called for reform of habeas corpus \nappeals. The habeas appellate process has become little more than a \nstalling tactic used by death row inmates to avoid punishment for their \ncrimes. I have authored and joined as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation designed to curb the abuse of habeas corpus and to limit \nthe intrusion of Federal courts in State\n court convictions.\n\n  Unfortunately, the present system of habeas corpus review has become \na game of endless litigation where the question is no longer whether \nthe defendant is innocent or guilty of murder, but whether a prisoner \ncan persuade a Federal court to find some kind of technical error to \nunduly delay justice. As it stands, the habeas process provides the \ndeath row inmate with almost inexhaustible opportunities to avoid \njustice. This is simply wrong.\n  In my home State of South Carolina, there are over 60 prisoners on \ndeath row. I am informed that one has been on death row for 18 years. \nTwo others were sentenced to death in 1980 for a murder they committed \nin 1977. These two men, half brothers went into a service station in \nRed Bank, S.C. and murdered Ralph Studemeyer as his son helplessly \nwatched. One man stabbed Mr. Studemeyer and the other shot him. It was \na brutal murder and although convicted and sentenced to death, these \ntwo murderers have been on death row for 15 years and continue to sit \nawaiting execution.\n  Mr. President, without adequate habeas reform , the murdering coward \nwho exploded the bomb in Oklahoma City could avoid justice for many \nyears as many are now doing who have been sentenced to death. President \nClinton has called for habeas reform, and I urge my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to join us to ensure that justice becomes a \ncertainty and not a mere probability.\n  The habeas reform provisions in this legislation will significantly \nreduce the delays in carrying out executions without unduly limiting \nthe right of access to the Federal courts. This language will \neffectively reduce the filing of repetitive habeas corpus petitions \nwhich delays justice and undermines the deterrent value of the death \npenalty. Under our proposal, if adopted, death sentences will be \ncarried out in most cases within 2 years of final State court action. \nThis is in stark contrast to death sentences carried out in 1993 which, \non average, were carried out over 9 years after the most recent \nsentencing date.\n  Mr. President, the current habeas system has robbed the State \ncriminal justice system of any sense of finality and prolongs the pain \nand agony faced by the families of murder victims. Or habeas reform \nproposal is badly needed to restore public confidence and ensure \naccountability to America's criminal justice system.\n  Mr. President, while there is nothing we can do to alter the tragic \nbombing in Oklahoma City, the Congress should now adopt legislation to \nbolster our efforts to prevent heinous and cowardly acts of terrorism. \nThe preamble to the U.S. Constitution clearly spells out the highest \nideals of our system of government--one of which is to ensure domestic \ntranquility. The American people have a right to be safe in their homes \nand communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to provide valuable \nassistance to our Nation's law enforcement in their dedicated efforts \nto uphold law and order. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening in very strong support \nof the bill that we are considering tonight, the Comprehensive \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 1995.\n  This is a bill that truly will help the United States fight \nterrorism, while at the same time preserving basic constitutional \nrights and civil liberties.\n  Let me begin tonight by congratulating Senator Dole, the majority \nleader, Senator Hatch, Senator Thurmond, who have worked so very, very \nhard on this bill. They have crafted a bill that will truly make a \ndifference. They have crafted a bill that will help the United States \nas a country fight back, against terrorism.\n  This bill being brought to the floor tonight is in immediate response \nto the horror of Oklahoma City. But it is also this response to the \nrealization that we all have, about what a very, very dangerous world \nwe live in today. Some thought that with the ending of the cold war we \nwould be living in a safer world. But we all know today that is simply \nnot true. Whether the terrorism comes from our own shores or is \ninternational terrorism, it is still horrible and we still must fight \nback.\n  I would like to talk briefly tonight about one particular aspect of \nthis bill. That has to do with the provisions in this bill that give \nlocal law enforcement the resources and the tools that they need to \nfight back. I am specifically talking about the provisions in the bill \nthat give local law enforcement the resources to provide for 21st \ncentury technology.\n  I have talked, Mr. President, on this floor during the last several \nweeks on 6 or 7 different occasions about how very, very important it \nis, that local law enforcement throughout the country, where 95 percent \nof all criminal prosecution occurs, where 95 percent of all arrests \noccur, where 95 percent of all investigations occur, that the resources \nbe driven down to those local communities and those local law \nenforcement officers so that they have the technology, the DNA, the \nautomated fingerprints, the ballistics, the criminal record, so that \nthey have those tools so they can fight back.\n  This bill takes a major provision of my crime bill--the crime bill, \nby the way, that is cosponsored by Senator Hatch as well as Senator \nThurmond, Senator Ashcroft--this bill takes a major provision of that \nbill and inserts it in this bill and provides $500 million that will go \ndirectly to local law enforcement to help them develop the data bases \nthat they need, and that the FBI knows they need.\n  This will, Mr. President, make a difference. It will help the \ngovernment solve crime. It will help to save lives. [[Page S7489]] It \nwill make a difference in fighting terrorism, and it will make a \ndifference in fighting all kinds of crime.\n  Last year's crime bill, Mr. President, had a major provision that \nprovided that very significant amount of money to the FBI to develop \nthe national central data base--DNA, fingerprints, identification of \nindividuals, ballistics.\n  When I traveled Ohio the last few months and talked to local law \nenforcement officers, one of things that they told me was that is all \nwell and good, but if we cannot access that information, if we cannot \nget it, if we do not have the tools to bring it to law enforcement, it \nwill not do any good.\n  Several months ago, I visited the FBI and spent a day with them and \nspent a day with their experts in all of these different high technical \nfields. That, I found, is what local law enforcement had told me the \nFBI confirmed. That is, their fear is that local law enforcement will \nnot have the resources so that we all can develop this national data \nbase.\n  This is a unique role for the Federal Government. When we talk, Mr. \nPresident, about anticrime bills, antiterrorism bills, we \nalways should first focus on what can only the Federal Government do.\n  I submit, Mr. President, that the evidence is abundantly clear that \nit is only the Federal Government that can establish this national base \nthroughout the country. Now, why is that? Let us pretend that we are \nthe sheriffs in Lawrence county, Ohio, or the chief of police in \nIronton.\n  Our ability to use these tools, to use these data bases, depends on \nthree things.\n  Number one, we have to have the ability or the resources there, and \nwe have to put the information in. We have to do a good job.\n  Number two, the FBI, of course, has to build up a national base, so \nwe can access from a national point of view.\n  But the third thing that we sometimes miss is that my ability --if I \nam the chief of police or a police officer in Ironton--to get \ninformation is dependent not only on the local community, local police, \nlocal sheriff and local FBI, but also on tens of thousands of \njurisdictions across the country, because we live in a very, very \nmobile society. People move around; criminals move around.\n  So what the Federal Government does and what we are doing in this \nbill--and again, I congratulate my colleague from Utah and Senator Dole \nthe majority leader, for having the wisdom to listen to local law \nenforcement, to listen to the FBI when they say this is what we need, \nand to set aside a provision of this bill and to take that $500 million \nand say it will go down to local law enforcement so that we can, as a \ncountry, develop this national data base. It will, in fact, Mr. \nPresident, make a very substantial difference.\n  What are we talking about? What practical applicability does all of \nthis have? You know, I have said many times, Mr. President, that we \ndebate in this Congress--in the Senate and in the House --on the \nnational news media a lot of things regarding crime that really do not \nmake a lot of difference. But giving local police officers the tools \nthat they need makes a difference. It matters. It is important. This is \nwhat the provisions of this bill truly do.\n  What is the practical application? We have seen it on TV a lot in the \nlast few in regard to DNA. One of the things that is sometimes missed \nis the fact that DNA can be used, and is used, every single day in this \ncountry to help clear from investigations innocent people, so that \nsomeone does not stay the focus of a criminal investigation. DNA can be \nused for that.\n  But the situation we have in this country today is that law \nenforcement officers throughout the country do not, as a rule, really \nhave access to good DNA technology. The laboratories are not there. If \nthe laboratories are there and they have access, there is waiting time. \nThey have to pick only their top cases, only the highest priority \ncases.\n  This bill will help solve that problem by establishing the resources \nso we can have DNA laboratories and experts who can come into court and \ntestify, no matter where that crime is committed.\n  How else does it help? Think how important it is if you are a police \nofficer or a sheriff's deputy, and at 3 o'clock in the morning you are \nfollowing a car and, for some reason, you make the determination you \nneed to pull that car over, and you need to pull that car over on a \ndark road, away from civilization, away from people, and you do that. \nIs it not important that you know that when you run that license plate, \nthat the information you get back on the ownership of that car is \naccurate? Is that not important? Is it not important, or would it not \nbe important if you are a police officer and you had just arrested \nsomeone and you wanted to determine really who that person was, and you \ndid not believe them when they told you who they were, if you could \ntake that person back to your police cruiser and take his or her hand \nand put it up against a screen and have those prints electronically \ntransmitted to a central data base, and within a matter of seconds know \nwho that person really is? We have that technology today. It is not \nwidespread because of the cost. But we have the ability to do that.\n  Would it not be important for our children, for possible victims of \nsexual abuse, to be able to start as a country what some States are \njust now beginning to do--that is, to develop a national data base, DNA \ndata base of sex offenders? The sad truth is, Mr. President, that sex \noffenders have just about the highest repeat offender rate of any group \nof criminals. I think check forgers and those who pass bad checks \nprobably have about the same number of recidivism. But it is a little \ndifferent when we are dealing with a sex offender.\n  I think it is important that every sex offender who goes into prison \ngets their blood taken. It is constitutional. We can do it. We just \nhave not put the resources behind it. We can take their blood and \ndevelop a national DNA data base of sex offenders. So when that person \ncomes out--as most of them do--and if that person commits another \noffense--as many do, tragically--then we have that data base, and we \nhave the ability to take any bodily fluid from the crime scene, \nanything, and match that up and make that DNA comparison. We will solve \ncrimes, save lives, and we will convict sex offenders.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on with example after example. This \nmoney is important. We talk a lot about what matters in crime and what \ndoes not matter. The money provided in this bill, the provision that \nSenator Hatch and Senator Dole have put in, when they have listened to \nlocal law enforcement and to the FBI--these provisions are an integral \npart of this bill, a very important part of the bill. I congratulate \nthem and thank them for putting it in the bill because it will truly \nmake a difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nOhio for an excellent statement and also the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina. As usual, Senator Thurmond really covers these matters \nas well as they can be covered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7479-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

KING\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, throughout my career in public service, I \nhave had [[Page S7490]] the good fortune of having a number of bright, \nloyal, and hard working individuals on my staff. One such individual is \nJames O. King, now serving as Minority Staff Director of the Senate \nRules Committee, who is retiring on June 5.\n  Jim has been a very good friend to me for many years. He worked with \nme back when I served as Governor of Kentucky, came with me to \nWashington as one of my Administrative Assistants, and was Staff \nDirector of the Rules Committee for 7 years.\n  He has served the Commonwealth in a number of roles in public \nadministration, including working under no less than five Kentucky \ngovernors. In addition, he served in a number of capacities in higher \neducation in the Commonwealth, including Vice President for \nAdministration and also Administrative Assistant to the President of \nthe University of Kentucky.\n  It seemed that no matter what job title he held, Jim was always \nworking in public service, always trying to give something back.\n  We here in the Senate have been recipients of some of the fruits of \nhis labor. Jim was a key person in 1988 to help the Committee review \nSenate rules and procedures. Under his direction, the Rules Committee \nhas addressed a number of major pieces of legislation including the \nmotor-voter bill and campaign finance reform. And all the while, he was \nstill keeping a eye on the ``nuts and bolts'' of the Senate operation.\n  Anyone who's ever come in contact with Jim knows that he loves \nKentucky, its people and its way of life. And, from what I understand \nfrom reliable sources, he's already getting in the swing of retirement \nby posting some of the best golf scores he's had in recent years!\n  We're going to miss Jim on the Rules Committee. And I know I'm \nspeaking for my staff, the Rules Committee staff, and the Senate as a \nwhole, in thanking him for his good work and wishing him all the best \nfor his retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7489-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

JEFFERSON WAS RIGHT: GOP BUDGET PROVES IT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of phony and \nhighly partisan criticism of the Republican budget proposal--criticism \nwhich the liberal news media have hastened to circulate. However, polls \nshow that the majority of American people are not misled, except those \nwho insist that they are entitled to something for nothing.\n  To their credit, Republicans in Congress have delivered on their \ncommitment to come forth with a budget to--First, balance the Federal \nbudget in 7 years; second, cut Federal spending by $961 billion; third, \neliminate 140 Federal departments agencies and programs; fourth, freeze \nsalaries of Member's of Congress; and fifth, cut the Senate staff \nbudget by 15 percent.\n  Mr. President, the American people obviously realize the dire \nfinancial straits into which our Nation has plunged as a result of \ndecades of irresponsibility by those in charge of their Federal \nGovernment. But children understand the penalty for spending more money \nthan they have in their piggy banks.\n  I have an example to share, a poignant letter from the sixth grade \nclass of Swain County West Elementary School in Bryson City, NC:\n  Dear Senator Helms: Our teacher shared with us your letter which \nmentioned the Federal debt as of March 14, 1995, which was \n$4,846,819,443,348.28.\n  We are amazed to see how large the Federal debt is and understand \nthat anything that is ``free'', the working people pay for. We don't \nhave much, but our class sends this collection to you and ask that you \nput it in the fund to reduce the Federal debt. Our generation is going \nto have to reduce this debt and we would like to begin our part now. We \nreally want to help our country and as sixth graders we understand that \nyou can't leave it up to somebody else to take care of what we must \nbegin now.''\n  Mr. President, enclosed with this letter came a check for $44.75, \nemphasizing the obvious if these sixth graders in North Carolina can \nrecognize the importance of balancing the federal budget, why can't \nCongress?\n  Needless to say, I greatly admire these young people and their \nteachers. Implicit in their letter is an obvious question: If \npoliticians cannot live up to promises to balance the budget, the \npoliticians perhaps should be called home to smell the coffee, if I may \nbe permitted to mix a couple of metaphors.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to remain silent amidst false charges \nby the President and various Senators of his party that the Republican \nbudget will cripple Medicare, the health care system upon which so many \nof our elderly have been encouraged to depend. Contrary to the false \nprophets, the Republican budget allows Medicare spending to increase \neach year by 7.1 percent.\n  Mr. President, the American people should always have realized that \nthere is no such thing as a free lunch. Thomas Jefferson said it best:\n\n       To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers \n     load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election \n     between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.\n\n  Mr. Jefferson also warned:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequences as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, that just about says it all, especially when one \nconsiders the moral injustice we are heaping upon our children and \ntheir children. This year Republicans made a promise to balance the \nbudget. We should keep that promise. Balancing the Federal budget is \nsimply a matter of doing what we were sent to Washington to do.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7490-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7490-S7491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ERNEST K.

Mr. President, dangerous nuclear leftovers from the \ncold war and the commercial spent fuel storage problem present the U.S. \nwith two major environmental challenges. An explosion at the liquid \nhigh-level waste storage tanks at Hanford could result in a \ncatastrophic nuclear accident, and electric utilities are running out \nof space for storage at commercial nuclear reactors. Although these are \nseparate problems, the solutions are related. Unfortunately, President \nClinton is AWOL (absent without leadership), and the DOE is playing \nlegal games instead of taking responsibility for taking the commercial \nspent fuel by 1998. It's time for a comprehensive solution.\n  First, let's review the facts:\n  Thirty thousand tons of spent nuclear fuel is being temporarily \nstored at powerplants at 75 sites.\n  In less than 3 years, 23 reactors will run out of space in their \nspent fuel storage pools.\n  By 2010, a total of 78 reactors will have run out of space.\n  We've already spent 12 years and $4.2 billion to find permanent high-\nlevel repository and conduct site characterization at Yucca Mountain.\n  DOE will decide if Yucca Mountain is a suitable site for a permanent \nrepository in 1998. If it is, DOE will file for license in 2001. DOE \nhas told us that the odds of the site being suitable are about 80 \npercent. However, DOE has also indicated that the odds of getting a \nlicense for a permanent repository under our existing laws are about \n50-50, and probably much worse. These odds are not good enough to bet \nthe taxpayer's money on.\n  Still, the fact remains that, if after 3 to 6 years more work at \nYucca Mountain, and a total expenditure of at least $9 billion on our \nnuclear waste disposal program, Yucca is either found not to be \nsuitable or licensable, we have nowhere to turn. We currently have no \ncontingency plan for waste storage. We will simply have to start over.\n  Meanwhile, the President and DOE are dragging their feet. DOE has \nrecently issued a ``Final Interpretation of Nuclear Waste Acceptance \nIssues,'' reaffirming its earlier position that its contracts with the \nutilities to take waste by 1998 are not enforceable in court. DOE has \nalso asserted that it has no authority under existing law to site an \ninterim repository. DOE has missed the point. While DOE is focusing on \nlegal technicalities to avoid its obligations to the American people, \nwe have had no suggestions from DOE regarding solutions to this \nproblem.\n  Although we have been told that DOE is studying the issue, all we \nhave heard from the administration is a refusal to support any pending \nlegislation at this time. I have received no response to my letter to \nthe President requesting that the administration engage on this issue \nin a meaningful way.\n  Finally, the State of Nevada and the Nevada congressional delegation \nremain opposed to the location of any nuclear waste facilities in their \nState.\n  It is time to take a comprehensive look at the problem based on two \nbasic principles: First, the Government must meet its obligation to \ntake spent fuel by 1998 or as soon thereafter as practical. The \nratepayers have paid for it. They deserve performance, not excuses. \nEven if it is found to be suitable, Yucca Mountain will not be ready \nbefore 2010. Therefore, interim storage of spent fuel is needed. \nAlthough there is nothing unsafe about the storage of spent fuel at \nreactor sites, for reasons of both economics and safety, we must \nconsolidate our 74 spent fuel storage sites into 1 or 2.\n  Second, the U.S. must continue efforts toward a permanent geological \nrepository. While we can keep alternatives such as deep seabed disposal \nand transmutation alive (if Yucca is found unsuitable), our long-term \ngoal remains geologic disposal.\n  This raises a more difficult question: Where do we locate central \ninterim storage? I would suggest the best location for an interim \nstorage facility would meet the following criteria:\n  Spent fuel should already be there.\n  There should be adequate land area.\n  The Federal Government should already own the land.\n  There should be transportation infrastructure.\n  There should be a security infrastructure.\n  A skilled work force familiar with handling nuclear materials should \nbe available.\n  A nuclear safety/worker protection infrastructure should be in place.\n  The location(s) should be in general proximity to the Nation's \nreactors, i.e., one for the East and one for the West.\n  The new economic activity associated with spent fuel management may \naddress concurrent job losses.\n  After all of these considerations are evaluated, the relative costs \nof the alternatives should be taken into account.\n  Locations that meet the above criteria include some of our existing \nDOE weapons facilities. Geographically, the most likely candidates are \nHanford and Savannah River. There are other important factors about \nHanford, and Savannah River--each contain nuclear materials \ndramatically more dangerous than spent commercial fuel safety contained \nin dry casks. For example, Hanford has 61 million gallons of liquid \nhigh level wastes in 177 underground tanks--some of which have leaked \nor are leaking. Under certain conditions, one or more of these tanks \ncould explode, resulting in a catastrophic nuclear accident. Also at \nHanford are 4,300 metric tons of plutonium in various forms and \nlocations, contaminated reprocessing facilities, corroding and possibly \ndangerous DOE nuclear fuels, and a contaminated plutonium finishing \nplant just to name a few. Savannah River has five closed reactors, two \ncontaminated reprocessing facilities, and a variety of liquid and solid \nradioactive wastes.\n  Despite the very real environmental health and safety risks that \nexist at Hanford and Savannah River, fiscal pressures are forcing us to \ncut the overall cleanup budget even as we squander millions of dollars \ncleaning up low risk sites to comply with environmental regulations \ndesigned for a perfect world. As Ivan Selin, Chairman of the NRC, said \nlast week, Prioritization of the cleanup at DOE sites, based on an \nassessment of risk to the public and the cleanup workers, isn't \nhappening to the extent it should.\n  Finally, Hanford and Savannah River already have spent nuclear fuel. \nNot the safe, stable nuclear fuel found in commercial power reactors--\nbut military fuel designed to be quickly reprocessed to make plutonium. \nWhen we abruptly shut down plutonium production, this military fuel was \nleft in limbo. Today it sits, corroding, in pools at Hanford and \nSavannah River . . . 206 metric tons at Savannah River, and 2132 metric \ntons at Hanford.\n  To review the situation, we need one or two centralized, dry cask \nstorage sites for spent commercial nuclear fuel, until Yucca Mountain \nor another permanent geologic repository is ready. We have spent \nmilitary fuel at Hanford and Savannah River--along with a host of other \nenvironmental problems--that demand attention despite declining dollars \nand misplaced priorities dictated by current environmental statutes. \nEmployment at Hanford and Savannah River is dropping. The local \ncommunities are feeling the economic pinch. the activity at Hanford and \nSavannah River is shifting from defense production to environmental \nrestoration.\n  Hanford and Savannah River meet all the criteria listed earlier:\n  Spent fuel is already there.\n  There is adequate land area.\n  The Federal Government already owns the land.\n  There is transportation infrastructure.\n  There is security infrastructure.\n  There is an available, skilled work force that knows how to handle \nnuclear materials.\n  There is a nuclear safety/worker protection infrastructure in place.\n  Savannah River is conveniently located with respect to civilian power \nreactors in the east, and Hanford is convenient to reactors in the \nwest.\n  The new economic activity associated with spent fuel management will \nhelp address economic declines in the area.\n  The new dry cask storage facilities may even help safely contain the \nmore dangerous spent military fuel that exists at both \nsites. [[Page S7492]] \n  Overall costs of transportation and storage would appear to be lower \nat these sites.\n  Therefore, I believe Hanford and Savannah River offer excellent sites \nfor the temporary, dry cask storage of civilian spent nuclear fuel \nuntil a permanent geologic repository is available. At this point, I \nwould like to make clear my support for continued progress toward a \npermanent geologic repository. Hanford and Savannah River already have \ndefense nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel from defense and research \nactivities that is destined for the permanent geologic repository. This \nproposal is intended to hasten the day that those wastes, as well as \nthe civilian spent fuel, are sent away from the sites for permanent \ndisposal. I realize that at this time, nobody wants to store nuclear \nwaste. Incentives must be offered. The communities near Hanford and \nSavannah River will understandably ask, what's in it for us?\n  I would be prepared to pursue benefits for these communities if they \nare inclined to take spent commercial fuel on an interim basis only. \nFirst, I am working with several of my colleagues to develop \nlegislation that will prioritize DOE cleanups in accordance with actual \nrisks. That approach will result in Hanford and Savannah River being \ncleaned up faster, since many of the high-risk problems are located \nthere. Second, I am encouraging the privatization of efforts to \nvitrify--or turn into glass--high-level liquid wastes at Hanford. This \nis the best way to stabilize the liquid tanks and make them safe.\n  Third, we are offering new construction and economic activity \nassociated with the construction and operation of an interim, above \nground, dry cask storage site. This will help address the job losses \nand economic declines associated with the end of defense-related \nactivities at Hanford and Savannah River. Fourth, there are other \narrangements, including financial incentives, that can be considered. \nWhether or not DOE continues to exist as a Cabinet-level agency, its \nfunctions and operations will be significantly scaled back. As the \nvarious DOE sites compete for the remaining missions, special \nconsideration could be given to a site that hosts the interim storage \nfacility. Other benefits to communities agreeing to host an interim \nstorage site can also be discussed.\n  Finally, to provide assurances to the local communities of Richland/\nPasco/Kennewick, WA; Aiken, SC; and Augusta, GA, that the interim dry \ncask storage sites are not intended to be permanent, work on Yucca \nMountain will be continued. Remember, there is already spent nuclear \nfuel at these sites that is destined for a permanent geologic \nrepository, when one is available. It is in the long-term interest of \nthese facilities to participate in a program that will take care of the \nimmediate problem so that the work on the permanent repository can go \nforward.\n  In addition to selecting a site, there are four elements that we \nshould include in a legislative bill dealing with spent nuclear fuel. \nFirst, in order to construct a central interim storage facility in a \ntimely manner, changes must be made in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. \nThese amendments should provide: that licensing of an interim storage \nfacility can begin immediately; that the interim dry cask storage site \ncan be constructed incrementally and that waste acceptance can begin as \nsections are completed; that the NRC will be the sole licensing \nauthority; short-term renewable licenses to ease NRC rulemaking; and \nthat DOE will be treated like a private licensee.\n  Second, to help ensure that the spent fuel can be moved from reactor \nsites to interim storage as soon as possible, a transportation system \nmust be developed. Legislative changes would provide: that utilities \nare responsible for obtaining casks; that DOE will take title to fuel \nat reactor site; that DOE will be responsible for delivery; and a clear \nregulatory regime related to the transportation of spent fuel.\n  Third, to ensure that Yucca can be licensed, we should streamline \nlicensing provisions, specifying repository performance standards.\n  Finally, fourth, a budgetary framework must be established that \nensures that the money put into the Nuclear Waste Fund by the \nratepayers is available to the program in amounts sufficient to achieve \nthe first three goals in a timely and efficient way.\n  These draft proposals outline a workable and efficient interim \nstorage program that would allow us to pursue the investigation of our \npermanent disposal options, including a full study of the Yucca \nMountain site. However, one lesson we have learned is that we cannot \nput all of our eggs in one basket. We cannot solve every nuclear waste \nand spent fuel issue before this country in this Congress. However, we \ncan set up the beginnings of a workable, integrated nuclear waste \nmanagement system that will allow succeeding generations to apply new \ntechnologies to these problems.\n  In conclusion, I have given a basic outline of principles Congress \nmust address if we are to solve these two major environmental problems. \nAs chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I pledge \nto continue our goal of reaching a common sense and comprehensive \nsolution. We'd like to do that with the help of President Clinton and \nhis Department of Energy. So far, I have not seen sufficient indication \nthey really want to be a part of any solution. Unfortunately, this \nissue is not one where America can be without leadership. I will look \nforward to working with all of those who have an interest and concerns \nto resolve what is undoubtedly one of America's most frightening \nproblems, the management of waste left at DOE defense weapons \nfacilities, while providing a legislative framework for DOE to meet its \nobligation to take possession of the Nation's civilian spent nuclear \nfuel.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7491-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7492-S7495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Majority Leader has \nindicated that, when the Senate returns from the upcoming recess, it \nwill take up S. 652, the ``Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act of 1995.'' As my colleagues are aware, this is a very \nimportant piece of legislation dealing with many aspects of the \ncomplicated, fast-changing marketplace in telecommunications and the \nmany competing commercial interests in that marketplace.\n  Of great interest is the international marketplace in \ntelecommunications equipment and services, which is extremely \nlucrative, and is subject to many of the same kind of barriers to entry \nfor American companies that we see in other business sectors. \nCurrently, the US Trade Representative, Ambassador Mickey Kantor, has \ninitiated a 301 case against the Japanese in the area of automobile \nparts, after years of frustration in trying to gain fair entry into the \nJapanese market--just as the Japanese have access into the American \nmarket, and the Senate has strongly endorsed this action. Similar \nproblems exist in the telecommunications field, and the bill as \nreported from the Commerce Committee includes a provision to protect \nour telecommunications companies from unfair competition. The provision \nrequires that reciprocity is needed in the international marketplace, \nand in adjusting the rules for foreign ownership of telecommunications \nservices in the U.S., the host countries of those businesses seeking \nmarket access in the U.S. allow fair and reciprocal access to our \ntelecommunications providers in those nations.\n  This is a case of fairness, and the Committee has wisely included \nneeded leverage for the Administration to prod our trading partners \ninto opening their markets.\n  Given the highly lucrative nature of the telecommunications \nmarketplace, the stakes of gaining market access to foreign markets are \nhigh. It should be no surprise that securing effective market access to \nmany foreign markets, including those of our allies, including France, \nGermany and Japan has been very difficult. Those markets remain \nessentially closed to our companies, dominated as they are by large \nmonopolies favored by those governments. In fact, most European markets \nhighly restrict competition in basic voice services and infrastructure. \nA study by the Economic Strategy Institute in December of 1994 found \nthat ``while the U.S. has encouraged competition in all \ntelecommunication sectors except the [[Page S7493]] local exchange, the \noverwhelming majority of nations have discouraged competition and \nmaintained a public monopoly that has no incentive to become more \nefficient.'' U.S. firms, as a result of intense competition here in the \nU.S., provide the most advanced and efficient telecommunications \nservices in the world, and could certainly compete effectively in other \nmarkets if given the chance of an open playing\n field. The same study found that ``U.S. firms are blocked from the \nmajority of lucrative international opportunities by foreign government \nregulations prohibiting or restricting U.S. participation and \ninternational regulations which intrinsically discriminate and \novercharge U.S. firms and consumers.'' This study found that the total \nloss in revenues to U.S. firms, as a result of foreign barriers is \nestimated to be over $100 billion per year between 1992 and the turn of \nthe century. These are staggering sums.\n\n  Thus the administration has adopted an aggressive incentives-based \nstrategy for foreign countries to open their telecommunications \nservices markets to U.S. companies. First, as my colleagues are aware, \nthe negotiations which led to the historic revision of the GATT \nagreement and which created the World Trade Organization were unable to \nconclude an agreement on telecommunications services. Thus, separate \nnegotiations are underway in Geneva today to secure such an agreement, \nin the context of the Negotiating Group on Basic Telecommunications. In \nthe absence of such an agreement, we must rely on our own laws to \nprotect our companies and to provide leverage over foreign \nnations to open their markets. To forego our own national leverage \nwould do a great disservice to American business and would be \nshortsighted--the result of which would be not only a setback to our \nstrategy to open those markets, but pull the rug out from under our \nnegotiators in Geneva to secure a favorable international agreement for \nopen telecommunications markets. Indeed, tough U.S. reciprocity laws \nare clearly needed by our negotiators to gain an acceptable, effective, \nmarket opening agreement in Geneva in these so-called GATS [General \nAgreement on Trade in Services] negotiations.\n  Second, the bill as reported by the Commerce Committee supports a \nstrategy to provide incentives for foreign country market opening by \nconditioning new access to the American market upon a showing of \nreciprocity in the markets of the petitioning foreign companies. \nCurrent law, that is section 310 of the Communications Act of 1934 \nprovides that a foreign entity may not obtain a common carrier license \nitself, and may not own more than 25 percent of any corporation which \nowns or controls a common carrier license. This foreign ownership \nlimitation has not been very effective and has not prevented foreign \ncarriers from entering the U.S. market. The FCC has had the discretion \nof waiving this limitation if it finds that such action does not \nadversely affect the public interest. In addition, the law does not \nprevent some kinds of telecommunications businesses, such as operation \nand construction of modern fiber optic facilities or the resale of \nservices in the U.S. by foreign carriers. Nevertheless, maintaining \nrestrictions on foreign ownership is generally considered by U.S. \nindustry to be useful as one way to raise the issue of unfair foreign \ncompetition and to maintain leverage abroad. Therefore the \nbill establishes a reciprocal market access standard as a condition for \nthe waiver of Section 310(b). It states that the FCC may grant to an \nalien, foreign corporation or foreign government a common carrier \nlicense that would otherwise violate the restriction in Section 301(b) \nif the FCC finds that there are equivalent market opportunities for \nU.S. companies and citizens in the foreign country of origin of the \ncorporation or government.\n  Even though Section 310 has not prevented access into our market, the \nexistence of the section has been used by foreign countries as an \nexcuse to deny U.S. companies access to their markets. The provision in \nS. 652, applying a reciprocity rule, makes it clear that our market \nwill be open to others to the same extent that theirs are open to our \ninvestment. This is as it should be.\n  Given the importance of this provision, and the tremendous stakes \ninvolved in the future telecommunications markets worldwide, a number \nof issues regarding the provision have been raised, including the role \nof the President in reviewing FCC decisions, how the public interest \nstandard should be applied, whether our negotiators should have wide \nauthority to exercise leverage among telecommunications market \nsegments, to what extent Congress should be informed and involved in \nthe developing policies which effectively define the American public \ninterest, the impacts of the legislation on the ongoing negotiations in \nGeneva for a multilateral agreement, what mechanisms are needed to \nensure that promises for market access turn into reality by foreign \nnations--after the ink on an international agreement is dry--and \nseveral other matters.\n  In order to clarify and develop a fuller understanding of the \nramifications of the provision of S. 652, I wrote Ambassador Kantor on \nApril 3, 1995, soliciting his views in five areas: First, the impacts \nof the provision on the ongoing telecommunications negotiations in \nGeneva; second, the nature of foreign market behavior that would \ntrigger action under the concept of reciprocity in the bill; third, the \nlikely reactions of foreign governments to the provision; fourth, the \nmost useful role that the United States Trade Representative can play \nin implementing the proposal in the bill; and, fifth, his suggestions \nfor any changes which might strengthen the effectiveness of the \nprovision. I received a very full reply from Ambassador Kantor on April \n24, 1995, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record at \nthis point. I commend the Ambassador for his attention to this matter, \nand am sure that his reply will be useful to the Senate when the bill \ncomes to the floor. I hope that the Senate will have a good debate on \nthis particular provision, and hope that we will seize this historic \nopportunity to put into place effective reciprocity tools to truly open \nthe world's economies to opportunities for American genius and labor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 3, 1995.\n     Ambassador Mickey Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ambassador: The Senate will soon take up S. 652, \n     the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n     1995, to promote competition in the telecommunications \n     industry. I am writing to solicit your views on the revision \n     of foreign ownership provisions, specifically the revision to \n     Section 310(b) of the 1934 Communications Act.\n       As you may know, the Commerce Committee's reported bill \n     would allow the FCC to waive current statutory limits on \n     foreign investment in U.S. telecommunications services if the \n     FCC finds that there are ``equivalent market opportunities'' \n     for U.S. companies and citizens in the foreign country where \n     the investor or corporation is situated.\n       I would like to have your assessment of the impact of this \n     provision for both enhancing the prospects of U.S. \n     penetration of foreign markets, and for foreign investment in \n     American telecommunications companies and systems.\n       Specifically, what impacts and advantages can we anticipate \n     will result from enactment of this provision on the ongoing \n     negotiations in Geneva on Telecommunications which has been \n     established under the GATT, to be incorporated into the \n     General Agreement on Trade in Services?\n       Second, which markets in Asia and Europe are now closed to \n     U.S. telecommunications services in such a way that action on \n     the basis of the concept of Reciprocity in the Senate bill is \n     likely? What timeframes for such action, if any, would you \n     contemplate?\n       Third, what has been the position of nations whose markets \n     are closed to U.S. telecommunications services in the way of \n     justifying their lack of access, and what likely reactions \n     can we anticipate from those nations as a result of this \n     legislative provision?\n       What role do you think can be most usefully played by your \n     office in effectively implementing the provision that has \n     been recommended?\n       Lastly, in analyzing the legislation reported from the \n     Senate Commerce Committee, do you have any suggestions as to \n     how the provision might be strengthened to better serve the \n     goal of opening foreign markets to U.S. telecommunications \n     services and products?\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert C. Byrd.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                               [[Page S7494]]\n\n                                The U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: This is to respond to your letter of \n     April 3, 1995 regarding S. 652, the ``Telecommunications \n     Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995'' and its proposed \n     revision of Section 310(b) of the Communications Act of 1934. \n     The Departments of Commerce, Justice, State and Treasury have \n     concurred in this response to your letter.\n       The Administration and the U.S. telecommunications industry \n     are united in their support for Congressional action to \n     revise the foreign ownership rules under Section 310(b). As \n     Vice President Gore indicated recently to our G-7 partners, \n     the Administration seeks legislation to allow us to open \n     further our common carrier telecommunications market to the \n     firms of countries which open their markets to the American \n     common carrier telecommunications industry. This would \n     contribute greatly to the development of the Global \n     Information Infrastructure (GII).\n       As you know, the U.S. leads efforts in the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) aimed at reaching a market-opening \n     agreement on basic telecom services. The U.S. negotiating \n     team--led by the USTR with representatives from the \n     Departments of Commerce, Justice, State and the Federal \n     Communications Commission--has successfully advanced U.S. \n     objectives at the WTO talks.\n       I have attached detailed responses to each of your five \n     questions. By amending the legislation as we suggest, the \n     Congress would provide effective market-opening authority for \n     both multilateral and bilateral negotiations on basic \n     telecommuncations services.\n       We stand ready to work with you to develop legislation \n     which can serve our shared interest in a stronger U.S. \n     economy and the development of the Global Information \n     Infrastructure. We would also be pleased to provide your \n     staff with a briefing on the status of major telecom services \n     markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America at their \n     convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kantor.\n       Attachments.\n       1. Specifically, what impacts and advantages can we \n     anticipate will result from enactment of this provision on \n     the ongoing negotiations in Geneva on Telecommunications \n     which have been established under the GATT, to be \n     incorporated into the General Agreement on Trade in Services?\n       Answer: The U.S. maintains one of the world's most open and \n     competitive markets. Our objective in this negotiation is to \n     obtain firm commitments regarding similar levels of openness \n     in the markets of other important trading partners.\n       Legislation providing the Government with effective market-\n     opening authority with respect to Section 310(b) could have a \n     powerful positive effect on these talks. Section 310(b) is \n     regarded by foreign companies as a major barrier to market \n     access in the United States. That perception is out of \n     proportion to the actual effect of Section 310(b). Authority \n     to remove this restraint through international negotiations \n     or on the basis of similar levels of openness could lead in \n     turn to the removal of ownership restrictions and monopoly \n     barriers to U.S. companies in key markets abroad.\n       U.S. firms are successful global players in the common \n     carrier telecommunications industry. Telecommunications \n     companies in many major developed countries regard access to \n     the U.S. market as a strategic imperative. Legislation \n     providing the Government with effective market-opening \n     authority is essential if we are to level the playing field \n     for U.S. firms. This authority would greatly enhance the \n     prospects for U.S. penetration of foreign markets--markets \n     that now are sanctuaries for our companies' top competitors. \n     At the same time, it would benefit the U.S. economy by \n     greater openness to foreign investment in this growing \n     sector.\n       2. Second, which markets in Asia and Europe are now closed \n     to U.S. telecommunications services in such a way that action \n     on the basis of the concept of reciprocity in the Senate bill \n     is likely? What time frames for such action, if any, would \n     you contemplate?\n       Answer: Most markets in Europe, Asia and elsewhere have \n     monopoly arrangements which prohibit or restrict both foreign \n     ownership of basic telecommunications infrastructure and \n     provision of basic services. For example, most Member States \n     of the European Union have voice telephone service \n     monopolies, which they plan to maintain at least until 1998. \n     The European Union and its Member States may introduce \n     reciprocity provisions on foreign ownership in the absence of \n     a successful conclusion to the WTO negotiations. In Japan and \n     Canada, foreign ownership of firms that own \n     telecommunications infrastructure is restricted to 33 \n     percent.\n       Foreign governments remain cautious about allowing \n     competition to firms which remain state-owned or controlled. \n     In the past these companies have been regarded mainly as \n     state-managed sources of employment and demand for domestic \n     high tech goods.\n       Our key trading partners are much more likely to open their \n     basic telecom services markets to U.S. companies in return \n     for a balanced market-opening commitment by the U.S. which \n     includes changes to the restrictions on common carrier radio \n     licenses in Section 310(b). Unilateral action by the U.S. to \n     eliminate these Section 310(b) provisions would forfeit \n     leverage vis-a-vis these countries.\n       Effective market-opening legislation would reaffirm our \n     commitment to the principles of private investment and \n     competition and would allow us to challenge our key trade \n     partners to embrace fully these principles.\n       The WTO negotiations have a deadline of April 30, 1996. We \n     seek market-opening action within that time frame.\n       3. Third, what has been the position of nations whose \n     markets are closed to U.S. telecommunications services in the \n     way of justifying their lack of access, and what likely \n     reactions can we anticipate from those nations as a result of \n     their legislative provision?\n       Answer: Foreign markets are closed to U.S. firms, in \n     varying degrees, mainly due to the worldwide heritage of \n     natural monopoly in basic telecommunications services. The \n     United States moved first to begin abandoning this approach \n     over twenty years ago. The very successful American result in \n     terms of increased information sector employment, fast-\n     growing high-technology industries and better services to \n     consumers and businesses has helped to motivate some key \n     trading partners gradually to abandon monopoly as well. But \n     progress has been incremental at best, with most markets only \n     allowing competition in data and value-added services. Very \n     few trading partners have taken steps to liberalize their \n     basic infrastructure and voice telephone service markets. \n     Even the United Kingdom, which now has one of the most \n     liberal basic telecommunications services markets, still \n     maintains a duopoly on facilities-based international \n     services.\n       Some trade partners regard global market access as a \n     strategic imperative for their companies. Since the United \n     States represents about one-quarter of the world telcom \n     services market, we can expect these nations will seek to \n     obtain the benefit of any market-opening steps offered by the \n     U.S. In this way, we hope to negotiate an exchange of market-\n     opening commitments in the WTO productively with these trade \n     partners.\n       Other significant trade partners which have inefficient \n     telecommunications monopolies are faced with large unmet \n     domestic demand for basic telecommunications services. \n     Nonetheless, they remain cautious about allowing competition. \n     The WOT negotiations offer an opportunity to harmonize and to \n     expedite these parties' transition away from monopoly and \n     towards reliance on private investment and competition.\n       4. Fourth, what role do you think can most usefully be \n     played by your office in effectively implementing the \n     proposal that has been recommended?\n       Answer: The Federal Communications Commission recently \n     proposed to consider foreign market access in certain \n     decisions affecting foreign-affiliated firms. The role of the \n     Executive Branch as defined by statutory reform of Section \n     310(b) should conform with the view expressed below by the \n     Executive Branch in its recent comments on the FCC's proposed \n     rulemaking. In comments filed on April 11, 1995 by the \n     Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration on behalf of the Executive Branch, \n     we stated,\n       ``The Commission . . . has authority over the regulation of \n     U.S.-based telecommunications carriers in interstate and \n     foreign commerce, as well as concurrent authority with the \n     Executive Branch to protect competition involving \n     telecommunications carriers by enforcing certain provisions \n     of the antitrust laws. In carrying out its regulatory \n     responsibilities, the Commission may help effectuate the \n     policy goals and initiatives of the Executive Branch and \n     promote U.S. interests in dealing with foreign countries. \n     Accordingly the Commission must accord great deference to the \n     Executive Branch with respect to U.S. national security, \n     foreign relations, the interpretation of international \n     agreements, and trade (as well as direct investment as it \n     relates to international trade policy). The Commission must \n     also continue to take into account the Executive Branch's \n     views and decisions with respect to antitrust and \n     telecommunications and information policies.''\n       The Administration plans to work with the Commission to \n     establish a process to take the respective authorities of the \n     Commission and Executive Branch agencies into account in \n     making such determinations.\n       5. Lastly, in analyzing the legislation reported from the \n     Senate Commerce Committee, do you have any suggestions as to \n     how the provision might be strengthened to better serve the \n     goal of opening foreign markets to U.S. telecommunications \n     services and products?\n       Answer: First, the legislation should provide the Executive \n     Branch with leverage to negotiate greater openness, in \n     conformance with the view expressed by the Executive Branch \n     in its recent comments on the FCC's proposed rulemaking. \n     Otherwise, the legislation reported from the Senate Commerce \n     Committee would make market access factors determinative, in \n     a departure from the FCC's existing public interest standard. \n     Under the existing public interest standard, the government \n     can exercise discretion with respect to foreign investors \n     from otherwise unfriendly nations.\n       Second, the bill should provide authority to conform with \n     the obligations of a successful outcome in the WTO \n     negotiations. This would require the U.S. to make any new \n     market-opening commitments on a most-favored-nation (MFN) \n     basis within the framework of the General Agreement on Trade \n     in [[Page S7495]] Services (GATS). In order to provide \n     effective leverage in these talks, legislation to reform \n     Section 310(b) should explicitly provide for the Government \n     to take on such an obligation. If the WTO basic \n     telecommunications services negotiations are not successful, \n     the U.S. will take a most-favored-nation exception for basic \n     telecommunications services under the GATS.\n       Third, the bill's market-segment-for-market-segment \n     approach should be dropped to allow market opening generally \n     balanced among telecommunications services markets.\n       Fourth and finally, the bill's ``snapback'' provision is a \n     unilateral provision to remove negotiated benefits which \n     would be unacceptable to us if proposed by other nations for \n     themselves. It is unnecessary insofar as the FCC can already \n     condition authorizations and reopen them if the conditions \n     later are not met, consistent with U.S. international \n     obligations.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7492-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7495-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7495-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7495-S7496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE STATE OF SMALL BUSINESS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM \n                                   53\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following messages \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to forward my second annual report on the state of small \nbusiness, and to report that small businesses are doing exceptionally \nwell. Business starts and incorporations were up in 1993, the year \ncovered in this report. Failures and bankruptcies were down. Six times \nas many jobs were created as in the previous year, primarily in \nindustries historically dominated by small businesses.\n  Small businesses are a critical part of our economy. They employ \nalmost 60 percent of the work force, contribute 54 percent of sales, \naccount for roughly 40 percent of gross domestic product, and are \nresponsible for 50 percent of private sector output. More than 600,000 \nnew firms have been created annually over the past decade, and over \nmuch of this period, small firms generated many of the Nation's new \njobs. As this report documents, entrepreneurial small businesses are \nalso strong innovators, producing twice as many significant innovations \nas their larger counterparts.\n  In short, a great deal of our Nation's economic activity comes from \nthe record number of entrepreneurs living the American Dream. Our job \nin Government is to make sure that conditions are right for that \ndynamic activity to continue and to grow.\n  And we are taking important steps. Maintaining a strong economy while \ncontinuing to lower the Federal budget deficit may be the most \nimportant step we in Government can take. A lower deficit means that \nmore savings can go into new plant and equipment and that interest \nrates will be lower. It means that more small businesses can get the \nfinancing they need to get started.\n  We are finally bringing the Federal deficit under control. In 1992 \nthe deficit was $290 billion. By 1994, the deficit was $203 billion; we \nproject that it will fall to $193 billion in 1995.\n  Deficit reduction matters. We have been enjoying the lowest combined \nrate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. Gross domestic product \nhas increased, as have housing starts. New business incorporations \ncontinue to climb. We want to continue bringing the deficit down in a \nway that protects our economic recovery, pays attention to the needs of \npeople, and empowers small business men and women.\n\n\n                           capital formation\n\n  One area on which we have focused attention is increasing the \navailability of capital to new and small enterprises, especially the \ndynamic firms that keep us competitive and contribute so much to \neconomic growth.\n  Bank regulatory policies are being revised to encourage lending to \nsmall firms. Included in the Credit Availability Program that we \nintroduced in 1993 are revised banking regulatory policies concerning \nsome small business loans and permission for financial institutions to \ncreate ``character loans.''\n  New legislation supported by my Administration and enacted in \nSeptember 1994, the Reigle Community Development and Regulatory \nImprovement Act of 1994, establishes a Community Development Financial \nInstitutions Fund for community development banks, amends banking and \nsecurities laws to encourage the creation of a secondary market for \nsmall business loans, and reduces the regulatory burden for financial \ninstitutions by changing or eliminating 50 banking regulations.\n  Under the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and \nAmendments Act of 1994, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is \nauthorized to increase the number of guaranteed small business loans \nfor the next 3 years. The budget proposed for the SBA will encourage \nprivate funds to be directed to the small businesses that most need \naccess to capital. While continuing\n cost-cutting efforts, the plan proposes to fund new loan and venture \ncapital authority for SBA's credit and investment programs. Changes in \nthe SBA's 7(a) guaranteed loan program will increase the amount of \nprivate sector lending leveraged for every dollar of taxpayer funds \ninvested in the program.\n\n  Through the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, a group \nof new venture capital firms are expected to make available several \nbillion dollars in equity financing for startups and growing firms. The \nSBIC program will continue to grow as regulations promulgated in the \npast year facilitate financing with a newly created participating \nequity security instrument.\n  And the Securities and Exchange Commission's simplified filing and \nregistration requirements for small firm securities have helped \nencourage new entries by small firms into capital markets.\n  We are recommending other changes that will help make more capital \navailable to small firms. In reauthorizing Superfund, my Administration \nseeks to limit lender liability for Superfund remediation costs, which \nhave had an adverse effect on lending to small businesses. Interagency \nteams have been examining additional cost-effective ways to expand the \navailability of small business financing, such as new options for \nexpanding equity investments in small firms and improvements to \nexisting microlending efforts.\n  We've also recognized that we can help small business people increase \ntheir available capital through tax reductions and incentives. We \nincreased by 75 percent, from $10,000 to $17,500, the amount a small \nbusiness can deduct as expenses for equipment purchases. Tax incentives \nin the 1993 Budget Reconciliation Act are having their effect, \nencouraging long-term investment in small firms. And the empowerment \nzone program offers significant tax incentives--a 20 percent wage \ncredit, $20,000 in expensing, and tax-exempt facility bonds--for firms \nwithin the zones.\n\n\n                        regulation and paperwork\n\n  But increasing the availability of capital to small firms is only \npart of the battle. We also have to make sure that Government doesn't \nget in the way. And we're making progress in our efforts to create a \nsmaller, smarter, less costly and more effective Government that is \ncloser to home--closer to the small businesses and citizens it serves.\n  In the first round of our reinventing Government initiative--the \nNational Performance Review--we asked Government professionals for \ntheir best ideas on how to create a better Government with less red \ntape. One recommendation was that Federal agency compliance with the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act--that requires agencies to examine proposed \nand existing regulations for their effects on small entities--be \nsubject to judicial review. In other words, they said we need to put \nteeth in the legislation requiring Federal agencies to pay attention to \nsmall business concerns when they write regulations. That proposal has \nbeen under debate in the Congress. [[Page S7496]] \n  Federal agencies are already considering and implementing specific \nways to streamline regulations and make paperwork easier for small \nbusinesses to manage. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) responded to small business owners and advocates who said that \nthe agency's toxic release inventory rule was especially costly and \nburdensome. In November 1994, the EPA announced a final rule that will \nmake it easier for small businesses to report small amounts of toxic \nreleases.\n  And SBA has slashed the small business loan form for loans under \n$100,000 from an inch-thick stack to a single page. The SBA is also \npiloting a new electronic loan application that will involve no \npaperwork, but will allow business owners to concentrate on the \nbusiness at hand--building a successful operation.\n  When businesses are unable to succeed, no one is served by a process \nthat entangles small business owners in an endless jumble of paperwork. \nSweeping changes made to bankruptcy laws in the past year will help \nsmall businesses reorganize. Small firms with less than $2.5 million in \ndebt may utilize a streamlined reorganization process that is less \nexpensive and more timely.\n  My Executive order on Regulatory Review provides a process for more \nrational regulation, and we've been listening to the concerns of small \nfirms through a Regulatory Reform Forum for Small Business. Five \nsector-specific groups have made specific proposals for regulatory \nrelief. These groups have said that a comprehensive, multiagency \nstrategy, with better public involvement, is probably the most cost-\neffective way to improve both the quality of regulations and compliance \nwith them. The key is to make sure that Government serves small \nbusiness and the American people, not the other way around.\n\n\n             electronic commerce and government procurement\n\n  The reinventing Government initiative also called for expanded use of \nelectronic marketing and commerce, and we have made great strides in \nproviding information about Government programs electronically. These \nmethods will increase small business access to markets.\n  Another area that has been sorely in need of reform is the Government \nprocurement process. In October 1994, I signed into law the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, which will change the way the Government \ndoes business. The law modifies more than 225 provisions of procurement \nlaw to reduce paperwork burdens, improve efficiency, save the taxpayers \nmoney, establish a Federal acquisition computer network, increase \nopportunities for women-owned and small disadvantaged businesses, and \ngenerally make Government acquisition of commercial products easier. \nThis report documents how small businesses are doing under the old \nsystem; my hope is that opportunities for small business success will \nbe even greater once these reforms are in effect.\n\n\n                            human resources\n\n  Beyond encouraging an economic environment that supports small \nbusiness success, opening doors to capital resources, buying more of \nour goods and services from small firms, and getting out of small \nbusiness' way, I believe we in Government have a responsibility to ask \nwhether we are doing enough to ensure a healthy and adequately prepared \nwork force.\n  I remain committed to seeking a way to provide health insurance \ncoverage for all Americans. As this report clearly shows, the number of \nuninsured Americans is too high--and it's growing. Millions of those \ncitizens are in working families. And the sad fact is that many of \nthose workers are in small businesses, which have seen their premiums \nand deductibles soar. We must make sure that self-employed people and \nsmall businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates--whether \nthrough voluntary purchasing pools or some other mechanism.\n  We also ought to be able to ensure that our citizens are adequately \nprovided for when they reach the end of their working years. Here too, \nsmall firms have been at a disadvantage. Our proposed pension \nlegislation exempted most small plans from compliance and reporting \nincreases.\n  And while our industries restructure and move from an age of heavy \nindustry to an information age that demands new skills and new \nflexibility, we need to make sure that our work force\n has the skills and tools to compete. That is why I proposed the Middle \nClass Bill of Rights, which would provide a tax deduction for all \neducation and training after high school; foster more saving and \npersonal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual \nretirement account and withdraw from it tax-free for the cost of \neducation, health care, first-time house buying, or the care of a \nparent; and offer to those laid off or working for a very low wage, a \nvoucher worth $2,000 a year to get the skills they need to improve \ntheir lives.\n\n\n                          international trade\n\n  We also want to empower small businesses to succeed in a global \neconomy. One of the greatest challenges in the next century will be our \ninternational competition. Ninety-six percent of all exporting firms \nare small firms with fewer than 500 employees, but only 10 percent of \nsmall firms export; therefore the potential for increasing small firm \nexports is significant. I believe the North American Free Trade \nAgreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will benefit \nsmall firms interested in expanding into international markets in this \nhemisphere and beyond.\n  Lending to small exporters is being eased through reforms in the \nExport-Import Bank's Working Capital Guarantee Program. New one-stop \nexport shops are moving in the right direction to assist small firms by \nproviding access to export programs of the Department of Commerce, \nExport-Import Bank, and Small Business Administration all under one \nroof.\n\n\n                      hearing from small business\n\n  Small businesses are too important to our economy for their concerns \nnot to be heard. That is why I have given the SBA a seat on the \nNational Economic Council and invited the SBA Administrator in to \nCabinet meetings.\n  Over the past 2 years, my Administration has been asking questions of \nsmall business owners and listening to the answers--seeking advice and \nguidance from a diverse audience of business leaders to determine the \nmost critical problems and devise solutions that work.\n  This year presents a special opportunity for small business persons \nto make their concerns known at the White House Conference on Small \nBusiness, set to convene in Washington in June 1995. In State \nconferences leading up to the national conference, small business \nowners have been frank about their concerns. I look forward to hearing \ntheir small business action agenda.\n  I firmly believe that we need to keep looking to our citizens and \nsmall businesses for innovative solutions. They have shown they have \nthe ingenuity and creative power to make our economy grow; we just need \nto let them do it.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nreform the wetlands regulatory program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               the wetlands regulatory reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce, along \nwith several of my colleagues, the Wetlands Regulatory Reform Act of \n1995. I am particularly pleased to have as the lead cosponsor Senator \nFaircloth, the chairman of the subcommittee of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee that has jurisdiction over wetlands. Our bill \nwill reform the section 404 ``wetlands'' permitting program under the \nClean Water Act by introducing balance, common sense, and reason to a \nFederal program that is causing unnecessary problems for my \nconstituents--and I believe for many of our citizens around the Nation.\n  In the closing days of the last Congress, I introduced a wetlands \nbill, S. 2506, so that my colleagues and other interested persons could \nreview the legislation and recommend improvements prior to \nreintroduction in the 104th Congress. I appreciate the efforts of those \nwho took the time over the last few months to provide suggestions, many \nof which are reflected in the current bill.\n  Mr. President, the current section 404 regulatory program has been \ndesigned less by the elected representatives of the people than by \nofficials of the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection \nAgency and by Federal judges. In 1972, the Congress enacted the Federal \nWater Pollution Control Act. Section 404 of that Act prohibited \n``discharges of dredged or fill material'' into ``waters of the United \nStates;'' without a permit from the Secretary of the Army. At the time \nof passage, ``waters of the United States'' was thought to be limited \nto the navigable waters of the Nation.\n  From this narrow beginning has come a rigid regulatory program that \nis devaluing property and preventing the construction of housing, the \nextension of airport runways, the construction of roads--often on lands \nthat rarely, if ever, have water on the surface but which, \nnevertheless, are viewed as ``wetlands'' within the definition of \n``waters of the United States''. And I might add, Mr. President, that \n75 percent of the land that is being regulated through the Section 404 \nprogram as ``wetlands'' or ``waters of the United States'' is \nprivately-owned property.\n  I do not believe that we, in Congress, intended for the Section 404 \nprogram to become a rigid, broad Federal land use program that affects \nprimarily privately-owned property. Yet, the evidence is clear to me \nthat the Section 404 program has become just that. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I believe that the time has come for the Congress to reform \nthis program to focus Federal regulatory authority on those wetlands \nthat are truly important functioning wetlands, to ensure that our \ncitizens can obtain permits through a reasonable process within a \nreasonable period of time, and to ensure that this program is not \ndenying people the use of their property unless there is an overriding \nreason to do so.\n  Mr. President, the Wetlands Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 proposes \nseveral key changes to the current 404 program:\n  First, the bill provides a statutory definition of a jurisdictional \nwetland. This is, of course, the crucial threshold question: what \nwetlands are subject to Federal regulation? And yet, one can read the \nentire Clean Water Act without finding the answer to this question. \nInstead, the answer currently lies only in a manual prepared by the \nCorps of Engineers in 1987. I think it is high\n time that Congress make an explicit judgment on this matter and set \nforth a definition in the statute itself.\n\n  The definition in our bill is essentially this: there must be water \non or above the surface of the ground for at least 21 consecutive days \nduring the growing season. This is virtually the same as the definition \nin H.R. 961, which passed the House last week.\n  During the debate in the House, it was claimed by opponent of the \nbill that this definition excludes a huge portion of the wetlands that \nare currently regulated. However, the claims varied widely, and did not \nappear to be based on solid evidence. Although I think that these \nclaims are exaggerated I want to make sure that our definition does not \nexclude wetlands that are truly important. Therefore, I intend to write \nto the Clinton administration to ask them to provide the best evidence \navailable regarding the effect of our definition on the amount and \nnature of wetland regulated, both nationwide and in Louisiana.\n  Second, this legislation will require that Federal jurisdictional \nwetlands be classified into three categories: high, medium, and low \nvalued wetlands, based on the relative wetlands functions present. \nToday, the Section 404 program regulates all wetlands equally rigidly, \nwhether the wetland is a pristine, high-value wetland, a wet spot in a \nfield, or a ``wetland'' in the middle of an industrial area. This \ntreatment of wetlands defies logic and common sense.\n  My legislation will require the Corps of Engineers to classify \nwetlands based on their functions, and then regulate them accordingly. \nClass A, high-value, wetlands will be regulated under the current \n``sequencing'' methodology, which first seeks to avoid adverse effects \non wetlands, then attempts to minimize those adverse effects that \ncannot be avoided, and finally calls for mitigation of any adverse \neffects that cannot be avoided or minimized. Class B, medium-value, \nwetlands will be regulated under a balancing test, which does not \nrequire the avoidance step. Finally, Class C, low-value, wetlands will \nnot be regulated by the Federal Government, but may be regulated by the \nState if they so choose.\n  Third, this legislation removes the dual agency implementation of \nthis program, an aspect of the program that is particularly confusing \nand troublesome to our constituents. Today, the Army Corps of Engineers \nissues Section 404 permits, but the Environmental Protection Agency may \nveto the decision of the Corps to issue the permit. Although EPA \nactually exercises its veto power infrequently, I understand that veto \nis threatened often, causing undue delays and repeated multi-agency \nconsultations. My legislation removes the EPA veto, and instead simply \nrequires the Corps to consult with EPA before acting.\n  Similarly, current law allows the EPA to veto permit decisions made \nby State that have assumed responsibility for the section 404 program. \nOur bill makes two changes to this regime. First, the Corps, instead of \nthe EPA, becomes responsible for overseeing States that have assumed \nresponsibility for the program. This is done in order to consolidate \nresponsibility in a single Federal agency. Second, the bill deletes the \nveto authority as an unnecessary interference with State administration \nof the program. If the Corps determines that the State is\n not implementing the program appropriately, the Corps has the \nauthority, which my bill does not change, to withdraw approval of the \nState program and return the program to Federal hands. But as long as \nthe State is in charge, its individual permit decisions should not be \nsubject to veto from Washington.\n\n  Fourth, mitigation banking is authorized and encouraged by the bill \nas a sound means to return wetlands functions to the environment. There \nare a number of mitigation banking projects now around the Nation. The \nexperience with these projects is proving that mitigation banking holds \ngreat promise as a means of restoring, enhancing, reclaiming, and even \ncreating wetlands to offset the wetlands disturbances that are \npermitted under the section 404 program. Mitigation banking is the type \nof market driven mechanism that I believe we must incorporate in our \nnational environmental laws if we are to achieve our national \nenvironmental goals.\n  Finally, this legislation will require that steps be taken to provide \nnotice to our citizens regarding the location of Federal jurisdictional \nwetlands. Remarkably, Mr. President, the Federal Government is \nregulating over 100 million acres of land, over 75 million acres of \nwhich is privately owned, yet there are no maps posted to inform \ncitizens about the location of these lands. Perhaps this would not be a \nproblem if [[Page S7499]] Federal jurisdictional wetlands were only \nswamps, marshes, bogs, and other such areas that are wet at the surface \nfor a significant portion of the year, and therefore relatively easy \nfor our citizens to identify. But land that is dry at the surface all \nyear long can also be a Federal jurisdictional wetland.\n  Without maps and other notices, only the most highly trained \ntechnicians among our citizens can identify the subtle differences \nbetween lands that are not subject to the section 404 program and those \nthat are. Thus, many people have bought land for home sites, only to \nfind out later that they have bought a Federal jurisdictional wetland \nand cannot obtain a permit to build their house. We owe our citizens \nbetter than that.\n  My legislation will require the Corps of Engineers to immediately \npost notices about the section 404 program near the property records in \nthe courthouses around the Nation, and to post maps of Federal \njurisdictional wetlands as those maps become available, including the \nNational Wetlands Inventory maps that are being developed by the \nNational Biological Survey.\n  Mr. President, there are many other improvements of the current \nprogram in my legislation, including time limits on the issuance of \nsection 404 permits, an administrative appeal process, and the \ndesignation of the Secretary of Agriculture to delineate wetlands on \nagricultural lands.\n  As I mentioned, our bill has virtually the same definition of wetland \nas the House-passed clean water bill, H.R. 961. Although there are \nseveral other comparable provisions in the two bills, our legislation \nvaries from the House-passed bill in at least one important respect. \nOur legislation does not provide a mechanism for obtaining compensation \nfrom the Federal Government when private property is taken through the \noperation of the 404 program. I believe that the impact of the section \n404 program on private property rights is a very important issue. \nHowever, I also believe that compensation is an extraordinarily\n complex and controversial issue that overarches all environmental \nregulations, not just those relating to wetlands. Thus, rather than \nattempting to resolve the compensation issue in this bill, we have \nchosen to include provisions in the legislation that will help ensure \nthat the Section 404 Program does not result in takings of private \nproperty in the first place. Therefore, in addition to the many \nprovisions of the bill that will make the wetlands program more \nbalanced and rational, it also directs Federal officials to implement \nthe program in a manner that minimizes the adverse effects on the use \nand value of privately-owned property.\n\n  I would be remiss if I did not comment on the recently-issued study \nof wetlands by the National Academy of Sciences. The report reaches \nseveral conclusions that are reflected in this legislation. \nSpecifically, it recommends the consolidation of all wetlands \nregulatory functions into a single Federal agency, a change that is \ncentral to our legislation. It also recommends that regional variations \nin wetlands be taken into account, which our bill does.\n  Some have suggested that the NAS study recommends against a \nclassification scheme such as is included in our bill, but I do not \nread it that way. The report states that:\n\n       Some groups have suggested the creation of a national \n     scheme that would designate wetlands of high, medium, or low \n     value based on some general guidelines involving size, \n     location, or some other factor that does not require field \n     evaluation. It is not possible, however, to relate such \n     categories in a reliable way to objective measures of \n     wetlands functions, in part because the relationships between \n     categories and functions are variable and in part because we \n     still have insufficient knowledge of wetlands functions. \n     (Emphasis added.)\n\n  I read the report to warn against nationwide classification schemes \nthat do not take into account site-specific considerations, a point on \nwhich I heartily agree. That is why our classification process is \ninitiated only in connection with the consideration of a permit \napplication or upon a request for classification of a specific piece of \nproperty. The particular piece of property is classified after \nconsidering site-specific factors, such as the significance of the \nwetland ``to the long-term conservation of the aquatic system of which \nthe wetland is a part,'' and the ``scarcity of functioning wetlands \nwithin the watershed or aquatic system.'' Thus, I do not see an \ninconsistency between the NAS report and our bill with respect to \nclassification.\n  Even if the NAS study could be interpreted as expressing concern \nabout any classification scheme for wetlands, I would suggest that \nthose concerns should not be dispositive. Scientists and lawmakers \nnecessarily approach matters differently. Scientists are in the \nbusiness of achieving a more perfect state of knowledge, while \nlawmakers are in the business of drawing regulatory lines and \nallocating societal resources based on the information available. While \na scientist might prefer to wait for more information before \ndistinguishing among wetlands, Congress cannot wait because the present \nregulatory scheme, which makes no distinctions among wetlands, is so \nclearly ineffective at balancing wetlands protection against other \npolicy considerations.\n  Mr. President, reforming the wetlands regulatory program will be one \nof my highest priorities in this Congress. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues and others in an effort to make the program work \nboth for the environment and for our constituents.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator J. Bennett Johnston, in introducing legislation today which \nmakes major reforms in Sec. 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control \nAct, also known a the Clean Water Act.\n  We all know Sec. 404 to be the wetlands regulatory program which has \ncaused so much controversy and so many problems. I have heard countless \ncomplaints that the program has been implemented in an excessive and \nrestrictive manner for years, imposing unfair hardship on landowners, \nbusinesses and local governments.\n  It is long overdue that the Sec. 404 program be reformed. It is long \noverdue that the program be balanced, reasonable and fair. This bill \nattempts to achieve those objectives.\n  One of the major features of the bill is its wetlands classification \nsystem. I wholeheartedly endorse classifying and regulating wetlands by \nthe their value and function.\n  All wetlands are not equal in value and function, yet for years they \nhave been regulated that way. That way is wrong and we intend to change \nit.\n  We do not have a wetlands classification system in current law. To be \nfair and to strike balance and reason in wetlands regulation we must \nidentify and regulate according to the very real differences in \nwetlands value and function.\n  For the first time, wetlands would be divided into three classes of \ncritical significance, Class A, significant, Class B, and marginal \nvalue, Class C. Each class is defined to distinguish the different \nvalues and functions found in wetlands.\n  Classes A and B wetlands would be regulated because they provide the \nmost valuable functions. A public interest test would have to be met \nwhen regulating these two classes. Class C wetlands would not be \nregulated because they are of marginal value.\n  Other major provisions of the bill include a definition of \njurisdictional wetlands, expansion of wetlands regulatory exemptions \nand an expansion of regulated activities. Single agency program \njurisdiction and administration by the Corps of Engineers is \nestablished.\n  Also included in the bill are exclusion of prior converted cropland \nfrom Sec. 404 regulation, USDA delineation of wetlands on agricultural \nland, and authorization of State permitting programs, and \nadministrative appeals program and a mitigation banking program. Public \ninformation is required to be published about wetlands and their \nregulation at the Federal and local levels.\n  The bill's policies attempt to strike a very simple and sound premise \nin regulatory policy, that is, balance, reason and, most importantly, \nfairness shall prevail.\n  These policies attempt to balance respect for the environment with \nrespect for property owners, in whose possession lies an estimated 75 \npercent of our wetlands in the lower 48 states.\n  In all that we do with regard to wetlands policy, we must always be \nmindful and respectful of the fact that most [[Page S7500]] of our \nwetlands in the lower 48 States are privately owned.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for this time to announce my support for \nand sponsorship of the Wetlands Regulatory Reform Act of 1995.\n  I hope the Senate can begin hearings on the legislation and hear \nsolid testimony so that a final bill can be crafted.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I join Senator Faircloth and \nSenator Johnston and others, in introducing legislation that addresses \na major concern of landowners, farmers, businesses, and average \ncitizens throughout the United States. The concern is wetlands.\n  Just last week, during consideration of the Clean Water Act, the \nHouse of Representatives passed major revisions to our Federal wetlands \nlaws. It is now the Senate's turn to address this major issue. As \nChairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Wetlands, Senator Faircloth will \ndirect Senate efforts to bring much needed common sense to our Federal \nwetlands laws. Very few Federal issues are more critical to South \nDakota property owners. Therefore, I look forward to working with \nSenator Faircloth in making sure reforms are adopted during this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, current wetlands law is too broad. It is causing too \nmany problems throughout the country. Congress has never passed a \ncomprehensive law defining wetlands. Without such a definition, Federal \nagencies have been recklessly pursuing control over private property in \nthe name of saving wetlands. The time to act has come.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced S. 352, The Comprehensive Wetlands \nConservation and Management Act of 1995. A number of the provisions in \nmy legislation already have been adopted by the House, as part of its \nreforms on wetlands. Also, I am pleased that most of S. 352 is \nincorporated in the bipartisan bill we are introducing today.\n  By introducing a bipartisan bill, one message is made clear: \nMeaningful wetlands reform must be adopted this year.\n  One issue I reserve the right to address during future Senate debate \non wetlands reform is adequate compensation for private property \nowners. Whenever the Federal Government takes land away from private \nproperty owners, or significantly reduces the use of private property, \ncompensation is in order. There is no compensation provision in the \nbill being introduced today. However, I intend to raise this issue \nduring floor debate on this subject. Compensation to private property \nowners should be included in meaningful wetlands reform.\n  The primary purpose of today's legislation is to clearly define \nwetlands in law and regulation. What the Federal Government should, or \nshould not be doing in this area needs to be clearly defined.\n  In addition, efforts must be made to ensure that any fine or penalty \nis in line with violations. Many violations are incidental and can be \nquickly repaired. Penalties should fit the crime. The bill we are \nintroducing today would set that kind of standard.\n  The bill would require certain criteria to be met and verified before \nan area can be regulated as a wetland. Such an approach would be more \nreliable in identifying true wetlands. It would prevent field \ninspectors from mistakenly classifying as wetland dry, upland areas \nthat drain effectively. It also would eliminate a major source of \nconfusion and abuse caused by current regulations.\n  This bill also would give States and local governments the authority \nto tailor the wetlands regulatory program to their own special \ncircumstances. This is greatly needed.\n  The bill also would clarify current agricultural exemptions and \nprovide that the Secretary of Agriculture shall identify agricultural \nlands that are wetlands.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for the Senate to adopt wetlands \nreform. Only through the kind of commonsense and balanced approach \nproposed in this bill can the Nation's agricultural, business, \nenvironmental, and individual interests be properly addressed.\n  Mr. President, thousands of South Dakotans have written, called, or \nvisited with me about the lack of definition of wetlands and the \nhaphazard rules and regulatory overkill taken by the Federal \nGovernment. They rightly are concerned about the impact of the current \nsystem on their ability to run their farms and businesses. South \nDakotans are law-abiding citizens who stand for fairness and balance in \nthe enforcement of the law. South Dakotans are conscientious stewards \nof the land they have cared for and cultivated for generations. They \nbelieve the time has come for a fair, balanced approach that protests \nthe environment as well as private property. I believe the bill we are \nintroducing today responds to this call for fairness from South Dakota \nand across America.\n  Action on this issue is essential. I urge my colleagues to take a \nclose look at this bill and join in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Brown, Mr. Campbell, \n        Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Burns, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Kyl, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Dole, and Mr. Gramm):\n  S. 852. A bill to provide for uniform management of livestock grazing \non Federal land, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                   the livestock grazing act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, over the past several years, a series of \nlegislative and administrative actions have haunted the Federal lands \nranchers. A cloud has been hanging over their livelihoods. Today, with \nthe introduction of the Livestock Grazing Act of 1995 [LGA], we intend \nto roll back that cloud.\n  In the wings, however, there awaits an onerous proposal that will \njeopardize the very fabric of the Federal lands rancher's livelihood. \nOn August 21, 1995, Secretary Babbitt's Rangeland Reform '94 proposal \nbecomes final. Earlier this year, the Secretary agreed to provide a 6-\nmonth window of opportunity for Congress to deliberate over the \nconcerns raised during the 2-year debate on the proposed rule. LGA is \nthe product of that temporary stay; it is a product that will provide \nstability for ranchers across the West.\n  Many issues have been addressed in our bill. For example, issues such \nas public input into the management of our Federal lands; standards and \nguidelines that will reflect the diversity of the western rangelands; \nand incentive for permitees to contribute private dollars to betterment \nof our Federal lands; a fair method in gaining ownership and control of \nwater rights; a subleasing provision that will help the elderly and \nfamily ranchers; and, a grazing fee formula that will generate more \nrevenue for the American taxpayers.\n  There are many more aspects of this legislation, nevertheless, I am \ngoing to focus on the new grazing fee and the formula that will \ngenerate an increase in revenue to the Treasury.\n  Although the grazing fee does not affect the condition of our \nrangelands, I did make a commitment to increase the grazing fee during \nthe October debate on Rangeland Reform '94. Today, through this \nlegislation that pledge has been honored. LGA includes a grazing \nformula that will provide for a fair return for the utilization of our \nFederal lands.\n  In the past, the Federal lands grazing fee was based on a formula \nthat was too complex and subject to many interpretations. A simpler and \nmore understandable fee formula will help ensure a greater amount of \nstability to the Federal lands ranchers.\n  The LGA fee establishes a fee formula that is based on the gross \nvalue of production for cattle. Although this formula is based solely \non the value of production for cattle, an adjustment has been made to \ntake into consideration the differential in the production value \nbetween a cow and animals that are not as large. This adjustment will \nnot increase the numbers of sheep and goats on the Federal lands, but \nwill merely take into account the considerable differences between the \ncattle prices and the other two commodities.\n  This Gross Return Fee formula is based on the premise that the \nwestern Federal lands rancher should pay a fair percentage of gross \nproduction value that is gained by use of the Federal lands. Two key \nfeatures of this formula are that the fee approximates the value of the \nforage from the gain in production value, and that it provides a fair \nreturn to the Federal Government for that forage. [[Page S7501]] \n  Mr. President, this formula is simple. As I explained earlier, the \ncurrent fee is convoluted. Establishing the grazing fee as a percentage \nof return will assure that livestock ranchers are assessed on the same \nbasis of many other public lands users.se\n  As you may know, forage has no readily identifiable market value \nuntil it is converted into beef, wool, mutton, or some other salable \nanimal product. Federal lands ranchers will--and have--willingly pay \nfor the opportunity to utilize this forage on Federal lands to attain a \ngross value of livestock grazing on those lands. The Gross Return Fee \nrecognizes the value of the end product by establishing the grazing fee \nas a percentage of this value.\n  The Gross Return Fee is critical to the continued viability of the \nwestern livestock industry. Ranchers are the family farmers of the \nWest. The establishment of a fair and equitable grazing fee formula is \ncritical to their survival.\n  Additionally, the rancher is key to the rural western economy. Every \ndollar a rancher spends yields an estimated $5 in economic activity \nthroughout the West. This economic activity is critical to social \nfabric west, old or new.\n  In closing, Mr. President, the fee is only one component of this \nlegislation. The other aspects of this bill will be addressed by the \ncosponsors of this legislation. Furthermore, a companion measure is \ncurrently ready for introduction in the House of Representatives. This \nwill allow the Livestock Grazing Act of 1995 to be examined in full by \nboth bodies of Congress. I look forward to moving this legislation \nthrough both Houses of Congress and removing the cloud that has been \nhanging over the Federal lands rancher.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I along with 14 of my colleagues am \nintroducing the Livestock Grazing Act. This bill is intended to \nestablish the policy guidelines for grazing of livestock on Federal \nlands in the Western States.\n  This bill is needed to resolve the ongoing debate over rangeland \nreform and the establishment of fees. I strongly believe the Congress \nmust address this issue and resolve the ongoing debate over western \nrangeland management. We must assure that the extensive Federal lands \nin the West have a grazing policy that allows the families who depend \non these lands to continue to use these lands to make their \nlivelihoods.\n  We have crafted a bill that addresses the numerous issues that have \narisen on grazing on the public lands. This bill is a product of \nextensive discussions with members of the grazing and academic \ncommunity. It addresses both rangeland reform and the fee issue.\n  It is my intention to hold hearings in the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Subcommittee that I chair in the early summer and then to \npromptly move a bill. I am pleased that the other body has a similar \nschedule.\n  It is my intention to resolve this long-standing issue in a way that \nstrengthens the economic base of the rural ranching West. I will work \nwith my colleagues to assure that such a bill is passed into law.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the introduction of \nthe livestock grazing bill offered by Senator Domenici, myself, and \nothers. This is a bill that will allow us to set the stage for the \nfuture grazing and land use access of the livestock industry. This is \nextremely important in the West, and in particular my State of Montana. \nThis is a bill that will provide security and stability to the \nlivestock producers--those people who live, and work 365 days a year, \non or near the public lands.\n  For years there has been debate on the purpose and scope of the \nintent of the language that a grazing bill would offer. Many people \nhave attempted to make this a single issue bill. This attempt may be \nthe case, to those who, do nothing more than depend upon the farmer and \nrancher for the food and fiber they enjoy in their daily lives. But to \nthe rancher, or anybody or any group this is the first step to creating \nsome sense of stability for them on public lands. For the rancher, this \nis the first step they have seen, that will provide them with the \nsecurity they need to operate their grazing permits with the sense of \npurpose and a future. The purpose of this bill is to provide a future \nfor those hard-working men and women that provide the best and least \nexpensive food supply to this Nation and the world.\n  Too many times the ability of these people to use the public lands \nhas been threatened by forces who neither care about the vitality and \nwell-being of the communities. People who have no idea of what the \nissue is. This is an issue of allowing producers and permit holders to \nuse the land. For it is in this use that the land is made healthy, that \nour country thrives, and the public is provided an opportunity to put \nback something into the land.\n  In the recent past in my State of Montana this land use has been \nthreatened by special interests. Interest groups with no understanding \nof what grazing and the livestock industry are all about. In a little \nknown area, called the Bitterroot Forest, history was made by the stand \nthat the permit holders made in defending their rights to use and graze \npublic lands. However, this action cost the Federal Government \nthousands of dollars and strained the relations between the land use \ngroups and the Government. All this action was brought on, due to the \nrequirements of the land managers to complete certain environmental \nrequirements. Requirements set forth under the provisions in the \nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n  This case was developed as a result of the failure of the Federal \nGovernment of complete NEPA compliance on permit holders allotments. As \na result, it threatened the ability of this particular group of \nranchers to work, to graze cattle, and provide for their families. The \npermit holders, in this example and many more like it, were held \nhostage to the whims and of the special interest groups and the Federal \ncourts. Held hostage by the very laws that were designed to protect \nthem and their way of living. I find it ironic that those permit \nholders suffered financial loss and mental anguish. They were the only \nones who did. All other interests including the Forest Service \npersonnel who were charged to do the required work, did not lose a pay \ncheck.\n  Under the language in this bill we have provided for the security of \nthe permit holders, and the health and future of the land. In this bill \nwe continue to use the land management plans as a way to protect the \nland, and at the same time give the permit holders an opportunity to \nhave access to the land for their use.\n  Mr. President, this bill is the first step to developing working \narrangements between the Government and the people on the land. It is \nan opportunity to have all parties working together to set the \nstandards for what is best for the land and the people of this country.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nLivestock Grazing Act introduced by my colleague and good friend, \nSenator Domenici. He and his staff--especially Marron Lee--have done an \noutstanding job leading the charge for responsible grazing fee reform. \nI commend them for working so doggedly to produce the best bill \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I say ``best bill possible'' because there cannot be a \nperfect bill. With the number of diverse interests represented \nthroughout our great American West, no legislation in this area will \nsatisfy everyone. But truly, the widespread support for this bill has \nbeen impressive.\n  Of course, I have heard some rumblings of discontent from those \nwishing to modify specific portions of this legislation. I ask those \nindividuals to work with us, to let us know your thoughts as this bill \nmoves through the committee process. We will do our best to attend to \nyour concerns. There are, however, certain things we must all bear in \nmind. First, this bill is by far better than the alternative of having \nno bill, and second, we must not turn this bill into a ``Christmas wish \nlist.'' Doing so could spell defeat for this legislation and, in turn, \nsubject our western livestock industry to an uncertain future.\n  I am most pleased by a number of provisions contained in this \nlegislation that will benefit the Wyoming ranching industry. I would \nlike to quickly address a few of these.\n  First, the bill will allow ranchers to own, in proportion to their \ninvestment in the overall cost, title to improvements located on \nFederal lands. This is far more fair than the administration's \nregulations requiring ranchers to pay for the improvement, while \ncedingownership with the Government. Mr. \n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\nPresident, that alternative is wrongly conceived. It amounts simply to \na form of tax on our ranchers, taking their scarce assets and \ntransferring them to the Federal Government.\n  We also address the critical issue of water rights. The Western \nStates are not blessed with the almost unlimited supply of water that \nour Eastern neighbors enjoy. Western water law was created to manage \nthis precious resource. Much of this law predates the birth of many of \nour Western States and works very well without the help of the Federal \nGovernment, thank you. This legislation directs Federal agencies to \nrespect established State water law.\n  This legislation, unlike the administration's regulations, will leave \ncertain aspects of rangeland management in the hands of those who have \nbeen responsible stewards of the public lands for over 100 years--the \npermittees, lessees, and landowners. Additionally, the new resource and \ngrazing advisory council structure will allow other interests \nrepresenting recreation and the environment to be adequately \nrepresented in the management process.\n  Finally, this legislation addresses the ever-contentious fee issue. \nRecall that not too long ago, many in this distinguished body were \nconcerned that the ranching community was not paying a fair price for \nthe opportunity to graze livestock on the public lands. This \nlegislation will fairly increase that fee but keep it short of levels \nthat would quickly bankrupt many hard-working families.\n  Mr. President, our American ranching industry has been a unique way \nof life for well over 100 years. Through the enactment of responsible \nlegislation we can ensure that this industry, while still facing a \nnumber of significant challenges, will at least have a chance to remain \nviable well into the next century.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Americans rely on Federal lands for a \nwide variety of purposes. Among them is rangeland for livestock \ngrazing. As we look to the future use of these lands, it is incumbent \nupon us to implement commonsense policies that allow ranchers to graze \nlivestock on these public rangelands while managing them in a manner \nthat is consistent with long-term, sustainable use.\n  During the last 2 years, debate has raged over the appropriate \nregulation of Federal grazing lands. Environmentalists and those \nranchers who graze on private land have argued for a more realistic fee \nsystem, one that links the grazing fee to the private land lease rate. \nSome have advocated stronger stewardship requirements. Meanwhile, as \ngrazing policy remains unresolved, we have seen cattle prices drop and \ntoo many ranchers teetering on the edge of financial viability.\n  There needs to be some fair and reasonable ground upon which \nagreement can be reached that ensures public confidence in the \nmanagement and use of the Federal lands, while allowing ranchers the \ncertainty that, by working hard and playing by the rules, the Federal \nlands will provide an opportunity to earn a decent living. In short, \nthe time has come to conclude this long debate and establish realistic \ngrazing standards once and for all.\n  Secretary Babbit's Rangeland Reform proposals have called attention \nto this important issue and, at the same time, generated considerable \ncontroversy. While an open discussion of grazing reform is needed, a \nrising tide of misunderstanding and distrust has hampered the \ndevelopment of a broadly supportable solution.\n  Today, Senator Domenici is introducing the Livestock Grazing Act, \nwhich is intended to provide much needed closure to this debate as well \nas certainty for the many ranchers who rely on the Federal lands for \ngrazing. I commend Senator Domenici for investing the hard work and \nenergy in meeting with the ranching community and fashioning a bill \nthat enjoys their support. His bill represents an essential step in \nmoving grazing reform to closure.\n  I support much of the Domenici bill. It provides a valuable framework \nfor addressing the critical issues of the fee, range management, and \noversight, and, ultimately, I expect it to provide the foundation for \nthe development of a balanced and reasonable approach to stewardship \nthat addresses legitimate concerns of all interested groups.\n  For example, I call attention to the provision in the bill that \nestablishes separate management of the national grasslands under the \nDepartment of Agriculture. This initiative will help ensure that \nmanagement of those lands is as sensitive as possible to the unique \nneeds of ranchers.\n  Currently, grasslands are subjected to rules and procedures that make \nsense for large expanses of national forests but not necessarily for \ngrazing. In South Dakota, most ranchers who graze cattle on Federal \nlands do so on Forest Service lands. Ranchers in my home State feel a \nseparate management unit for grasslands will allow them to ranch \nbetter. This legislation will accomplish that important objective.\n  Congress' challenge is to strike a balance between the recognition of \nregional environmental differences and the need to ensure a basic level \nof environmental protection. It is to reform the grazing fee, without \nputting an untenable financial squeeze on hard-working ranchers. And it \nis to strike a balance between the desire to provide an opportunity for \ninput into range management decisions from the general public and the \nrecognition that these decision have special ramifications for the \neconomic security of those using the land.\n  We have not yet achieved that balance. But I am optimistic that we \ncan, and I will devote my energies to working with Senator Domenici and \nothers toward that goal.\n  This is one of the reasons I have invited Secretary of Agriculture \nDan Glickman to visit with South Dakota ranchers next week in Rapid \nCity. I want Secretary Glickman to hear first hand how those whose \nlivelihoods are affected by Federal land management policies feel about \nthe grazing issue. Their experience must be part of the solution sought \nin this debate.\n  Senator Domenici has expressed a desire to move grazing reform \nlegislation with bipartisan support. While some initial concern has \nbeen raised that the Livestock Grazing Act, as currently drafted, may \nnot yet achieve the balance needed to ensure consideration of all \nlegitimate interests in the management of the range, he has given \nCongress a solid place to start. I hope that, in the weeks to come, any \ncontentious issues can be worked out to the mutual satisfaction of all \ninterested parties, and that we can move to enact legislation with \nbroad-based support.\n  My goal is to pass Federal grazing reform. I am confident this \nCongress can achieve that goal.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nlegislation introduced by Senator Domenici, the Livestock Grazing Act. \nThis bill is a reasonable proposal that will allow livestock producers \nin the West to continue to operate on public lands and will protect the \npublic range for multiple-use purposes.\n  Today, western livestock producers are encountering many challenges. \nIn addition to struggling because of low market prices for many \nproducts and fighting losses from predators, livestock producers in the \nWest are now faced with regulations proposed by Interior Secretary \nBruce Babbitt that will put them out of business. Secretary Babbitt's \nso-called ``Rangeland Reform '94'' proposal to reform public land \ngrazing practices is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to end \nlivestock grazing on these areas.\n  The people of Wyoming and the West rely on having access to public \nlands for their livelihood. Over the last 100 years, this process has \nworked well. Westerners were able to use these lands for multiple uses \nsuch as grazing, oil and gas exploration, and recreation and in turn \nprovided the rest of the Nation with high quality food products and \nother commodities. Unfortunately, the Department of the Interior has \nnow taken a number of actions that will destroy the concept of multiple \nuse of public lands and will cost jobs and harm local economies across \nWyoming and the West.\n  The Livestock Grazing Act is designed to reverse this disturbing \ntrend. This legislation will provide western livestock producers with a \nlifeline to survive the Clinton administration's efforts to destroy \ntheir way of life. The measure is a reasonable attempt to solve the \nlong-standing dispute over grazing fees on public lands and many other \nissues which have caused great discontent in Congress and across the \ncountry. [[Page S7503]] \n  Let me focus on a few provisions in the bill which are particularly \nimportant to the people of my State. First, the legislation establishes \na grazing fee formula that will be tied to market values. This is a \nfair and equitable approach to resolving the fee formula dispute and \nwill end the unfair comparison between private and public fee rates on \nFederal lands.\n  Second, the legislation will provide permittees with the assurance \nthat they will be allowed to graze a certain number of livestock on \ntheir allotment. For over 50 years, BLM grazing permittees have known \nthey had a priority position for a specific number of Federal animal \nunit months [AUM's] on their allotments. These so-called preference \nlevels are attached to the private lands of the lessee and influence \nthe value of the privately owned base property. Preference levels are \nparticularly important to folks in my State where there is a large \namount of checkerboard land, which is commingled Federal and private \nproperty.\n  Unfortunately, Secretary Babbitt's ``Rangeland Reform '94'' proposal \nattempts to radically revised the concept of grazing preference by \ngiving Federal agents the authority to determine the appropriate number \nof AUM's attached to a lease. The Secretary wants to set AUM's for \npermittees on an arbitrary basis at the whim of the local Federal \nofficials. This would cause instability throughout western livestock \ncommunities and threaten the economic value of western family ranches. \nThe Livestock Grazing Act would stop the Secretary's misguided efforts \nby codifying the concept of grazing preference and giving western \nranchers the surety they need to continue operating on Federal lands.\n  Mr. President, these are just two examples of the important actions \ntaken by Senator Domenici in this bill that support western livestock \nproducers. The time has come for Congress to assert itself regarding \nthe issue of grazing on public lands in the West and stop Secretary \nBabbitt's unending assault on western communities and our western way \nof life. Although the Clinton administration and Secretary Babbitt \nwould like folks to believe ranchers in the West are simply welfare \ncowboys, nothing could be further from the truth. These people are not \ntaking advantage of the Government, but simply trying to make a \nreasonable living and raise their families.\n  I strongly support the Livestock Grazing Act and hope that we can \ntake quick action on this measure in order to allow western livestock \nproducers to continue their important work.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the sponsor of this bill, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, has made a sincere attempt to draft a good management plan \nfor our western public lands, and I have agreed to cosponsor it.\n  Although I want to see changes in several areas of this bill, overall \nit is a good plan for responsible management of our huge public trust \nin the West, imposing reasonable rules for the grazing of livestock and \nrangeland improvement while safeguarding the natural environment.\n  Senator Domenici has indicated his intent to work with Senators of \nboth parties toward a consensus on this legislation. I appreciate his \nflexibility, but I particularly appreciate the Senator's addition to \nhis bill of title II, provisions I and others from the Northern Plains \nhave submitted dealing specifically with the national grasslands.\n  In fact, the Grasslands provisions are the primary reason that I am \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  Let me explain. Except for the grasslands provisions, this bill deals \nexclusively with lands supervised by the Department of the Interior. In \nNorth Dakota, however, land managed by Interior amounts to about two \ntownships out of a State of 46 million acres. On the other land, North \nDakota is host to 1.2 million acres of the national grasslands, which \nare managed by the U.S. Forest Service of USDA.\n  The main purpose of the grasslands provisions is to give the \nSecretary of Agriculture more flexibility in shaping the administration \nof the Grasslands.\n  I have worked with the ranchers in North Dakota and with the Forest \nService in recent years, searching for ways the Secretary of \nAgriculture and the Forest Service could reorder the bureaucratic \nframework under which the Grasslands are managed. The Forest Service \nhas been cooperative in that search, but I finally had to conclude that \nthe Forest Service and USDA are legally prevented from the kind of \nchange I believe is needed.\n  In the 1970's the grasslands were joined by statute to the entire \nNational Forest System, managed by the Forest Service. That means the \ngrasslands are enmeshed in the mounds and reams of paper that prescribe \nthe layers of procedure, planning, management, and so forth, for the \nnational forests.\n  Let me note here that land ownership in the grasslands areas of my \nstate is much different than what you find among most of the great \nexpanses of Federal lands in the West.\n  Most of the grasslands were owned earlier in this century by private \nfarmers and ranchers, but were abandoned or lost to debt, and taken \nover by the Federal Government. Today this is not a region of big \nranches. It is an area of small, and mid-sized ranchers where land \nownership is extensively interspersed among individual families, the \nForest Service, the State of North Dakota, and the Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n  The proper approach in management of such rangeland, it seems to me, \nmust be a cooperative venture between the ranchers and the Forest \nService, drawing upon the best expertise of range scientists, wildlife \nspecialists, and others who can help maintain and improve conditions in \nthe grasslands.\n  The main focus of such a cooperative venture must be how to best \nmanage and nurture the grasslands so they remain healthy and productive \nfor the benefit of future generations of people and wildlife.\n  Somehow, that focus is lost in the reams of Forest System rules and \nregulations and planning documents that are supposed to address the \ngrasslands. In reading those documents you would hardly know that there \nare cows on the grasslands when, in fact, ranching is the main human \nactivity there by a long shot.\n  So, the grasslands provisions of this bill give the Secretary \nimportant latitude in changing the administrative structure under which \nthe grasslands are managed. The provisions essentially restate the \nintent of the 1937 Federal act that set aside the grasslands: A call \nfor conscientious range management that would build and preserve a \nhealthy grassland resource.\n  And, where soil conservation and general range health are considered, \ntitle II also tries to return grasslands management to a more \ncooperative venture between the Forest Service and our State-chartered \ngrazing associations.\n  The grasslands provisions do not dictate a specific administrative \nstructure the Secretary must adopt for the grasslands. So, to a large \nextent, those provisions of the bill speak mostly to what can happen \nfor the grasslands under a new design of Forest Service management, and \ndo not say specifically what must happen.\n  The grasslands provisions will, I believe, help harvest the expertise \nand enthusiasm of grasslands area residents, including ranchers, for \nbetter local input into managing this critical natural area in my \nState.\n  The provisions are certainly not a step back from responsible \nmanagement and protection of the natural resources. All Federal \nenvironmental laws, including the National Environmental Protection \nAct, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, still apply. If anything, \nthe grasslands provisions will encourage better attention to the spirit \nof our environmental laws because more people who live in the \ngrasslands region, particularly those with expertise in areas of \nconservation and grassland agriculture, will be participating in how \nthe lands are managed.\n  This is the kind of approach to public lands management that the \npeople of North Dakota want. I should note that the 1995 North Dakota \nLegislature unanimously recommended the change we have proposed in the \ngrasslands law.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to print the proposed grassland \nprovisions here in the Record as a means of distributing them for \ncomment and discussion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record; as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\n                          TITLE II--GRASSLANDS\n\n     SEC. 201 REMOVAL OF GRASSLANDS FROM NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the inclusion of the \n     national grasslands (and land utilization projects \n     administered under Title III of the Bankhead Jones Farm \n     Tenant Act) within the Forest System contrains the Secretary \n     in managing the national grasslands as intended under the \n     Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act.\n       (b) Amendment of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act of 1974.--Section 11(a) of the Forest \n     and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1609(a)) is amended in the second sentence by striking \n     ``the national grasslands and land utilization projects \n     administered under Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm \n     Tenant Act (50 Stat. 525, 7 U.S.C. 1010-1012)''.\n       (c) Amendment of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act.--\n     Section 31 of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1010) is amended by designating current Sec. 31 as subsection \n     (a) to read as follows:\n       Sec. 1010. Land conservation and land utilization\n       To accomplish the purposes stated in the preamble of this \n     act, the Secretary is authorized and directed to develop a \n     program of land conservation and utilization as a basis for \n     grassland agriculture, to promote secure occupancy and \n     economic stability of farms, and thus assist in controlling \n     soil erosion, preserving natural resources, protecting fish \n     and wildlife, developing and protecting recreational \n     facilities, mitigating flood damages, preventing impairment \n     of dams and reservoirs, developing energy resources, \n     protecting the watersheds of navigable streams, conserving \n     surface and subsurface moisture, and protecting the public \n     lands, health, safety, and welfare, but is not authorized to \n     build industrial parks or establish private industrial or \n     commercial enterprises. The Secretary, in cooperation and \n     partnership with grazing associations, is authorized and \n     directed to issue renewable livestock grazing leases to \n     achieve the land conservation and utilization goals of this \n     section.\n       And adding a new subsection (b) as follows:\n       National Grasslands Fee Adjustments for Conservation \n     Practices to be Retained as Implemented by the Secretary.--A \n     reduction in grazing fees for national grasslands will be \n     allowed for conservation practices and administrative duties \n     performed by grazing associations.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Stevens, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Craig, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Packwood, \n        and Mr. Hatfield):\n  S. 853. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to divide the \nninth judicial circuit of the United States into two circuits, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     the ninth circuit court of appeals reorganization act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my purpose today is to introduce the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1995, which is similar \nto measures I introduced in 1983, 1989, and 1991. This measure has the \ncosponsorship of Senators Burns, Murkowski, Stevens, Kempthorne, Craig, \nBaucus, Packwood, and Hatfield, who represent all the States forming \nthe new proposed circuit. This proposal will divide the ninth circuit, \nthe largest circuit in the country, into two separate circuits of more \nmanageable size and responsibility. This division would leave the ninth \ncircuit composed of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Guam, and the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, and would create a new twelfth circuit \ncomposed of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. Personally, \nI believe that the ninth circuit should be divided into three new \ncircuits, but the composition for the two southern circuits should be \ndetermined by the elected representatives of those States, to whose \njudgment I will defer.\n  Today the ninth circuit is by far the largest of the thirteen \njudicial circuits, measured both by number of judges and by caseload. \nIt has 28 active judges, 11 more than any other. Last year it had an \nastounding 8,092 new filings, almost 2,000 more than the next busiest \ncircuit. It serves over 45 million people, almost 60 percent more than \nare served by the next largest circuit. Moreover, the population in the \nStates and territories that comprise the ninth circuit is the fastest-\ngrowing in the Nation.\n  Mr. President, the deplorable consequence of the massive size of this \ncircuit is a marked decrease in the consistency of justice provided by \nninth circuit courts. Judges are unable to keep abreast of legal \ndevelopments even within their own jurisdiction--to say nothing of lay \ncitizens' inability to keep abreast. The large number of judges \nscattered over a large area inevitably results in difficulty in \nreaching consistent circuit decisions. These judges have nearly \nunmanageable caseloads with little time to review the voluminous case \nlaw within the jurisdiction or to consult with their fellow circuit \ncolleagues. As a result, legal opinions tend to be very narrow with \nlittle precedential value, merely exacerbating the problem. As a former \nattorney general for the State of Washington, I personally have \nexperienced the unique frustrations and difficulties of practicing \nbefore the ninth circuit.\n  Compounding the problem for the Northwest is that 55 percent of the \ncase filings in the ninth circuit are from California alone. \nConsequently, the remaining States in the ninth circuit, including my \nState of Washington and our Northwest neighbors, are dominated by \nCalifornia judges and California judicial philosophy. That trend cannot \nhelp but persist as the number of cases filed by California's litigious \nand exploding population continues to rise. The Northwestern States \nconfront issues that are fundamentally unique to that region, issues \nthat are central to the lives of citizens in the Northwest, but which \nare little more than one of many newspaper articles in California. In \nsum, the interests of the Northwest cannot be fully appreciated or \naddressed from a California perspective.\n  This initiative, Mr. President, is long overdue. As early as 1973, \nthe Congressional Commission on the Revision of the Federal Court \nAppellate System recommended that the ninth circuit be divided. In \naddition, the U.S. Judicial Conference found that increasing the number \nof judges in any circuit court beyond 15 would create an unworkable \nsituation. The American Bar Association also adopted a resolution \nexpressing the desirability of dividing the ninth circuit to help \nrealign the U.S. appellate courts. Earlier bills on the ninth circuit \nreorganization that I introduced during the 101st and 102d Congresses--\nand which were virtually identical to this bill--earned the support of \npractitioners and judges in the ninth circuit, attorneys general of the\n western States, the Department of Justice, and the former Chief \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Warren E. Burger.\n\n  The leadership of the ninth circuit has not donned blinders to the \ndifficulties inherent in a circuit court of this size and workload. It \nhas responded, however, by adopting a number of innovative but \nultimately ineffectual approaches to these problems. For example the \nninth circuit has divided itself into three administrative divisions: \nthe northern unit consists of the five Northwestern States that would \ncomprise the proposed twelfth circuit, and the combined middle and \nsouthern units is identical to the restructured ninth circuit. This \nmethod, however, does little more than recognize the problem without \nsolving it.\n  Another innovation of the ninth circuit is the limited en banc court, \nfor which a panel of 11 of the 28 judges will be chosen by lot to hear \nan individual case. Such panels, however, further contribute to the \ninherent unpredictability of a jurisdiction as large as the ninth \ncircuit. Lawyers often must tell their clients that they cannot begin \nto predict the likely outcome of an appeal until the panel has been \nidentified. Mr. President, justice should not be determined by lot. \nMoreover, I have serious reservations about any method which would \npermit a small minority--as few as six of the sitting judges--to \ndictate the outcome of a case contrary to the judgment of a large \nmajority, solely depending on the luck of the draw.\n  Despite these attempts to solve the problem, the performance of the \nninth circuit has gotten worse, not better. Its judges are falling \nfurther and further behind. Despite only a moderate increase in new \nfilings for appeal, the number of pending cases swelled by almost 20 \npercent in the last year. The ninth circuit now is the slowest of 12 \nregional circuits in hearing and deciding appeals, on average taking a \nfull 16 months. Mr. President, justice delayed is justice denied.\n  The 45 million residents within the ninth circuit continue to pay the \nhigh costs of an unpredictable body of case law and an overburdened \ncourt system. They wait years before cases are heard and decided, \nprompting many to forego their rights to judicial redress. Residents in \nthe Northwest, in particular, [[Page S7505]] are concerned about the \ngrowing inability of the ninth circuit to handle the boom in criminal \ncases stemming from stepped-up enforcement of our drug laws.\n  The swift and sure administration of justice is a right that should \nno longer be compromised in the ninth circuit. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the complete text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall become \n     effective on October 1, 1995.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, as an original cosponsor of the legislation \nto split the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and create a new 12th \nCircuit. This legislation is long overdue in my opinion. It is my hope \nthat we can act to create a new 12th circuit court this Congress.\n  The ninth circuit court is by far the largest of all the circuit \ncourts, both in terms of the number of judges and caseload. In fact, \nthe Judicial Conference of the United States stated in 1971 that ``to \nincrease the number of judges in a circuit beyond 15 would create an \nunworkable situation.''\n  The ninth circuit court currently has 28 judges. That is nearly twice \nthe maximum workable number in the opinion of the Judicial Conference, \n12 more than the next largest circuit court and 16 more than the \naverage circuit court.\n  In terms of caseload, the 9th circuit had 7,597 appeals pending at \nthe end of fiscal year 1993. In 1988 when I was first elected to the \nU.S. Senate, there were 6,342 appeals pending. That is an increase of \nnearly 20 percent in just 5 years.\n  No other circuit court carries a heavier caseload. In fact, no other \ncircuit even comes close. Each year, the ninth circuit has \napproximately twice as many appeals pending as the next largest \ncircuit. It only makes sense that a Federal appeals court with a \ncaseload that heavy should be split up.\n  The prospect for relief is not promising, either. In fact, the \nCommittee on Long Range Planning for the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States has projected that by the year 2000, over 15,000 \npetitions and appeals will be filed annually. and by the year 2020, \nover 60,000 will be filed annually.\n  What does all this mean in terms of our judicial process? It means \nthat a case is pending in the ninth circuit for an average of 14\\1/2\\ \nmonths. That means some cases may be there 29 months while others whiz \nthrough in 7 or 8 months. The costs to those in Montana or Washington \nwho are victims of this backlog continues to accrue. Not only are they \ncontinuing to pay their legal counsel during that time, but in the case \nof suits against economic activities such as timbering, mining, and \nwater developments, employment is jeopardized, seriously threatening \nlocal economic stability.\n  It is also disturbing to me to see convicted murderers bringing \nlawsuits against the State claiming cruel and unusual punishment \nbecause they've been sitting on death row for a number of years. What \nis cruel and usual punishment is that families of victims have to wait \nsuch a long time to see justice finally carried out.\n  One such Montana family is State Senator Ethel Harding of Polson. \nSenator Harding's daughter, Lana, was brutally murdered by Duncan \nMcKenzie over 20 years ago. It was not until 2 weeks ago that McKenzie \nwas finally put to death and the Harding family could finally put this \nhorrendous chapter of their lives behind them.\n  McKenzie's appeals ended up at the 9th Circuit 3 times over this 20 \nyear period. Certainly part of the delay of justice may be attributed \nto the heavy caseload of the circuit and the inefficient system that \nthe burdensome caseload has created. [[Page S7506]] \n  Senator Harding has written a very moving letter to me and I would \nask that it be submitted into the record in its entirety immediately \nfollowing my remarks. ``Justice delayed is justice denied,'' writes \nSenator Harding, and I could not agree more.\n  As a result of her own ordeal, Senator Harding has been a strong \nadvocate of splitting the Ninth Circuit. During the 1995 Montana State \nLegislature, she introduced Senate Joint Resolution No. 10, calling \nupon Congress to divide the Ninth Circuit court. The resolution passed \noverwhelmingly and is an accurate reflection on the wishes of \nMontanans.\n  Perhaps the most compelling argument for splitting the Ninth Circuit \nis precedent. The division of the 8th Circuit creating the 10th Circuit \ntook place in 1929. In addition, the Fifth Circuit was also divided in \n1981, creating the 11th Circuit. In fact, a commission which studied \nthe revision of the Federal appellate court system recommended in 1973 \nthat both the Fifth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit courts be split.\n  Those involved with the Fifth Circuit had the sense to make the \ndivision. Unfortunately, the division of the Ninth Circuit has been \nheld up to be political maneuvering. So now we have to be here arguing \nfor something that should have been done 14 years ago.\n  Granted, the division of the Ninth Circuit is more complicated since \none State, California, generates a majority of the cases in that \ncircuit. However, I think it is in the best interest of California, \nMontana, and the other States under the court's jurisdiction to make \nthe split. The caseload for the Ninth Circuit will remain high no \nmatter what, due to the population dynamics in a State like California. \nThus, the split will bring much needed caseload relief to the Ninth \nCircuit while providing overall relief to States like my own Montana.\n  I just do not think it is fair, or in the best interest of the \njudicial process, that Montana businesses and individual citizens \nsuffer because California continues to experience an economic and \npopulation boom. I find myself arguing this case everyday--the case of \nmiddle America battling to hold its own against the population centers \non both coasts. There is a bias in the legislative branch, the \nexecutive branch, and now in the judicial branch.\n  I am here to see that States like Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, \nand Alaska get a fair shake. I think that splitting the Ninth Circuit \nis a good place to start and I intend to see that it happens. Until it \ndoes, it is my intention to prevent any future nominations to the Ninth \nCircuit court of Appeals from going through the Senate for it makes no \nsense to continue to perpetuate a system that is not working.\n  I hope that my colleagues from all nine States currently under the \njurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit court will join us in our efforts to \nquickly pass this legislation so that we can put justice back into our \njudicial system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The Big Sky Country,\n\n                                                     May 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: I am enclosing a copy of Senate Joint \n     Resolution No. 10 which passed in the 1995 session in \n     Montana. I am also enclosing a copy of the 9th judicial \n     circuit map and workload for your perusal.\n       The 9th Circuit covers nine states and two territories, \n     totaling approximately 14 million square miles; serves a \n     population of almost 44 million people 15 million more than \n     the next largest circuit court and about 20 million more than \n     all other courts of appeals; has 28 judges, 12 more than the \n     next largest circuit court and 16 more than the average \n     circuit court; and has a caseload of more than 6,000 appeals, \n     2,000 larger than the next largest court of appeals and \n     nearly one- sixth of the total appeals in all the 12 regional \n     courts of appeals; and projections are, that at the current \n     rate of growth, the 9th Circuit's 1980 docket of cases will \n     double before the year 2000.\n       The enclosed statistics on U.S. Court of Appeals--Judicial \n     work load profile shows Montana is last or 12th in numerical \n     standing from filing Notice of Appeal to Disposition. That is \n     top long. Montana deserves better than that. We should not \n     have to wait until California or any other state is served in \n     in the judicial process but at least we should not have to be \n     considered last. If the Circuit is divided and we were last \n     it could at least cut the time in half.\n       I am also enclosing a copy of the History of Appeals in the \n     McKenzie case which has haunted me personally for 20 years \n     because he killed my daughter on January 21, 1974. It is for \n     this reason I sponsored SJR 10 and why I am urging you to \n     work in behalf of Montana having a quicker response and turn \n     around on these criminal appeals. The families of victims \n     should not have to suffer 20 years while the system works. \n     ``JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED''.\n       I am enclosing an excerpt from ``Rationing Justice on \n     Appeal'' by Thomas E. Baker, Justice Research Institute which \n     clearly presents the problem and urges Congress to do \n     something about it besides study. I also urge Congress to act \n     now and to prevent the misuse of the judicial system as my \n     family has personally experienced for twenty years.\n       Thank you, Senator Burns, for your help in this most \n     important matter of dividing the 9th Circuit to a better \n     advantage for Montana and the other smaller populated states \n     and territories in the 9th circuit.\n       I will be anxiously watching for a good report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Ethel M.

and\n       Whereas, in 1988, the 100th Congress created the Federal \n     Courts Study Committee as an ad hoc committee within the \n     Judicial Conference of the United States to examine the \n     problems facing the federal courts and to develop a long-term \n     plan for the Judiciary; and\n       Whereas, the Study Committee found that the federal \n     appellate courts are faced with a crisis of volume that will \n     continue into the future and that the structure of these \n     courts will require some fundamental changes; and\n       Whereas, the Study Committee did not endorse any one \n     solution but served only to draw attention to the serious \n     problems of the courts of appeals; and\n       Whereas, the Study Committee recommended that fundamental \n     structural alternatives deserve the careful attention of \n     Congress and of the courts, bar associations, and scholars \n     over the next 5 years; and\n       Whereas, the problems of the circuit court system and the \n     alternatives for revising the system represent a policy \n     choice that requires Congress to weigh costs and benefits and \n     to seek the solution that best serves the judicial needs of \n     the nation; and\n       Whereas, there are 13 judicial circuits of the United \n     States courts of appeals; and\n       Whereas, Montana is in the Ninth Circuit, which consists of \n     Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, \n     Oregon, Washington, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 1990, it was estimated that the Ninth Circuit: \n     covers nine states and two territories, totaling \n     approximately 14 million square miles; serves a population of \n     almost 44 million people, 15 million more than the next \n     largest circuit court and about 20 million more than all \n     other courts of appeals; has 28 judges, 12 more than the next \n     largest circuit court and 16 more than the average circuit \n     court; and has a caseload of more than 6,000 appeals, 2,000 \n     larger than the next largest court of appeals and nearly one-\n     sixth of the total appeals in all the 12 regional courts of \n     appeals; and\n       Whereas, projections are that at the current rate of \n     growth, the Ninth Circuit's 1980 docket of cases will double \n     before the year 2000; and\n       Whereas, statistics reveal that, because of the number of \n     judges in the Ninth Circuit, there are numerous opportunities \n     for conflicting holdings--one legal scholar has estimated \n     that on a 28-judge court there are over 3,000 combinations of \n     panels that may decide an issue, without counting senior \n     judges, district judges, and judges sitting by designation; \n     and\n       Whereas, legal scholars have suggested that because the \n     United States Supreme Court reviews less than 1% of appellate \n     decisions, the concept of regional state decisis, or \n     adherence to decided cases, results, in effect, in each court \n     of appeals becoming a junior supreme court with final \n     decision power over all issues of federal law in each circuit \n     (unless and until reviewed by the Supreme Court); and\n       Whereas, the Ninth Circuit has been described as an \n     experiment in judicial administration and a laboratory in \n     which to test whether the values of a large circuit can be \n     preserved; and\n       Whereas, some legal scholars have opposed its division on \n     the grounds that to divide the Ninth Circuit would be to lose \n     the benefit of an experiment in judicial administration that \n     has not yet run its course; and\n       Whereas, the problems of the Ninth Circuit are immediate \n     and growing and maintaining the court in its present state is \n     a disservice to the citizens of Montana and other Ninth \n     Circuit states and territories; and\n       Whereas, it is generally understood that an essential \n     element of a federal appellate system must include \n     guaranteeing regionalized and decentralized review when \n     regional concerns are strongest; and\n       Whereas, because of the problems of the Ninth Circuit \n     related to its dimensions of geography, population, \n     judgeships, docket, and [[Page S7507]] costs, it is desirable \n     for the Northwest states to be placed in a separate circuit, \n     consisting mainly of contiguous states which common \n     interests; and\n       Whereas, the existing circuit boundary lines have been \n     called arbitrary products of history; and\n       Whereas, Congress at least twice divided circuits: in 1929, \n     to separate the new Tenth Circuit from the Eighth Circuit, \n     and in 1981, to separate the new Eleventh Circuit from the \n     Fifth Circuit; and\n       Whereas, Congress, in 1989, considered and is expected, in \n     1995, to again consider a bill to divide the Ninth Judicial \n     Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals into two \n     circuits--a new Ninth Circuit, composed of Arizona, \n     California, and Nevada, and a new Twelfth Circuit, composed \n     of Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Guam, \n     and the Northern Mariana Islands; and\n       Whereas, it is the proper function of Congress to determine \n     circuit boundaries and it is desirable that Montana be \n     included in a regional circuit that will allow relief for its \n     citizens from the problems occasioned by its inclusion in the \n     present Ninth Circuit: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana:\n       That the Legislature of the State of Montana urge Congress \n     to turn its thoughtful attention to the passage of \n     legislation that will split the existing Ninth Judicial \n     Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals into two \n     circuits and that will include Montana in a circuit composed \n     in large part of other Northwest states with similar regional \n     interests.\n       Be it further resolved, that the President of the United \n     States be urged to place a Montana judge on the Federal \n     Circuit court for Montana.\n       Be it further resolved, that Congress grant this relief and \n     pass this legislation immediately, regardless of \n     considerations of long-term changes to the appellate system \n     in general.\n       Be it further resolved, that the Secretary of State send \n     copies of this resolution to the Secretary of the United \n     States Senate, the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States, and the \n     members of Montana's Congressional Delegation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 854. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to improve the \nagricultural resources conservation program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n          the agricultural resources conservation act of 1995\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the \nAgricultural Resources Conservation Act of 1995. In this bill, Senator \nLeahy and I have developed the boldest concepts for protecting our \nagricultural resource base and the environment since the 1985 farm \nbill.\n  This legislation is based on simple but pivotal principles:\n  First, we need to preserve stable funding to help farmers and \nranchers meet environmental challenges.\n  Second, the initiatives must be voluntary for producers and simple \nfor them to participate in.\n  Third, we must maximize the environmental benefits produced by each \nfederal dollar expended.\n  Fourth, conservation programs must be consistent with a more market-\noriented farm economy. Specifically, we prefer land management options \nover land retirement. And within our land retirement initiative, the \nConservation Reserve Program, we want to stress more tactical partial-\nfield enrollments.\n  Fifth, we need to address the breadth of contemporary environmental \nchallenges--such as water quality--in addition to soil erosion.\n  Our bill advances each of these principles. It will be the foundation \nof the conservation title of the 1995 farm bill.\n  Let me address some specifics, beginning with the question of \nfunding. Our bill calls for substantial, stable funding for \nconservation programs into the next century. We take the current \nfunding levels for the Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetlands \nReserve Program and the various conservation incentive and cost-share \ninitiatives--about $2.1 billion--and extend it annually through 2005. \nWe also would make these programs mandatory in a budget sense and fund \nthem through the Commodity Credit Corporation with strict annual caps. \nTo ensure budget neutrality, we make offsetting reductions in \ndiscretionary accounts.\n  Maintaining the conservation fund throughout the next 10 years will \nrequire a shift in budget priorities. My preference is to preserve \nconservation assistance while reducing costs of crop subsidy programs \nin order to meet our deficit reduction requirement.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program has been successful and this bill \nwould continue and improve it over the next 10 years. We allocate the \nentire Congressional Budget Office baseline,\n which declines from the current level of $1.8 to $1.2 billion in 2000, \nfor the CRP.\n\n  Successful as it is, the CRP has several shortcomings. Too much land \nthat can be farmed without harming the environment is currently idled. \nAnnual payments too often exceed local rental rates. And the CRP can be \nutilized much more fully to improve water quality. Our bill corrects \nthese weaknesses.\n  We direct the Secretary of Agriculture to enroll at least 4 million \nacres of land--primarily buffer strips along permanent water bodies and \nintermittent streams--for water quality purposes. We target only the \nmost highly erodible land that cannot be farmed profitably using \nnecessary management practices and is not eligible for incentive or \ncost-share assistance. And we impose new discipline on rental rates.\n  Much has been made of the significant wildlife benefits of the CRP. \nWhile the CBO baseline and our stricter enrollment standards points to \na small CRP in the future, I believe our bill will result in a program \nthat, acre for acre, is actually more beneficial for wildlife. Among \nequivalent eligible offers to enroll land under the soil erosion and \nwater quality criteria, preference will be given to offers that give \ngreater wildlife benefits. And all CRP contract holders will receive \nguidance on management methods to promote beneficial stands of cover.\n  I mentioned earlier that our conservation strategies must stress land \nmanagement as opposed to land retirement. This legislation takes the \nbest of our existing cost-share and incentive programs and combines \nthem into a new, strengthened effort: The Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, or EQIP. This will streamline the process for \nfarmers and ranchers to apply for assistance. It will eliminate \noverlaps between our current hodgepodge of assistance programs. And by \nmaking EQIP a mandatory budget initiative, it will end the year-to-year \nuncertainly that producers must face under the current discretionary \nfunding process.\n  The EQIP Program will also offer new incentives to livestock \nproducers. Currently, less than a quarter of our conservation spending \ngoes for livestock, even though there is a high correlation between \nagriculturally sourced water quality impairments and livestock \noperations. A 1993 report of the Environmental Protection Agency's \nFeedlot Workgroup indicates that feedlots are a more significant source \nof river impairments than storm sewers or industrial sources. Under \nEQIP, assistance for both crop and livestock producers would increase \nsignificantly and livestock would be eligible for half of the total \nfunding. This is sound environmental policy that benefits all of \nagriculture.\n  Let me list a few things we do not do in this bill. First, we create \nno new environmental mandates for farmers. It is very important that, \nas crop support levels decline, we not add any more compliance \nprovisions to the commodity programs. In fact, farmers and ranchers \nneed not participate in the programs to be eligible for our \nconservation programs.\n  In addition, we do not permit any new economic use of Conservation \nReserve Program lands. We can enroll all the land that truly deserves \nto be in the CRP with the budget baseline we have. As a result, we can \navoid adverse effects to the cattle and forage industries that might \nresult from expanded haying and grazing of CRP acres.\n  Finally, this initial proposal does not make changes to our current \nwetland compliance provisions. Although Senator Leahy and I were able \nto agree on an overwhelming majority of conservation issues, we were \nunable to reach consensus on this front. I am fully aware of the \ncontroversy surrounding the swampbuster program and I recognize the \nneed to improve it. I am committed to working with members of the \nAgriculture Committee to make wetlands regulation less burdensome. We \nmust make swampbuster a fair and flexible program that can be described \nthe same way as conservation compliance: A program that works and is \nsupported by farmers. [[Page S7508]] \n  Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this bill today. It makes \nwinners of both agriculture and the environment. I hope all Senators \nwill agree that it builds on the substantial conservation gains made by \nfarmers and ranchers in the last decade and helps them answer the \nenvironmental challenges of the new millennium.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Subtitle D--Agricultural Resources Conservation \n     Program, is amended to read:\n       Sec. 1230. Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve \n     Program.\n       During the 1996 through 2005 calendar years, the Secretary \n     shall establish an Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve \n     Program to assist owners and operators of farms and ranches \n     to conserve and enhance soil, water, and related natural \n     resources including grazing lands, wetlands, and wildlife \n     habitat. The Secretary shall carry out these purposes through \n     the Conservation Reserve, Wetlands Reserve, and Environmental \n     Quality Incentive Programs authorized in this Act.\n       Sec. 2. Subchapter B-Conservation Reserve, is amended to \n     read:\n       Sec. 1231. Conservation Reserve.\n       (a) In General. The Secretary is authorized to re-enroll \n     lands currently in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) by \n     extending current contracts and to enroll new lands into the \n     CRP during the 1996-2005 calendar years. The purposes of the \n     CRP are to improve water quality, soil erosion, and related \n     natural resources, by taking environmentally sensitive lands \n     out of production that, if permitted to remain untreated, \n     could substantially impair water quality or reduce soil \n     productivity or related natural resources.\n       (b) Eligible Lands. Emphasis will be place on enrolling and \n     re-enrolling lands that are 1) highly erodible croplands that \n     cannot be farmed in accordance with a conservation compliance \n     plan or are next to lakes, rivers, or streams, 2) marginal \n     pasture lands established as wildlife habitat, and 3) \n     cropland or pasture land to be devote to the production of \n     hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts.\n       (c) Certain Lands Affected by Secretarial Action. Lands \n     enrolled into the CRP shall be considered to be planted to an \n     agricultural commodity during a crop year if an action of the \n     Secretary prevented land from being planted to the commodity \n     during the crop year.\n       (d) Enrollment. Not more than 36.4 million acres may be \n     enrolled and re-enrolled into the CRP in any year between the \n     1996-2005 calendar years. The Secretary shall enroll acreage \n     into the CRP that meets specified water quality and soil \n     erosion criteria, and that also maximizes wildlife habitat \n     benefits, to the maximum extent practicable.\n       (e) Priority Functions. All lands enrolled or re-enrolled \n     into the CRP between 1996--2000 must satisfy the priority \n     functions of water quality, soil erosion, and wildlife \n     benefits.\n       Water Quality. The Secretary shall enroll by the year 2000 \n     filterstrips that are contiguous to permanent bodies of \n     water, tributaries and smaller streams, or intermittent \n     streams. Contour grass strips and grassed waterways shall \n     also be enrolled. Priority shall be given to partial field \n     enrollments. Four million acres shall be enrolled by the end \n     of the year 2000.\n       Soil Erosion. The Secretary shall accept offers to enroll \n     highly erodible lands that cannot be farmed through practices \n     designed to significantly reduce soil erosion on highly \n     erodible fields in a cost-effective manner without high \n     potential for degradation of soil or water quality.\n       Wildlife. The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, ensure that offers to enroll acreage under the \n     water quality and soil erosion priorities also maximize \n     wildlife habitat benefits. This shall be accomplished by \n     enrolling lands that are contiguous to other CRP acreage, \n     designated wildlife habitats, or wetlands.\n       (f) Duration of Contract. CRP Contracts shall be for 10 to \n     15 years.\n       (g) Multi-Year Grasses and Legumes. Alfalfa and other \n     multi-year grasses and legumes used in a rotation practice \n     shall be considered agricultural commodities.\n       Sec. 1232. Duties of Owners and Operators.\n       (a)&(b) Conservation Plans. An owner or operator of a farm \n     or ranch must agree to implement a conservation plan approved \n     by the Secretary for converting eligible lands normally \n     devoted to the production of an agricultural commodity on the \n     farm or ranch to a less intensive use, and to establish a \n     vegetative or water cover on the land. An owner or operator \n     must also agree not to use such land for agricultural \n     purposes, or to conduct any harvesting or grazing on CRP land \n     except as allowed by the Secretary. The conservation plan \n     shall contain conservation measures and practices to be \n     carried out during the term of the contract.\n       (c) Environmental Use.--To the extent practicable, not less \n     than one-eighth of the land that is placed into CRP shall be \n     devoted to hardwood trees.\n       (d) Foreclosure. If land enrolled into the CRP is \n     foreclosed upon, the Secretary may waive repayment by the \n     owner or operator of amounts received under the contract.\n       Sec. 1233. Duties of the Secretary. The Secretary shall \n     provide cost share and technical assistance for carrying out \n     conservation measures and practices, and pay an annual rental \n     payment.\n       Sec. 1234. Payments.\n       The Secretary shall provide payments for cost share \n     amounting to 50 percent of the cost of establishing water \n     quality and conservation practices. Rental payments shall be \n     paid as soon as practicable after October 1 of each calendar \n     year, and shall be determined by the Secretary through the \n     submission of offers for contracts by owners and operators \n     and establishment of\n      the rental value of the land through a productivity \n     adjustment formula. Rental payments may not exceed local \n     rental rates, except that rental payments for partial \n     field enrollments may be up to 150% of local rental rates, \n     adjusted for the productivity of the land. The total \n     amount of rental payments may not exceed $50,000.\n       Sec. 1235. Contracts.\n       If the ownership of the land has changed within the \n     previous 3 years, the land cannot be enrolled into the CRP \n     unless the new ownership was acquired by will or succession \n     as a result of the death of the previous owner, or the \n     Secretary determines that the land was acquired under \n     circumstances that give adequate assurance that such land was \n     not acquired for the purpose of placing it in the CRP. CRP \n     contracts can be modified upon the agreement of the owner or \n     operator and the Secretary.\n       Sec. 1236. Base History.\n       The acreage base, quota or allotment for the farm (as \n     applicable) shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio \n     between the total cropland acreage on the farm and the \n     acreage placed into the CRP.\n       Sec. 3. Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Chapter 2 \n     is amended to read:\n       Chapter 2--Environmental Quality Incentives Program.\n       Sec. 1238. Findings and Purposes.\n       This section articulates the needs and purposes of a \n     comprehensive conservation program that provides flexible and \n     cost effective technical assistance, cost share, and \n     incentive payments to farmers and ranchers engaged in crop \n     and livestock production for various conservation practices, \n     instead of retiring land from production. This program is \n     intended to assist farmers and ranchers in complying with the \n     conservation compliance and swampbuster requirements of Title \n     XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, and other State and \n     Federal environmental laws. The Environmental Quality \n     Incentives Program (EQIP) combines the functions of the \n     Agricultural Conservation Program, the Great Plains \n     Conservation Program, the Water Quality Incentives Program \n     and the Colorado River Salinity Control Program into a single \n     program. Conservation assistance for livestock production is \n     significantly increased.\n       Sec. 1238A. Definitions.\n       (a) Livestock.

The Secretary shall, for the 1996-2005 \n     fiscal years, provide technical assistance, cost share, and \n     incentive payments through EQIP to operators engaged in crop \n     or livestock production. Operators who implement structural \n     practices shall be eligible for technical assistance and/or \n     cost share. Operators who perform land management practices \n     shall be eligible for technical assistance and/or incentive \n     payments.\n       (b) Duration of Assistance. Contracts between operators and \n     the Secretary may be for 5-10 years.\n       (c) Structural Practices. The Secretary shall administer a \n     competitive offer (bid) system for cost share and/or \n     technical assistance for the implementation of structural \n     practices.\n       (d) Land Management Practices. The Secretary shall \n     establish an application and evaluation process for awarding \n     an incentive payment and/or technical assistance for the \n     performance of land management practices.\n       (e) Cost Share and Incentive Payments.\n       Cost share payments for structural practices shall be not \n     greater than 75% of the [[Page S7516]] projected cost of the \n     structural practice, as determined by the Secretary. \n     Operators of large confined livestock operations are not \n     eligible for cost share for animal waste management \n     facilities. Incentive payments shall be\n      in an amount and at a rate determined by the Secretary to be \n     necessary to attract operators to perform land management \n     practices. The receipt of incentive payments under EQIP \n     shall not affect the eligibility of the operator to \n     receive incentive payments under other conservation \n     programs.\n       (f) Technical Assistance. The Secretary shall allocate \n     funding for technical assistance under EQIP according to the \n     purpose and projected cost for which the technical assistance \n     is provided in a fiscal year. The receipt of technical \n     assistance under EQIP shall not affect the eligibility of the \n     operator to receive technical assistance under other \n     conservation programs.\n       (g) Modification or Termination of Contracts.\n       The Secretary may modify a contract with an operator under \n     this chapter if the operator and Secretary agree.\n       Sec. 1238C. Evaluation of Offers and Payments.\n       (a) Regional Priorities. The Secretary shall provide cost \n     share, technical assistance, and incentive payments depending \n     on the significance of the soil, water and related natural \n     resource problems in the region, watershed, or conservation \n     priority area, and the structural or land management \n     practices that best address these problems.\n       (b) Maximize Environmental Benefits. EQIP shall be \n     administered so as to maximize environmental benefits per \n     dollar expended.\n       (c) Local or State Contributions. Priority is given to \n     operators whose agricultural operations are located within \n     watersheds, regions, or conservation priority areas in which \n     watersheds, regions, or conservation priority areas in which \n     local or state governments will, or already have already \n     provided financial or technical assistance to the operator \n     for a practice on the same land.\n       (d) Priority Lands. Priority is given to structural or land \n     management practices on lands on which agricultural \n     production has the potential to cause the failure to meet \n     water quality standards or other environmental objectives of \n     Federal or State laws.\n       Sec. 1238D. Duties of the Operator. An operator must agree \n     to implement an EQIP plan that contains conservation and \n     environmental goals to be achieved through land management or \n     structural practices.\n       Sec. 1238E.

Conservation Operations. It is the Sense of the \n     Senate that the functions performed by the Secretary pursuant \n     to the authority for Conservation Operations are valuable \n     conservation activities that should continue to be carried \n     out by the Secretary and receive annual appropriations by \n     Congress at least at 1995 funding levels.\n       Sec. 1245. Information Management. It is the Sense of the \n     Senate that the Secretary should develop information \n     management techniques that are necessary to create individual \n     farm or ranch natural resource data bases that would \n     streamline the process by which owners or operators apply to \n     participate in a conservation program administered by USDA \n     and, to the extent practicable, develop a common application \n     process for all conservation programs.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to introduce today, \nwith Senator Lugar, the Agricultural Resources Conservation Act of \n1995.\n  When President Bush signed the 1990 farm bill, he called it one of \nthe most important environmental bills in that Congress.\n  Today will build on that legacy.\n  We build on the legacy of Vermont's--and America's values.\n  Being good neighbors. That is the value we live by in Vermont. When a \ncow gets out of her pasture, our neighbors make sure she gets back \nsafely. When phosphorus gets out of our barnyards and threatens Lake \nChamplain, we come together to find a solution.\n  We build on the legacy of our Vermont experience.\n  In Vermont we have proved over the past 15 years that if we build \ngood conservation policy, our farmers will come and participate. This \nbill takes the Vermont model and makes it a nationwide program.\n  We build on a legacy of bipartisan cooperation.\n  The conservation policies we enacted in 1985 and 1990 have produced \nmore progress in the last 10 years than we have seen in the last 50 \nyears of soil conservation.\n  That is a summary of the values and policies behind this bill.\n  What does it mean on the ground in Vermont? [[Page S7517]] \n  First, it means farmers will not have to choose between being good \nneighbors--controlling their polluted runoff--and staying in business.\n  Our neighbors, Vermonters and Americans nationwide, will help share \nthe costs.\n  Second, our working together means cleaner rivers and streams. We can \ntake the successes we have had in local areas, and make them work \nstatewide.\n  Third, it means new opportunities for all Vermont's farmers. Dairy \nand sheep, apple farmers and vegetable farmers--all can be better \nfarmers and neighbors.\n  I believe the bill we are introducing today embodies in legislation \nthe agricultural community's commitment to conservation and the \nenvironment. In the Agricultural Resources Conservation Act of 1995 we \nextend that legacy to the broader environmental challenges farmers and \nranchers will face in the next 10 years.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is built on four key ideas.\n  We are neighbors;\n  Let's build on proven success;\n  We need solutions, not complex programs;\n  Look ahead, or we will fall behind.\n  We are neighbors: The Good Neighbor Act of 1995.\n  The Agricultural Resources Conservation Act of 1995 is more than a \nset of proposals for policies and programs. It is, at its heart, a \nstatement of the values we share as Americans.\n  The guiding principle of this bill is the golden rule.\n  Farmers and ranchers manage nearly half of the land mass of the \ncontiguous United States. Cropland alone makes up one-fifth of our \nland. The 36 million acres in the Conservation Reserve Program is 2.5 \ntimes the size of the Wildlife Refuge System in the lower 48 states. \nThese figures show that some of our most critical environmental \nconcerns, from water quality to wildlife habitat, can be solved only \nwith the active, cooperative support of the agricultural sector. The \nbill I am introducing today provides the means to engage farmers and \nranchers in actively and cooperatively meeting their responsibilities \nas neighbors.\n  I firmly believe that most farmers and ranchers are good neighbors. \nThe facts speak for themselves. Since 1985, farmers and ranchers have \nreduced soil erosion on highly erodible land by two-thirds. We are \nabout to turn the corner on wetland losses in agriculture--restoring \nmore acres than we are converting. A recent poll of 10,000 farmers in \n15 leading farm States found that 58 percent of the farmers said \nconservation compliance should be continued. A majority of the farmers \npolled, 43 percent agreed that the Government should insist they plant \nfilter strips along stream banks to protect water quality--40 percent \ndisagreed.\n  Farmers, it seems to me, are way ahead of some of their leaders when \nit comes to working constructively to solve our real and legitimate \nenvironmental problems. This bill builds on farmers and ranchers clear \ncommitment to conservation and their neighbors.\n  BUILD ON PROVEN SUCCESS: IF WE BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME.\n  This bill tries to make what has worked so well in Vermont work for \nfarmers and ranchers in the rest of the country.\n  In Vermont we have a problem with Lake Champlain. Runoff from dairy \nfarms causes a real problem when it carries phosphorus into Lake \nChamplain. Beginning in 1980, farmers and their urban neighbors came \ntogether to work out solutions. We identified the sources of runoff--we \nidentified the management practices that would reduce that runoff--and \nwe set ourselves some goals by which to measure our progress. We \ntargeted the Federal assistance to get results.\n  And it's working. In the Lake Champlain basin alone 436 farmers have \ncontributed $5.8 million over their own money to match $13.4 million in \nFederal funding in the last 15 years. Other farmers are taking \nadvantage of technical assistance and incentive payments provided \nthrough the Water Quality Incentives Program to set up innovative \nrotational grazing systems that increase profits and protect water \nquality. Our experience proves that if we provide farmers and ranchers \nwith the technical and financial assistance they need, they will step \nup to the plate and do their share to protect the environment.\n  That is what the Agricultural Resources Conservation Act of 1995 \ndoes--put the tools into the hands of farmers that will allow them to \nreconcile profitability, productivity, and the environment. \nSpecifically we:\n  Reauthorize the Conservation Reserve Program through 2005 and make \nsure the program works to protect soil, water quality, and wildlife \nhabitat;\n  Authorize a new program, called the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, which insures farmers will have the technical and financial \nassistance to produce crops and livestock in ways that protect the \nenvironment; and\n  Reauthorize the Wetland Reserve Program through 2005 to make sure \nwetland restoration and protection works for flood prevention, water \nquality, and wildlife habitat.\n  These three programs will enable farmers to make the changes they \nneed to make to protect the environment while protecting their bottom \nline at the same time.\n  We need solutions, not complex programs.\n  Farmers and ranchers want to do the right thing, but sometimes our \nrules and regulations get in the way.\n  This bill gets bureaucratic redtape out of the way of farmers that \nwant to conserve and protect the environment.\n  Our proposed Environmental Quality Incentives Program combines the\n   functions of the Great Plains Conservation Program, Water Quality \nIncentives Program, Agricultural Conservation Program, and the Colorado \nRiver Salinity Control Program into one, voluntary and flexible \nconservation program. Farmers and ranchers will have one-step shopping \nfor conservation planning. They will no longer have to have a file \ndrawer full of plans for every conservation program or cost-share \nagreement they need. They will be able to use one plan to address all \ntheir conservation objectives and that makes them eligible for \nfinancial assistance.\n  Last year, we took the first steps toward eliminating bureaucratic \nredtape when we passed legislation that reorganized the Department. \nThere is no reason to reinvent the wheel and create a new bureaucratic \nstructure to implement the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. \nThe structure is already in the field to do the job--county committees, \nconservation districts, the Natural Resources Conservation Service and \nthe Consolidated Farm Services Agency just need to work together to get \nthe job done. That's how it works in Vermont, and that's how it should \nwork in every State. The implementation of the Department \nreorganization is proving that it can and will work for everyone.\n  We have to think ahead or we will be left behind.\n  This bill provides a public commitment to help farmers meet what they \ntell me is a growing concern: meeting increasingly complex \nenvironmental challenges while sustaining profitable and productive \nfarms and ranches.\n  This bill charts a course for farm policy in the 21st century. It is \na course that provides for environmental income stability in the same \nway our current farm policy provides for market income stability.\n  Agricultural programs were established in the 1930's to stabilize \nfarm income in the face of large swings in commodity prices. Farmers \nnow believe that conservation and environmental rules threaten the \nstability of farm income. Often these threats are overblown by groups \nmore interested in being divisive than being constructive. Polls \nconsistently show that the American public holds both farming and \nenvironmental protection in very high esteem. Both farmers and \nenvironmentalists have much to lose from a divisive relationship.\n  As I said earlier, farmers and ranchers manage half of the land mass \nin the contiguous United States. This means how we farm and how we \nranch must affect our neighbors, whether those neighbors are across the \nfence, or 1,000 miles downstream. The farm policy of the future must \nmeet the unique needs of farmers and ranchers as the Nation's \nlandowners and land managers.\n  This bill proposes to put conservation funding on an equal footing \nwith commodity programs. Why?\n  The purpose of the CCC borrowing authority is to provide farm income \nstability. [[Page S7518]] \n  Conservation programs address the effect of changing environmental \nrules on farm income, just as commodity programs address farm income \ninstability from changing markets.\n  That is why this legislation authorizes the Commodity Credit \nCorporation to use its borrowing authority to fund the Conservation \nReserve Progam, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and the \nWetland Reserve Program.\n  Early last year several groups of experts from all sectors of \nagriculture came together under the auspices of the National Center for \nFood and Agricultural Policy to help us plan for the 1995 farm bill.\n  Let me quote from the overview prepared at the end of this process:\n\n       Supporters of the program had some difficulty, however, in \n     rationalizing as to why an industrial policy for the food and \n     fiber sector requires continuing large-scale transfers of \n     income to a portion of the farm production sector. . . . The \n     working group looking at land use, conservation and \n     environment issue had no such problems in identifying the \n     public interest in and the public benefits that can be \n     derived from programs. . . . This group argued that the \n     primary beneficiary of the conservation and the environment \n     programs is the public--which values the benefits of \n     additional wildlife, cleaner water, and less soil erosion.\n\n  This report is right. The direction is clear. I firmly believe that \nconservation should and will play an increasingly important role in the \nagricultural policy of the next century. The public has proved they are \nwilling to pay for conservation. We need to take the first steps this \nyear to build on that willingness to guarantee farmers and ranchers \nwill have the technical and financial assistance they will need in the \nfuture.\n  Budget pressures will sorely test our commitment to conservation this \nyear. We will be forced to make painful choices. We will be forced to \nrethink the basis and justification of our farm policy. This bill makes \na firm commitment to conservation as a fundamental purpose of future \nfarm programs.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this bill today. This bill \nbuilds on what we know works in my State and in the Nation. It is part \nof a blueprint for a farm policy that will meet the needs of farmers, \nranchers, and their neighbors as we approach the next century.\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 855. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to revise the \nauthorization for long-term leasing of military family housing to be \nconstructed; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n         the build-to-lease military family housing act of 1995\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing on behalf \nof myself and Senator Stevens legislation to address a serious national \nneed--the condition and availability of military family housing for the \nArmed Forces of the United States, including the Coast Guard.\n  The condition of the family housing for our military personnel has \ndeteriorated to the point where it is a serious disincentive to \nreenlistment and a threat to long-term military readiness. According to \na March 7, 1995 article in the Washington Post:\n\n       ``Defense Secretary William J. Perry cites the poor \n     condition of military housing as the number one complaint he \n     hears from soldiers on visits to bases.''\n       ``. . . 60% of the 375,000 on base family housing units are \n     inadequate . . .''\n       ``Many barracks and family apartments, built soon after \n     World War II, are cramped and suffer from peeling lead-based \n     paint, hazardous asbestos, cracked foundations, corroding \n     pipes or faulty heating and cooling systems.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is clearly a shameful situation that we can and \nshould address. The Washington Post article I cited goes on to point \nout the need for a system to attract private investment to help rebuild \nor replace America's military housing. That is the approach of the \nlegislation I am introducing today.\n  Mr. President, in Alaska we have successfully used private developers \nto build 1,216 units of critically needed military family housing, \nincluding 666 units of Air Force housing at Eielson Air Force Base, and \n550 units of Army housing at Fort Wainwright. This was accomplished \nunder the authority of section 801 of Public Law 98-115, a provision I \nauthored in 1983 along with Senator Tower and Representative Charlie \nStenholm of Texas. Today I am urging that we revise and extend that law \nto encourage its use for today's housing needs in the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marines, and Coast Guard.\n  While there is still build-lease authority in 10 U.S.C. 2828, it is \nmy understanding that little or no new housing has actually been \nconstructed under the provisions of the statute as currently written \ndue to the manner in which proposed projects are scored for budgetary \npurposes by the Congressional Budget Office [CBO]. There are also other \nconstraints in the current statutory language, such as the requirement \nthat the housing be off-base, that work to the detriment of successful \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, in Ketchikan, AK the Coast Guard tells me that there \nis a serious need for new housing. However, they do not believe that \nthey can provide this for their personnel due to budgetary constraints. \nBy providing the authority to lease or construct on or near a military \ninstallation I believe we will reduce the cost of providing housing as \nmany of the needed infrastructure support systems, that is, water, \nsewer, electricity, will already be in place.\n  The approach I advocate, and the approach in the legislation I am \nintroducing today, is simple and cost effective. The military services \nwould invite the private sector to build housing to military \nspecifications on land already belonging to the Federal Government, \npreferably on base or on Government property. Under my approach, the \nmilitary service can also contract for maintenance, providing the \ndeveloper with an added incentive to construct easy-to-maintain \nhousing.\n  The private developer builds the housing, leases it back to the \nmilitary for the contract lease price including any inflation factors \nspecified in the contract, for a lease term not to exceed 20 years. At \nthe end of the 20 years, the United States has the right of first \nrefusal to purchase the housing for its own purposes. As a practical \nmatter, I'd expect the purchase to occur at little additional cost. \nSince the land the housing is on belongs to the Government, and since \naccess to the housing and the base can be stipulated, any on-base \nhousing would only be of value to the Federal Government.\n  My approach also codifies the requirement that the housing projects \nbe competitively bid, and that the committees of jurisdiction in the \nHouse and Senate have an opportunity to review the economic \njustifications for the projects prior to final award.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my legislation directs that the total amount \nof budget authority and outlays required by the build-lease contract \nshall be scored on a pro rata basis over the term of the contract for \npurposes of CBO scoring. While some may dislike this provision, \nexperience has demonstrated its necessity.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article from the Washington Post and \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Perry cites the poor condition \n     of military housing as the number one complaint he hears from \n     soldiers on visits to bases.\n       ``If you ever drove up with your kids to a college with \n     that kind of housing, you'd never leave your kid,'' John \n     Hamre, the Pentagon's comptroller, has been telling \n     congressional and news media audiences around Washington. \n     ``It's pathetic.''\n       But at a time of shrinking budgets, Pentagon officials have \n     come up with only some token extra millions of dollars to \n     throw at a problems requiring billions to fix. So Perry is \n     casting about for creative off-budget schemes. His main \n     notion, still largely untested, is to establish a system for \n     attracting private investment to help rebuild or replace \n     America's military housing.\n       So passionate has Perry become about the subject that the \n     former aerospace, entrepreneur--remembered as an \n     undersecretary in the Carter administration for such high-\n     tech innovations as stealth technology and the cruise \n     missile--is now determined to leave his mark by cleaning up \n     the more mundane housing mess.\n       ``When I leave here, I want to look back at a handful of \n     legacies--things that I`ve done that I'm proud of, that will \n     be sustained and carried on--and this is going to be one of \n     them,'' Perry said in an interview.\n       Asked about the apparent irony of appealing for new, \n     improved housing even as another round of base closings is \n     underway, Pentagon authorities say the shutdowns have \n     exacerbated the overall housing shortage. Moreover, with much \n     of the closure process now behind them, Defense Department \n     officials say the way is open for enlisting private \n     developers who had been spooked by the uncertainty of the \n     closings.\n       On Capitol Hill, where strong bipartisan support exists for \n     better military housing, Perry has run into one complication. \n     His emphasis on the U.S. problem is undermining his parallel \n     effort to continue building new homes for former Soviet \n     military officers, part of a U.S. program to finance \n     elimination of nuclear missile bases in Moscow's onetime \n     empire.\n       Much American military housing remains in decent shape. \n     Some quite handsome buildings, with remodeled interiors and \n     attractive surroundings, are home to senior officers. And \n     many bases feature well-kept smaller housing units.\n       But the norm is something else.\n       While no definitive Pentagon standard for adequate housing \n     exists, the Defense Department reports that about 60 percent \n     of the 375,000 on-base family housing units are inadequate--\n     and there are long waiting lists at most bases even for those \n     homes. About one-fourth of the military's 510,000 ``barracks \n     spaces'' are rated substandard, with World War II-vintage \n     gang latrines still common.\n       Even some top-tier combat forces, like the Army's 82nd \n     Airborne Division based here at Fort Bragg, live in \n     overcrowded rooms with pock-marked walls, rickety lockers, \n     swaying bunks and dim lighting.\n       ``We'd like to give our soldiers something better than \n     tiles falling on their heads and air conditioning that \n     doesn't work,'' said Lt. Col. Charles Jacoby, a battalion \n     commander in the 82nd.\n       Pentagon officials cite several factors to explain how \n     housing became a crisis. One involves the shift over the past \n     two decades from a conscript force to an all-volunteer \n     military, which led to a jump from 40 percent to 60 percent \n     in the proportion of married service members.\n       But the availability of family housing has increased little \n     since the 1970s. Most of the Reagan administration's surge in \n     defense spending went into new weapon systems rather than \n     bricks and mortar. Some military housing was upgraded in \n     Europe, then central to Cold War defenses, but those \n     facilities now are being closed.\n       ``Even during the 1980s, when we had a defense budget \n     buildup, there was little or not attention paid to this \n     housing problem,'' Perry said. ``I think it just didn't \n     strike them that it was an important problem.''\n       The relocation in the United States of U.S. troops formerly \n     based abroad has exacerbated the shortage, as has the closing \n     of numerous domestic bases that offered at least some decent \n     housing.\n       Styles, too, have changed. Today's soldiers, like other \n     Americans, expect more privacy and space than their \n     counterparts several decades ago. One bath for three or four \n     bedrooms might have been satisfactory in the 1950s; now, \n     military families want not only more bathrooms, but more \n     living and storage space, various appliances, parking for at \n     least two cars and other amenities.\n       Despite numerous, limited renovations efforts, military \n     officials say maintenance has tended to be more reactive than \n     preventive. Besides, only so much can be done for some \n     eroding structures.\n       ``This place is like an old car, it's continually breaking \n     down,'' said Sgt. Maj. Sam Chapman of the 16th Military \n     Brigade, quartered at Fort Bragg in a 1920s-era barracks with \n     broken plumbing, unreliable heating and never enough hot \n     water. ``We're constantly putting in work orders, but the \n     only way to fix things is to tear the place down and build a \n     new barracks.''\n       Defense Department policy is to provide on-base housing \n     when the neighboring private market cannot meet the need. \n     Each military service houses about the same proportion of its \n     family population on base--between 30 percent and 40 percent. \n     Some commanders would prefer to get out of the housing \n     business altogether, but on-base units remain very popular \n     among service members for reasons of adding security, family \n     support networks, financial advantages, proximity to jobs and \n     access to child care and medical services.\n       Living off-base is often not a manageable alternative, \n     because military pay and housing allowances have not kept up \n     with civilian pay on average. In a recent survey of 29 home \n     ports, the Navy found that sailors ranked petty officer third \n     class and below could afford a one-bedroom apartment in only \n     five of the localities and an efficiency in only 17.\n       Perry makes the point that ``quality of life'' concerns, of \n     which housing ranks highest, are key to persuading the best \n     military people to reenlist.\n       ``What I want to do is equate dealing with the housing \n     problem with [military] readiness,'' he said. ``I see a \n     single, iron logic that drives me from one to the other.''\n       Under an initiative announced last fall, the Pentagon plans \n     to spend $450 million a year for the next six years to \n     improve on-base housing, raise allowances for off base living \n     and provide more child care and other family support \n     services. But even with these extra funds--on top of \n     increased spending on housing by the services--Pentagon \n     officials expect to modernize only 14 percent of the family \n     housing stock over the next six years and only one in three \n     substandard barracks.\n       ``The real hope is that we can attract large amounts of \n     private investment into this housing problem,'' said Perry.\n       Perry now has both an internal team of officials and an \n     outside task force headed by former Army secretary John O. \n     Marsh looking for alternatives.\n       One promising plan is being tried by the Navy, which \n     received congressional authority last year to enter into \n     equity partnerships with private developers. Also under \n     consideration are sales of excess property or land swaps to \n     raise capital for housing projects, discounted leases on \n     government land to lower costs for developers and mortgage \n     insurance for new or renovated military housing.\n       Perry would like to proceed with several pilot programs \n     this year, then select one or two for expansion next year.\n       ``The problems have been a long time in coming, and will \n     take a long time to fix,'' said Col. James R. Hougnon, Fort \n     Bragg's public works director.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Pell, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 856. A bill to amend the National Foundation on the Arts and the \nHumanities Act of 1965, the Museum Services Act, and the Arts and \nArtifacts Indemnity Act to improve and extend the acts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n[[Page S7520]]\n\n    the reauthorization of the national foundation on the arts and \n                         humanities act of 1995\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, with Senators Kassebaum, Kennedy, Pell, \nSimpson, and Dodd, I am introducing today the Reauthorization of the \nNational Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965. This bill \nprovides authorization for the National Endowment for the Arts, the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities, the newly consolidated Institute \nfor Museum and Library Services, and the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity \nAct, through the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, this has been a controversial bill I know, and we have \ndone our utmost in the committee, and will continue to do so through \nthe markup, to restore the kind of confidence that this act in these \nvarious endowments deserve.\n  The subject of government sponsorship of the arts and humanities \nevokes great disagreement and spirited debate from thoughtful people. \nMy colleagues here in the Senate are certainly no strangers to the \ncontroversies and discussions associated with the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. I must say that throughout the process of drafting the \nbill this consideration has been on my mind. I worked in consultation \nwith my Republican and Democratic colleagues on the Labor Committee in \nhopes of addressing concerns and incorporating constructive suggestions \nas to how to improve each of the agencies.\n  At each subcommittee hearing, we had opportunities to discuss \nfundamental issues related to the NEA, NEH, and IMS with a host of \nindividuals each with very different perspectives. Some spoke of the \nmerits of the Endowments, others proposed significant change, still \nothers advocated total elimination of the Endowments as we now know \nthem. We had the opportunity to see the work of the IMS first hand. The \nhearing on the Institute for Museum Services was held at the Alexandria \nBlack History Resource Center--a center that serves the community, is \nhome to a wonderful collection of photographs and objects, supports \neducation and lifelong learning initiatives, and is there for the \nenjoyment of all of the people of Alexandria, and others who visit.\n  The exchanges at each of the hearings were enlightening, lively, and \nI believe in the end, very productive. We were able to discuss ideas \nand concepts which challenged the way we have thought of these \nagencies. I believe we successfully broadened this discussion from that \nof simply all or nothing--elimination versus no change--and created an \nopportunity to improve upon these agencies.\n  We have sought to do something very different with this bill. We have \nmade changes that will lead to substantial improvement in terms of how \nthese agencies work and made it even more clear in the legislation as \nto the priority of who they serve. I learned a great deal from the \nhearings and feel certain that we have incorporated some of the \nvaluable and thoughtful ideas that were shared during these \ndiscussions. There was room for improvement at the NEA and NEH. In \naddition, there is a clear and direct connection to learning between \nthe IMS and libraries.\n  We have worked very hard on this bill, for very simple reasons, in my \nopinion. The National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities, libraries and museums make enormous contributions \nto vibrancy and greatness of our society. They enrich the fabric of \nthis Nation, they bring us together, enable us to better express \nourselves and better understand each other and many times, through the \narts and humanities we reach those who have been written off.\n  Simply, the arts and humanities are an integral improvement in terms \nof how these agencies work and make even more clear that legislation is \nneeded as to the priority of those who they serve.\n  I learned a great deal from the hearings and feel certain that we \nwill have incorporated some of the most valuable and thoughtful ideas \nthat were shared during these discussions. There was room for \nimprovement in the NEA and the NEH.\n  In addition, it is clear that direct connection to learning between \nthe NEH, the NEA, and the libraries is enlightening. We have worked \nvery hard on this bill for very simple reasons, in my opinion. The \nNational Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities and the institute for Museum and Library Services make \nenormous contributions. Encouraging curiosity, thought, learning, \ndialog, and understanding are endeavors that the Federal Government \nshould have a role in supporting.\n  In fact, I believe the Federal Government should have a leadership \nrole in fostering and preserving the unique cultural heritage of the \nNation. And to give credit where credit is due, the National Endowment \nfor the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute \nfor Museum Services and libraries have made the arts and humanities \nmore accessible to all people of our Nation and have created innovative \nand exciting ways of learning to the lives of many, old and young.\n  My support of these agencies is based on what I have witnessed and \nlearned over the years--facts about what they really do and who they \nreally serve. I have seen the many ways the Endowments' and the IMS' \nprograms have touched people's lives. Their programs have reached \nchildren who, prior to their involvement with the arts or humanities \nhad little interest in learning and less hope. Each of these agencies \nhave enabled individuals to gain a better understanding of their \nneighbors and their communities through participation in community \nfestivals and other outreach activities. They have brought the beauty \nand the magic of the Nation's rich culture to even the smallest corners \nof the Nation.\n  My own State of Vermont, while unique in so many ways, is part of a \ncommon phenomenon--when the arts, humanities, museums, and libraries \nare introduced to a community--that community comes alive, its people \ncome alive. There are examples of excellence in the arts and humanities \nin Vermont which deserve mention. Book Discussion for General \nAudiences, which began from a small grant from the Vermont Council for \nthe Humanities at the suggestion of a local librarian in my home town \nof Rutland, VT, has become a integral component of the agenda in many \nof the State humanities councils. The Shelburne Museum has received \ngrants from the NEA, NEH, and IMS. It is a showcase and a leading \ninstitution of American folk art and decorative arts and artifacts--\nvisited by Vermonters and other visitors from across the country and \naround the world. It has worked in partnership with local libraries, \nlocal schools, and with adult education projects. These are but two \nexamples of thousands which have enhanced the experiences of people in \na State.\n  It has been my intention to preserve what the agencies do well, yet \nprovide them with greater guidance and direction as to the purpose of \ntheir work. Today we are putting forward a proposal that consolidates \nprograms, streamlines functions,\n restructures and provides clear guidelines for the agencies. It \nrecognizes that there are initiatives that are best done best locally \nand other initiatives that are clearly national in scope and benefit a \nbroad audience. This bill makes the agencies more accountable and more \nresponsive to the American public while enabling them to continue to do \nwhat they do best--provide and enhance access to the best of the arts \nand humanities to all the people of this Nation.\n\n  It comes to a very fundamental question, should this Nation care and \nsupport those who want to nurture its heart and soul, to provide the \nopportunity for those who would not otherwise have it, and to best \ndemonstrate the beauty and greatness of our fabulous country.\n  I think it is important to go into some detail as to the extent of \nthe changes we have proposed. They are far reaching and go to the basis \nof the operation of these agencies. It is our hope that these changes \nwill provide clear guidance as to how the Endowment funds are spent and \nsets a clear priority which meet the standard of artistic excellence \nand artistic merit, benefit and reach the widest possible audience.\n  First, we have cleaned up much of the clutter and confusion regarding \ngrant programs, primarily as this relates to the National Endowment for \nthe Arts. We have imposed a new structure by establishing three grant \nprograms at the Arts Endowment: partnership grants, national \nsignificance [[Page S7521]] grants, and direct grants. At the \nHumanities Endowment, we have adopted this same structure. We have \nconsolidated the Institute for Museum Services with the Library \nServices Act and changed the focus of the latter to technology and \naccess and literacy programs for undeserved communities.\n  Forty percent of NEA's program funds must now be spent on partnership \ngrants. Local initiatives make up the partnerships block. Projects \nfunded under this block include the basic State grant at an increased \nlevel as well as competitive grants to State agencies and local and \nregional groups to establish local acts activities with particular \nemphasis on arts education and projects that reach rural and urban \nundeserved areas. Funds will be matched on a 1:1 ratio.\n  Forty percent of all program funds must be used for national \nsignificance grants. These are grants to organizations of demonstrated \nand substantial artistic and cultural importance for projects that will \nincrease access of the American people to the best of their arts and \nculture. Within this block, priority will be given to those projects \nthat will have a national, regional, or otherwise substantial artistic \nand cultural impact. Matching requirements are increased within the \nblock to 3:1 or 5:1 dependent on the size of the institution's annual \nbudget.\n  Finally, 20 percent of funds for grants must be spent on direct \ngrants to groups or individuals that are broadly representative of the \ncultural heritage of the United States and broadly geographically \nrepresentative for projects of the highest artistic excellence and \nartist merit. Again, within this block, priority is given to those \nprojects that will have a national, regional, or otherwise substantial \nartistic and cultural impact and the match is 1:1.\n  Some administrative changes apply to both Endowments. We have merged \nmany of the administrative functions of the Endowments with the intent \nof eliminating duplication and saving money. In addition, we have \nplaced a cap on what can be spent on administration for both Endowments \nat 12 percent. We have decreased the number of members that make up the \nnational councils to streamline and cut bureaucracy. We have instituted \na provision which enables both the NEA and NEH to recapture funds if a \ngrant supported by the Endowment becomes commercially successful. We \nhave prohibited any funds from either Endowment to be used for \nlobbying. Some administrative changes apply specifically to the NEA. We \nhave incorporated administrative provisions that make the chairperson \nmore accountable and given her greater decisionmaking responsibilities. \nIt limits the number of grants an individual can receive in a lifetime \nand the number of grants an institution can receive in a year. We have \neliminated seasonal support and eliminated subgranting--areas of great \nproblem and concern in the past--making an exception only for States \nand regional groups. We have increased turnover in the panel system and \nincreased lay person participation to ensure greater community \ninvolvement. In addition, panels will be prohibited from recommending \nspecific amounts for grants and required to recommend more grants than \nfunding available.\n  We have made substantial structural changes as well as the Humanities \nEndowment. We have mandated that 25 percent of program funds be used \nfor Federal/State partnership. Included in this block is the basic \nState grant to State humanities councils which represents an increase \nin their funding. NEH funds must be matched dollar for dollar.\n  We have mandated that 37.5 percent of all program funds at the NEH be \nused for national grants to support groups and individuals for programs \nin education and the public humanities that have a national audience \nand are of national significance. Projects within the block used for \nendowment building or capital projects must be matched 3:1 by private \nfunds.\n  Finally, research and scholarship grants will constitute the final \n37.5 percent of program funds at the Humanities Endowment. These funds \nwill be awarded to groups and individuals to encourage the development \nand dissemination of significant scholarship in the humanities and will \nbe matched 1:1.\n  The consolidation of the Institute of Museum Services and the Library \nServices Act reflects efforts to unite programs that have a direct \nconnection to one another. More than simply a connection is the \npotential for invaluable collaboration and partnership especially in \nthe areas of technology and access.\n  Last but, in my opinion one of the most important changes to this \nbill is the broadening of the Arts and Artifact Indemnity Act. This \nchange will enable domestic exhibitions to be eligible for insurance \nand allow for more Americans to have access to the great treasures of \nthis Nation.\n  I have laid out a great deal in this statement. It is my hope it \nprovides a general sense of the direction we have moved the agencies \nand the efforts we have made in consolidating programs to better serve \nthe American people. We have focused on what is done best at each level \nand made each responsible for projects to serve the large \nconstituency--the citizens of this Nation. Access to the name of the \ngame in my opinion and we have a responsibility to provide direction \nand guidance to ensure that the Endowments and the Institute of Museum \nLibrary Service reach every corner of the country.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 857. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide waiver authority for the requirement to provide a written \njustification for the exact grounds for the denial of a visa, except in \ncases of intent to immigrate; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE SOURCES PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Law \nEnforcement and Intelligence Sources Protection Act of 1995. This \nlegislation would significantly increase the ability of law enforcement \nand intelligence agencies to share information with the State \nDepartment for the purpose of denying visas to known terrorists, drug \ntraffickers, and individuals involved in international crime.\n  This provision would permit denials of U.S. visas to be made without \na detailed written explanation for individuals who are excludable for \nlaw enforcement reasons, which current law requires. These denials \ncould be made citing U.S. law generically, without further \nclarification or amplification. Individuals denied visas due to the \nsuspicion that they are intending to immigrate would still have to be \ninformed that this is the basis, to allow such an individual to compile \nadditional information that may change that determination.\n  Under a provision of the INA, a precise written justification, citing \nthe specific provision of law, is required for every alien denied a \nU.S. visa. This requirement was inserted into the INA out of the belief \nthat every non-American denied a U.S. visa for any reason had the right \nto know the precise grounds under which the visa was denied, even if it \nwas for terrorist activity, narcotics trafficking, or other illegal \nactivity. This has impeded the willingness of law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies to share with the State Department the names of \nexcludable aliens. These agencies are logically concerned about \nimpeding an investigation or revealing sources and methods if they \nsubmit a name of a person they know to be a terrorist or criminal--but \nwho we do not want to know that we know about their activities--who \nthen goes on the lookout list, is denied a visa, and then is informed \nin writing that he or she was denied a visa because of known drug \ntrafficking activity. That drug trafficker then will know that the DEA \nknows about his or her illegal activity and may be developing a \ncriminal case. This information is something the United States would \nwant to protect, until the case against is completed and, hopefully, \nsome law enforcement action is taken. At the same time, however, for \nthe protection of the American people we should also make this \ninformation available to the Department of State to keep the individual \nout of our country.\n  The key issue is that travel to the U.S. by noncitizens is a \nprivilege, not a constitutional right. There is no fundamental right \nfor extensive due process in visa decisions by our consular officers \noverseas. While I believe that our country should do what we can to be \n[[Page S7522]] fair in our treatment of would-be visitors to the United \nStates, in cases where providing information to an alien would harm our \nown national security, complicate potential criminal cases, or \npotentially reveal sources and methods of intelligence gathering, we \nshould err on the side of protecting Americans, not the convenience of \nforeign nationals.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 862. A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to make urban university business initiative grants, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                     small business enhancement act\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to help \nour vital small and emerging businesses grow successfully. This bill \nwould utilize existing research facilities, especially in our urban \nuniversities, to help enable businesses to discover what currently \nhinders their development. This proposal previously passed the Senate \nas an amendment to S. 4, the National Competitiveness Act. While this \nact did not become law last year, it is my hope that this measure will \nsee quick action in this Congress.\n  This proposal will not create a new bureaucracy. In fact, it may help \nto point out where local and Federal bureaucracies impede business \ndevelopment. It is designed to promote business research assistance by \nthose uniquely qualified to take on these tasks: namely, our Nation's \nbusiness schools in conjunction with private or nonprofit \norganizations.\n  The focus of this legislation is the overall health of businesses in \nlower income urban communities. However, this bill does not preclude \nthis assistance from being applied in rural areas. In fact, if a State \ndoes not contain an urban area as defined in the legislation, the SBA \nAdministrator may designate one area in that State for this purpose.\n  We know some of the most basic problems that businesses face, such as \nintrusive government regulations. Additionally, small and emerging \nbusinesses in low-income urban areas find development difficult because \nof the lack of access to investment capital and technical assistance. \nHowever, why do some of these businesses thrive and compete \ninternationally while others fail?\n  Last year's committee report on the National Competitiveness Act \nnoted that only 6 out of 10 of our smaller manufacturers employ \nadvanced technology, compared to 9 out of 10 for plants with more than \n500 employees. Reports offer little information on exactly why \nbusinesses fail or cease to expand in certain areas. When I tried to \nfind research on the specific problems that businesses face in Oregon, \nthe only current source of information was a survey done by the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses. Surveys and government \nstatistics cannot take the place of primary research conducted by our \nNation's business schools.\n  Business schools play an important role in sustaining business \ndevelopment. They currently perform vital research and train our \nNation's future business leaders. However, this role could be\n greatly enhanced by providing them with additional Federal resources \nto expand their much needed research and apply their findings to \nbusinesses in their communities through assistance programs.\n\n  This proposal would allow the Small Business Administration to make \ngrants to urban universities for research on, or for implementation of, \ntechnical assistance, technology transfer, or delivery of services in \nbusiness creation, expansion, and human resource management. As noted \nabove, where there is not an urban university in a State, the SBA \nAdministrator may designate another eligible area in the State.\n  The authorization for these demonstration grants is limited to $10 \nmillion. The grants would be dispersed geographically, and not exceed \n$400,000 per institution or consortium. This procedure makes use of \nexisting talent and facilities to create the information and assistance \nthat developing businesses need.\n  For example, a comprehensive data base on business births, deaths, \nexpansions, or contractions is no longer maintained. A potential \nbenefit of this proposal could be the creation of such a data base in \nconjunction with assistance efforts based upon the resulting \ninformation. In this case, we would see nonprofit entities taking over \nfunctions that were previously under the direction of the SBA in order \nto enhance American competitiveness.\n  Other programs such as the Small Business Development Centers \n[SBDC's] do an admirable job of specializing in assisting small \nentrepreneurial enterprises. However, the Small Business Enhancement \nAct is designed to offer applied research and in-depth technical \nassistance to small and emerging businesses that SBDCs do not have the \nfacilities to undertake.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring this important \nbusiness initiative. I ask unanimous consent that supporting letters \nfrom the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the \nNational Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, the \nAmerican Electronics Association of Oregon, and Portland State \nUniversity be placed into the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of the American \n     Association of State Colleges and Universities and Land Grant \n     Colleges (NASULGC), we commend your efforts to match the \n     resources of our urban colleges and universities to the needs \n     of the urban business community through the proposed Urban \n     University Business Initiative legislation.\n       The community resource and economic development mission of \n     our urban colleges and universities inextricably links our \n     institutions to the communities in which they reside. \n     Moreover, the business community's need for technical \n     assistance and solutions to problems, especially those in \n     lower income urban areas, and the urban university's ability \n     and interest in applying their energies and talents to human \n     and community concerns, creates a climate for urban \n     universities and urban businesses to collaborate.\n       As we approach the 21st century, the technological \n     challenges threatening America's economy and international \n     competitiveness will have to be addressed by the American \n     people. Too often the potential of our colleges and \n     universities, as participants in the problem solving process, \n     is overlooked. Your legislation helps create the link between \n     urban institutions of higher education and the communities in \n     which they reside.\n       Once again, we appreciate your foresight and leadership on \n     this issue and your outstanding and longstanding advocacy on \n     behalf of urban and metropolitan colleges and universities.\n           Sincerely,\n     James B. Appleberry,\n         President, American Association of State Colleges and \n           Universities.\n     C. Peter Magrath,\n         President, National Association of State Universities and \n           Land-Grant Colleges.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Portland State University,\n\n                                       Portland, OR, May 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I'm writing to let you know I \n     enthusiastically endorse your proposed legislation related to \n     urban universities and technical assistance for small and \n     emerging businesses. This legislation will make a difference \n     not only to businesses in Oregon, but throughout the nation. \n     Establishing direct linkages between urban universities and \n     business assistance will help enhance the success rate of \n     small and emerging businesses.\n       At a time when our nation's economic base is changing \n     dramatically from industrial to small and mid-size \n     businesses, legislative solutions like the Urban University \n     Business Initiative Grants are especially crucial to long-\n     term sustainability. In addition to providing technical \n     assistance, your legislation specifically establishes a \n     priority for a research agenda. Clearly, too little is now \n     known about what works to support business development, \n     strategies for promoting business expansion, and successful \n     efforts to maintain profitability and sustainability.\n       The urban university is well positioned to provide business \n     assistance. It is the mission of the urban university to work \n     with the community to address community problems. A key \n     problem for urban areas, especially lower-income \n     neighborhoods, is business competitiveness. Jobs, \n     particularly family-wage jobs, are essential to self-\n     sufficiency, family stability, and community development. \n     Your legislation creates a mechanism for urban university \n     business schools to be an integral part of the solution.\n       Senator Hatfield, your leadership on this issue is greatly \n     appreciated. I especially want to recognize the good work and \n     commitment of your staff in making this legislative concept a \n     reality. It is obvious that your [[Page S7523]] passion for \n     the urban university mission is shared by the people you \n     employ.\n       Thank you again for embracing this important issue. Please \n     call upon me if I can provide you with any information or \n     assistance.\n           Best regards,\n                                                Judith A. Ramaley,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                             American Electronics Association,\n\n                                          Salem, OR, May 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I am writing to express support for \n     your proposed small business initiative grant program.\n       As you know, Oregon is a hotbed of small businesses, many \n     of which are faced with the daunting task of trying to \n     compete in a global marketplace. Although such programs as \n     the SBDCs attempt to help small enterprises get started, your \n     proposal addresses a different need: the applied research and \n     long-term technical assistance that could be provided by our \n     urban universities.\n       Your proposal addresses another gap in our current system--\n     a much needed data base to track small business development \n     and chart the reasons for success and failure.\n       A recent discussion we had with economic development \n     leaders in the Portland area highlighted for us the urgent \n     need for business development strategies designed \n     specifically for lower income urban communities. We hope that \n     your proposal, if successful, will help address those needs.\n       As always, we applaud your leadership in these issues. Good \n     luck.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       jim Craven,\n                                       Government Affairs Manager.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 863. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for increased Medicare reimbursement for physician assistants, \nto increase the delivery of health services in health professional \nshortage areas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 864. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for increased Medicare reimbursement for nurse practitioners \nand clinical nurse specialists to increase the delivery of health \nservices in health professional shortage areas, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          medicare legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself and Senator \nConrad, I am introducing two bills. If enacted, these bills would \nincrease access to primary care for Medicare beneficiaries in rural and \ninner city communities. The Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive \nAct of 1995 would reform Medicare reimbursement to nurse practitioners \n[NP's] and clinical nurse specialists [CNS's]. The Physician Assistant \nIncentive Act of 1995 would reform Medicare reimbursement for physician \nassistants.\n  We introduced these bills in the last Congress. We are reintroducing \nthem today in the conviction that access to primary care services for \nMedicare beneficiaries would be improved if we reformed Medicare \npolicies that restrict the circumstances under which the services of \nthese providers can be reimbursed.\n\n\n                              the problem\n\n  The Medicare program currently covers the services of these \npractitioners. However, payment levels vary depending on treatment \nsettings and geographic area. In most cases, reimbursement may not be \nmade directly to the nonphysician provider. Rather, it must be made to \nthe employer of the provider, often a physician. The legislation \nauthorizing these different reimbursement arrangements was passed in an \nincremental fashion over the years.\n  The Medicare law which authorizes reimbursement of these providers is \nalso inconsistent with State law in many cases. For instance, in Iowa, \nState law requires nonphysicians to practice with either a supervising \nphysician or a collaborating physician. But under Iowa law, the \nsupervising physician need not be physically present in the same \nfacility as the nonphysician practitioner and, in many instances, can \nbe located in a site physically distant from that of the nonphysician \npractitioner he or she is supervising.\n  Unfortunately, Medicare policy will not recognize such relationships \nand instead requires that the physician be present in the same building \nas the nonphysician practitioner in order for the services of these \nnonphysician providers to be reimbursed. This is known as the incident \nto provision, referring to services that are provided incident to a \nphysician's services.\n  This has created a problem in Iowa, Mr. President. In many parts of \nmy State, clinics have been established using nonphysician \npractitioners, particularly physician assistants, in order to provide \nprimary health care services in communities that are unable to recruit \na physician. The presence of these practitioners insures that primary \nhealth care services will be available to the community.\n  Iowa's Medicare carrier has strictly interpreted the incident to \nrequirement of Medicare law as requiring the physician presence of a \nsupervising physician in places where physician assistants practice. \nThis has caused many of the clinics using physician assistants to \nclose, and thus has deprived the community of primary health care \nservices.\n  Mr. President, recently the Iowa Hospital Association suggested a \nnumber of ways access and cost effectiveness could be improved in the \nMedicare Program. One of their suggestions was that this incident to \nrestriction be relaxed. They said:\n\n       In rural Iowa, most physicians are organized in solo or \n     small group practices. Physician assistants are used to \n     augment these practices. With emergency room coverage \n     requirements, absences due to vacation, continuing education \n     or illness and office hours in satellite clinics, there are \n     instances on a monthly basis where the physician assistant is \n     providing care to patients without a physician in the clinic. \n     Medicare patients in the physician clinic where the physician \n     assistant is located have to either wait for the physician to \n     return from the emergency room or care is provided without \n     charge. The patient and the providers are clearly harmed by \n     this provision.\n\n\n                            this legislation\n\n  If enacted, this legislation would establish a more uniform payment \npolicy for these providers. It would authorize reimbursement of their \nservices as long as they were practicing within State law and their \nprofessional scope of practice. It calls for reimbursement of these \nprovider groups at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule for \nservices they provide in all treatment settings and in all geographic \nareas. Where it is permitted under State law, reimbursement would be \nauthorized even if these nonphysician providers are not under the \ndirect, physical supervision of a physician. Currently, the services of \nthese nonphysician practitioners are paid at 100 percent of the \nphysician's rate when provided incident to a physician's services. If \nenacted, this legislation would discontinue this incident to policy. \nThe reimbursement would be provided directly to the nurse practitioners \nand clinical nurse specialists. It would be provided to the employer of \nthe physician assistant.\n  These bills also call for a 10-percent bonus payment for those of \nthese practitioners who work in health professional shortage areas \n[HPSA's]. We hope that this provision will encourage nonphysician \npractitioner to relocate in areas in need of health care services.\n  Mr. President, legislation closely paralleling the legislation we are \nintroducing today was twice accepted by the Committee on Finance, and \nonce by the Senate. Comparable legislation was included in the Senate's \nversion of H.R. 11 in 1992. Also included in that legislation were \ncertified nurse midwives. Comparable legislation was also accepted by \nthe committee in its health care reform legislation last year. That \nlegislation included only the services of nurse practitioners and \nphysician assistants.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I are again \nintroducing legislation to improve Medicare reimbursement policy \nrelated to nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and \nphysician's assistants. The bills we are introducing today--the Primary \nCare Health Practitioner Incentive Act and the Physician Assistant \nIncentive Act--are slightly modified versions of S. 833 and S. 834, \nwhich we introduced during the last Congress.\n  Our legislation helps maximize the effective utilization of these \nprimary health care providers, who play a vital role in our health care \ndelivery infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.\n  Each of the specialties affected by our legislation has its own \ntraining requirements. For example, nurse practitioners are registered \nnurses who have advanced education and clinical training in a health \ncare specialty area that is either age- or setting-specific. A few \nexamples include pediatrics, adult health, geriatrics, women's health, \n[[Page S7524]] school health, and occupational health. Nurse \npractitioners generally perform services like assessment and diagnosis, \nand provide basic primary care treatment.\n  Almost half of the 25,000 nurse practitioners across the Nation have \nmaster's degrees. Clinical nurse specialists, on the other hand, are \nrequired to have master's degrees and are found more frequently in \ntertiary care settings in specialties like cardiac care. However, many \nalso practice in primary care settings.\n  Physician assistants on average receive 2 years of physician-\nsupervised clinical training and classroom instruction. Unlike nurse \npractitioners, they are educated using the medical model of care, \nrather than the nursing process. Physician assistants work in all \nsettings providing diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive care \nservices.\n  Members of each of these provider groups work with physicians to \nvarying degrees. They generally work in consultation with physicians, \nand are being relied upon more and more. In States like North Dakota, \nnurse practitioners or physician assistants often staff clinics where \nno physician is present or available. Without their presence, many \ncommunities would have no ready access to the health care system.\n  Within their areas of competence, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse \nspecialists, and physician's assistants furnish care of\n exceptional quality. Numerous studies have demonstrated that they do a \nparticularly effective job of providing preventive care, supportive \ncare, and health promotion services. They also emphasize communication \nwith patients and provide effective followup with patients. These \nqualities will continue to grow in importance as primary care receives \nincreasing emphasis throughout our health care system.\n\n  Medicare currently provides for reimbursement of nurse practitioners, \nphysicians' assistants, and clinical nurse specialists working with \nphysicians. But the ad hoc fashion in which the various payment \nmechanisms have been established results in wide reimbursement \nvariations in different settings and among different providers.\n  Our national budget situation requires that we approach Medicare \nreimbursement policies in a sensible way. This legislation is one \nexample of how Medicare can and should promote the use of cost-\neffective providers to a much higher degree, without compromising the \nquality of care that older Americans receive.\n  Today's Medicare requirements can hinder the ability of practices to \nset up satellite clinics that are staffed by providers other than \nphysicians. For example, although the State of North Dakota allows for \nbroad use of such providers, the reimbursement levels provided by \nMedicare can create difficulty both for the providers and the practices \nthemselves.\n  In rural North Dakota, and in rural communities throughout the \nNation, one or two doctors might rotate between a series of clinics. \nThe clinics might also be staffed by physician's assistants, nurse \npractitioners, or other providers. If a Medicare patient requires care \nwhen a doctor is conducting business away from the clinic, and the only \nprovider present is a physician assistant, the clinic can not be \nreimbursed by Medicare for care he or she provides to that individual--\nthe same care that would be reimbursed if the physician were in the \nnext room. The State of North Dakota allows that same physician's \nassistant to provide the care without a physician present, but Medicare \nprovides no reimbursement.\n  The Office of Technology Assessment, the Physician Payment Review \nCommission and these providers themselves have all expressed the need \nfor consistency, and for a reimbursement scheme that acknowledges \nreality of today's medial marketplace.\n  Greater use of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and \nclinical nurse specialists can improve our ability to provide health \ncare services in areas where access to providers can be difficult. \nThese providers have historically been willing to move to both rural \nand inner-city areas that are underserved by health care providers. In \nfact, they are located in about 50 communities throughout North Dakota.\n  Many communities that cannot support a physician can support a full-\ntime nurse practitioner or physician assistant. As I have already \ndiscussed, some towns already utilize these providers to some extent. \nNorth Dakotans and residents of many other States recognize the value \nof each of these health care professionals, and appreciate the access \nto quality care they provide.\n  Although North Dakota maximizes access to health care for our rural \nresidents by allowing for relatively broad utilization of these \nproviders, our efforts are impeded by an irrational Federal \nreimbursement scheme. But no matter what the State of North Dakota \ndoes, unless changes are made in Federal reimbursement, we will never \nencourage use of this group of health care professionals to the extent \nthat rural Americans need.\n  The bills Senator Grassley and I are introducing would help eliminate \nthe existing barriers to using these important primary care providers. \nThe bills provide each of these provider groups with reimbursement at \n85 percent of the physician fee schedule for the services they provide. \nThe 85 percent level represents a compromise relative to the \nlegislation we introduced in the 103d Congress. It is consistent with a \nprovision that was included in all of the major health reform \nlegislation before the Senate last year--the Mainstream coalition \nproposal as well as the health reform proposals made by Senators \nMitchell and Dole.\n  Our proposals also allow for a bonus payment to these providers if \nthey elect the practice in Health Professional Shortage Areas [HPSAs]. \nAll but six counties in North Dakota are completely or partially \ndesignated as HPSAs. The health care access problems residents of those \ncounties experience could be substantially alleviated by the presence \nof this special class of primary care providers. Finally, our \nlegislation ensure that a nurse practitioner from a rural area who \nfollows a patient into an inpatient setting will get paid for doing so.\n  The improvements that Senator Grassley and I advocate will pay \ndividends in improved access to health care for Americans living in \nrural and urban areas alike. They were items about which Democrats and \nRepublicans had a great deal of agreement during health care reform \nlast year. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to \nimprove health care access for rural Americans.\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 866. A bill to reform prison litigation, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      prison litigation reform act\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, in introducing the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n  Over the past two decades, we have witnessed an alarming explosion in \nthe number of lawsuits filed by State and Federal prisoners. According \nto enterprise institute scholar Walter Berns, the number of ``due-\nprocess and cruel and unusual punishment'' complaints filed by \nprisoners has grown astronomically--from 6,600 in 1975 to more than \n39,000 in 1994. As Chief Justice William Rehnquist has pointed out, \nprisoners will now ``litigate at the drop of a hat,'' simply because \nthey have little to lose and everything to gain. Prisoners have filed \nlawsuits claiming such grievances as insufficient storage locker space, \nbeing prohibited from attending a wedding anniversary party, and yes, \nbeing served creamy peanut butter instead of the chunky variety they \nhad ordered.\n  Unfortunately, prisoner litigation does not operate in a vacuum. \nFrivolous lawsuits filed by prisoners tie up the courts, waste valuable \njudicial and legal resources, and affect the quality of justice enjoyed \nby the law-abiding population.\n  According to Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, 45 percent of the \ncivil cases filed in Arizona's Federal courts last year were filed by \nState prisoners. That means that 20,000 prisoners in Arizona filed \nalmost as many cases as Arizona's 3.5 million law-abiding citizens. The \ntime and money spent defending most of these cases are clearly time and \nmoney that could be better spent prosecuting criminals, fighting \n[[Page S7525]] illegal drugs, or cracking down on consumer fraud.\n\n\n                              garnishment\n\n  The bottom line is that prisons should be prisons, not law firms. \nThat's why the Prison Litigation Reform Act would require prisoners who \nfile lawsuits to pay the full amount of their court fees and other \ncosts.\n  Many prisoners filing lawsuits today in Federal court claim indigent \nstatus. As indigents, prisoners are generally not required to pay the \nfees that normally accompany the filing of a lawsuit. In other words, \nthere is no economic disincentive to going to court.\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act would change this by establishing a \ngarnishment procedure: If a prisoner is unable to fully pay court fees \nand other costs at the time of filing a lawsuit, 20 percent of the \nfunds in his account would be garnished for this purpose. Every month \nthereafter, an additional 20 percent of the\n income credited to the prisoner's account would be garnished, until \nthe full amount of the court fees and costs are paid-off.\n\n  When average law-abiding citizens file a lawsuit, they recognize that \nthere could be an economic downside to going to court. Convicted \ncriminals shouldn't get preferential treatment: If a law-abiding \ncitizen has to pay the costs associated with a lawsuit, so too should a \nconvicted criminal.\n  In addition, when prisoners know that they will have to pay these \ncosts--perhaps not at the time of filing, but eventually--they will be \nless inclined to file a lawsuit in the first place.\n\n\n                           judicial screening\n\n  Another provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act would require \njudicial screening, before docketing, of any civil complaint filed by a \nprisoner seeking relief from the Government under section 1983 of title \n42, a reconstruction-era statute that permits actions against State \nofficials who deprive ``any citizen of the United States * * * of the \nrights, privileges, or immunities guaranteed by the constitution.'' \nThis provision would allow a Federal judge to immediately dismiss a \ncomplaint under section 1983 if either of two conditions is met: First, \nthe complaint does not state a claim upon which relief may be granted, \nor second, the defendant is immune from suit.\n\n\n                             other reforms\n\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act would also punish Federal prisoners \nwho file frivolous lawsuits by requiring them to forfeit any good-time \ncredits they may have accumulated. Why should we provide ``good-time'' \ncredits to Federal prisoners who waste taxpayer dollars and valuable \njudicial resources with unnecessary lawsuits?\n  The act also requires State prisoners to exhaust all administrative \nremedies before filing a lawsuit in Federal court.\n  In addition, the act amends both the Civil Rights of \nInstitutionalized Persons Act and the Federal Tort Claims Act to \nprohibit prisoners from suing for mental or emotional injury while in \ncustody, absent a showing of physical injury.\n  If enacted, all of these provisions would go a long way to curtail \nfrivolous prisoner litigation.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to express my thanks to Arizona \nAttorney General Grant Woods. In many respects, the Prison Litigation \nReform Act is modeled after the attorney general's own State initiative \nin Arizona. Without the invaluable input of Attorney General Woods and \nhis staff, Senator Kyl and I would not be here today introducing this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act be reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 865\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I join Senator Dole in introducing the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. This bill will deter frivolous inmate \nlawsuits. Statistics complied by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts show that inmate suits are clogging the courts and draining \nprecious judicial resources. Nationally, in 1994, a total of 238,590 \ncivil cases were brought in U.S. district court. More than one-fourth \nof these cases--60,086--were brought by prisoners.\n  Most inmate lawsuits are meritless. Courts have complained about the \nabundance of such cases. Filing frivolous civil rights lawsuits has \nbecome a recreational activity for long-term residents of our prisons. \nJames v. Quinlan, 886 F.2d 37, 40 n. 5 (3rd Cir. 1989) quoting Gabel v. \nLynaugh, 835 F.2d 124, 125 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1988) (per curiam). Indeed, \nin Gabel, the fifth circuit expressed frustration with the glut of \n``frivolous or malicious appeals by disgruntled state prisoners.'' \nGabel v. Lynaugh, 835 F.2d 124, 125 (per curiam). The court wrote:\n\n       About one appeal in every six which came to our docket \n     (17.3%) the last four months was a state prisoner's pro se \n     civil rights case. A high percentage of these are meritless, \n     and many are transparently frivolous. So far in the current \n     year (July 1-October 31, 1987), for example, the percentage \n     of such appeals in which reversal occurred was 5.08. Partial \n     reversal occurred in another 2.54%, for a total of 7.62% in \n     which any relief was granted. . . . Over 92% were either \n     dismissed or affirmed in full.\n       For the same period section 1983 prisoner appeals \n     prosecuted without counsel were our largest single category \n     of cases which survived long enough to be briefed and enter \n     our screening process so as to require full panel \n     consideration. The number of these stands at almost 22%, with \n     the next largest category--diversity cases--coming in at 16%, \n     federal question appeals at 14.5%, and both general civil \n     rights cases and criminal appeals coming in at something over \n     11% each. Such figures suggest that pro se civil rights \n     litigation has become a recreational activity for state \n     prisoners in our Circuit . . . Id.\n\n  As Walter Berns recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ``Nowhere \nis [the] problem [of frivolous lawsuits] more pressing than in our \nprison system.'' (April 24, 1995) Legislation is needed because of the \nlarge and growing number of prisoner civil rights complaints, the \nburden that disposing of meritless complaints imposes on efficient \njudicial administration, and the need to discourage prisoners from \nfiling frivolous complaints as a means of gaining a ``short sabbatical \nin the nearest Federal courthouse.'' Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 327 \n(1972) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\n  The Dole-Kyl ``Prisoner Litigation Reform Act'' will:\n  Remove the ability of prisoners to file free lawsuits, instead making \nthem pay full filing fees and court costs.\n  Require judges to dismiss frivolous cases before they bog down the \ncourt system.\n  Prohibit inmate lawsuits for mental and emotional distress.\n  Retract good-time credit earned by inmates if they file lawsuits \ndeemed frivolous.\n  Require the exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n  The Dole-Kyl bill is based on similar provisions that were enacted in \nArizona. Arizona's recent reforms have already reduced State prisoner \ncases by 50 percent. Now is the time to reproduce these commonsense \nreforms in Federal law. If we achieve a 50-percent reduction in bogus \nFederal prisoner claims, we will free up judicial resources for claims \nwith merit by both prisoners and nonprisoners.\n  Section 2 of the bill covers proceedings in forma pauperis. It adds a \nnew subsection to 28 U.S.C. section 1915. The subsection provides that \nwhenever a Federal, State, or local prisoner seeks to commence an \naction or proceeding in Federal court as a poor person, the prisoner \nmust pay a partial filing fee of 20 percent of the larger of the \naverage monthly balance in, or the average monthly deposits to, his \ninmate account. The fee may not exceed the full statutory fee. If the \ninmate can show that circumstances render him unable to make payment of \neven the partial fee, the court has the power to waive the entire \nfiling fee.\n  Section 2 will require prisoners to pay a very small share of the \nlarge burden they place on the Federal judicial system by paying a \nsmall filing fee upon commencement of lawsuits. In doing so, the \nprovision will deter frivolous inmate lawsuits. The modest monetary \noutlay will force prisoners to think twice about the case and not just \nfile reflexively. Lumbert v. Illinois Department of Correction, 837 \nF.2d 257, 259 (7th Cir. 1987) (Posner, J.). Prisoners will have to make \nthe same decision that law-abiding Americans must make: Is the lawsuit \nworth the price? Criminals should not be given a special privilege that \nother Americans do not have. The only thing different about a criminal \nis that he has raped, robbed, or killed. A criminal should not be \nrewarded for these actions.\n  The volume of prisoner litigation represents a large burden on the \njudicial system, which is already overburdened by increases in \nnonprisoner litigation. Yet prisoners have very little incentive not to \nfile nonmeritorious lawsuits. Unlike other prospective litigants who \nseek poor person status, prisoners have all the necessities of life \nsupplied, including the materials required to bring their lawsuits. For \na prisoner who qualifies for poor person status, there is no cost to \nbring a suit and, therefore, no incentive to limit suits to cases that \nhave some chance of success.\n  The filing fee is small enough not to deter a prisoner with a \nmeritorious claim, yet large enough to deter frivolous claims and \nmultiple filings. As noted above, the bill contains a provision to \nwaive even the partial filing fee. This provision assures that \nprisoners with meritorious claims will not be shut out from court for \nlack of sufficient money to pay even the partial fee.\n  Finally, section 2 of the Dole-Kyl bill also imposes the same payment \nsystem for court costs as it does for filing fees. This provision, like \nthe filing fee provision, will ensure that inmates evaluate the merits \nof their claims.\n  Section 3 of this bill creates a new statute that requires judicial \nscreening of a complaint, or any portion of the complaint, in a civil \naction in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or \nofficer or employee of a governmental entity. The bill establishes two \nstandards a prisoner must meet. Under the first standard, the court \nmust dismiss the complaint if satisfied that the complaint fails to \nstate a claim on which relief may be [[Page S7527]] granted. Under the \nsecond standard, the court must dismiss claims for monetary relief from \na defendant who is immune from such relief.\n  Sections 4 and 5 of the bill will bar inmate lawsuits for mental or \nemotional injury suffered while in custody unless they can show \nphysical injury. Of the 60,086 prisoner petitions in 1994 about two-\nthirds were prisoner civil rights petitions, according to the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. courts. Prisoner civil rights \npetitions are brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983. Section 1983 petitions are \nclaims brought in Federal court by State inmates seeking redress for a \nviolation of their civil rights. ``The volume of section 1983 \nlitigation is substantial by any standard,'' according to the Justice \nDepartment's report on section 1983 litigation, ``Challenging the \nConditions of Prisons and Jails.'' Indeed, the Administrative Office \n[AO] of the U.S. courts counted only 218 cases in 1966, the first year \nthat State prisoners' rights cases were recorded as a specific category \nof litigation. The number climbed to 26,824 by 1992. When compared to \nthe total number of all civil cases filed in the Nation's U.S. district \ncourts, more than 1 in every 10 civil filings is now a section 1983 \nlawsuit, according to the AO.\n  Section 6 of the bill will deter frivolous suits by adding to the \nU.S.C. a sanction to revoke good-time credits when a frivolous suit is \nfiled. Specifically, the bill would require that in a civil action \nbrought by an adult convicted of a crime and confined in a Federal \ncorrectional facility, the court may order the revocation of earned \ngood-time credit if the court finds that: First, the claim was filed \nfor a malicious purpose, second, the claim was filed solely to harass \nthe party against which it was filed, or third, the claimant testifies \nfalsely or otherwise knowingly presents false evidence or information \nto the court. Additionally, if the Attorney General determines that any \nof these criteria have been met, the Attorney General may recommend the \nrevocation of earned good-time credit to the court.\n  Section 7 will make the exhaustion of administrative remedies \nmandatory. Many prisoner cases seek relief for matters that are \nrelatively minor and for which the prison grievance system would \nprovide an adequate remedy. Section 7 of this bill would require an \ninmate, prior to filing a complaint under 42 U.S.C. section 1983, to \nexhaust all available administrative remedies certified as adequate by \nthe U.S. attorney general. An exhaustion requirement is appropriate for \nprisoners given the burden that their cases place on the Federal court \nsystem, the availability of administrative remedies, and the lack of \nmerit of many of the claims filed under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.\n  Mr. President, in a dissenting opinion in Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 \nU.S. 193, 211 (1985), then-Justice Rehnquist wrote, ``With less to \nprofitably occupy their time than potential litigants on the outside, \nand with a justified feeling that they have much to gain and virtually \nnothing to lose, prisoners appear to be far more prolific litigants \nthan other groups in the population.'' The Dole-Kyl bill will stem the \ntide of meritless prisoner cases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 24, 1995]\n\n          Sue the Warden, Sue the Chef, Sue the Gardener . . .\n\n                           (By Walter Berns)\n\n       The Senate's debate this week on tort reform will focus the \n     public spotlight on frivolous lawsuits. Nowhere is this \n     problem more pressing than in our prison system. As one \n     federal appeals court judge said recently, filing civil \n     rights suits has become a ``recreational activity'' for long-\n     term inmates. Among his examples of ``excessive filings'': \n     more than 100 by Harry Franklin (who, in one of them, sued a \n     prison official for ``overwatering the lawn''), 184 in three \n     years by John Robert Demos, and--so far the winning score--\n     more than 700 by the ``Reverend'' Clovis Carl Green Jr.\n       Disenting in a case that reached the Supreme Court in 1985, \n     Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted that prisoners are not \n     subject to many of the constraints that deter litigiousness \n     among the population at large. Most prisoners qualify for in \n     forma pauperis status, which entitles them to commence an \n     action ``without prepayment of fees and costs or security \n     therefor,'' and all of them are entitled to free access to \n     law books or some other legal assistance. As the chief \n     justice said, with time on their hands, and with much to gain \n     and virtually nothing to lose, prisoners ``litigate at the \n     drop of a hat.''\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist was not referring to appeals by \n     defendants protesting their innocence, but to the suits \n     initiated by people claiming a deprivation of their rights \n     while in prison. Since almost any disciplinary or \n     administrative action taken by prison officials now can give \n     rise to a due process or cruel-and-unusual-punishment \n     complaint, the number of these suits is growing at a rate \n     that goes far to explain the ``litigation explosion'': from \n     6,606 in 1975 to 39,065 in 1994 (of which ``only'' 1,100 \n     reached the Supreme Court).\n       Of the 1994 total, 37,925 were filed by state prisoners \n     under a section of the so-called Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, \n     which permits actions for damages against state officials who \n     deprive ``any citizen of the United States or other person \n     under the jurisdiction thereof, [of] any rights, privileges, \n     or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.'' This \n     statute came into its own in 1961 when the Supreme Court \n     permitted a damage action filed by members of a black family \n     who (with good reason) claimed that Chicago police officers \n     had deprived them of the Fourth Amendment right ``to be \n     secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against \n     unreasonable searches and seizures.'' Today, the statute is \n     used mostly by prisoners who, invoking one or another \n     constitutional right, complain of just about anything and \n     everything.\n       They invoke the cruel-and-unusual-punishment provision of \n     the Eighth Amendment not only when beaten or raped by prison \n     guards, but when shot during a prison riot, or when required \n     to share a cell with a heavy smoker, or when given \n     insufficient storage locker space, or when given creamy \n     peanut butter instead of the chunky variety they ordered.\n       They involve the First Amendment when forbidden to enter \n     into marriage, or to correspond with inmates in other state \n     prisons. John Robert Demos sued one prison official for not \n     addressing him by his Islamic name.\n       And there is probably not a prison regulation whose \n     enforcement does not, or at least may not, give rise to a \n     14th Amendment (or, in the case of federal prisoners, a Fifth \n     amendment) due process complaint. Requiring elaborate trials \n     or evidentiary proceedings, these especially, are the cases \n     that try the patience of the judges. Still, reviewing these \n     complaints imposes a particular burden on administrative \n     officials who, unlike the judges, can be sued for damages.\n       Consider a recent due process case involving a New York \n     state inmate.\n       In five separate hearings, prison officers found inmate \n     Jerry Young guilty of violating various prison rules and \n     sentenced him to punitive segregation and deprived him of \n     inmate privileges. Appeals from the disciplinary decisions in \n     the 66 state prisons are directed to Donald Selsky, a \n     Department of Correctional Services official who, in a \n     typical year, hears more than 5,000 such appeals. Young sued \n     the prison hearing officers, claiming that they had denied \n     his request to call 31 inmates and two staff officers as \n     witnesses, and that they failed to provide him with adequate \n     legal assistance; he also sued Mr. Selsky, claiming he had \n     violated his due process rights by affirming the decisions \n     made by the hearing officers. From Mr. Selsky he demanded \n     $200 in punitive damages, $200, in compensatory damages, and \n     $200 in exemplary damages for each day of his segregated \n     confinement.\n       Mr. Selsky is currently the defendant in 156 such suits, \n     but the state provides him with legal representation, and, if \n     he is found liable, will indemnity him unless the damages \n     ``resulted from [his] intentional wrongdoing,'' Since he \n     bears the burden of providing that it was ``objectively \n     reasonable to conclude that the prisoners' constitutional \n     rights were not violated.'' he may or may not find this \n     reassuring.\n       The Republican crime bill passed by the House in the first \n     100 days aims to reduce the number of such suits--first, by \n     prohibiting the filing of an action in Federal court by adult \n     state prisoners until they have exhausted all the remedies \n     available to them in the states, and, second, by permitting \n     federal judges to dismiss an in forma pauperis case ``if the \n     allegation of poverty is untrue, or if satisfied that the \n     action fails to state a claim upon which relief may be \n     granted or is frivolous or malicious, even if the partial \n     filing fees have been imposed by the court.''\n       These provisions seem reasonable, but it remains to be seen \n     whether the Senate and the president will find them so. And \n     only time will tell whether they are adequate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Tucson Citizen, Feb. 2, 1995]\n\n                Cost of Inmates' Frivolous Suits Is High\n\n       Almost 400 times last year, inmates in Arizona prison sued \n     the state. Some of their claims:\n       An inmate wasn't allowed to go to his parents' wedding \n     anniversary party; another said he was subject to cruel and \n     unusual punishment because he wasn't allowed to attend his \n     father's funeral.\n       An inmate claimed that he lost his Reebok tennis shoes \n     because of gross negligence by the state. Another said the \n     state lost his sunglasses.\n       A woman inmate said the jeans she was issued didn't fit \n     properly.\n       An inmate sued because he wasn't allowed to hang a tapestry \n     in his cell. [[Page S7528]] \n       When the state decided that inmates would not be allowed to \n     see movies with exposed breasts and genitals, an inmate \n     claimed that violated his Constitutional rights.\n       Inmates claimed the state stole money from their prison \n     accounts. But another inmate claimed the state illegally \n     deposited money in his account, disqualifying him as an \n     indigent.\n       An inmate claimed he was wrongly disciplined for refusing \n     to change the television from a Spanish-language channel.\n       An inmate said he was not provided the proper books for a \n     black studies class he was taking.\n       Several inmates said they weren't allowed to go to the \n     bathroom while using the law library.\n       One inmate was denied access to the law library after he \n     kicked and tampered with a security device in the library.\n       An inmate said he wasn't allowed to get married.\n       An inmate said he was forced to work and not paid minimum \n     wage.\n       Lawsuits filed by inmates are expensive for Arizona \n     taxpayers. The Attorney General's Office budgets $1.5 million \n     per year to fight the suits, not including court costs. Other \n     state departments also pay some costs.\n       To cut down on the number of frivolous suits filed, the \n     state Legislature last year passed a law that requires \n     inmates to pay part or all of the filing costs from money \n     earned in prison jobs. In addition, inmates who filed \n     unsubstantiated or harassing lawsuits can be forced to \n     forfeit five days of good-behavior credit.\n       The new law didn't slow down Mitchell H. Jackson, a \n     convicted drug dealer incarcerated at the state prison in \n     Tucson. Jackson has filed 22 suits against the state in \n     recent years. He got off to a good start in 1995, filing two \n     in the first week.\n       In one of his suits, he targets the new law requiring \n     inmates to pay filing fees. He claims that has caused him \n     ``mental anguish and emotional distress.'' He wants $10 \n     million from each of the 90 legislators--a total of almost $1 \n     billion.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7498-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 240\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of S. 240, a bill to amend the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to establish a filing deadline and to \nprovide certain safeguards to ensure that the interests of investors \nare well protected under the implied private action provisions of the \nact.\n\n\n                                 S. 245\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cohen, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n[Mr. Nunn] was added as a cosponsor of S. 245, a bill to provide for \nenhanced penalties for health care fraud, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 256, a bill to amend title 10, \nUnited States Code, to establish procedures for determining the status \nof certain missing members of the Armed Forces and certain civilians, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 327, a bill \nto amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide clarification for \nthe deductibility of expenses incurred by a taxpayer in connection with \nthe business use of the home.\n\n\n                                 S. 490\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 490, a bill to amend the \nClean Air Act to exempt agriculture-related facilities from certain \npermitting requirements, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 515\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 515, a bill to \namend the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products \nInspection Act to provide for improved public health and food safety \nthrough the reduction of harmful substances in meat and poultry that \npresent a threat to public health, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 714\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun] was added as a cosponsor of S. 714, a bill to \nrequire the Attorney General to study and report to Congress on means \nof controlling the flow of violent, sexually explicit, harassing, \noffensive, or otherwise unwanted material in interactive \ntelecommunications systems.\n\n\n                                 S. 758\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 758, a bill to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to provide for S corporation reform, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nPackwood] was added as a cosponsor of S. 770, a bill to provide for the \nrelocation of the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 816\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 816, a bill \nto provide equal protection for victims of crime, to facilitate the \nexchange of information between Federal and State law enforcement and \ninvestigation entities, to reform criminal procedure, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Resolution 3\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the name of the Senator from Washington \n[Mr. Gorton] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n3, a concurrent resolution relative to Taiwan and the United Nations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7528-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 15--RELATIVE TO THE COSTS OF INTERNATIONAL \n                        PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES\n\n  Ms. SNOWE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

In the United States, this news was \ngreeted with very strong concern that this Russian nuclear technology \nwould be used to support Iran's nuclear weapons development program.\n  At the recent summit in Moscow, Russian President Yeltsin was asked \nby President Clinton to cancel the reactor sale to Iran. Yeltsin would \nnot. Instead, he offered us a fig leaf when he cancelled the Russian \nsale of a gas centrifuge to Iran and halted the training of 10 to 20 \nIran scientists a year in Moscow.\n  Iran is aggressively pursuing a nuclear-weapons acquisition program. \nThe CIA said last September that Iran probably could, with some foreign \nhelp, acquire a nuclear weapons capability within 8 to 10 years. And \nIran is receiving that foreign help, and it is not just from the \nRussians. China is helping Iran build a nuclear research reactor, and \nin April it concluded a deal to sell Iran two light-water reactors. \nPakistan, a country with its own significant nuclear weapons program, \nhas reportedly provided key technical assistance to Iran.\n  Iran's nuclear weapons program is not the only cause for concern. The \nDefense Department is increasingly concerned about--and is closely \nwatching--the Iranian military buildup in the Persian Gulf.\n  Let me just review some of the disturbing facts about this Iranian \nbuildup. Iran has acquired as many as 30 Mig-29's out of a reported \ndeal with Russia for 50 of these modern combat jets, and Russia has \nalso sold Iran sophisticated air-to-air missiles to arm these aircraft. \nIran has received numerous surface-to-air missile systems from both \nRussia and China. Iran's submarine force consists of two modern \nRussian-made Kilo-class submarines, and a third is expected to be \ndelivered. Russia also provided Iran with sophisticated torpedoes for \nthese subs.\n  In addition, despite U.S. pressure, Poland is going ahead with the \nplanned sale to Iran of over 100 T-72 tanks, and Iran has also taken \ndelivery of several hundred other T-72's from Russia. And over the last \nfew years Iran has reportedly acquired several hundred improved Scud \nmissiles from North Korea.\n  Iran has asserted control over the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, \nwhich it had been previously sharing with the United Arab Emirates. And \nIran has moved air defense missile systems, tanks, additional troops, \nartillery, and surface-to-surface missiles onto islands in the Persian \nGulf, some of which are disputed between Iran and the United Arab \nEmirates.\n  Mr. President, Iran's military buildup in the Persian Gulf and its \naggressive nuclear program should be of serious concern to us all. Iran \nhas opposed the Middle East peace process and continues to support the \nterrorist group Hezballah in Lebanon and radical Palestinian groups. \nAnd whether Russia realizes it or not, Iran also poses a long-term \nthreat to them as well. A nuclear-armed Iran poses just as great a \nthreat to Russia as it does to United States interests in the Persian \nGulf and the Middle East. President Clinton tried to reason with the \nRussians earlier this month, but they refused to listen. Russia's \nmisguided commercial agreement to sell nuclear technology to Iran \nshould be condemned.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7528-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7529-S7530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 125--HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FATHER JOSEPH \n                           DAMIEN DE VEUSTER\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nSimon, and Mr. Murkowski) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 125\n\n       Whereas Father Joseph Damien de Veuster was born in \n     Tremeloo, Belgium, on January 3, 1840;\n       Whereas Father Damien entered the Sacred Hearts Order at \n     Louvain, Belgium, as a postulant in January 1859 and took his \n     final vows in Paris on October 7, 1860;\n       Whereas, after arriving in Honolulu on March 19, 1864, to \n     join the Sacred Hearts Mission in Hawaii, Father Damien was \n     ordained to the priesthood in the Cathedral of Our Lady of \n     Peace on May 21, 1864;\n       Whereas Father Damien was sent to the Puna, Kohala, and \n     Hamakua districts on the island of Hawaii, where Father \n     Damien served people in isolated communities for 9 years;\n       Whereas the alarming spread of Hansen's disease, also known \n     as leprosy, for which there was no known cure, prompted the \n     Hawaiian Legislature to pass an Act to Prevent the Spread of \n     Leprosy in 1865;\n       Whereas the Act required segregating those afflicted with \n     leprosy to the isolated peninsula of Kalaupapa, Molokai, \n     where those afflicted by leprosy were virtually imprisoned by \n     steep cliffs and open seas;\n       Whereas those afflicted by leprosy were forced to separate \n     from their families, had meager medical care and supplies, \n     and had poor living and social conditions;\n       Whereas in July 1872, Father Damien wrote to the Father \n     General that many of his parishioners had been sent to the \n     settlement on Molokai and lamented that he should join them;\n       Whereas on May 12, 1873, Father Damien petitioned Bishop \n     Maigret, having received a request earlier for a resident \n     priest at Kalaupapa, to allow Father Damien to stay on \n     Molokai and devote his life to leprosy patients;\n       Whereas for 16 years, from 1873 to 1889, Father Damien \n     labored to bring material and spiritual comfort to the \n     leprosy patients of Kalaupapa, building chapels, water \n     cisterns, and boys and girls homes;\n       Whereas on April 15, 1889, at the age of 49, Father Damien \n     died of leprosy contracted a few years earlier;\n       Whereas the Roman Catholic Church began the consideration \n     of beatification of Father Damien in February 1955, and \n     Father Damien will be beatified on June 4, 1995, by Pope John \n     Paul II in Brussels, Belgium;\n       Whereas Father Damien was selected by the State of Hawaii \n     in 1965 as 1 of the distinguished citizens of the State\n      whose statue would be installed in Statuary Hall in the \n     United States Capitol;\n       Whereas the life of Father Damien continues to be a \n     profound example of selfless devotion to others and remains \n     an inspiration for all mankind;\n       Whereas common use of sulfone drugs in the 1940's removed \n     the dreaded sentence of disfigurement and death imposed by \n     leprosy, and the 1969 repeal of the isolation law allowed \n     greater mobility for former Hansen's disease patients;\n       Whereas in the mid-1970's, the community of former leprosy \n     patients at Molokai recommended the establishment of a United \n     States National Park at Kalaupapa, out of a strong sense of \n     stewardship of the legacy left by Father Damien and the rich \n     history of Kalaupapa;\n       Whereas the Kalaupapa National Historical Park was \n     established in 1980 with a provision that former Hansen's \n     disease patients may remain in the park as long as they wish; \n     and\n       Whereas the remaining patients at Kalaupapa, many of whom \n     were exiled as children or young adults and who have endured \n     immeasurable hardships and untold sorrows, are a special \n     legacy for America, exemplifying the dignity and strength of \n     the human spirit: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States recognizes \n     Father Damien for his service to humanity and takes this \n     occasion to--\n       (1) celebrate achievements of modern medicine in combating \n     the once-dreaded leprosy disease; [[Page S7530]] \n       (2) remember that victims of leprosy still suffer social \n     banishment in many parts of the world; and\n       (3) honor the people of Kalaupapa as a living American \n     legacy of human spirit and dignity.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7529-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          SENATE RESOLUTION 126--TO AMEND THE SENATE GIFT RULE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NUTRITIONAL HEALTH \n                   OF CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal nutrition programs, such as the school lunch \n     program, the school breakfast program, the special \n     supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and \n     children (referred to in this section as ``WIC''), the child \n     and adult care food program, and others, are important to the \n     health and well-being of children;\n       (2) participation in Federal nutrition programs is \n     voluntary on the part of States, and the programs are \n     administered and operated by every State;\n       (3) a major factor that led to the creation of the school \n     lunch program was that a number of the recruits for the \n     United States armed forces in World War II failed physical \n     examinations due to problems related to inadequate nutrition;\n       (4)(A) WIC has proven to be extremely valuable in promoting \n     the health of newborn babies and children; and\n       (B) each dollar invested in the prenatal component of WIC \n     has been shown to save up to $3.50 in medicaid costs related \n     to medical problems that arise in the first 90 days after the \n     birth of an infant;\n       (5) the requirement that infant formula be purchased under \n     a competitive bidding system under section 17 of the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786) saved $1,000,000,000 \n     in fiscal year 1994 and enabled States to allow 1,600,000 \n     women, infants, and children to participate in WIC at no \n     additional cost to taxpayers; and\n       (6) a balanced Federal budget will provide economic \n     benefits to children alive today and to future generations of \n     Americans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution include the assumptions that--\n       (1) schools should continue to serve lunches that meet \n     minimum nutritional requirements based on tested nutritional \n     research;\n       (2) the content of WIC food packages for infants, children, \n     and pregnant and postpartum women should continue to be based \n     on scientific evidence;\n       (3) the competitive bidding system for infant formula under \n     section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n     1786) should be maintained;\n       (4) foods of minimum nutritional value should not be sold \n     in competition with school lunches in the school cafeterias \n     during lunch hours;\n       (5) some reductions in nutrition program spending can be \n     made without compromising the nutritional well-being of \n     program recipients;\n       (6) in complying with the reconciliation instructions in \n     section 6 of this resolution, the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate should take this \n     section into account; and\n       (7) Congress should continue to move toward fully funding \n     the WIC program.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 1171\n\n  Mr. EXON (for Mr. Leahy) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III of the resolution, add the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MAINTAINING FEDERAL FUNDING \n                   FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedoms and security;\n       (2) law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation and \n     support;\n       (3) law enforcement officers and agencies are under \n     increasing attacks, both to their physical safety and to \n     their reputations;\n       (4) on April 7, 1995, the Senate passed S.J. Res. 32 in \n     which the Senate recognizes the debt of gratitude the Nation \n     owes to the men and women who daily serve the American people \n     as law enforcement officers and the integrity, honesty, \n     dedication, and sacrifice of our Federal, State, and local \n     law enforcement officers;\n       (5) the Nation's sense of domestic tranquility has been \n     shaken by explosions at the World Trade Center in New York \n     and the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and by the \n     fear of violent crime in our cities, towns, and rural areas \n     across the nation;\n       (6) Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts need \n     increased financial commitment from the Federal Government \n     and not the reduction of such commitment to law enforcement \n     if law enforcement officers are to carry out their efforts to \n     combat violent crime; and\n       (7) on April 5, 1995, and May 18, 1995, the House of \n     Representatives has nonetheless voted to reduce \n     $5,000,000,000 from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund in \n     order to provide for tax cuts in both H.R. 1215 and H. Con. \n     Res. 67.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that the Federal Government's commitment to \n     fund Federal law enforcement programs and programs to assist \n     State and local efforts should be maintained and funding for \n     the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund should not be reduced \n     by $5,000,000,000 as the bill and resolution passed by the \n     House of Representatives would require.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 HARKIN (AND GRAHAM) AMENDMENT NO. 1172\n\n  Mr. EXON (for Mr. Harkin, for himself and Mr. Graham) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution \n13, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 77, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

BUDGET SURPLUS ALLOWANCE.\n\n       (a) Adjustments.--For the purposes of points of order under \n     the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 \n     and this concurrent resolution on the budget, the appropriate \n     allocations and budgetary aggregates and levels shall be \n     revised to reflect the additional deficit reduction achieved \n     as calculated under subsection (c) for legislation that \n     reduces the adverse effects on medicare, medicaid, and \n     welfare reform in the following manner:\n       (1) $60,000,000,000 shall be used for medicare legislation \n     which will reduce the adverse effects of--\n       (A) increased premiums;\n       (B) increased deductibles;\n       (C) increased copayments;\n       (D) limits on the freedom to select the doctor of one's \n     choice; and\n       (E) reduced or eliminated benefits caused by restrictions \n     on eligibility or services. These additional medicare \n     appropriations shall be allocated among the various \n     components of the medicare program in a manner that maintains \n     the solvency of the Federal Hospital Insurance (FHI) Trust \n     Fund for the same time period established through program \n     revisions enacted in the 1995 budget reconciliation bill.\n       (2) $50,000,000,000 shall be used for legislation that \n     reduces the adverse affects upon the elderly, disabled, and \n     children who have nowhere else to turn but medicaid for \n     health care.\n       (3) $60,000,000,000 shall be used for legislation that \n     reduces the drastic cuts to welfare programs.\n       (4) If the Congressional Budget Office scores this surplus \n     differently, than the amounts provided in paragraphs (1) \n     through (3) shall be increased or decreased proportionally.\n       (b) Revised Allocations and Aggregates.--Upon the reporting \n     of legislation pursuant to subsection (a), and again upon the \n     submission of a conference report on such legislation (if a \n     conference report is submitted), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on Budget of the Senate may submit to the Senate \n     appropriately revised allocations under sections 302(a) and \n     602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and levels \n     under this resolution, revised by an amount that does not \n     exceed the additional deficit reduction calculated under \n     subsection (d).\n       (c) CBO Revised Deficit Estimate.--After the enactment of \n     legislation that complies with the reconciliation directives \n     of section 6, the Congressional Budget Office shall provide \n     the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate a \n     revised estimate of the deficit for fiscal years 1996 through \n     2005.\n       (d) Additional Deficit Reduction.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``additional deficit reduction'' means the \n     amount by which the total deficit levels assumed in this \n     resolution for a fiscal year exceed the \n     [[Page S7540]] revised deficit estimate provided pursuant to \n     subsection (c) for such fiscal year for fiscal years 1996 \n     through 2005.\n       (e) CBO Certification and Contingencies.--This section \n     shall not apply unless--\n       (1) legislation has been enacted complying with the \n     reconciliation directives of section 6;\n       (2) the Director of the Congressional Budget Office has \n     provided the estimate required by subsection (c); and\n       (3) the revisions made pursuant to this subsection do not \n     cause a budget deficit for fiscal year 2002, 2003, 2004, or \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 204. SCORING OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 606(d)(2) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 and beginning with fiscal year 1996, the \n     determinations under sections 302, 303, and 311 of such Act \n     shall take into account any new budget authority, new \n     entitlement authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit effects \n     as a consequence of the provisions of section 251(b)(2)(D) \n     and 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n\n     SEC. 205. SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the prohibition on scoring asset sales has discouraged \n     the sale of assets that can be better managed by the private \n     sector and generate receipts to reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit;\n       (2) the President's fiscal year 1996 budget included \n     $8,000,000,000 in receipts from asset sales and proposed a \n     change in the asset sale scoring rule to allow the proceeds \n     from these sales to be scored;\n       (3) assets should not be sold if such sale would increase \n     the budget deficit over the long run; and\n       (4) the asset sale scoring prohibition should be repealed \n     and consideration should be given to replacing it with a \n     methodology that takes into account the long-term budgetary \n     impact of asset sales.\n       (b) Budgetary Treatment.--For purposes of any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget and the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the amounts realized from \n     sales of assets shall be scored with respect to the level of \n     budget authority, outlays, or revenues.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``sale of an asset'' shall have the same meaning as under \n     section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (d) Treatment of Loan Assets.--For the purposes of this \n     section, the sale of loan assets or the prepayment of a loan \n     shall be governed by the terms of the Federal Credit Reform \n     Act of 1990.\n\n     SEC. 206. EXTENSION OF BUDGET ACT 60-VOTE ENFORCEMENT THROUGH \n                   2002.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 275(b) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as amended by sections \n     13112(b) and 13208(b)(3) of the Budget Enforcement Act of \n     1990), the second sentence of section 904(c) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (except insofar as it \n     relates to section 313 of that Act) and the final sentence of \n     section 904(d) of that Act (except insofar as it relates to \n     section 313 of that Act) shall continue to have effect as \n     rules of the Senate through (but no later than) September 30, \n     2002.\n\n     SEC. 207. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       The Senate adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, \n     and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of \n     the Senate, and such rules shall supersede other rules only \n     to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     the Senate) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.\n            TITLE III--SENSE OF THE CONGRESS AND THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON REVENUE INSTRUCTION TO \n                   FINANCE COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) to balance the Federal budget in a rational and \n     reasonable manner, there must be a fair and equitable \n     distribution of the deficit reduction burden;\n       (2) the plan under consideration in the Senate does not ask \n     the wealthy to contribute to deficit reduction;\n       (3) the deficit reduction package approved by the Senate \n     Budget Committee would disproportionately affect those at \n     lower-income levels;\n       (4) over the next 7 years, at current growth rates, tax \n     loopholes and preferences will result in a revenue loss to \n     the Federal Government of more than $4,000,000,000,000; and\n       (5) the House Budget Committee had under consideration, but \n     did not include in its deficit reduction package, a list of \n     $335,000,000,000 in corporate tax loopholes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate Finance Committee, as part of this year's \n     reconciliation package, should limit or eliminate tax \n     loopholes that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest \n     individuals and the largest corporations in order to more \n     equitably distribute the burden of deficit reduction;\n       (2) the Senate Finance Committee should give first priority \n     to closing corporate loopholes;\n       (3) the Senate Finance Committee should also give priority \n     to closing loopholes that disproportionately benefit \n     Americans with incomes of $140,000 or more;\n       (4) in no event should taxes go up on those making less \n     than $140,000; and\n       (5) in no event should the Senate Committee on Finance \n     reduce deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable \n     contributions, or State and local taxes; and\n       (6) in no event should the Senate Finance Committee raise \n     income tax rates for individuals.\n\n     SEC. 302. RESTRUCTURING GOVERNMENT AND PROGRAM TERMINATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that to balance the Federal \n     budget in a rational and reasonable manner requires an \n     assessment of national priorities and the appropriate role of \n     the Federal Government in meeting the challenges facing the \n     United States in the 21st century.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that to balance the budget the Congress should--\n       (1) restructure Federal programs to meet identified \n     national priorities in the most effective and efficient \n     manner so that program dollars get to the intended purpose or \n     recipient;\n       (2) terminate programs that have largely met their goals, \n     that have outlived their original purpose, or that have been \n     superseded by other programs;\n       (3) seek to end significant duplication among Federal \n     programs, which results in excessive administrative costs and \n     ill serve the American people; and\n       (4) eliminate lower priority programs.\n\n     SEC. 303. NONPARTISAN ADVISORY COMMISSION ON THE CPI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress intended to insulate certain government \n     beneficiaries and taxpayers from the effects of inflation by \n     indexing payments and tax brackets to the Consumer Price \n     Index (CPI);\n       (2) approximately 30 percent of total Federal outlays and \n     45 percent of Federal revenues are indexed to reflect changes \n     in the CPI; and\n       (3) the overwhelming consensus among experts is that the \n     method used to construct the CPI and\n      the current calculation of the CPI both overstate the \n     estimate of the true cost of living.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a temporary advisory commission should be established \n     to make objective and nonpartisan recommendations concerning \n     the appropriateness and accuracy of the methodology and \n     calculations that determine the CPI;\n       (2) the Commission should be appointed on a nonpartisan \n     basis, and should be composed of experts in the fields of \n     economics, statistics, or other related professions; and\n       (3) the Commission should report its recommendations to the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics and to Congress at the earliest \n     possible date.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON A UNIFORM ACCOUNTING \n                   SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal \n     internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress \n     has been made in recent years, there still exists no uniform \n     Federal accounting system for Federal Government entities and \n     institutions.\n       (2) As a result, Federal financial management continues to \n     be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and \n     fiscal practices have failed to identify costs, failed to \n     reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions, and \n     failed to accurately report the financial condition of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Current Federal accounting practices do not adequately \n     report financial problems of the Federal Government or the \n     full cost of programs and activities. The continued use of \n     these practices undermines the Government's ability to \n     provide credible and reliable financial data, encourages \n     already widespread waste and inefficiency, and will not \n     assist in achieving a balanced budget.\n       (4) Waste and inefficiency in Federal Government undermine \n     the confidence of the American people in the Government and \n     reduces the Federal Government's ability to address \n     adequately vital public needs.\n       (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the \n     Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the \n     Federal Government, a uniform Federal accounting system, that \n     fully meets the accounting standards and reporting objectives \n     for the Federal Government, must be immediately established \n     so that all assets and liabilities, revenues and expenditures \n     or expenses, and the full cost of programs and activities of \n     the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately \n     recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout all \n     government entities for control and management evaluation \n     purposes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) a uniform Federal accounting system should be \n     established to consistently compile financial data across the \n     Federal Government, and to make full disclosure of Federal \n     financial data, including the full cost of Federal programs \n     and activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, \n     and agency management; and [[Page S7541]] \n       (2) beginning with fiscal year 1997, the President should \n     require the heads of agencies to--\n       (A) implement and maintain a uniform Federal accounting \n     system; and\n       (B) provide financial statements;\n\n     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles \n     applied on a consistent basis and established in accordance \n     with proposed Federal accounting standards and \n     interpretations recommended by the Federal Accounting \n     Standards Advisory Board and other applicable law.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT 90 PERCENT OF THE \n                   BENEFITS OF ANY TAX CUTS MUST GO TO THE MIDDLE \n                   CLASS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incomes of middle-class families have stagnated \n     since the early 1980's, with family incomes growing more \n     slowly between 1979 and 1989 than in any other business cycle \n     since World War II; and\n       (2) according to the Department of the Treasury, in 1996, \n     approximately 90 percent of American families will have \n     incomes less than $100,000.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that if the 1996 Concurrent Budget Resolution includes any \n     cut in taxes, approximately 90 percent of the benefits of \n     these tax cuts must go to working families with incomes less \n     than $100,000.\n\n     SEC. 306. BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON HEALTH CARE REFORM, \n                   MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COSTS, ACCESS AND \n                   SOLVENCY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Health Insurance for the Aged Act, which created \n     the medicare program, was enacted on July 30, 1965, and, \n     therefore, the medicare program will celebrate its 30-year \n     anniversary on July 30, 1995;\n       (2) on April 3, 1995, the Trustees of medicare submitted \n     their 1995 Annual Report on the Status of the medicare \n     program to the Congress;\n       (3) the Trustees of medicare have concluded that ``the \n     medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its present \n     form'';\n       (4) the Trustees of medicare have concluded that ``the \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays inpatient hospital \n     expenses, will be able to pay benefits for only about 7 years \n     and is severely out of financial balance in the long range'';\n       (5) the Public Trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund shows a rate \n     of growth of costs which is clearly unsustainable'';\n       (6) the Trustees of medicare have recommended ``legislation \n     to reestablish the Quadrennial Advisory Council that will \n     help lead to effective solutions to the problems of the \n     program'';\n       (7) the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \n     concluded that, absent long-term changes in medicare, \n     projected medicare outlays will increase from about 4 percent \n     of the payroll tax base today to over 15 percent of the \n     payroll tax base by the year 2030;\n       (8) the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \n     recommended, by a vote of 30 to 1, that spending and revenues \n     available for medicare must be brought into long-term \n     balance;\n       (9) the Public Trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``We had hoped for several years that comprehensive health \n     reform would include meaningful medicare reforms. However, \n     with the results of the last Congress, it is now clear that \n     medicare reform needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct \n     legislative initiative''; and\n       (10) the Public Trustees of medicare ``strongly recommend \n     that the crisis presented by the financial condition of the \n     medicare trust funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive \n     basis, including a review of the programs's financing \n     methods, benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) a special bipartisan commission should be established \n     immediately to make recommendations concerning the most \n     appropriate response to the current health care crisis, and \n     the recommendations should include ways to address medicare \n     and medicaid costs, access and solvency issues and to reform \n     our current health care system;\n       (2) the commission should report to Congress its \n     recommendations on the appropriate response to the short-term \n     solvency of medicare by July 10, 1995, in order that the \n     committees of jurisdiction may consider those recommendations \n     in fashioning an appropriate congressional response; and\n       (3) the commission should report its recommendations to \n     respond to the Public Trustees' call to make medicare's \n     financial condition sustainable over the long term to \n     Congress by February 1, 1996.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 SIMON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1184\n  Mr. EXON (for Mr. Simon, for himself, Mr. Pell, and Mr. Kennedy) \nproposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent \nResolution 13, supra;

as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REDUCTIONS IN MEDICARE \n                   SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Medicare protection is as important as Social Security \n     protection in guaranteeing retirement security and is truly a \n     part of Social Security;\n       (2) senior citizens have contributed throughout their \n     working lives to Medicare in the expectation of health \n     insurance protection when they retire;\n       (3) because of gaps in Medicare coverage, senior citizens \n     already spend more than one dollar in five of their limited \n     incomes to purchase the health care that they need;\n       (4) low and moderate-income senior citizens will suffer \n     most from Medicare cuts, since 83 percent of all Medicare \n     spending is for older Americans with annual incomes below \n     $25,000 and two-thirds is for those with annual incomes below \n     $15,000;\n       (5) at the present time, Medicare only pays 68 percent of \n     what the private sector pays for comparable physicians' \n     services and 69 percent of what the private sector pays for \n     comparable hospital care;\n       (6) piecemeal, budget-driven cuts in Medicare will only \n     shift costs from the Federal budget to the family budgets of \n     senior citizens and working Americans; [[Page S7542]] \n       (7) deep cuts in Medicare could damage the quality of \n     American medicine, by endangering hospitals and other health \n     care institutions that depend on Medicare, including rural \n     hospitals, inner-city hospitals, and academic health centers;\n       (8) deep cuts in Medicare will make essential health care \n     less available to millions of uninsured Americans, by \n     endangering the financial stability of hospitals providing \n     such care; and\n       (9) cuts in Medicare benefits should not be used to pay for \n     tax cuts for the wealthy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this concurrent resolution assume that \n     reductions in projected medicare spending included in the \n     reconciliation bill for fiscal year 1996 should not increase \n     medical costs such as premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance \n     or diminish access to health care for senior citizens, and \n     further, that major reductions in projected Medicare spending \n     should not be enacted by the Congress except in the context \n     of a broad, bipartisan health reform plan that will not--\n       (1) increase costs or reduce access to care for senior \n     citizens;\n       (2) shift costs to working Americans; or\n       (3) damage the quality of American medicine.\n                                 ______\n\n\n

BUDGET SURPLUS ALLOWANCE.\n\n       (a) Adjustments.--For the purposes of points of order under \n     the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 \n     and this concurrent resolution on the budget, the revenue \n     aggregates may be reduced and other appropriate allocations \n     and budgetary aggregates and levels shall be revised to \n     reflect the additional deficit reduction achieved as \n     calculated under subsection (c) for legislation that reduces \n     the adverse effects on medicare, medicaid, and welfare reform \n     in the following manner:\n       (1) $50,000,000,000 shall be used for legislation that \n     reduces the adverse affects upon the elderly, disabled, and \n     children who have nowhere else to turn but medicaid for \n     health care.\n       (2) $20,000,000,000 shall be used for legislation that \n     reduces the drastic cuts to welfare programs.\n       (3) If the Congressional Budget Office scores this surplus \n     differently, than the amounts provided in paragraphs (1) or \n     (2) shall be increased or decreased proportionally.\n       (b) Revised Allocations and Aggregates.--Upon the reporting \n     of legislation pursuant to subsection (a), and again upon the \n     submission of a conference report on such legislation (if a \n     conference report is submitted), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on Budget of the Senate may submit to the Senate \n     appropriately revised allocations under sections 302(a) and \n     602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and levels \n     under this resolution, revised by an amount that does not \n     exceed the additional deficit reduction calculated under \n     subsection (d).\n       (c) CBO Revised Deficit Estimate.--After the enactment of \n     legislation that complies with the reconciliation directives \n     of section 6, the Congressional Budget Office shall provide \n     the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate a \n     revised estimate of the deficit for fiscal years 1996 through \n     2005.\n       (d) Additional Deficit Reduction.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``additional deficit reduction'' means the \n     amount by which the total deficit levels assumed in this \n     resolution for a fiscal year exceed the revised deficit \n     estimate provided pursuant to subsection (c) for such fiscal \n     year for fiscal years 1996 through 2005.\n       (e) CBO Certification and Contingencies.--This section \n     shall not apply unless--\n       (1) legislation has been enacted complying with the \n     reconciliation directives of section 6;\n       (2) the Director of the Congressional Budget Office has \n     provided the estimate required by subsection (c); and\n       (3) the revisions made pursuant to this subsection do not \n     cause a budget deficit for fiscal year 2002, 2003, 2004, or \n     2005.\n     SEC. 204.

SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.\n     SEC. 206 EXTENSION OF BUDGET ACT 60-VOTE ENFORCEMENT THROUGH \n                   2002.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 275(b) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as amended by sections \n     13112(b) and 13208(b)(3) of the Budget Enforcement Act of \n     1990), the second sentence of section 904(c) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (except insofar as it \n     relates to section 313 of that Act) and the final sentence of \n     section 904(d) of that Act (except insofar as it relates to \n     section 313 of that Act) shall continue to have effect as \n     rules of the Senate through (but no later than) September 30, \n     2002.\n\n     SEC. 207. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       The Senate adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, \n     and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of \n     the Senate, and such rules shall supersede other rules only \n     to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     the Senate) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.\n            TITLE III--SENSE OF THE CONGRESS AND THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON REVENUE INSTRUCTION TO \n                   FINANCE COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) to balance the Federal budget in a rational and \n     reasonable manner, there must be a fair and equitable \n     distribution of the deficit reduction burden;\n       (2) the plan under consideration in the Senate does not ask \n     the wealthy to contribute to deficit reduction;\n       (3) the deficit reduction package approved by the Senate \n     Budget Committee would disproportionately affect those at \n     lower-income levels;\n       (4) over the next 7 years, at current growth rates, tax \n     loopholes and preferences will result in a revenue loss to \n     the Federal Government of more than $4,000,000,000,000; and\n       (5) the House Budget Committee had under consideration, but \n     did not include in its deficit reduction package, a list of \n     $335,000,000,000 in corporate tax loopholes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate Finance Committee, as part of this year's \n     reconciliation package, should limit or eliminate tax \n     loopholes that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest \n     individuals and the largest corporations in order to more \n     equitably distribute the burden of deficit reduction;\n       (2) the Senate Finance Committee should give first priority \n     to closing corporate loopholes;\n       (3) the Senate Finance Committee should also give priority \n     to closing loopholes that disproportionately benefit \n     Americans with incomes of $140,000 or more;\n       (4) in no event should taxes go up on those making less \n     than $140,000; and\n       (5) in no event should the Senate Committee on Finance \n     raise income tax rates on individuals or reduce deductions \n     for home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, or \n     State and local taxes.\n\n     SEC. 302. RESTRUCTURING GOVERNMENT AND PROGRAM TERMINATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that to balance the Federal \n     budget in a rational and reasonable manner requires an \n     assessment of national priorities and the appropriate role of \n     the Federal Government in meeting the challenges facing the \n     United States in the 21st century.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that to balance the budget the Congress should--\n       (1) restructure Federal programs to meet identified \n     national priorities in the most effective and efficient \n     manner so that program dollars get to the intended purpose or \n     recipient;\n       (2) terminate programs that have largely met their goals, \n     that have outlived their [[Page S7552]] original purpose, or \n     that have been superseded by other programs;\n       (3) seek to end significant duplication among Federal \n     programs, which results in excessive administrative costs and \n     ill serve the American people; and\n       (4) eliminate lower priority programs.\n\n     SEC. 303. NONPARTISAN ADVISORY COMMISSION ON THE CPI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress intended to insulate certain government \n     beneficiaries and taxpayers from the effects of inflation by \n     indexing payments and tax brackets to the Consumer Price \n     Index (CPI);\n       (2) approximately 30 percent of total Federal outlays and \n     45 percent of Federal revenues are indexed to reflect changes \n     in the CPI; and\n       (3) the overwhelming consensus among experts is that the \n     method used to construct the CPI and\n      the current calculation of the CPI both overstate the \n     estimate of the true cost of living.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a temporary advisory commission should be established \n     to make objective and nonpartisan recommendations concerning \n     the appropriateness and accuracy of the methodology and \n     calculations that determine the CPI;\n       (2) the Commission should be appointed on a nonpartisan \n     basis, and should be composed of experts in the fields of \n     economics, statistics, or other related professions; and\n       (3) the Commission should report its recommendations to the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics and to Congress at the earliest \n     possible date.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON A UNIFORM ACCOUNTING \n                   SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal \n     internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress \n     has been made in recent years, there still exists no uniform \n     Federal accounting system for Federal Government entities and \n     institutions.\n       (2) As a result, Federal financial management continues to \n     be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and \n     fiscal practices have failed to identify costs, failed to \n     reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions, and \n     failed to accurately report the financial condition of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Current Federal accounting practices do not adequately \n     report financial problems of the Federal Government or the \n     full cost of programs and activities. The continued use of \n     these practices undermines the Government's ability to \n     provide credible and reliable financial data, encourages \n     already widespread waste and inefficiency, and will not \n     assist in achieving a balanced budget.\n       (4) Waste and inefficiency in Federal Government undermine \n     the confidence of the American people in the Government and \n     reduces the Federal Government's ability to address \n     adequately vital public needs.\n       (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the \n     Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the \n     Federal Government, a uniform Federal accounting system, that \n     fully meets the accounting standards and reporting objectives \n     for the Federal Government, must be immediately established \n     so that all assets and liabilities, revenues and expenditures \n     or expenses, and the full cost of programs and activities of \n     the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately \n     recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout all \n     government entities for control and management evaluation \n     purposes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) a uniform Federal accounting system should be \n     established to consistently compile financial data across the \n     Federal Government, and to make full disclosure of Federal \n     financial data, including the full cost of Federal programs \n     and activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, \n     and agency management; and\n       (2) beginning with fiscal year 1997, the President should \n     require the heads of agencies to--\n       (A) implement and maintain a uniform Federal accounting \n     system; and\n       (B) provide financial statements;\n     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles \n     applied on a consistent basis and established in accordance \n     with proposed Federal accounting standards and \n     interpretations recommended by the Federal Accounting \n     Standards Advisory Board and other applicable law.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT 90 PERCENT OF THE \n                   BENEFITS OF ANY TAX CUTS MUST GO TO THE MIDDLE \n                   CLASS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incomes of middle-class families have stagnated \n     since the early 1980's, with family incomes growing more \n     slowly between 1979 and 1989 than in any other business cycle \n     since World War II; and\n       (2) according to the Department of the Treasury, in 1996, \n     approximately 90 percent of American families will have \n     incomes less than $100,000.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that if the 1996 Concurrent Budget Resolution includes any \n     cut in taxes, approximately 90 percent of the benefits of \n     these tax cuts must go to working families with incomes less \n     than $100,000.\n\n     SEC. 306. BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON HEALTH CARE REFORM, \n                   MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COSTS, ACCESS AND \n                   SOLVENCY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Health Insurance for the Aged Act, which created \n     the medicare program, was enacted on July 30, 1965, and, \n     therefore, the medicare program will celebrate its 30-year \n     anniversary on July 30, 1995;\n       (2) on April 3, 1995, the Trustees of medicare submitted \n     their 1995 Annual Report on the Status of the medicare \n     program to the Congress;\n       (3) the Trustees of medicare have concluded that ``the \n     medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its present \n     form'';\n       (4) the Trustees of medicare have concluded that ``the \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays inpatient hospital \n     expenses, will be able to pay benefits for only about 7 years \n     and is severely out of financial balance in the long range'';\n       (5) the Public Trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund shows a rate \n     of growth of costs which is clearly unsustainable'';\n       (6) the Trustees of medicare have recommended ``legislation \n     to reestablish the Quadrennial Advisory Council that will \n     help lead to effective solutions to the problems of the \n     program'';\n       (7) the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \n     concluded that, absent long-term changes in medicare, \n     projected medicare outlays will increase from about 4 percent \n     of the payroll tax base today to over 15 percent of the \n     payroll tax base by the year 2030;\n       (8) the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \n     recommended, by a vote of 30 to 1, that spending and revenues \n     available for medicare must be brought into long-term \n     balance;\n       (9) the Public Trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``We had hoped for several years that comprehensive health \n     reform would include meaningful medicare reforms. However, \n     with the results of the last Congress, it is now clear that \n     medicare reform needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct \n     legislative initiative''; and\n       (10) the Public Trustees of medicare ``strongly recommend \n     that the crisis presented by the financial condition of the \n     medicare trust funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive \n     basis, including a review of the programs's financing \n     methods, benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) a special bipartisan commission should be established \n     immediately to make recommendations concerning the most \n     appropriate response to the current health care crisis, and \n     the recommendations should include ways to address medicare \n     and medicaid costs, access and solvency issues and to reform \n     our current health care system;\n       (2) the commission should report to Congress its \n     recommendations on the appropriate response to the short-term \n     solvency of medicare by July 10, 1995, in order that the \n     committees of jurisdiction may consider those recommendations \n     in fashioning an appropriate congressional response; and\n       (3) the commission should report its recommendations to \n     respond to the Public Trustees' call to make medicare's \n     financial condition sustainable over the long term to \n     Congress by February 1, 1996.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 SNOWE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1197\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Ms. Snowe, for herself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Cohen, Mr. \nCampbell, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nHollings, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Pell) proposed an amendment \nto the concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, supra; \nas follows:\n\n       Close tax loopholes and corporate subsidies by the \n     following amounts:\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $875,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $1,100,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $1,250,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $1,400,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $1,550,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $1,550,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 16, increase the amount by $1,675,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $875,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $1,100,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, increase the amount by $1,250,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, increase the amount by $1,400,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 24, increase the amount by $1,550,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 25, increase the amount by $1,550,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $1,675,000,000.\n       Restore cuts in student loans by the following amounts:\n       On page 5, line 17, increase the amount by $875,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, increase the amount by \n     $1,100,000,000.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can \n     be used to create radioactive dispersal devices that are \n     capable of causing serious bodily injury as well as \n     substantial damage to property and the environment;\n       (2) the potential use of nuclear materials, including \n     byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist \n     activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (3) due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat \n     of nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the \n     United States has a strong interest in ensuring that persons \n     who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear \n     materials, including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for \n     their offenses;\n       (4) the threat that nuclear materials will be obtained and \n     used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has \n     increased substantially since the enactment in 1982 of the \n     legislation that implemented the Convention on the Physical \n     Protection of Nuclear Material, codified at section 831 of \n     title 18, United States Code;\n       (5) the successful efforts to obtain agreements from other \n     countries to dismantle nuclear weapons have resulted in \n     increased packaging and transportation of nuclear materials, \n     thereby decreasing the security of such materials by \n     increasing the opportunity for unlawful diversion and theft;\n       (6) the illicit trafficking in the relatively more common, \n     commercially available and usable nuclear and byproduct \n     materials poses a potential to cause significant loss of life \n     and environmental damage;\n       (7) reported trafficking incidents in the early 1990's \n     suggest that the individuals involved in trafficking these \n     materials from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently \n     conducted their black market sales of these materials within \n     the Federal Republic of Germany, the Baltic States, the \n     former Soviet Union, Central Europe, and to a lesser extent \n     in the Middle European countries;\n       (8) the international community has become increasingly \n     concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear \n     byproduct materials;\n       (9) the potentially disastrous ramifications of increased \n     access to nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials pose such a \n     significant future threat that the United States must use all \n     lawful methods available to combat the illegal use of such \n     materials;\n       (10) the United States has an interest in encouraging \n     United States corporations to do business in the countries \n     that comprised the former Soviet Union, and in other \n     developing democracies;\n       (11) protection of such United States corporations from \n     threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials is \n     important to the success of the effort to encourage such \n     business ventures, and to further the foreign relations and \n     commerce of the United States;\n       (12) the nature of nuclear contamination is such that it \n     may affect the health, environment, and property of United \n     States nationals even if the acts that constitute the illegal \n     activity occur outside the territory of the United States, \n     and are primarily directed toward foreign nationals; and\n       (13) there is presently no Federal criminal statute that \n     provides adequate protection to United States interests from \n     nonweapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material, and \n     from the illegal diversion of nuclear materials that are held \n     for other than peaceful purposes.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide \n     Federal law enforcement agencies the necessary tools and \n     fullest possible basis allowed under the Constitution to \n     combat the threat of nuclear contamination and proliferation \n     that may result from illegal possession and use of \n     radioactive materials.\n\n     SEC. 802. EXPANSION OF SCOPE AND JURISDICTIONAL BASES OF \n                   NUCLEAR MATERIALS PROHIBITIONS.\n\n       Section 831 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``nuclear material'' each place it appears \n     and inserting ``nuclear material or nuclear byproduct \n     material'';\n       (B) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``or the \n     environment'' after ``property''; and\n       (ii) by amending subparagraph (B) to read as follows:\n       ``(B)(i) circumstances exist that are likely to cause the \n     death or serious bodily injury to any person or substantial \n     damage to property or the environment, or such circumstances \n     have been represented to the defendant to exist;''; and\n       (C) in paragraph (6), by inserting ``or the environment'' \n     after ``property'';\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:\n       ``(2) an offender or a victim is a national of the United \n     States or a United States corporation or other legal \n     entity;'';\n       (B) in paragraph (3)--\n       (i) by striking ``at the time of the offense the nuclear \n     material is in use, storage, or transport, for peaceful \n     purposes, and''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``or'' at the end of the paragraph;\n       (C) in paragraph (4)--\n       (i) by striking ``nuclear material for peaceful purposes'' \n     and inserting ``nuclear material or nuclear byproduct \n     material''; and\n       (ii) by striking the period at the end of the paragraph and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) the governmental entity under subsection (a)(5) is \n     the United States or the threat under subsection (a)(6) is \n     directed at the United States.''; and\n       (3) in subsection (f)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``with an isotopic \n     concentration not in excess of 80 percent plutonium 238''; \n     and\n       (ii) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``(C) uranium'' and \n     inserting ``(C) enriched uranium, defined as uranium'';\n       (B) by redesignating paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) as \n     paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), respectively;\n       (C) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(2) the term `nuclear byproduct material' means any \n     material containing any radioactive isotope created through \n     an irradiation process in the operation of a nuclear reactor \n     or accelerator;'';\n       (D) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (4), as \n     redesignated;\n       (E) by striking the period at the end of subsection (f)(5), \n     as redesignated, and inserting a semicolon; and\n       (F) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(6) the term `national of the United States' has the \n     meaning given such term in section 101(a)(22) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22)); and\n       ``(7) the term `United States corporation or other legal \n     entity' means any corporation or other entity organized under \n     the laws of the United States or any State, Commonwealth, \n     territory, possession, or district of the United States.''.\n                   TITLE IX--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 901.

Mr. President, I rise today in response to \nPresident Clinton's threat to veto the conference agreement on \nlegislation to rescind $16 billion in already appropriated but, as yet, \nunspent funds under H.R. 1158.\n  The President has stated that the conference agreement cuts too \ndeeply into education programs in order to finance ``pork barrel'' \nconstruction of courthouses and highways. However, I would remind the \nPresident that the House and Senate rescission conference report blocks \nthe planned consolidation of the Food and Drug Administration at \nClarksburg and Prince Georges County, thereby saving the taxpayers an \nestimated $810 million. In addition to money for the FDA project, a \ntotal of $110.8 million was trimmed from funding for six other \nGovernment buildings in the D.C. metropolitan area under the GSA.\n  Moreover, the President's statement on the rescissions package \nindicated that Congress would receive a list of $438 million in \nadditional cuts of building projects to be added to the current \nconference report of $580 million from the GSA. Even at this late date, \nI welcomed the proposed list to provide additional savings. \nRegrettably, I was surprised to receive word from the General Services \nAdministration that the Office of Management and Budget has directed \nthe GSA to discontinue efforts to compile this list, especially in \nlight of previous accusations of ``pork barrel'' projects being \ncontained in the conference report.\n  If the President is serious about this effort, the GSA must be \nallowed to proceed with this promised list for congressional review. I \nwould further like to remind the President that the current House-\nSenate conference report provides the American taxpayer with a sizeable \nvictory through the elimination of the planned consolidation of the \nFood and Drug Administration at Clarksburg and Prince Georges County.\n  Since the conception of the proposal to move the Food and Drug \nAdministration to the Montgomery County site, I have continually\n questioned the need for this move, especially at a time when the \nFederal Government is closing and selling Federal properties. As the \nchairman of the Subcommiteee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I \nhave contacted both General Services Administrator Roger Johnson and \nBudget Director Alice Rivlin to apprise them of my concern.\n\n  I might also add that, to date, I have not yet received a reply from \nBudget Director Rivlin to my letter of March 28 in regard to this \nmatter. It is my hope that this does not indicate a lack of \ncommunication between the General Services Administration and the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  In February, during a meeting with the General Services Administrator \nRoger Johnson, I questioned the need for this costly move and asked why \nthe Federal Government would need to purchase privately-owned property \nfor the ``consolidation'' of one Federal agency. Administrator Johnson \nresponded that he shared my concern and that the ``GSA would continue \nto look for opportunities to utilize existing Federal land.''\n  Following our meeting, Administrator Johnson provided me with written \nassurance that the project, and purchase of private properties, would \nnot go forward until a complete review of available Federal property \nhad been examined.\n  I am pleased to report that such an examination was well underway \nwhen it was announced that the conference report included a rescission \nof $810 million for this project, providing a victory for American \ntaxpayers.\n  I commend my colleagues who served as conferees on this most \nimportant bill for their decision to eliminate this wasteful spending.\n  In this austere budget environment, it is my intention to continue to \nmake our capital assets work better in the area of the General Services \nAdministration. As the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nSubcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I believe that \nFederal real property should meet certain priority \ncriteria. [[Page S7572]] \n  It is my view that the Senate should support only those General \nService Administration projects and programs which have been justified \nas necessary, cost-effective and compelling by\n utilizing a more disciplined asset management program. This approach \nshould be targeted to worthwhile projects directly related to the \nGeneral Services Administration's mission.\n\n  To accomplish this objective, the GSA should require that Federal \nreal property activities meet certain broad principles. My suggested \ncriteria for priority consideration would be, in sequential order:\n  First, those projects necessary to ensure the life, safety, and \nhealth of the tenant;\n  Second, those projects which achieve a high priority ranking based on \nurgency of need and positive return on investment criteria;\n  Third, those projects which fully utilize opportunities for cost \nsavings;\n  Fourth, those projects necessary to avoid expensive, short-term \nholdover situations due to lease expirations; and finally,\n  Fifth, those projects which represent a fixed need for a permanent \nFederal agency.\n  Based on these criteria, it is my hope that the GSA will adopt a \nstrategic planning approach and reformat its submissions of proposals \nto the Congress accordingly. As subcommittee chairman, I will urge the \nEnvironment Committee to judge the top priorities of each of the \ncategories under the GSA's real property programs against one another \non a case-by-case basis. However, the process for determining the \nhighest priorities within each category should be a disciplined \nprocess.\n  In the future, I will continue my effort to convince GSA to adopt a \nmore disciplined approach to provide real savings for the American \ntaxpayer.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7571-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            NATO AIRSTRIKES\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I strongly support today's NATO \nairstrikes in Bosnia. I am pleased that the United Nations finally \npermitted NATO to respond to the continued defiance of the U.N. \nmandates for Bosnia. I am also pleased to hear the preliminary reports \nthat NATO strikes were carried out against a meaningful military \ntarget.\n  There is certainly a risk that the Bosnian Serbs may retaliate \nagainst U.N. personnel. There is, however, even greater risk to U.N. \npersonnel if the U.N. and NATO's credibility continues to erode. In \naddition to the terrible human suffering, I have been concerned about \nthe loss of U.N. and NATO credibility that has taken place as the \nvarious warring parties, particularly the Bosnian Serbs, have ignored \nU.N. resolutions and international law.\n  I hope today's strikes on the Bosnian Serb ammunition dumps at the \nmilitary headquarters in Pale will serve notice to all sides that the \nUnited Nations and NATO can and will enforce the resolutions that have \nbeen approved by the U.N. Security Council.\n  I am hopeful that these strikes will strengthen the resolve of the \nU.N. forces in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo where the United \nNations has prohibited the use of heavy military equipment. This zone \nwas designed to stop the indiscriminate shelling of the civilian \npopulation within the exclusion zone. If any side in this conflict \nignores the U.N. ban on heavy weapons in this zone I would favor more \nstrikes like today's strikes on Pale until all sides respect the U.N. \nban on heavy weapons.\n  I have long felt that any hope for peace in Bosnia requires the \nenforcement and expansion of the zone of exclusion. By expanding the \nareas where heavy weapons are prohibited, the U.N. could reduce \ncivilian casualties, level the playing field between the warring \nparties, and lower the level of violence in the conflict, thus paving \nthe way for a negotiated settlement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7572-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF WILLARDS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to call to the \nattention of my colleagues celebrations that are underway to \ncommemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the \nTown of Willards, Maryland.\n  Willards, a town with a total population of 900 persons, was founded \non the basis of a quarrel. Ebenezer G. Davis was the first inhabitant \nand store proprietor of what is known today as Willards after moving to \nthe area after a dispute with his brother. Mr. Davis made a vow to \nWillard Thompson, a railroad General Manager, that he would name the \ntown after him if Mr. Thompson would build a railroad depot in the \ntown. That first railroad depot is now the local Post Office for the \nTown of Willards.\n  Officially named in October of 1895, The Town of Willards' boundary \nwas comprised of a half-mile radius circle, encompassing at the center \nthe popular corner of Hearn and Canal Streets.\n  While Willards was first incorporated in 1906, and again in 1927, the \nfirst elected government would not be legislated until 1971. By the \n1970's many businesses had been located in the town including the Shirt \nFactory, erected in 1905, and the Farmers Bank that would follow in \n1945. Civic organizations such as the Volunteer Fire Department, \nestablished in 1927, and the 1948 creation of the local Lions Club, \nwould all lend their support to community development.\n  Willards is a model of community spirit and cooperation. The \nactivities being sponsored to commemorate this auspicious occasion \nexemplify the deep devotion of Willards residents to their community. \nThe spirit and enthusiasm of Willards citizens have proven to be the \nfoundation of its success. These anniversary celebrations provide the \nopportunity to review the dedication that has supported Willards \nthroughout its history and helped it to develop into one of Wicomico \nCounty's most treasured communities.\n  We in Maryland are fortunate to have an area as community-oriented as \nWillards. I join the citizens of Wicomico County in sharing their pride \nin Willards' past and optimism for continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7572-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7572-S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              BLACK DOLLAR DAYS TASK FORCE--CAMPAIGN 5000\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a fundamental problem facing our \ncountry today is increasing economic dependence which serves to fuel \nthe rise of the welfare state. The task for America is to find creative \nand innovative ways to assist people who are economically deprived. One \nway to do this is to create systems that will lead to economic self-\nsufficiency for people trapped by the poverty of inner cities.\n  The Black Dollar Days Task Force [BDDTF], a Seattle-based \norganization gaining national attention, was established in 1988 to \naddress this problem. This organization has demonstrated that poor \ncommunities working together can make a difference and begin to create \nan economic future for themselves.\n  One of the programs started by BDDTF to address the issue of self-\nsufficiency is CAMPAIGN 5000. This program is the first minority-owned \nendowment program in the country. The goal of CAMPAIGN 5000 is to get \nminority community residents to become owners of their economic future \nby contributing to an endowment fund and becoming stakeholders. The \nendowment fund, once established, serves as a means by which corporate, \npublic and private moneys can come together in partnership to foster \ndignity, hope, and self-esteem. The only present alternative to this \nendowment fund is federallycontrolled programs which, in some cases, \nhave led to dead end jobs and inner city hopelessness.\n  The CAMPAIGN 5000 Endowment Fund ensures: A self-perpetuating fund \nthat helps solve the problem of deficit spending; a mechanism that \ncreates jobs by fueling the expansion and development of business \nopportunities; an opportunity for communities to be self-sufficient in \nsolving their own problems.\n  I have here, Mr. President, a list of funding sources which I will \nsubmit for the Record.\n  Mr. President, we are now dealing with a great challenge and a great \nresponsibility. In the ongoing budget debate, we must remember that it \nis not enough just to cut the budget. We must cut the budget, but at \nthe same time we must also be the mechanism to encourage new models \nthat offer hope and promise through self-sufficiency and that get \npeople off welfare. This is the role communities can play in the \nContract With America. [[Page S7573]] \n  One model I support enthusiastically is from my home State of \nWashington.

NEED FOR A STRONG UNITED NATIONS RESPONSE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we all witnessed from afar the \nhorrors perpetrated in Rwanda a year ago when mostly Hutus massacred an \nestimated half million Tutsis. Just this past month, there was renewed \nviolence in that country, including the deaths of Hutus implicated in \nthe genocide. I believe many of the deaths in Rwanda during the past \nyear could have been prevented if the international community had acted \nsooner to protect the thousands of innocent civilians who were \nmercilessly slaughtered.\n  Today, a similar situation is brewing in Rwanda's neighboring \ncountry, Burundi, where hatred and violence between Hutus and Tutsis \nover the past several years has intensified and caused tremendous \nturmoil and death. We regularly receive reports of killings of dozens, \nhundreds, even thousands of innocent men, women and children. Once \nagain, we face the difficult question of how to respond.\n  After the catastrophe in Rwanda, inaction now by the international \ncommunity would amount to nothing less than an assurance to people \nanywhere who would commit genocide that they need not fear being held \nto account.\n  Mr. President, the Central African country of Burundi has a history \nof ethnic tensions. However, the tensions between the two ethnic \ngroups, Hutu and Tutsi, has more to do with economic status than \nethnicity. While the Hutus represent 85 percent of the population, they \nare primarily impoverished, subsistence farmers. The wealthier, \nminority Tutsis, raise cattle.\n  Tensions intensified during German, and later Belgian colonialism. \nThese Western powers allied themselves with the more European-like \nTutsis to help manage the colonial government, fortifying Tutsi power. \nSince Burundi's independence in 1962, the Tutsis have maintained \ncontrol of the country's wealth, politics, and the military, creating \nfriction between Hutus and Tutsis. These tensions have been used \nperiodically by extremist elements to divide Burundis, causing violent \neruptions that pit the two ethnic groups against each other.\n  In 1993, the assassination of the first democratically elected \nPresident, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, plunged the country into chaos. \nHutus seeking revenge for the assassination ignited a cycle of \nviolence. During the 10-month period following the assassination, \nnearly 50,000 Burundis were slaughtered, and the Tutsi-dominated \nmilitary seized power. The slaughter has bred intensified distrust and \nfear, and further violence on a similar scale is a real possibility.\n  The President was murdered by Tutsi military extremists who refused \nto accept the election results. They also were angered by Ndadaye's \nsensible policy of balancing Hutus with Tutsis in the military. The \nbrewing unrest in Rwanda further contributed to the Burundi Tutsis' \nfear of losing their identity and power, and led to the coup. The army \nhas propped up Tutsi power in the recent past, and is a key element in \ndeciding Burundi's future. The army is now acting as a de facto \ngovernment and is becoming increasingly politicized and radicalized.\n  Extremists on both sides are using the ethnicity card to spread fear \nand distrust and consolidate their power, making reconciliation more \ndifficult. Former Texas Senator Robert Krueger, now the U.S. \nambassador, says Burundi is the most fearful society he has ever \nwitnessed.\n  The trouble is not limited to Burundi alone. The conflict is a \nregional crisis. The renewed violence in Rwanda, which we thought was \nbehind us, is spilling over into Burundi, Zaire and Tanzania, which are \nflooded with refugees. Recently, 70,000 Rwandan refugees and displaced \nBurundi civilians fled to the borders of Tanzania. Tanzania, already \noverwhelmed with refugees and displaced persons, closed its borders. \nBecause of the international community's tenuous support, the Tanzanian \nGovernment feels it cannot handle the new influx of refugees without \nmore help. Ngara, across the border from Tanzania, is now home to \n450,000 refugees, more than double the local Tanzanian population. \nThese camps area a humanitarian nightmare, with disease, massacres and \nriots a constant threat.\n  Delays of aid by some donor countries are causing refugee unrest and \naccusations that the reduced rations are part of a conspiracy by the \nUnited Nations and other relief organizations. This type of paranoia is \nfueling the hardliners' efforts to spread fear and destabilize the \ncountry. Even the Central African governments are becoming impatient \nwith the donor community. Citing last year's failure of the \ninternational community to stop the Rwandan genocide, some have \nsuggested scaling back the UN presence in Rwanda. Millions of Central \nAfricans displaced by the violence depend on this assistance. The \nrecent seizure of World Food Program trucks headed for Rwandan refugee \ncamps in Burundi illustrate how serious the situation has become.\n  Despite the sickening brutality, the situation in Burundi is not \nhopeless. Although little public attention has been given to the \nfrightening developments there, the administration and many \nhumanitarian groups are working to encourage preventive measures to \ndeter another calamity. It is imperative that the United States turn \nits full attention to Burundi, facilitating strategies to prevent \ngenocide and regional instability.\n  Ambassador Krueger deserves great praise for reporting the \natrocities, at considerable risk to his own safety. The world needs to \nknow the truth about what is happening. We must also\n promote a sense of hope, confidence, and the possibility for \novercoming the fear that threatens to explode into a spiral of \nviolence. The atrocities must be exposed, but we must also put our \nenergies into developing preventive and rehabilitative strategies, to \ncounter the extremists and defuse tensions, and move beyond a short-\nterm relief mentality. The Africans must be centrally involved in this \nprocess.\n\n  Efforts to support and reassure moderate elements in Burundi is \nessential. The U.N.'s Special Representative Ould-Abdallah is calling \nfor strengthening the nationwide reconciliation campaign launched a few \nweeks ago. Moderates including the President, Prime Minister, Cabinet \nMembers, Members of Congress, and party leaders are all actively \ninvolved in this campaign. We need to give these leaders political, \nmoral and financial support. [[Page S7574]] Visits to the region by top \nU.S. officials are a good start. Party leaders have already denounced \nextremists in their parties.\n  These efforts at strengthening reconciliation will help focus the \npeoples' attention on the national debate set to take place in June or \nJuly. The debate is an open forum to address the complex issues of \npromoting and sustaining Burundi's democratic process and government. \nThe National Debate has already begun with the establishment of its \nTechnical Committee. Our strong, visible support for this forum will \nhelp discourage and deter the extremists and their hate press from \ninciting violence and gaining credibility.\n  We must continue to support the creation of a judicial commission to \nprosecute human rights violators. We need to help ensure that the army \nand others are accountable for their actions. We must strongly condemn \nall violence and assassinations.\n  We must also support the private voluntary organizations that are \ndoing the lion's share of delivering relief aid. These groups need \nsufficient personnel, funding and political support to continue their \nwork. Groups such as Parliamentarians for Global Action have helped to \nfacilitate dialogue and begun the reconciliation process. Refugees \nInternational has done a tremendous job in focusing public attention on \nthe crisis in Central Africa.\n  Mr. President, ever since former President Bush spoke of a new world \norder, the world has been anything but orderly. The threat of Communism \nhas been replaced by shockingly brutal, ethnic conflicts that threaten \nto spread in the Balkans, the Middle East, Central Africa and \nelsewhere. In every case, innocent civilians bear the brunt of the \nviolence.\n  The international community faces a profound, moral choice, in a \nworld in which future man-made catastrophes are inevitable. Preventive \nmeasures are always preferable. But if they fail, and the violence in \nBurundi takes on the character and magnitude of what we witnessed in \nRwanda, what will our answer be? Will we\n stand by in the face of genocide, or will we act to try to stop it? \nWill we watch passively and cast blame after the blood stops flowing, \nor will we and others intervene to save innocent lives?\n\n  After Somalia, there is no enthusiasm in the Congress for sending \nlarge numbers of American troops into the midst of a bloody conflict in \nAfrica or anywhere else, where U.S. national security interests are not \nobviously threatened. On the other hand, to do nothing is to invite \ngenocide. That is also unacceptable. Our security is our interest. But \ngenocide is everybody's interest, wherever it occurs.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Rwanda experience compels us to respond \ndifferently to future crises of this sort, whether in Burundi or \nelsewhere. In Rwanda, 5 months after receiving a mandate to act, the \nU.N. still had no budget, no equipment, no humanitarian coordinator, no \npolitical strategy, and no logistical capability to rapidly deploy and \nsustain a peacekeeping force. As in past peacekeeping operations, the \nU.N. started from scratch. An estimated $200 million was needed, but \nonly a fraction of that was raised. In the meantime, hundreds of \nthousands of people were slaughtered, and the international community \nis now spending hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars to feed \nand care for refugees, and to deal with the myriad of difficult \nproblems Rwanda faces in the wake of the genocide. Not until the \narrival of a small contingent of well-armed French troops, did the \nmayhem wane.\n  Peacekeeping, or some combination of peacekeeping and peacemaking, \nwhich in Rwanda-like situations I would prefer to call peacekeeping \nwith muscle, could not only have saved thousands of innocent Rwandan \nlives, it could also have saved money. These should be our goals in the \nfuture.\n  To that end, the United States should vigorously seek international \nsupport for establishing a properly trained, fully equipped, U.N. force \nthat can be deployed quickly to provide protection to civilians in \nRwanda-like crises. The U.N. is the only overtly neutral organization \nthat can fulfill this responsibility. I am not talking about a standing \narmy, but rather small contingents of troops from a wide range of U.N. \nmember states, specially trained, coordinated and equipped and ready to \nassemble quickly to respond with overwhelming force in humanitarian \nemergencies.\n  The role of such a force would not be nation-building. That is not \nthe work of armies. Its mission would be humanitarian and deterrence. \nBy preventing those who would slaughter thousands of innocent people \nfrom access to the targets of their hatred, and by offering those who \nmight be coerced into taking part in genocide a safe haven if they \nrefuse, tensions can be defused and crises averted.\n  The U.N. Secretary General should have sufficient funds at his \ndisposal to support the early deployment of such a force. It should be \nfurther buttressed with a U.N. media capability to publicize its \nactivities, and to counter the kinds of inflammatory radio broadcasts \nthat incited Hutus to commit genocide in Rwanda.\n  The United States should be prepared to contribute its equipment, and \neven its troops to participate in such a force, although I believe it \nis preferable if the troops of the major powers are used in these \nsituations only as a last resort. Nevertheless, there are financial \ncosts and human risks involved, and the United States has an \nobligation, as the most powerful country, to do its part. That is the \nprice of world leadership.\n  Mr. President, I am not the first to suggest the establishment of \nsuch a U.N. capability. It is not peacekeeping. It is not peacemaking. \nIt is life saving. And it is urgently needed in today's violent, post \ncold war world.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7573-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7574-S7575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    NATIONAL MISSING CHILDREN'S DAY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about \nNational Missing Children's Day. This day focuses on what must be one \nof the most horrifying events in a parent's life: the abduction of \ntheir child. Nothing I say could ever ease their pain, but I would like \nto let them know that my thoughts are with them.\n  I want to take this opportunity to applaud the efforts of programs \nthat assist families in these situations. The National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) is a remarkable organization. \nNCMEC handles over 850,000 calls on its hotline, worked on 43,000 cases \nand, amazingly, played a role in the recovery of 28,000 children. Using \nadvanced technology, this vital center disseminates information with \nthe ultimate goal of rescuring as many children as possible.\n  After personally viewing the need for these efforts, I helped to \nestablish Project ALERT, which is housed within NCMEC. Hoping to tap \ninto an extremely valuable resource, Project ALERT recruits retired law \nenforcment officers, provides training to them and then dispatches \nthese officers to local police agencies. The officers are volunteers \nand are assigned to cases involving missing and exploited children. \nThey have the experience, expertise, will and dedication to investigate \ncases and can readily available to provide these services free to local \nlaw enforcement agencies.\n  In order to draw attention to the gravity of this National Missing \nChildren's Day, some very dedicated New Yorkers have taken to their \nbicycles to ride from Herkimer County in New York to Washington, DC. \nHerkimer County has special significance. Sara Anne Wood, 12 years old \nat the time, was abducted from there on August 18, 1993. Her father, \nReverend Robert Wood is one of the seven making the arduous trip to \nWashington, DC which will benefit the Sara Anne Wood Rescue Center. I \nwould like to take a moment to congratulate them on completing their \njourney and bring national attention to their efforts.\n  I also would like to speak briefly on the Morgan P. Hardiman Task \nForce on Missing and Exploited Children. The Task Force creates a team \nof active Federal agents who would work with the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children in assisting State and local law \nenforcement agents in their most difficult By supplementing our \nNation's police departments with Task Force members and resources, we \ncan effectively fight child victimization, a truly reprehensible crime, \nand help to reunite families disrupted by an abduction. [[Page S7575]] \n  I only hope that one day, there will be no need for a National \nMissing Children's Day or a center to locate missing and exploited \nchildren. Until that day comes, I will continue to do whatever I can as \na United States Senator to assist in the efforts to bring these \nchildren home and to impart the most severe punishment for any depraved \nperson who harms a child. This issue is dear to my heart and I will \nremain close to the efforts to help children and their families. We \nwill not stop until the problem has ceased.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7574-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    ``I TOLD YOU SO''--WHITE HOUSE MEMO LAYS GROUNDWORK FOR COERCION\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today the Associated Press broke a \nstory that should take no one by surprise. The concern expressed on \nthis floor as we debated reforming the Hatch Act was that without \nprotection for Federal employees, a sitting President could coerce his \nappointees to contribute to his campaign.\n  Today, we see from a wire story that the White House has laid the \ngroundwork for the kind of coercion we predicted.\n  A memo dated May 2 from White House Counsel Abner Mikva and addressed \nto ``Heads of all All Agencies and Departments''--a memo written on \nofficial White House stationery, states that the Hatch Act Reform of \n1993 ``provided that civilian executive branch employees are no longer \nprohibited from making a political contribution to the reelection \ncampaign committee of an incumbent President.''\n  The memo then asks the agency heads to share the information with \nemployees inside their agencies. Frankly, Mr. President, I find this \nabsolutely outrageous, and believe that this memo could be seen as \nsetting up a coercive situation for executive branch civilian \nemployees--something I warned against when we considered the so-called \nreform of the Hatch Act.\n  The purpose of the Hatch Act was straightforward--to protect Federal \nemployees from just this type of pressure. I fought tooth and nail \nagainst the repeal of provisions in the Hatch Act for just this reason. \nI find it interesting that of all of the changes made to the Hatch Act, \ncontributing to the reelection campaign committee of an incumbent \nPresident is the change they chose to highlight. This memo is a glaring \nexample of the abuses that can occur without the protection of the \nHatch Act.\n  When the White House asks agency and department heads to tell their \nemployees that they may contribute to their boss' reelection, that \nclearly can be seen as coercion. Those employees may feel that their \ncontinued employment depends on contributing. Furthermore, that this \nwas sent out on official White House stationary makes things even \nworse.\n  What is an employee to think when he or she receives this \ninformation--this narrow information--concerning the changes to the \nHatch Act All the changes were highlighted by the media when the act \nwas reformed. Certain, Federal employees kept themselves abreast of the \nnews. ``So why,'' one would have to ask, ``would the highest levels at \nthe White House use official stationary to direct attention to only one \nof several changes in the law?''\n  ``Is it because the President wants to remind me that I serve at this \nleisure--and if I don't contribute, I may not serve?'' As Ann McBride, \npresident of Common Cause says, ``There's just no way that a message \ncomes from the White House and people don't feel some sense of implicit \ncoercion.''\n  This is unfair to our Federal employees. At a time when the President \nis seeking to build goodwill and esteem among those who work in the \nbureaucracy, he shouldn't be strapping them with the bill for his \nreelection campaign.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7575-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7575-S7576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE POLICY AND RESEARCH\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President. I would like to submit for the \nRecord, a recent Washington Post article on the Agency for Health Care \nPolicy and Research (AHCPR).\n  Before submitting the article, I would like to say a few words about \nthe AHCPR. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) was \nestablished as the eighth agency in the Public Health Service by the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. I was pleased to work on a \nbi-partisan basis--with Senators Mitchell, Hatch, Durenberger and \nKennedy, and Representatives Gradison, Stark, and Waxman--to help \nestablish AHCPR.\n  In creating the agency, Congress gave increased visibility and \nstature to the only broad-based, general health services research \nentity in the Federal Government--one of the most important sources of \ninformation for policymakers and private sector decisionmakers as they \nseek to resolve the difficult issues facing the Nation's health care \nsystem.\n  Congress gave AHCPR the following mission:\n\n       ``to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and \n     effectiveness of health care service and access to such \n     services, through a broad base of scientific research and the \n     promotion of improved clinical practice and in the \n     organization, financing and delivery of health services.\n\n  The Members of Congress who supported the creation of AHCPR did so \nbecause of their concern that while the Nation was spending at that \ntime some $800 billion on health care, it is now more than a trillion \ndollars, we had little information on what works in the delivery or \nfinancing of care. We wanted to encourage support for research to find \nthe best ways to finance and provide health care at the lowest cost and \nthe highest quality. We believed then that for a relatively low \nexpenditure we could find ways to save health care money without \nsacrificing quality. The AHCPR's work has proven us right.\n  The 1989 Reconciliation Act authorized AHCPR to conduct research in \nthree basic areas: Cost, Quality, and Access (CQA) and medical \neffectiveness research and outcomes research.\n  Cost, Quality and Access research funding has provided:\n  The fundamental research that led to the development of the Diagnosis \nRelated Groups (DRG) system;\n  The basic research that first documented major variation in physician \npractice patterns;\n  A landmark study, called the Medical Outcomes Study\n   (MOS) which will help understand the impact of financial incentives \nand practice setting (e.g. Health Maintenance Organizations vs. fee-\nfor-service) on practice style and, in turn, on health outcomes;\n\n  Research that documented that utilization review can significantly \ncut utilization costs of health care; and\n  The most comprehensive survey on the costs and utilization patterns \nof AIDS patients, which will help target treatment programs, more \neffectively.\n  Part of AHCPR's work is in technology assessment and this effort has \nmade a significant contribution to saving federal funds. For example, \naccording to the Institute of Medicine, at least $200 million a year in \nmedicare expenditures are saved through AHCPR's technology assessment \nprogram. Again, AHCPR is helping us as policymakers understand what \nworks.\n  Congress greatly expanded the federal effort to support research on \nthe outcomes, appropriateness and effectiveness of health care \nservices. The ultimate goal of this program is to provide information \nto health care providers and patients that will improve the health of \nthe population and optimize the use of scarce health care resources. \nThis program includes research, data development and development of \nclinical practice guidelines.\n  It was our hope that the guidelines, which are just that, not \nrequirements, would lead us to find ways to save money without \ncompromising care. It is now apparent that our modest investment in the \nprocess has paid off.\n  For example, AHCPR, research has found that some 90% of low back pain \nproblems--a condition estimated to cost more than $20 billion a year in \nhealth expenditures--disappear on their own in about one month. This \nfinding has enormous cost savings implications.\n  One hospital in Utah found that after six months of using an AHCPR \nguideline on prevention of pressure ulcers that it saved close to \n$250,000. That hospital is part of the Intermountain Health Care system \nwhich has now implemented the guideline in its 23 other hospitals. Use \nof this guideline has reduced the incidence of bed sores by 50% at \nsavings of $4,200 per patient. [[Page S7576]] \n  I cite the cost savings aspects of AHCPR research because of a \nrecommendation by the Budget Committee to cut AHCPR research by 75%. \nThe committee report also indicates that AHCPR was established to \nmanage health care reform. That assertion is just plain wrong. AHCPR is \nan important agency for its research, but it was not envisioned to be a \nhealth care\n implementation agency. We may save a few Federal dollars by cutting \nAHCPR's funding, but we will lose far more in potential savings in our \nhealth care system.\n\n  The budget resolution also proposes deep reduction cuts in Medicaid \nand Medicare spending. I oppose those harsh cuts because the people of \nWest Virginia will have health care benefits taken away from them as a \nresult. It seems to me that the only way to rationally reduce costs and \nnot hurt people by reducing their access to care or their quality of \ncare, is to know what works and what does not work. That is precisely \nthe point of the research of AHCPR.\n  The current budget of AHCPR is about $160 million. This modest \ninvestment is just now paying off in research and guidelines which have \nthe potential to reduce cost and without a reduction in quality of \ncare. It is my hope that the Appropriations Committee will continue to \nprovide adequate appropriations for AHCPR and I will do my best to \nsupport the agency as the Congress makes its decisions on \nauthorizations and funding for the coming fiscal year.\n  I ask that the article from the Washington Post be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1995]\n\n     House Panel Would Kill Agency That Compares Medical Treatments\n\n                            (By David Brown)\n\n       It doesn't take long to go from being a solution to waste \n     to simply waste.\n       That, at least, is the congressional budget committees' \n     view of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. The \n     $162 million agency is the government home for ``medical \n     effectiveness research.''\n       When it was created by Congress in 1989, the AHCPR was \n     viewed as an essential tool in the effort to control medical \n     costs without damaging medical care. Last week, the Senate \n     Budget Committee proposed cutting its budget by 75 percent, \n     and the House Budget Committee said it should be eliminated \n     altogether.\n       AHCPR was launched with the great hope--much of it \n     enunciated by politicians--that it would help the country cut \n     health care costs painlessly by comparing competing treatment \n     strategies to see which works, best, and at the least cost.\n       Over the last five years, the agency has sponsored 20 \n     Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORTs), each headquartered at \n     a different hospital or university, which studied such topics \n     as back pain, schizophrenia, prostate enlargement, knee joint \n     replacement, cataracts, breast cancer and heart attack.\n       The teams reviewed the published medical literature on the \n     topic, delineated the variations in treatment, attempted to \n     uncover links between specific treatments and patient outcome \n     (often using large data banks kept by Medicare or private \n     insurance companies), and occasionally devised new tools. For \n     example, the prostate PORT created a video to educate \n     patients about what to expect with certain treatments--\n     including no treatment--and formally incorporated the tool \n     into medical decision-making.\n       Recently, AHCPR has begun funding randomized controlled \n     trials, which are generally the best way to compare one \n     treatment with another. The topics are ones unlikely to \n     appeal to the National Institutes of Health, where new \n     therapies, not old ones (or low-tech ones), are the preferred \n     subjects of clinical research.\n       AHCPR trials, for instance, are comparing chiropractic \n     treatment to physical therapy in low back pain; testing a \n     mathematical equation that identifies which patients are most \n     likely to benefit from ``clot-busting'' drugs for heart \n     attacks; and comparing homemade vs. commercial rehydration \n     fluids for children with diarrhea.\n       The agency also has sponsored 15 ``clinical practice \n     guidelines,'' which, based on the best medical evidence, \n     suggest how to treat such common (and unexotic) problems as \n     cancer pain, urinary incontinence and chronic ear infections.\n       In a recent example of that program's effects, researchers \n     at Intermountain Health Care System in Utah reported they had \n     cut the incidence of bedsores in high-risk (generally \n     paralyzed) patients from 33 percent to 9 percent at LDS \n     Hospital in Salt Lake City after implementing a modified \n     version of AHCPR's guideline on pressure ulcers. Incidence of \n     ulcers--which cost an average of $4,200 to treat--also fell \n     among lower-risk patients, and the hospital estimated the \n     annual savings will be at least $750,000.\n       To defund a relatively modest effort like that at a time \n     when the questions they need to answer are becoming even more \n     critical doesn't make a lot of sense to me,'' said Jay \n     Crosson, an executive in charge of quality assurance at \n     Permanente Medical Group, the physician organization of the \n     Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization (HMO). \n     There's a lot more work that needs to be done than even AHCPR \n     can fund.''\n       In explaining its recommendation of a 75 percent budget \n     cut, the Senate Budget Committee said AHCPR ``was to be the \n     primary administrator of comprehensive health reform''\n       This, however, is not true. Although data-gathering by \n     AHCPR-funded researchers presumably would have helped assess \n     the equity of a national health care program, the agency had \n     not official role in the defunct Clinton administration \n     plan.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7575-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE CITY OF LAUREL\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, celebrations to commemorate the \n125th anniversary of the establishment of the city of Laurel, MD, are \nbeing held throughout this year. The mayor of Laurel, Frank Casula, \nalong with the entire community, have planned several significant \nevents to commemorate this milestone.\n  First known as the ``Commissioners of Laurel,'' the citizens of \nLaurel established their home as recognized by the laws of Maryland in \n1870. Yet, even before then, the people of Prince Georges County were \nliving off the land now known as Laurel. The first grist mill that was \nerected in Laurel would be the outset of community development; many \nindustries, storefronts, offices and homes would eventually appear \nalong that particular stretch along the Patuxent River. Creating what \nis now known as Laurel's Main Street, the mill built by Nicolas Snowden \nin 1811, had laid the foundation for a thriving community.\n  By 1888, Laurel was the largest town in Prince Georges County and had \nbecome the focal point along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad between \nBaltimore and Washington, DC. In 1879, the Laurel Leader, one of the \noldest newspapers in the State of Maryland, was founded. The Leader \ncontinues to serve not only Laurel and Prince Georges County, but also \nthe bordering counties of Howard, Montgomery, and Anne Arundel.\n  Laurel was also a pioneering community in education. The first public \nhigh school in Prince Georges County is located in Laurel. Laurel \nElementary School was also the first public school in the county to \nhave a cafeteria to serve its students.\n  Laurel is a model of community spirit and cooperation. The activities \nbeing sponsored to commemorate this auspicious occasion exemplify the \ndeep devotion of Laurel's residents to their community. The spirit and \nenthusiasm of Laurel's citizens have been the foundation of its \nsuccess. These celebrations provide the opportunity to renew the \ndedication that has supported Laurel throughout its history and helped \nit to develop from a railroad stop to one of Prince Georges County's \nmost attractive communities.\n  We in Maryland are fortunate to have an area as community-oriented as \nLaurel. I join the citizens of Prince Georges County in sharing their \npride in Laurel's past and optimism for continued success in the years \nto come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7576-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7576-S7577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               PROSPECTS FOR PEACE IN BOSNIA AND CROATIA\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I commend the United Nations for \nits May 25 air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. It is about time the \nUnited Nations took an assertive, instead of a passive, approach to \ncarrying out its mandated responsibilities to defend Bosnian safe areas \nand the Sarajevo weapons exclusion zone. Even before the formal \nexpiration of the January-April cessation of hostilities in Bosnia, \nBosnian Serbs were violating their commitment to refrain from violence. \nThe Bosnian Government has defended itself, and apologists within the \nU.N. have mistakenly treated as equal the cease-fire transgressions of \nthe Serb aggressors and the Bosnian victims. This has been wrong. \nToday's decision, finally, to use force, which has long been \nauthorized, against those violating the weapons exclusion zone is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  But it is only a small step. I was not surprised to learn of the \nfailure of the [[Page S7577]] latest effort to appease Serbian leader \nMilosevic by offering to lift sanctions in exchange for his recognition \nof Bosnia and Croatia. The United States participated in this contact \ngroup offer despite the fact that Milosevic has repeatedly and \nblatantly violated his commitments to prevent shipments of arms to the \nBosnian and Croatian Serbs. The U.N. eased sanctions on Serbia in \nNovember with the understanding that Milosevic would stop supplies to \nthe Bosnian and Croatian Serbs. Faced with clear evidence that Serbia \nviolated this commitment, the U.N. Security Council nevertheless \nextended the easing of sanctions for a second period in April. In \nMilosevic's experience, aggression, false promises and delay pay \ndividends. No one has given him any reason to expect that serious \nconsequences will\n follow his failure to live up to his commitments.\n\n  Similarly, the Bosnian Serbs have every reason to doubt the resolve \nof the international community--represented by UNPROFOR--in carrying \nout its commitments to protect safe areas, enforce weapons exclusion \nzones, or deliver humanitarian assistance to starving communities. The \nBosnian Serbs have demanded and received from the U.N. treatment equal \nto that of their victims, the Bosnian Government. The U.N. has thus \nbecome a passive contributor to Bosnia's tragedy just as a witness who \ndoes not intervene to assist a victim can be judged to be an accessory \nto a crime. U.N. peacekeeping is truly at a crossroads in Bosnia--the \nlargest and most expensive U.N. peacekeeping mission in history. While \nUNPROFOR may have contributed to stability and delivery of humanitarian \nsupplies in the first year of its deployment, its compliant approach to \nresurgent Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia since then has called into \nquestion the U.N.'s capability to effectively carry out peacekeeping \nresponsibilities in the future.\n  We must make no mistake about the origins of the war in Bosnia. As \nWarren Zimmerman, the last U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia, made clear in \na recent Foreign Affairs article, the Serbs initiated the war in Bosnia \neven before the country declared its independence from Yugoslavia.\n  It is said by some that Bosnia's fate will have little impact on U.S. \nnational security. They are wrong. I believe that tolerance of visible \ngenocide and aggression in the heart of Europe cannot help but make \nmore probable the recurrence of these crimes in other places in the \nfuture. If that is the case, then the post-cold war world is likely to \nbe a Hobbesian one where independence for small democracies will all \ntoo often be painful and short-lived.\n  We must not let our desire to stop the killing in the Balkans lead us \nto blame the victims instead of the aggressor. We cannot let our \naversion to war obscure our vision of right and wrong. Is the post-cold \nwar era going to be known as the no-fault era, when strong countries \nused their influence merely to contain the bad things that happened to \nweak countries but with no blame assigned? Surely the United States, \nwhich was founded on the principles of freedom and ``certain \ninalienable rights'' will not participate indefinitely in a policy of \ndenying the pursuit and defense of basic human rights for Bosnians? \nAppeasement is never an honorable or effective course in foreign \npolicy. Appeasement of a ragtag band of former Communists and war \ncriminals--the Bosnian Serbs--is a dishonorable course which we should \nhave no part in.\n  I applaud the U.N.'s decision--supported by President Clinton--to use \nair strikes against the Bosnian Serbs May 25 in an effort to enforce \nthe weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo. I hope this is the \nbeginning of a more assertive U.N. approach in Bosnia which will be \nsustained and expanded as necessary even if, as Bosnian Serb leader \nKaradjic has promised, his forces retaliate. The only way to avoid a \nlarger Balkan war and to bring the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating \ntable is to stop Serbian aggression. Regrettably, talk alone will not \ndo the job.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7576-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  RAPE PREVENTION MONTH IN NEW JERSEY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

It \nis a severe problem and we must do all we can to reduce its incidence, \npunish offenders, and assist victims.\n  In this country, rape and child sexual abuse still continues to \nincrease at an alarming rate. Organizations like Women Against Rape in \nCollingwood, New Jersey have taken on the difficult task of combating \nrape by providing crime prevention programs, teaching rape prevention \ntechniques, offering escort services, and having hotline and counseling \nservices available.\n  For the 15th consecutive year, Women Against Rape is sponsoring the \nmonth of May as Rape Prevention Month. During this month they have \nworked hard to address this problem in both crisis and everyday \nsituations. Education is one of the first steps to stopping this awful \ncrime, and I commend the volunteers and professionals who have \ndedicated their time and effort to raise awareness about rape and \nsexual abuse.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7577-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7577-S7578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 SALUTE TO THE GOODSPEED OPERA COMPANY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Goodspeed \nOpera Company in my home town of East Haddam, CN for receiving the 1995 \nTony Award for Outstanding Achievement in Regional Theater. This award, \ngiven upon recommendation by the American Theater Critics Association, \nis the second such award received by the Goodspeed Theater and is well-\ndeserved recognition for the Goodspeed's decades-long record of \nexcellence in theater. This award marks the first time a national \nregional theater has received a second special Tony award for general \nexcellence.\n  The Goodspeed Opera House, located on the Connecticut River, was \noriginally built in 1876 by William Goodspeed, a shipping merchant. \nThis beautiful, six-story Victorian landmark fell into disuse and \ndisrepair in the early 1900s and basically sat abandoned until 1959 \nwhen it was saved from demolition through the efforts of the State and \ncommunity. With local support and significant private assistance, the \nbuilding was restored and reopened in 1963 as the Goodspeed Theater, \nhome to the Goodspeed Opera Company. Since that time, the Goodspeed has \nbeen dedicated to the advancement of the American Musical through the \ncreation of original musicals and the production and reinterpretation \nof classic American musicals.\n  Under the leadership of executive director, Michael Price, the \nGoodspeed Theater has developed dozens of original musicals, many of \nwhich have gone on to Broadway. These have included such well known \nmusicals as ``Annie,'' ``Shenandoah'' and ``Man of La Mancha.'' Just \nthis year, the Goodspeed sent its production of ``Gentlemen Prefer \nBlondes'' directly from East Haddam to Broadway.\n  The Goodspeed Opera Company has not only attracted national attention \nbut has also served as an artistic beacon for its own community. This \nspecial relationship is symbolized by the ongoing financial support of \nthe Chester and East Haddam communities as well as its numerous and \ndiverse audiences from all over the Northeast. The Goodspeed is the \nvery heart, both literally and figuratively, of my hometown of East \nHaddam. Not only is it our single largest industry and the cultural \ncenter of the region, it is also our main landmark and point of \nreference; in East Haddam, all roads lead to the Goodspeed.\n  It is also timely to note that the Goodspeed Theater receives support \nfrom the National Endowment for the Arts. In this time when Federal \nfunding for the arts is under attack, the Goodspeed exemplifies how a \nsmall Federal investment in a community arts organization can have an \nenormous yield. Theaters, such as the Goodspeed, assure that first rate \nartistic events and productions are accessible to people who do not \nlive near large urban cultural centers. At the same time, places like \nEast Haddam and its surrounding areas have enjoyed additional economic \nactivity brought in by theater patrons. And in the case of the \nGoodspeed, the benefits have been even broader since many of the \nmusicals created there have gone on to [[Page S7578]] become national \ntreasures seen and enjoyed by millions of people on Broadway and all \nover the country.\n  Once again, I congratulate the Goodspeed Opera Company on the Tony \nAward for Outstanding Achievement in Regional Theater and on its long \nrecord of excellence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7577-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     MEASURE RETURNED TO CALENDAR--SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 13\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 125, a \nresolution to honor the contributions of Father Joseph Damien de \nVeuster, submitted earlier today by Senators Akaka, Inouye, and others; \nthat the resolution and the preamble be agreed to, en bloc, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements appear \nin the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 125) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n                              S. Res. 125\n\n       Whereas Father Joseph Damien de Veuster was born in \n     Tremeloo, Belgium, on January 3, 1840;\n       Whereas Father Damien entered the Sacred Hearts Order at \n     Louvain, Belgium, as a postulant in January 1859 and took his \n     final vows in Paris on October 7, 1860;\n       Whereas, after arriving in Honolulu on March 19, 1864, to \n     join the Sacred Hearts Mission in Hawaii, Father Damien was \n     ordained to the priesthood in the Cathedral of Our Lady of \n     Peace on May 21, 1864;\n       Whereas Father Damien was sent to Puna, Kohala, and Hamakua \n     districts on the island of Hawaii, where Father Damien served \n     people in isolated communities for 9 years;\n       Whereas the alarming spread of Hansen's disease, also known \n     as leprosy, for which there was no known cure, prompted the \n     Hawaiian Legislature to pass an Act to Prevent the Spread of \n     Leprosy in 1865;\n       Whereas the Act required segregating those afflicted with \n     leprosy to the isolated peninsula of Kalaupapa, Molokai, \n     where those afflicted by leprosy were virtually imprisoned by \n     steep cliffs and open seas;\n       Whereas those afflicted by leprosy were forced to separate \n     from their families, had meager medical care and supplies, \n     and had poor living and social conditions;\n       Whereas in July 1872, Father Damien wrote to the Father \n     General that many of his parishioners had been sent to the \n     settlement on Molokai and lamented that he should join them;\n       Whereas on May 12, 1873, Father Damien petitioned Bishop \n     Maigret, having received a request earlier for a resident \n     priest at Kalaupapa, to allow Father Damien to stay on \n     Molokai and devote his life to leprosy patients;\n       Whereas for 16 years, from 1873 to 1889, Father Damien \n     labored to bring material and spiritual comfort to the \n     leprosy patients of Kalaupapa, building chapels, water \n     cisterns, and boys and girls homes;\n       Whereas on April 15, 1889, at the age of 49, Father Damien \n     died of leprosy contracted a few years earlier;\n       Whereas the Roman Catholic Church began the consideration \n     of beatification of Father Damien in February 1955, and \n     Father Damien will be beatified on June 4, 1995, by Pope John \n     Paul II in Brussels, Belgium;\n       Whereas Father Damien was selected by the State of Hawaii \n     in 1965 as 1 of the distinguished citizens of the State whose \n     statue would be installed in Statuary Hall in the United \n     States Capitol;\n       Whereas the life of Father Damien continues to be a \n     profound example of selfless devotion to others and remains \n     an inspiration for all mankind;\n       Whereas common use of sulfone drugs in the 1940's removed \n     the dreaded sentence of disfigurement and death imposed by \n     leprosy, and the 1969 repeal of the isolation law allowed \n     greater mobility for former Hansen's disease patients;\n       Whereas in the mid-1970's, the community of former leprosy \n     patients at Molokai recommended the establishment of a United \n     States National Park at Kalaupapa, out of a strong sense of \n     stewardship of the legacy left by Father Damien and the rich \n     history of Kalaupapa;\n       Whereas the Kalaupapa National Historic Park was \n     established in 1980 with a provision that former Hansen's \n     disease patients may remain in the park as long as they wish; \n     and\n       Whereas the remaining patients at Kalaupapa, many of whom \n     were exiled as children or young adults and who have endured \n     immeasurable hardships and untold sorrows, are a special \n     legacy for America, exemplifying the dignity and strength of \n     the human spirit: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States recognizes \n     Father Damien for his service to humanity and takes this \n     occasion to--\n       (1) celebrate achievements of modern medicine in combating \n     the once-dreaded leprosy disease;\n       (2) remember that victims of leprosy still suffer social \n     banishment in many parts of the world; and\n       (3) honor the people of Kalaupapa as a living American \n     legacy of human spirit and dignity.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution \nrecognizing the contributions of Father Damien, a very special person \nwho lived in Hawaii during the late 1800s, for his service to humanity. \nSenators Inouye, Daschle, Kennedy, Simon, and Murkowski have joined me \nas cosponsors of this measure.\n  Father Damien is best known for his tireless efforts to provide \nmaterial and spiritual comforts for leprosy patients at Kalaupapa, \nMolokai, during the latter half of the 19th century. Beloved by the \npeople of Hawaii and the country of his birth, Belgium, his life serves \nas a model for all mankind.\n  In recognition of his heroic acts, the Roman Catholic Church began \nthe consideration of Father Damien's beatification in 1955. The State \nof Hawaii, in 1965, selected Father Damien as one of its distinguished \ncitizens and his statue was installed in the U.S. Capitol's Statuary \nHall. I am pleased to announce that Father Damien will be beatified by \nPope John Paul II on June 4, 1995, in Brussels, Belgium.\n  Mr. President, lessons from the life of Father Damien extend beyond \nreligious beliefs and considerations. My resolution recognizes Father \nDamien's life for his overall service to humanity. Indeed, his life was \nnot that of an ordinary man.\n  Born in Belgium in 1840, Father Damien arrived in Hawaii in 1864 to \njoin the Sacred Hearts Mission in Honolulu. After several years of \nserving isolated communities on the island of Hawaii, Father Damien \nbecame concerned that many of his parishioners had been sent to \nKalaupapa, Molokai, a settlement established for leprosy patients in \n1865. In 1873, his request to serve the people of Kalaupapa was \ngranted.\n  For 16 years, Father Damien labored to bring material and spiritual \ncomfort to Kalaupapa's leprosy patients, building chapels, water \ncisterns, and boys and girls homes. His selfless devotion to the \npatients was evident when in 1876, he told a U.S. medical inspector, \n``This is my work in the world. Sooner or later I shall become a leper, \nbut may it not be until I have exhausted my capabilities for good.'' \nFather Damien died of leprosy, at the age of 49, on April 15, 1889. \nWhile his death was a devastating loss, the spiritual foundation that \nhe established for the community of Kalaupapa would forever be \nremembered by the people of Hawaii.\n  Out of concern that Father Damien's legacy and Kalaupapa's rich \nhistory not be forgotten, the Kalaupapa National Historical Park was \nestablished in 1980, with a provision that former leprosy patients may \nremain as long as they wish. While the common use of sulfone drugs \nsince the 1940s had rendered leprosy, or Hansen's disease, \ncontrollable, and the 1969 repeal of Hawaii's isolation law allowed \ngreater mobility for former leprosy patients at Kalaupapa, many \ncontinued to face discrimination and banishment from their families and \nthe community at large.\n  To show how the stigma of leprosy impacted everyday lives, I would \nlike to share with you the words expressed by a 70-year old woman who \nhad lived at Kalaupapa for 46 years. In part, she said, ``I was finally \nparoled in 1966. My mother was still alive, so I wrote to her and told \nher I was finally cured. I could come home. After a long while, her \nletter came. She said, ``Don't come home. You stay at Kalaupapa.'' I \nwrote her back and said that I wanted to just visit, to see the place \nwhere I was born. Again, she wrote back. This time she said, ``No, you \nstay there.'' You see, my mother had many friends and I think she felt \nshame before them. I was disfigured, even though I was cured. So she \ntold me, her daughter, ``Don't come home.'' She said, ``You stay right \n[[Page S7579]] where you are. Stay there, and leave your bones at \nKalaupapa.''\n  Mr. President, such testimony is not uncommon. For years, former \npatients from Kalaupapa struggled for respect and dignity. Though \nattitudes have changed over the years, much more needs to be done. We \nmust take every opportunity to educate our Nation on Father Damien's \nlife and the history of Kalaupapa. The history of Kalaupapa holds a \nuniversal lesson that is still valid as we deal with social issues of \ntoday, be it homelessness, AIDS, disabilities, or cultural differences.\n  While my resolution honors Father Damien, it also honors the people \nof Kalaupapa as a living American legacy of human spirit and dignity. \nIt celebrates the achievements of modern medicine in combating the \nonce-dreaded leprosy. And it remembers the victims of this disease that \nstill suffer social banishment in many parts of the world.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support in the adoption of my \nresolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7578-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO REPORT\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Carlin, of Kansas, to be Archivist of the United \n     States.\n               statement on the nomination of john carlin\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier this week, it was my privilege to \nintroduce former Kansas Governor John Carlin, President Clinton's \nnominee to be Archivist of the United States, at his confirmation \nhearing before the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  That nomination has now been unanimously reported out of that \nCommittee with a favorable recommendation. And as Governor Carlin is \nconfirmed by the entire Senate, I wanted to repeat some of the comments \nI made at his hearing.\n  Mr. President, the National Archives is an invaluable source of \ninformation and, no less important, inspiration for millions of \nAmericans who yearn to know more about our origins and our collective \nhistory.\n  Last year alone, more than one million of our fellow citizens visited \nthe Archives building in Washington. Another 1.3 million visited the \nNation's Presidential libraries. Countless more visited Federal records \ncenters to explore their family genealogy, or attending public programs \nsponsored by the Archives.\n  It is important to note that only a very small percentage of those \nwho use the National Archives every year have Ph.D's. The vast majority \nhave something more important than a Ph.D--They have curiosity and they \nhave pride in America's history.\n  These are the people who made Ken Burns' ``The Civil War'' a national \nphenomenon. These are the readers who made David McCullough's \n``Truman'' a deserved best seller. And these are the Americans to whom \nthe Archivist of the United States must answer.\n  In this, the Archivist is no different from the rest of us who are \ntemporarily entrusted with our positions. In the last two elections, \nvoters have insisted on a government that serves their needs, while \nreflecting their values. The National Archives should be in the \nforefront of this grassroots revolution.\n  I believe that the National Archives should reach out beyond the \nWashington beltway to the very heart of America. And the heart of \nAmerica is where John Carlin comes from.\n  I have known Governor Carlin for many years, and worked with him on \ncountless occasions during his 8 years as Governor. Though we are from \ndifferent parties, Governor Carlin was more interested in partnership \nthan in partisanship, when it came to doing what was right for Kansas.\n  I believe John Carlin is uniquely qualified to serve as our National \nArchivist. Following a period of internal strife and serious morale \nproblems, the Archives needs a leader--someone with the ability to \nframe a coherent vision, the skills to communicate it, and the \nwillingness to tap the talents of every single employee of the agency. \nGovernor Carlin is such a leader.\n  He demonstrated as much in spearheading the magnificent Kansas State \nHistory Museum and in his continuing involvement with the Kansas State \nHistorical Society.\n  Far from disqualifying him, as some professional historians have \nsuggested, Governor Carlin's political experience will make him a \npersuasive advocate for an agency whose cultural and educational \npossibilities are limited only by its resources.\n  As a member of the National Archives Foundation Board, the nominee \nunderstands better than anyone, that in this era of shrinking budgets, \nthe Archives will need to enlist private support to carry out its \npublic obligations. His years as a legislator and speaker of the Kansas \nHouse also afford him a unique perspective on Congress and its \noversight functions.\n  Finally, Governor Carlin also has a wealth of first hand experience \nin the preservation of Government records. When he left the Governor's \nOffice, he not only turned over all his papers to the Kansas State \nHistorical Society, he did so with the assurance that the entire \ncollection would be open as soon as possible and with no restrictions \nplaced upon it. He proved to be a man of his word, to the benefit of \nfuture students of Kansas history, and I am confident his service as \nArchivist of the United States will be of benefit to all students of \nAmerican history.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/25/senate-section/article/S7579-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7579-S7580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE BOARD\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
