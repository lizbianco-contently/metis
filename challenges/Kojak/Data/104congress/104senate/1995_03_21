Mr. President, you are chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I do not often have an opportunity to speak when \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina, also the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, is in the chair. I am in the middle of a \nseries of speeches on the defense budget, and I know that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina is very much for a strong national defense. I am \nalso for a strong national defense. But I have some questions about the \namount of money we ought to spend and whether or not it has been used \nin the most well-managed way. And so I am addressing that issue.\n  So today I wish to resume my presentation on the integrity of the \nDepartment of Defense budget.\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I provided some background \ninformation on how I got involved in defense issues in the early 1980's \nand have been involved with them since. I talked about how the spare \nparts horror stories convinced me that President Reagan's defense \nbuildup would lead to waste on a massive scale. I talked about how the \nspare parts horror stories drove me to the job of watchdogging the \nPentagon.\n  Today I wish to begin discussing the accuracy of the Department of \nDefense budget and accounting data. Each year, Congress debates the \nDepartment of Defense budget for days. I do not expect this year to be \nmuch different. In fact, the debate may intensify. It may intensify \nbecause some of my Republican colleagues are bent on pumping up the \ndefense budget again by billions of dollars. I am flat baffled by their \nproposal. I do not understand it. They want to start back up the \nslippery slope toward higher defense budgets \n[[Page S4208]]  when there is no reason for doing it. The Soviet threat \nis gone. The cold war is over. The defense budget should be leveling \noff, not going up. But I do not intend to debate that issue today. That \nis better debated when we are working on the appropriations and \nauthorization bills for the Department. My purpose today is to suggest \nthat we cannot make meaningful decisions on the defense budget until we \nget more reliable information.\n  I wish to talk about the soundness then of the Department of Defense \ninformation base. I wish to talk about the integrity of Secretary \nPerry's budget. The Department's financial records are the foundation \nfor this budget. Like a house or building, if it is going to stand the \ntest of time and if the building is going to serve its intended useful \npurpose, then a budget's foundation must likewise be built upon very \nsolid rock.\n  Secretary Perry's accounting and budget numbers should be accurate \nand complete. Sadly, however, every shred of evidence I have tells me \nthat Mr. Perry's budget structure is built on sand.\n  Do they understand that? I believe they do. I believe that there are \nsome people over there intent upon changing this, who right this very \nminute are working toward doing that. But the point is that job is a \nlong way from being done, because it is in such a sad state of affairs. \nWe are going to be called upon in the next couple months to make a \ndecision whether to spend $50 billion more than what the President \nproposed on defense. I do not see how we can make that decision with \nthe information on which the budget structure is formed if this is all \nbuilt on a foundation of sand. I will document the basis for that \nassertion in a moment.\n  Mr. Perry's financial records, the Department's budget books and \naccounting books are in a shambles. Mr. Perry has no way of knowing \nwhich numbers are true and which are false.\n  Inaccurate and misleading budget numbers erode our process of checks \nand balances, and they undermine accountability.\n  Bad information leads to bad decisions and hence bad Government.\n  The accounting books should provide a full and accurate record of how \nthe money was spent, what was purchased, and how much each item cost.\n  The accounting books should provide a historical record of past \nexpenditures.\n  The budget, by comparison, is supposed to tell us what is needed in \nthe coming year in the way of money and material.\n  The future years defense program, or FYDP, in turn, projects the \nfuture consequences of our budget decisions. All these books--the \nfuture year's defense program, the budget, as well as accounting book--\nshould hang together.\n  The books should be bound together by a common thread--accurate, \nconsistent data.\n  The budget should be hooked up to the accounting books, and the \nfuture year's defense program should be hooked up to the budget.\n  The books need to hang together for one very simple reason:\n  Much of what will be bought and done in the years ahead were bought \nand done last year and the year before.\n  If we do not know what we bought last year and how much it cost, it \nwill be impossible to figure out what we need next year. You cannot \ncraft a good budget with bad numbers. It is as simple as that.\n  There is no way to escape from this commonsense principle. If we do \nnot know what last year's defense program cost, then how in the world \ncan Mr. Perry figure out what he needs down the road--in the outyears?\n  That is it in a nutshell.\n  In the simplest terms, if we do not know where we have been and where \nwe are, we cannot possibly figure out where we are going. We may be \nlost.\n  Mr. President, all the DOD budget chains are broken. The essential \nlinks between the accounting records and the budget, and the budget and \nthe future year's defense program, are busted. We have mismatches \nwithin mismatches within mismatches.\n  Now, this is a very complicated subject, and my conclusions could be \ncontroversial. They could be challenged.\n  So it is important that I document my sources.\n  But I would like to warn my colleagues, these issues are not laid out \nin one single source. I have drawn on many different sources.\n  I will cite the main ones. There are others but the main ones are as \nfollows:\n  First, U.S. General Accounting Office, ``Financial Management: Status \nof Defense Efforts To Correct Disbursement Problems.'' (AIMD-95-7. \nOctober 1994.)\n  This work is continuing at the request of myself and Senators Roth \nand Glenn. I have used some updated data on disbursements and \nunreconciled contracts that does not yet appear in published reports.\n  Second, DOD inspector general, ``Fund Control Over Contract Payments \nat the Defense Finance and Accounting Service--Columbus Center.'' \n(Report No. 94-054. March 15, 1994.)\n  Third, U.S. Senate, Committee on Governmental Affairs. (Hearing on \nDOD Financial Management. April 12, 1994.)\n  Testimony by Comptroller General Bowsher and Senator Glenn provided \nmost of my information on overpayments to contractors.\n  Fourth, DOD inspector general, ``Consolidated Statement of Financial \nPosition of the Defense Business Operations Fund for Fiscal Year \n1993.'' (Report No. 94-161. June 30, 1994.)\n  Fifth, U.S. General Accounting Office, ``Defense Business Operations \nFund: Management Issues Challenge Fund Implementation.'' (AIMD-95-79. \nMarch 1995.)\n  Sixth, U.S. General Accounting Office, ``Future Years Defense \nProgram: Optimistic Estimates Lead to Billions in Overprogramming.'' \n(NSIAD-94-210. July 1994.)\n  The GAO's evaluation of the FYDP is continuing at the request of \nSenator Roth and myself. The ongoing work has two objectives:\n  Evaluate the data and methodology presented in Mr. Chuck Spinney's \nlatest study, ``Anatomy of Decline'' and the role of DOD's Office of \nProgram Analysis and Evaluation [PA]; and\n  Review the fiscal year 1996 FYDP.\n  Seventh, this is also by Chuck Spinney: ``Anatomy of Decline.'' \nOffice of Program Analysis and Evaluation, Department of Defense. \nFebruary 1995.\n  In order to save time, I will not make a detailed reference every \ntime I draw data from one of these sources.\n  Instead, I will try to identify the source in a more general way as I \ngo along.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my statement for today.\n  I will continue with more evidence tomorrow and Thursday and Friday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to James Larry \nBrown who died suddenly 2 weeks ago at the young age of 40.\n  Larry, as he was known by friends and family, was born and raised in \n[[Page S4209]]  Johnston County, NC, and spent his entire life in that \ntight-knit community. The hundreds of people who mourned his untimely \ndeath offer testimony to his character and the value of his life that \nended without warning.\n  As a young boy he sang in the choir at Carter's Chapel Baptist Church \nat Sunday services and for the sad occasion of a fellow parishioner's \nfuneral. In 1970, when he was 16 years old, he sang at the funeral of \nTammy Denise Woodruff, a 3-year-old child whose life was cut short. \nEach time he visited the grave site of that little girl who was buried \nnext to his mother, Lyda Mae, he wept for her. Tammy's gravestone read \n``Picking Flowers in Heaven.'' Larry now rests next to her. The \ncompassion he felt for a little girl he didn't even know is the finest \nexample of the compassion Larry Brown felt toward all human beings.\n  Larry wasn't a renowned scientist, an outspoken community activist, \nor a political leader. Larry was an ordinary man who lived and worked \nin his community for his entire life. He was the type of man that you \nwould want as a brother, as a father, as a neighbor and as a friend. \nWhether he knew you for 20 years or for 20 minutes, he would be there \noffering a shoulder to cry on, a helping hand, or a $20 loan he never \nexpected to be repaid.\n  Some of his neighbors knew him as Vicki's father, Mr. Larry, the one \nwho was always there working for the North Johnston High School Band \nBoosters to help them raise money and organize activities so the high \nschool could continue developing young minds and souls through music. \nOther Pine Level residents knew him as Megan's daddy, a devoted \nsoftball fan who never missed a single game his daughter played. \nParents and friends at the softball game always turned to Larry to find \nout the score at any given point in time. He always knew the answer \nbecause he kept the score in the soil beneath his lawn chair which he \nwould put in place at the start of the day's first game and not remove \nuntil all the games were over. He was every child's playmate and every \nparent's confidant. Most everyone knew him as a friend.\n  He married Colleen Kenney in 1975 after they met on a blind date when \nher family moved from Wisconsin to North Carolina. They would have \ncelebrated their 20th wedding anniversary this October and both Larry \nand Colleen were looking forward to spending the rest of their lives \ntogether. Colleen, Pine Level's Girl Scout troop leader, relied on \nLarry to help her with the tremendous task of helping these girls grow \nand learn about life, responsibility and the importance of community \nservice. It was a task he did well and with great dedication.\n  Almost as much as Larry loved his family, his friends and his \ncommunity, he loved the University of North Carolina Tar Heels. He was \nknown throughout Pine Level, Smithfield and Selma as one of the most \ndevoted Heels' fans in the State, never missing a game on television \nand invariably purchasing his cars and clothing in the Carolina Blue \ncolors of the Tar Heels. He engaged in good hearted rivalry with his \nneighbors who were fans of the NC State Wolfpack, gaining a reputation \nas not only a practical joker but also as a good sport. Larry loved to \nlaugh and loved to make others laugh--one of his extraordinary talents.\n  While family and friends were his first priority, Larry gained a \nreputation as a sympathetic, understanding and effective manager at \nData General and at Channel Master in Selma were he was working when he \ndied. Those that he worked with in the present and well over a decade \nago were struck by his death and came to pay him tribute. While working \nto support his family over the past 20 years, he was also able to \ncomplete his bachelors degree at the Atlantic Christian College. His \ngraduation day, just a few years ago, was a proud day for his family. \nIt was supposed to be just the beginning.\n  James Larry Brown will be missed by all who knew and loved him. \nHowever, we are comforted in our loss by the knowledge that his was a \nlife worthwhile, filled with compassion and kindness. We can only hope \nthat his life and sudden death will make us better people.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/21/senate-section/article/S4208-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CELEBRATING THE 19TH AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 75th \nanniversary of the passage of our Nation's 19th amendment. As my \ncolleagues know, this important amendment placed in law the right for \nwomen in the United States to vote and is now a cause to celebrate the \ncontributions and achievements of women.\n  The right to vote is indeed a precious right that we as Americans \nsometimes do not appreciate. Until 75 years ago, our forefathers did \nnot recognize that this right also applied to women. Women fought hard \nto secure this right. The 19th amendment has since become a turning \npoint symbolizing the remarkable contributions of women to our Nation's \npast, present, and future.\n  It is not an understatement that this amendment was the impetus for \nwomen to actively participate in politics, science, education, and \ncommerce. Once opportunities were presented, women have, through hard \nwork, excelled in their chosen professions.\n  This anniversary, therefore, marks the rise of women into positions \nof leadership. Women's History Month recognizes the achievements and \nthe contributions of these prominent members of our past such as Susan \nB. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. This becomes especially \nimportant as we look to our future.\n  Mr. President, it is in New York that Women's History Month has \nspecial meaning given that the formal beginning of the suffrage \nmovement began with a convention in Seneca Falls, NY. Today, Seneca \nFalls is the home of the Women's Rights National Historical Park and \nits history serves as an inspiration to all. I am pleased to lend my \nvoice to celebrate this anniversary.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/21/senate-section/article/S4209-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4209-S4210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE REGULATORY MORATORIUM BILL\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to describe the \neffect of the amendment I authored and which is now part of the \ncommittee substitute for S. 219, the regulatory moratorium legislation.\n  My amendment modifies the definition of ``significant regulatory \naction'' to include ``any action that withdraws or restricts \nrecreational, subsistence, or commercial use of any land under the \ncontrol of a Federal agency, except for those actions described under \nparagraph 4 (D) and (E).'' The effect of this amendment is to impose \nthe moratorium contained in the bill on any action by a Federal agency \nto withdraw or restrict commercial, recreational, or subsistence use of \nFederal lands.\n  The actions described in paragraph 4 (D) and (E) are ``any agency \naction that establishes, modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a \nregulatory program for a commercial, recreational, or subsistence \nactivity relating to hunting, fishing, or camping'' and ``the granting \nof * * * a license, * * * exemption, * * * variance or petition for \nrelief * * * or other action relieving a restriction * * *.'' In other \nwords, a Federal agency may continue to manage these activities, even \nif the management action involved would restrict the public's use of \nFederal lands. This means that a Federal agency may close wildlife \nrefuges to duck hunting, limit the number of people permitted in the \nNational Parks to the number of campsites available, or prohibit \ntrawling in certain areas to protect crab and halibut.\n  In addition, my amendment defines ``public property'' to mean ``all \nproperty under the control of a Federal agency, other than land.'' This \ndefinition is necessary because the bill provides that the moratorium \nshall not apply if the President finds that ``the action is * * * \nprincipally related to public property * * *.'' Without this \ndefinition, the President could circumvent the purpose of my amendment \nby simply finding that the closing of Federal lands to grazing or of a \nNational Forest to timber harvests is ``principally related to public \nproperty'' because the principal ``public property'' under the control \nof the Forest Service are National Forests. By limiting the definition \nof ``public property'' to ``all property * * * other than land'' my \namendment would allow the President to exclude from the moratorium any \naction related to managing public property like motor pools, \nwarehouses, and other buildings--including \n[[Page S4210]]  public toilets--in short, any action other than to \nrestrict land use.\n  Some have said this amendment goes too far. I think it does not. The \nPresident has plenty of exceptions that allow him to escape the impact \nof my amendment. There are exceptions for national security, law \nenforcement, health and safety, and international trade, among other \nthings. And in the final analysis, it is the President who makes the \nfinal call as to what regulations are impacted by this law. The intent \nof my amendment is clear--I want to put a halt to agency actions that \nneedlessly restrict the use of public lands.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, \nand his committee staff, particularly Frank Polk, Paul Noe, and Mickey \nProsser for their efforts in reporting this regulatory moratorium \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/21/senate-section/article/S4209-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      PRESIDENT CLINTON IMPLEMENTS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier today, President Clinton took a \nmajor step toward effective implementation of the new Violence Against \nWomen Act, which was enacted as part of the omnibus crime control law \nlast year.\n  President Clinton established a new Violence Against Women Office at \nthe Department of Justice, and appointed former Iowa Attorney General \nBonnie Campbell as Director of the Office. Ms. Campbell was the first \nwoman to hold the office of attorney general in Iowa, and in that \ncapacity, authored one of the Nation's first antistalking laws.\n  President Clinton also announced $26 million in State grants and a \ntoll-free domestic violence hotline. I was proud to be a strong \nsupporter of the act and to be the Senate sponsor of the hotline.\n  I commend the President for taking this important step in the fight \nto end violent crimes against women. The rates of violent crimes \ncommitted against women continue to rise. Nationwide a woman is beaten \nevery 15 seconds. Three to four million women a year are victims of \nfamily violence. In Massachusetts last year, a woman was murdered every \n16 days, and in this year alone, 17 women have been murdered as a \nresult of domestic violence.\n  It is clear that far more needs to be done to stop this violence. One \nof the most effective measures is to improve our methods of law \nenforcement and do more to prosecute and convict the perpetrators of \nthese crimes.\n  The Violence Against Women Act provides $1.6 billion over the next 6 \nyears to combat such violence. Included in those funds are grants to \nStates to train and hire more police and prosecutors for domestic \nviolence or sexual assault units, open new crisis centers for victims, \nhire advocates and crisis counselors, and improve lighting for unsafe \nstreets and parks.\n  These grants are a critical part of a comprehensive new effort to \ncombat violence against women. Police need better training, so that \nthey will make arrests when the situation warrants. Prosecutors need \nbetter training in how to work with victims, using victims' advocates \nwhen possible. Judges need to understand that domestic violence and \nother attacks against women are serious crimes. Often, when women are \nabused or beaten, the police, prosecutors, and judges fail to take the \ncrimes seriously enough. As a result, many women are reluctant to call \nthe police or seek help in other ways. These grants will help States \naddress these problems.\n  This new law is the first comprehensive Federal effort to deal with \nviolence against women. It protects the rights of victims. It makes it \na Federal offense to cross State lines to abuse a fleeing spouse or \npartner. It gives victims of violent crime or sexual abuse the right to \nspeak at the sentencing hearings of their assailants. It prohibits \nthose facing a restraining order on domestic abuse from possessing a \nfirearm.\n  I am particularly gratified by the restoration of the national, toll-\nfree domestic violence hotline, which will be administered by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Before the hotline was shut \ndown for lack of funds in 1992, it averaged over 180 calls a day, or \n65,000 calls a year, during the 5 years it was in operation. The \nhotline is a lifeline for women in danger. The nationwide system will \nenable any woman in trouble to call an 800 number and be advised by a \ntrained counselor on what to do immediately and where to go for help in \nher area.\n  I commend President Clinton for his leadership in implementing this \nlaw, and I look forward to working with the administration to continue \nto fight to end the tragedy of violence against women.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/21/senate-section/article/S4210-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, when Congress passed the Communications \nAct in 1934, telephones were a novelty. Sixty years later, most \nAmericans have affordable telephone service, thanks largely through a \nuniversal service system of support mechanisms. This is a success \nstory.\n  Universal service has been a success because policymakers had the \nforesight to understand that market forces, left to their own devices, \nwould not serve every American. Support mechanisms are necessary to \nensure that every American could have access to phone service and \nelectricity. This was true in building a nationwide phone network and \nit will be true in the future to deploy an advanced telecommunications \nnetwork.\n  Today we stand at the advent of a telecommunications revolution that \npromises to bring an explosion of economic activity and growth in rural \nAmerica that will rival the delivery of electricity to farms in the \nearly part of the century. The information age promises to bring \nopportunity to previously disadvantaged areas. Until now, geography has \nbeen, a disadvantage for rural America. Much of the \n[[Page S4211]]  business growth and development in America happens to \noccur in major urban centers out of geographic necessity, leaving rural \nAmerica at a significant disadvantage. The telecommunications \nrevolution is quickly changing all that, making a rural community in \nNorth Dakota as close to Manhattan as the Hudson River.\n  Satellites, fiber optic cable, digital switching devises and other \ntechnological developments make it possible for voice, video, and data \ntransmission to occur effectively and immediately between two locations \nthousands of miles apart. This means jobs, economic development, and \nopportunity unprecedented in rural areas that have historically been \nstruggling to build a promising future.\n  On the eve of our consideration of new major national \ntelecommunications policy, I am concerned that issues essential to \nrural America may be overshadowing by the battles between the industry \ntitans, like the regional Bell operating companies, long distance \ncarriers and national cable networks. We cannot forget to do what is \nright for all, and not just a few, Americans.\n  There is an obsession and worship of competition and deregulation \nthese days. After all, a free market driven by competition comprises \nthe economic fabric on which our Nation was built. At the same time, \nhowever, the country has always understood that these principles are \nnot always in everyone's best in interest. This dichotomy is of \nsignificant note as we chart the development of our Nation's \ntelecommunications policy and its impact on rural America.\n  The structure and the economics of the telecommunications industry is \nas complicated as scholastic philosophy. Our Nation already possesses a \nquality integrated telephone network that most Americans can access and \nenjoy the benefits of coast-to-coast communications. However, few \nunderstand and the complex interaction and coordination that is \nrequired to connect the hundreds of local phone companies and long \ndistance carriers. Although most Americans know the difference between \nlocal and long distance phone calls, few understand and appreciate the \ncomplexities of how long distance and local phone companies \ninterconnect.\n  For example, I would guess many Americans are not aware that the \nseven regional Bell operating companies [RBOC's] are not the Nation's \nonly local exchange carriers [LEC's]. Many Americans are surprised to \nlearn that there are hundreds of LEC's throughout\n the Nation. In fact, there are approximately 1,400 small cooperative \nand commercial systems serving people and communities throughout rural \nAmerica. These small and rural LEC's originated to bring service to \nareas considered unprofitable and undesirable by the industry's early \nleaders.\n\n  Together, these small and rural LEC's provide telecommunications \nservice to approximately 6.6 million rural Americans. Their combined \nservice areas cover some 1.7 million square miles and represent \napproximately 1 million route miles of infrastructure. While they serve \nabout 5 percent of the U.S. population, their service areas encompass \n40 percent of the Nation's land area. On average, their investment \ntotals approximately $2,500 for each subscriber. And, for the most \npart, the services they provide are equal or superior to those offered \nby the industry giants.\n  With these facts in mind, it should come as no surprise that these \nlow-density, high-cost areas are not natural candidates for competition \nand need support to deliver affordable service. They are neither \nmagnets for capital nor market-stimulating sources of revenues and \nprofits. Yet, despite the challenges these small and rural LEC's face, \nthey consistently provide universal service to their constituency. This \nis possible only through sound public policy that has historically \nrecognized rural is different.\n  That's what we really need to focus on today. Rural areas are \ndifferent. This does not suggest that competition should be rejected \nfor rural areas. Rather, we need to understand that competition in \nrural and high cost markets needs to be structured differently in rural \nareas. Universal service support is critical and the introduction of \ncompetition must be addressed with carefully constructed policy--not \nblind obedience to competition and deregulation.\n  There are two cardinal rules I want to impress upon my colleagues \ntoday. The first rule is that telecommunications reform must protect \nand preserve universal service support. Without such support, the \nfuture of rural telecommunications is a guaranteed disaster rather than \na promise for opportunity. The second cardinal rule is that competition \nin rural areas needs to be structured appropriately and it is \nimperative that safeguards be in place to ensure an orderly transition \nto a competitive marketplace.\n\n\n              PROTECTING AND PRESERVING UNIVERSAL SERVICE\n\n  A recent study entitled ``Keeping Rural America Connected: Costs and \nRates in the Competitive ERA'' reveals how the rural telecommunications \nmarketplace could be devastated without universal service support. \nSpecifically, it shows that rates would skyrocket to the point that \nmany rural Americans would be forced to simply decline service.\n  For example, the study demonstrates that without universal service \nsupport, local monthly rates would increase by $12.84 on average. \nMonthly toll rates would climb by $18.43. The combined monthly increase \nwould average an astounding 72.3 percent. And these are study-wide \naverages; the effects in some States are even worse.\n  Maintaining universal telecommunications service must remain our \nhighest priority. Any emerging national policy must embrace the concept \nof an ongoing and evolving universal service mandate. Moreover, such \npolicy must ensure that universal service initiatives are financially \nsustained by all market providers.\n  Some have argued in favor of reducing, and in some cases, \neliminating, the level of universal service support. This is flagrantly \ninconsistent with this Nation's 60-plus year commitment to universal \nservice for all Americans. Congress and the administration alike have \nset many ambitious goals for the Nation's telecommunications industry--\ngoals that can be met only if we are willing to make a renewed \ncommitment to support, not abandon, the policy of universal service.\n  The objective of introducing competition in local phone service is to \ndrive prices toward cost. In contrast, current practice reflects the \nlong-established national policy goal of setting rates at levels that \nmaximize subscription and use. That policy has proved very effective, \nenabling all of us to reap what economists call the ``external \nbenefits'' of broad access to the Nation's public switched network.\n  The largest LEC's want to base their rates on cost in order to \nconfront their onrushing competitors more effectively. That is \ncertainly understandable. They are large enough to make such pricing \nwork for both themselves and their subscribers. Nevertheless, it does \nnot necessarily make economic sense to force similar arrangements on \nsmall, rural LEC's. Cost-based pricing by rural LEC's would lead to \ndramatic rate increases for rural consumers. The value of a phone in \nRegent, ND is the same as the value of a phone in New York City. The \nonly way to prevent rate increases is to offset them through universal \nservice cost recovery mechanisms. This clearly points out the \nimportance of establishing strong universal service support mechanisms \nprior to permitting the modification of the industry's rate structure \nscheme.\n  Rural areas must have access to telecommunications capabilities and \nservices comparable to those in urban areas. To ensure this, Congress, \nthe FCC, and the telecommunications industry have established a number \nof support mechanisms, including geographic toll rate averaging, \nlifeline and linkup programs, local rate averaging, and the rural \nutilities service's, formerly REA, telephone loan program. These \nprograms and policies have made state-of-the-art telecommunications \ntechnologies available to rural Americans. In return for these \nsupports, LEC's agree to serve every resident in their service area who \nwants to be served. In many cases, it would have been impossible for \nLEC's to serve the entirety of sparsely populated service areas without \nsupport.\n              [[Page S4212]] competition in rural markets\n\n  The second cardinal rule is that blind allegiance to competition will \nhurt rural telecommunications delivery. The fact is that competition--\nwithout conditions--does not serve rural markets. Airline deregulation \nis but one example. In a deregulated environment, airlines have chosen \nnot to serve many rural areas. Why? Because the economics of \ncompetitive industry do not drive service into rural areas.\n  The fundamental premise in the telecommunications reform legislation \nwe considered last year--and that is emerging this year--is that \ncompetition will lead to lower rates and encourage investment. In most \ncases, this is the correct approach. Competition should be introduced \ninto all aspects of telecommunications. When the old Ma Bell was \ndivested of its local monopolies, separating long distance and \nmanufacturing services into competitive markets, competition lead to \nlower long-distance prices and a flood of new equipment into the \nmarketplace. Nobody can question that consumers have benefited from the \nemergence of hundreds of long distance companies and the thousands of \nnew products that were borne from a competitive equipment manufacturing \nindustry. Consumers have benefited from allowing competition in long \ndistance and manufacturing industries and I am confident that consumers \nwill also benefit under competitive local exchange service. Introducing \ncompetition into local telephone service can produce the same positive \nresult--but only if it is done right and a one-size-fits-all approach \nis not taken.\n  If unstructured competition is permitted in rural markets and \ncompetitors are allowed to cherry pick only the high revenue customers, \nserious destruction of the incumbent carrier, who is obligated to serve \nall customers, including the high cost residents, will occur. A local \ntelephone exchange is like a tent and if a competitor is permitted to \ntake out the center pole, the whole tent collapses. Larger markets may \nbe able to sustain some cherry picking, but in smaller rural markets, \nthe results could be higher residential rates.\n  The fact is that competition can be destructive in markets that \ncannot sustain multiple competitors. A blind allegiance to competition \ncould result in higher costs and diminished services for rural \nAmericans. The question is not whether or not competition should occur \nin rural areas. Rather the question is how can the rules of competition \nbe structured to ensure that rural consumers continued to relieve \nquality, affordable service. Without caution, we could be setting the \nstage for competition to jeopardize the national public switched \nnetwork--\n and universal service--that almost all Americans enjoy today.\n\n  Unstructured competition could lead to geographic winners and losers. \nWe must not agree to any policy that creates a system of information-\nage haves and have-nots. I cannot and will not support public policy \nthat leaves rural Americans reeling in its wake. An unrestricted \ncompetitive and deregulatory telecommunications policy will not work in \nrural America. Such policy in fact threatens higher, not lower, \nconsumer prices. Such policy in fact threatens less, not more, consumer \nchoice. And such policy in fact will cost taxpayers more, not less, \nwhen it forces existing LEC's out of business.\n  Telecommunications reform should not adopt a one-size-fits-all policy \nof competition and deregulation for the entire Nation. Competition and \nderegulation cannot work as a national policy without rural safeguards.\n  I am not interested in giving telephone companies a competitive \nadvantage over other telecommunications carriers. But I am interested \nin ensuring an affordable, high-quality telecommunications network in \nrural America. The cable industry and electric utilities want to \ncompete in the local exchange market and phone companies want to \ncompete in cable. I support breaking down the barriers that prohibit \nthese industries from competing in each other's businesses. However, we \nmust adopt safeguards that are in the interest of rural consumers who \nmust be our first concern. Only with safeguards are all rural Americans \nguaranteed to receive the high-quality, affordable telecommunications \nservice they deserve. That's the bottom line. New telecommunications \npolicy must be about rural consumers.\n  In exchange for universal service support mechanisms, telephone \ncompanies serving rural and high-cost areas have undertaken the \nobligation to serve areas that market forces would leave behind. The \nonly reason why thousands of Americans living in rural areas have phone \nservice is because our existing policies require certain carriers to \nprovide that service. In addition, necessary support mechanisms to \nensure that service are available so that service can be provided at an \naffordable rate. It seems to me that if competition is going to enter \ninto rural and high-cost areas, competitors ought to be required to \nundertake the same responsibilities. Let's not close the door to \ncompetition--but let's require competitors and incumbents alike to \ncarry the same burdens. This is the only way we can have fair \ncompetition in rural areas.\n  The fact is that U.S. telecommunications policy has always recognized \nlocal exchange service as essential to the well-being of all Americans. \nThe same cannot be said of cable TV or other related services. The key \npoint here is that we must not adopt any policy that would jeopardize \nthe provision of essential local exchange service. And we must \ncertainly not adopt any policy that would alter current policy so \ndramatically that the interests of rural consumers would suffer.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In summary, preserving universal service is sound public policy. \nUniversal service benefits the entire Nation, not just rural areas. As \nwe pursue new telecommunications policy, we must also ensure that real, \neffective mechanisms remain in place to preserve and advance universal \nservice. It is equally important to provide rural safeguards to ensure \nthat competition results in positive benefits for rural consumers. The \nconventional wisdom of free-market economics generally does not apply \nto the different conditions in rural America where low population \ndensity and vast service areas translate to less demand and higher \ncosts.\n  Telecommunications reform legislation is one of the most \ncomprehensive and significant pieces of legislation that many of us \nwill work on in our congressional careers. Not only does billions of \ndollars hang in the balance between some of the largest corporations in \nthe world, but more importantly, the affordability and effectiveness of \na central element of economic and social life of Americans is at \nstake--an advanced telecommunications network. I urge my colleagues to \naddress this legislation with an understanding and appreciation for the \ncomplexities involved and not to resort to easy ideological solutions. \nThere is too much at stake. Not only do all Senators have a common \nnational goal to promote the development of an advanced \ntelecommunications network, but we share the same responsibility to \nensure that all Americans have access to that network--regardless of \ntheir geographic residence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/21/senate-section/article/S4210-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     LEGISLATIVE LINE-ITEM VETO ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, \nthat is the second cloture motion that has been filed at the desk.\n  Mr. President, after discussion with the majority leader, I think it \nwould be well to inform my colleagues that we anticipate a cloture vote \non Wednesday, tomorrow, at some point, at the discretion of the \nmajority leader, and then again on Thursday and, if necessary, another \none on Friday.\n  I remind my colleagues that the bill is under consideration. It is \nopen for amendments. We welcome amendments at this time. I remind \nMembers that first-degree amendments must be filed by 1 p.m. today in \nthe event of a cloture motion.\n  Mr. President, in discussions with the majority leader, he has \ninformed me that, if necessary, we would stay, in order to complete \nconsideration of this bill in a timely fashion, that we would plan on \nstaying in late both tonight, tomorrow night, and Thursday night, if \nnecessary. Hopefully, that is not necessary. Hopefully, we can pass a \ncloture motion and close off debate in 30 hours, of course, with \nrelevant amendments that are germane to be considered at that time.\n  I also point out that, in the event there are amendments that are not \nruled specifically germane to the bill, the Members should file those \nby 1 p.m. today.\n  Mr. President, it is clear the intentions on this side of the aisle, \nand with the majority leader's help, that we do not intend to drag this \ndebate out for weeks. We intend to dispose of the issue. It has been \nbrought up on numerous occasions, dating back to 1985. As short a time \nago as last year, a sense- of-the-Senate resolution basically \nencompassing most of the provisions of the Dole substitute was voted \non, and the issue is clear and will not require extended debate in the \nview of the majority leader and those on this side of the aisle.\n  Let me just point out, in the 99th Congress, a hearing was held in \ncommittee and the motion to proceed was filibustered. There are 53 \ncurrent Members of the Senate who were here then. It has been \nreintroduced every Congress since then. Additionally, in 1990, on July \n25, the Senate, the Budget Committee, favorably reported this bill, and \nfinally during the 103d Congress, the Senate voted on a sense of the \nSenate regarding this issue.\n  I also remind my colleagues that the bill is very short. It is five \npages and one sentence long. It does not require a great deal of time \nand effort to digest it. It is, I think, rather simple, rather brief, \nespecially compared with bills that we dispose of that are of much \ngreater length on a routine basis around here.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, there will be questions about this bill. \nThere will be amendments, hopefully, that will help define this \nlegislation. We do not view it as perfect. But the fundamentals \nassociated with it are, in my view, important and unchangeable.\n  Those are based around the following assumptions:\n  First, that it would require a two-thirds majority in both Houses in \norder to override the President's veto. In my view, that is the \nfundamental principle behind the line-item veto and one that is not \nnegotiable.\n  Second, the separate enrollment aspect which allows the President to \neliminate pork using his constitutional authority by a simple veto as \neach piece of legislation is divided up into separate bills. Now, there \nwill be a lot of discussion about that, Mr. President. There was the \nlast time, in 1985, when it was brought up.\n  I point out that I went to see the enrolling clerk to be briefed on \nthe mechanics of separate enrollment. We did a little experiment where \nwe took the Commerce, Science, and Justice bill, which is the largest \nappropriations bill that was passed last year, just as a trial run, and \nwe broke it up into some 500 pieces of separate enrolled legislation.\n  I think to ask the President to sign a bill 500 times is a chore. I \nalso believe that to allow tens of billions of dollars of wasteful and \nunwanted spending to be included, tucked into various appropriations \nbills, is a far more serious and grievous error.\n  In another provision of the bill is the sunset provision, which would \nsunset this line-item veto authority after 5 years. I was not \nparticularly happy about that provision, Mr. President, but there are \nthose on both sides of the aisle that view this for what it is--a \nsignificant shift in authority from the legislative to the executive \nbranch.\n  There are concerns about abuse of this power. So they want an \nopportunity to review the results of the enactment of this legislation \nafter a 5-year period.\n  Frankly, I think that that is appropriate. That is another aspect of \nit.\n  The final aspect of it, Mr. President, that is going to be debated \nand be significantly involved is the targeted tax benefits. The \ntargeted tax benefits allows the President to eliminate specific \ntargeted tax benefits. These are rightful shots for transition benefits \nthat help but a few that are not applicable to the general population.\n  The bill states clearly, and I quote from the legislation:\n\n       (5) The term ``targeted tax benefit'' means any provision:\n       (A) estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation as losing \n     revenue within the period specified in the most recently \n     adopted concurrent resolution on the budget . . .\n       (B) having the practical effect of providing more favorable \n     tax treatment to a particular taxpayer or limited group of \n     taxpayers when compared with other similarly situated \n     taxpayers.\n\n  What that means, Mr. President, is that we are trying to avoid the \nso-called transition rules in which tax breaks are included for favored \nindividuals or companies. We are trying to avoid things like what \nhappened--and I quote from a New York Times article of May 20, 1994:\n\n       A case in point is a provision that would allow some \n     homeowners who rent their homes for a brief period to \n     continue to escape taxes on their rental income. . . .\n       Since 1976, income from homes and apartments rented for 15 \n     days a year or less has been tax free. No one now in Congress \n     knows for sure, but the word in tax circles for years is this \n     was put into the law for the benefit of people who live in \n     and around Augusta, GA, and who rent their homes for \n     thousands of dollars each April for the Masters golf \n     tournament. At the time that the measure went into the Tax \n     Code, Herman E. Talmadge, Democrat of Georgia, was the \n     second-ranking Senator on the Finance Committee.\n       This year, to raise money to offset various tax cuts, the \n     House decided to abolish the 15-day rule. But one narrow \n     exception was provided. The rent would still not be taxable \n     if the home was in an area where there was not enough hotel \n     or motel space to accommodate visitors at a particular event. \n     . . .\n       The folks in Atlanta who are planning housing for the 1996 \n     Olympics this summer are quite pleased with the outcome.\n\n  Mr. President, we cannot do that anymore. There is going to be an \nargument to expand this provision to basically any tax provision in the \ntax law, in tax bills that are passed.\n  I think that would be very dangerous. I believe that if we did that, \nthen that would give the President of the United States the ability to \nveto things like home mortgage deductions, medical expenses deductions, \nchild care tax credit, exclusion from income of employer-provided \nhealth care benefits, earned income tax credit, personal exemption, \nspecial exemption for the blind, special exemption for the elderly, et \ncetera, including charitable contribution deductions and State and \nlocal tax deductions.\n  The bill is intentionally narrowly focused on targeted tax benefits \nto prevent the same kind of abuses that have become rampant in the \nappropriations process.\n  I want to point out again and again and again, Mr. President, two-\nthirds versus a simple majority is the crux of this bill.\n  We asked for an opinion by the Congressional Research Service on the \nconstitutionality of separate enrollment. There is a Congressional \nResearch Service memorandum to the Honorable Dan Coats from Mr. Johnny \nH. Killian, who is a senior specialist in American consultant law. The \nsubject is separate enrollment bill and the Constitution.\n  It is a little long, but I think it is important enough to ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to print it in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [[Page S4214]] Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1995.\n     To: Hon. Dan Coats. Attention: Megan Gilley.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Separate enrollment bill and the Constitution.\n       This memorandum is in response to your request for a \n     constititional analysis of the draft substitute for the \n     various item veto-rescission proposals now pending in the \n     Senate. Briefly, your substitute would direct that the \n     appropriations committees, the authorization committees in \n     designated cases, and conference committees in designated \n     cases to include within their bills reported to the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate a level of detail on the \n     allocation of an item of appropriation (or other authority) \n     as is proposed by that House such as is set forth in the \n     committee report accompanying such bill. The substitute then \n     provides for separate enrollment of the designated bills, \n     once passed by both Houses in identical language, as is \n     detailed below.\n       Discussion here is of particular problems relating to \n     passage of the separated bills, insofar as constitutional \n     issues are raised. We do not deal in this memorandum with the \n     larger issues of separate enrollment and the item veto.\\1\\ In \n     a considerable amount of published material since the \n     preparation of the two memoranda, cited in n. 1, separate \n     enrollment has not been dealt with, the controversy exciting \n     much of the writing being the dispute over the assertion that \n     the President already has the power of item veto if he would \n     but use it.\\2\\ Discussion of that subject we also pretermit. \n     It is to the constitutionality of the mechanics of the \n     proposal's implementation that we turn.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n       Under the proposal, once an appropriations bill and any \n     authorization bill or resolution providing direct spending or \n     targeted tax benefits has passed both Houses of Congress in \n     the same form, the Secretary of the Senate (if the bill or \n     joint resolution originated in the Senate) or the Clerk of \n     the House of Representatives (if the bill or joint resolution \n     originated in the House of Representatives) would cause the \n     enrolling clerk of such House to enroll each item of \n     appropriation or covered authorization as a separate bill or \n     joint resolution. The separately enrolled measure is to be \n     enrolled without substantive revision, is to conform in style \n     and form to the applicable provisions of chapter 2 of title 1 \n     of the United States Code, and is to bear the designation of \n     the measure of which it was previously a part plus such other \n     designation as to distinguish it from the other items \n     separately enrolled from the same bill. The critical \n     provision then is the following excerpted section.\n       ``A measure enrolled pursuant to [this act] with respect to \n     an item shall be deemed to be a bill under clauses 2 and 3 of \n     section 7 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n     States and shall be signed by the Speaker of the House and \n     the President of the Senate, or their designees, and \n     presented to the President for approval or disapproval (and \n     otherwise treated for all purposes) in the manner provided \n     for bills and joint resolutions generally.''\n       Constitutional difficulty for the separate-enrollment \n     proposal may be raised by the effectuation of this section. \n     At present, when both Houses have passed a bill in the same \n     form, it is presented by the last House acting on it to a \n     specially appointed clerk for enrolling. Bills and joint \n     resolutions are enrolled, and the enrolling clerk is to make \n     no change, however unimportant, in the text of a bill or \n     joint resolution, although the two Houses may, by concurrent \n     resolution, authorize the correction of errors when \n     enrollment is made. Following enrollment, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and the President of the Senate sign \n     the bill, and it is then presented to the President.3\n       How is it, then, it may be asked, that separate bills, \n     which in their subsequent form have not passed both Houses, \n     may be deemed bills that have passed both Houses and are then \n     properly presented to the President? It is not\n      possible to make a definitive answer to this question. Sound \n     precedent is lacking. However, one may, on the basis of \n     existing precedents and general principles derived from \n     the rule-making powers of both Houses, develop two \n     possible resolutions to the quandary that will be suitable \n     in form for each House to make its own constitutional \n     determination.\n       Each House of Congress is empowered to ``determine the \n     Rules of its Proceedings,'' Art. I, Sec. 5, cl. 2. The \n     authority is quite broad and leaves much to the discretion of \n     each House, but it is not limitless. United States v. Ballin, \n     144 U.S. 1 (1892). In that case, the House of Representatives \n     had adopted a rule to break the obstruction of some Members \n     who would deny the existence of a quorum to do business by, \n     though present, refusing to vote or otherwise indicating \n     their presence for purposes of determining a quorum. The rule \n     authorized the Speaker to have the names of nonvoting Members \n     recorded and the Members counted and announced in determining \n     the presence of a quorum. When the rule was challenged, by \n     those asserting that a bill was not passed with a sufficient \n     quorum present, the Court rejected the attack.\n       ``The Constitution empowers each house to determine its \n     rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore \n     constitutional constraints or violate fundamental rights, and \n     there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or \n     method of proceeding established by the rule and the result \n     which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations \n     all matters of method are open to the determination of the \n     house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some \n     other way would be better, more accurate or even more just. \n     It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different \n     one has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. \n     The power to make rules is not one which once exercised is \n     exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be \n     exercised by the house, and within the limitations suggested, \n     absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body or \n     tribunal.'' Id., 5.\n       Inasmuch as the Constitution required a quorum to do \n     business but prescribed no method of making the determination \n     of the existence of a quorum, ``it is therefore within the \n     competency of the house to prescribe any method which shall \n     be reasonably certain to ascertain the fact.'' Id., 6. The \n     Court then listed several methods the House might have used. \n     ``Any one of these methods, it must be conceded, is \n     reasonably certain of ascertaining the fact, and as there is \n     no constitutional method prescribed, and no constitutional \n     inhibition of any of those, and no violation of fundamental \n     rights in any, it follows that the house may adopt either or \n     all, or it may provide for a combination of any two of the \n     methods.'' Ibid. Ballin, thus, stands for the proposition \n     that the power of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     is quite broad and that the Court will defer in large \n     measure; but by its phrasing, the Court clearly said that it \n     has power to review rules and their application, if there are \n     constitutional inhibitions in existence or if private rights \n     are alleged to be abridged.\n       That judicial review of congressional rules may be an \n     expansive power is illustrated by United States v. Smith, 286 \n     U.S. 6 (1932), an opinion by Justice Brandeis. Smith \n     concerned the meaning of a disputed rule of the Senate. The \n     Senate has confirmed an appointee to the FPC, the President \n     had been notified, the commission was signed, and Smith took \n     office. The Senate then requested that the nomination be \n     returned for reconsideration; upon the President's refusal, \n     the Senate nonetheless voted again and refused confirmation. \n     The Senate relied upon a role that it construed to authorize \n     such reconsideration.\n       ``The question primarily at issue,'' the Court said, \n     ``relates to the construction of the applicable rules, not to \n     their constitutionality,'' Id., 33 (emphasis supplied). The \n     supposed Ballin limits were passed. ``As the construction to \n     be given to the rules affects persons other than members of \n     the Senate, the question presented is of necessity a judicial \n     one.'' Ibid. While the Court purported to give great \n     deference to the Senate's construction of its rules, it read \n     the text of the rules, the history and precedents, and the \n     mischief attendant on the Senate's construction to interpret \n     the rules as precluding reconsideration of the appointment. \n     Id., 35-49.\\4\\\n       Other cases to be noticed are Christoffel v. United States, \n     338 U.S. 84 (1948), and Yellin v. United States, 374 U.S. 109 \n     (1963), both relating to the practice of investigating \n     committees in following House rules, Christoffel involved the \n     question whether the fact that a quorum existed at the \n     beginning of a hearing created the presumption that a quorum \n     continued throughout, including when perjured statements were \n     made, as the house contended. The Court held that it must be \n     shown that a quorum was actually present when the perjury was \n     committed. In Yellin, the Court set aside a contempt-of-\n     Congress conviction, because it found the committee had \n     failed to follow its rules, rejecting the argument that under \n     the congressional interpretation of the rules the rules were \n     followed.\n       The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     has long emphasized that the rulemaking clause ``creates a \n     `specific constitutional base' which requires [the courts] to \n     `take special care to avoid intruding into a constitutionally \n     delineated prerogative of the Legislative Branch.'' Vander \n     Jagt v. O'Neill, 699 F.2d 1166, 1173 (D.C.Cir. 1982) (quoting \n     Harrington v. Bush, 553 F.2d 190, 214 (D.C. 1977)), cert. \n     den., 464 U.S. 823 (1983); Metzenbaum v. FERC, 675 F.2d 1282, \n     1287 (D.C.Cir. 1982). Nevertheless, the Vander Jagt court \n     dismissed the action, brought by minority-party Members of \n     Congress to contest the party distribution of committee \n     seats, only because it felt the Members had alternative \n     routes to political relief. In Gregg v. Barrett, 771 F.2d 539 \n     (D.C.Cir. 1985), after dismissing Members as plaintiffs in a \n     suit challenging the accuracy of the Congressional Record, \n     the Court reached the merits of the suit on behalf of private \n     plaintiffs, although it decided against them. And, quite \n     recently, in Michel v. Anderson, 14 F.3d 623 (D.C.Cir. 1994), \n     the court reviewed on the\n      merits (finding constitutional) the changes in House rules \n     permitting delegates from the territories and the District \n     of Columbia to vote in the Committee of the Whole, subject \n     to revoting in certain instances.\\5\\\n       Thus far, we have established that the rule-making power of \n     each House is broad and is entitled to judicial deference, \n     although if there is a constitutional barrier to a particular \n     rule or impairment of a private right there may well be a \n     judicial remedy. We must, therefore, turn to the exercise of \n     the rule-making power of each House in the specific context \n     of the enactment of the separately-enrolled bills.\n       [[Page S4215]] Beginning that consideration leads us to \n     Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892), decided \n     the same Term as Ballin. In Clark, certain parties challenged \n     the validity of a tariff law, authenticated by the Speaker of \n     the House and the President of the Senate as having passed \n     Congress, signed into law by the President, and furnished to \n     the Public Printer by the Secretary of State as a correct \n     copy of the law. It was contended that the bill had not been \n     passed because congressional documents showed that a section \n     of the bill, as it finally passed, was not in the bill \n     authenticated by the signatures of the two officers and \n     approved by the President. The holding of the Court was that \n     the judiciary may not look behind the authenticating \n     signatures of the Speaker of the House and the President of \n     the Senate. Its reasoning requires lengthy quoting.\n       ``The argument . . . is, that a bill, signed by the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives and by the President of the \n     Senate, presented to and approved by the President of the \n     United States, and delivered by the letter to the Secretary \n     of State, as an act passed by Congress, does not become a law \n     of the United States if it had not in fact been passed by \n     Congress. In view of the express requirements of the \n     Constitution the correctness of this general principle cannot \n     be doubted. There is no authority in the presiding officers \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate to attest by \n     their signatures, nor in the President to approve, nor in the \n     Secretary of State to receive and cause to be published, as a \n     legislative act, any bill not passed by Congress.\n       ``But this concession of the correctness of the general \n     principle for which the appellants contend does not determine \n     the precise question before the court; for it\n      remains to inquire as to the nature of the evidence upon \n     which a court may act when the issue is made as to whether \n     a bill, originating in the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate, and asserted to have become a law, was or was not \n     passed by Congress. Id., 669-670.''\n       The challengers asserted that courts should recur to the \n     journal required to be kept by the Constitution. Art I, \n     Sec. 5, cl. 3. But the Court denied that the journal was the \n     best, if not conclusive, evidence upon the issue of whether a \n     bill, in the same form, was, in fact, passed by the two \n     Houses of Congress. The purpose of the requirement was not \n     related to this function, and there was no express \n     requirement in the Constitution relating to this question and \n     others pertaining to bills and joint resolution for inclusion \n     in the journal. These and other matters were left to the \n     discretion of Congress. To what should the courts look?\n       ``The signing by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and by the president of the Senate, in open \n     session, of an enrolled bill, is an official attestation by \n     the two houses of such bill as one that has passed Congress. \n     It is a declaration by the two houses, through their \n     presiding officers, to the president, that a bill, thus \n     attested, has received, in due form, the sanction of the \n     legislative branch of the government, and that it is \n     delivered to him in obedience to the constitutional \n     requirement that all bills which pass Congress shall be \n     presented to him. And when a bill, thus attested, receives \n     his approval, and is deposited in the public archives, its \n     authentication as a bill that has passed Congress should be \n     deemed complete and unimpeachable. As the President has no \n     authority to approve a bill not passed by Congress, an \n     enrolled act in the custody of the Secretary of State, and \n     having the official attestations of the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives, of the President of the Senate, and of \n     the President of the United States, carries, on its face, a \n     solemn assurance by the legislative and executive departments \n     of the government, charged, respectively, with the duty of \n     enacting and executing the laws, that it was passed by \n     Congress. The respect due to coequal and independent \n     departments requires the judicial department to act upon that \n     assurance, and to accept, as having passed Congress, all \n     bills authenticated in the manner stated; leaving the courts \n     to determine, when the question properly arises, whether the \n     act, so authenticated, is in conformity with the \n     Constitution.'' Id., 672.\n       Upon the correct interpretation of Clark and the \n     convergence of Clark and Ballin, we suggest, may be found the \n     solution to the issue of the validity of the passage of a \n     series of bills after the passage of the one bill from which \n     the many bills are extracted. The difficulty is that it is \n     not clear what the correct\n      interpretation of Clark is; below, we set out three \n     possibilities and evaluate them.\n       First, Clark may be read as simply holding that the ``best \n     evidence'' of whether a bill had passed both Houses may be \n     found in the signatures of the Speaker of the House and the \n     President of the Senate. The Court would not allow \n     challengers to use the Journal or other legislative evidence \n     to counter the attesting signatures. In a very recent \n     decision, the Court, in part, casually adopted this reading \n     of Clark, but it did so in a footnote that also ambiguously \n     appears to go beyond that simple explanation. United States \n     v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. 385, 391 n. 4 (1990).\\6\\ Inasmuch \n     as that footnote is relevant here and will be relevant in a \n     subsequent portion of this memorandum, we here quote the \n     entire pertinent parts of the footnote.\n       ``[Clark] concerned ``the nature of the evidence'' the \n     Court would consider in determining whether a bill had \n     actually passed Congress. Id. [143 U.S.], at 670. Appellants \n     had argued that the constitutional Clause providing that \n     ``[e]ach House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings'' \n     implied that whether a bill had passed must be determined by \n     an examination of the journals.. . . The Court rejected that \n     interpretation of the Journal Clause, holding that the \n     Constitution left it to Congress to determine how a bill is \n     to be authenticated as having passed. Id., at 670-671. In the \n     absence of any constitutional requirement binding Congress, \n     we stated that ``[t]he respect due to coequal and independent \n     departments'' demands that the courts accept as passed all \n     bills authenticated in the manner provided by Congress. Id., \n     at 672. Where, as here, a constitutional provision is \n     implicated, Field does not apply.''\n       Should Clark be taken to be simply about what is the ``best \n     evidence'' that a bill passed both Houses, then in \n     practically all instances the attesting signatures will be \n     decisive. However, respecting the proposals for a separate \n     enrollment following adoption of a single bill and its \n     division into many bills, with these multiple bills being \n     ``deemed'' to have passed both Houses, it is possible that \n     the courts would adopt a different view. Because both Houses \n     have adopted rules that expressly provide for a separate \n     enrollment, deeming, and the attestation signatures, the \n     courts could exercise judicial review to consider on the \n     merits the rules and their comportment with the Constitution, \n     viewing the\n      signatures of the two officers as essentially irrelevant in \n     the context of this particular situation.\n       Adoption of this reading of Clark, with an exception, would \n     not void the rules thus adopted. It would simply mean that \n     the courts would review the rules on the merits.\n       Second, Clark may be read much more broadly than merely as \n     a best evidence rule. The paragraph quoted in full above from \n     Clark does not read as if it is a decision placing a burden \n     of persuasion on some person or at some point. Rather, the \n     passage has the flavor of a ``political question'' approach \n     to a constitutional issue. ``The respect due to coequal and \n     independent departments requires the judicial department to \n     act upon that assurance, and to accept, as having passed \n     Congress, all bills authenticated in the manner stated. . . \n     .'' Clark, supra, 143 U.S., 672, See baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. \n     186, 217 (1962) (Identifying the features that identify \n     political questions, including ``the impossibility of a \n     court's undertaking independent resolution [of an issue] \n     without expressing lack of respect due coordinate branches of \n     government''). See also INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 941 \n     (1983) (quoting Baker); Nixon v. United States, 113 S.Ct. \n     732, 735 (1993) (quoting two of the other standards of \n     Baker). Indeed, in Baker, itself, the Court viewed Clark as a \n     political question case.\\7\\ The political-question doctrine \n     is ``essentially a function of the separation of powers.'' \n     Baker v. Carr, supra, 217.\n       Baker, of course, is qualified in a number of respects. \n     ``Our system of government requires that federal courts on \n     occasion interpret the Constitution in a manner at variance \n     with the construction given the document by another branch. \n     The alleged conflict that such an adjudication may cause \n     cannot justify the courts' avoiding their constitutional \n     responsibility.'' Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 549 \n     (1969). In that case, the action of the House of \n     Representatives in excluding a Member-elect from office was \n     reviewed and overturned, because the Court determined that \n     there was a constitutional provision governing resolution of \n     the matter, a clause establishing exclusive qualifications \n     that the House had violated. See also United States v. Munoz-\n     Flores supra, 495 U.S., 389-396 (refusing to find a political \n     question bar to judicial resolution to whether a revenue-\n     raising measure did not originate in the House of \n     Representatives, as required by the origination clause).\n       Nonetheless, the political-question doctrine remains alive \n     if restrained in the courts. For example, in Nixon v. United \n     States, supra, 113 S. Ct., 735-740, the Court refused to \n     review, using the political-question doctrine, a claim by an \n     impeached federal judge that the Senate had used invalid \n     procedures in trying him. Under the impeachment clause, Art. \n     I, Sec. 3, cl. 6, ``[t]he Senate shall have the sole Power to \n     try all Impeachments.'' Under a rule of the Senate, a special \n     committee of Senators is appointed to ``receive and report \n     evidence.'' After hearings, the committee submits a \n     transcript and summary of its proceedings to the Full Senate, \n     which then conducts a trial. Nixon argued that the special-\n     committee procedure denied him a trial before the full \n     Senate. Applying two standards from the Baker list, the Court \n     found that the word ``sole'' in the clause was a textual \n     commitment of authority to the Senate to act alone without \n     court review; further, the Court found the word ``try'' in \n     the clause was sufficiently indefinite to cabin the Senate's \n     discretion, thus using the lack of judicially-manageable \n     standards factor of Baker. See also id., 738-739 (referring \n     to other Baker factors).\n       Superficially, the application of the political-question \n     doctrine in this context is contrary to INS v. Chadha, supra, \n     462 U.S., 940-943. That decision denied that a challenge to \n     the legislative veto presented a political question, and on \n     the merits the Court went on to hold that for a congressional \n     measure to have legal effect outside Congress it must be \n     acted on bicamerally and when passed in identical terms by \n     both Houses must be presented to the President. The Court \n     provided a truncated version of the quotation from Clark, \n     which we quoted above, to reject the argument that the issue \n     presented a politcal \n     [[Page S4216]]  question. It did not consider the issue of \n     the effect of attesting signatures by the two congressional \n     officers, and it could not have done so because only bills \n     and joint resolutions are enrolled, signed, and presented to \n     the President. The simple resolution before the Court in \n     Chadha was not enrolled, signed, and presented to the \n     President, and neither was the concurrent resolution in \n     question in two-House legislative vetoes.\\8\\\n       Chadha, thus, was a case in which by statute congressional \n     actions having legal impact outside Congress were provided \n     for in which, in some instances two-House actions were \n     authorized, in others one-House actions, and none of the \n     resolutions or concurrent resolutions was presented to the \n     President. Chadha is, therefore, of no precedential value in \n     this context, although it must be considered below.\n       If, under the political-question doctrine, courts will not \n     look behind the attestation signatures of the Speaker and the \n     President of the Senate, then Congress may provide for \n     ``deeming'' the passage of the separated bills without fear \n     of judicial review. This situation does not mean that \n     Congress is free of constitutional constraints. Members of \n     Congress take an oath, identical to the one taken by judges, \n     to support the Constitution, Art. VI, cl. 3, and Members of\n      Congress must determine for themselves that a measure upon \n     which they are voting is constitutional, United States v. \n     Munoz-Flores, supra, 495 U.S., 390-391, just as the \n     President must before he signs a bill. But it does mean \n     that Congress' constitutional determination is not \n     susceptible to judicial invalidation.\n       When Congress studies the constitutionality of a proposal, \n     it performs essentially the same analysis as a court does, \n     and we now turn to the issue of the merits.\n       Third, assuming the inapplicability of the political-\n     question doctrine, when either a court or Congress evaluates \n     the validity of the deeming mechanism, what should the \n     decision be?\n       Beyond question is the proposition that a measure must be \n     passed in the same form by both Houses before it is presented \n     to the President for his action; no bill not meeting this \n     qualification can become law. Clark, supra, 143 U.S. 669-670, \n     INS v. Chadha, supra, 462 U.S., 943, 944-946, 948-951, 956-\n     959. And that is precisely the question presented by this \n     proposal. A bill has passed both Houses in identical terms, \n     and it is then subdivided into a series of bills excerpted \n     out of the larger bill by an enrolling clerk acting pursuant \n     to the rules of the two bodies. If the separately-enrolled \n     bills are not again presented to both Houses for a vote, \n     perhaps an en bloc consideration, has the bicameralism \n     requirement been met.\n       That each House has the power to make the rules for its own \n     proceedings is a substantial authority, as Ballin certainly \n     demonstrates. There, the Constitution required a quorum to do \n     business, but the Constitution was silent with respect to how \n     a quorum was to be determined. Members present declined to \n     answer to a call of the roll to permit a determination that a \n     quorum was present, and the House of Representatives simply \n     provided that they would nonetheless be counted.\n       When the House of Representatives or the Senate determines \n     its rules of proceeding, the Ballin Court instructed us, \n     ``[i]t may not by its rules ignore constitutional restraints \n     or violate fundamental rights, and there should be a \n     reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding \n     established by the rule and the result which is sought to be \n     attained.'' Ballin, supra, 144 U.S., 5. Within this capacious \n     concept, what provision of the Constitution would the \n     ``deeming'' provision violate? We certainly cannot point to \n     any fundamental right that is abridged. The constitutional \n     constraint that is applicable is the first section of Article \n     I, which sets a bicameral requirement for the exercise of \n     lawmaking. But Congress in the proposal does not disregard \n     the bicameralism mandate. A bill in identical form has passed \n     both Houses. Then, a functionary, the enrolling clerk, \n     follows instructions embodied in the rules and separates out \n     of this bill a series of sections identical to the sections \n     contained in the larger bill and enrolls these sections into \n     separate bills; these bills are signed by the Speaker of the \n     House and the President of the Senate, and these bills are \n     then presented to the President for his signatures or his \n     vetoes.\n       One can readily see that the question is much more narrow \n     than the mere issue whether Congress can pass a law that has \n     not cleared both Houses in identical versions. A bill has \n     passed both Houses in an identical version. The separately \n     enrolled bills, taken together, are identical to that initial \n     bill. If Congress should conclude that this two-step process \n     comports with the constitutional requirement of bicameral \n     passage of a legislative measure, in what way has a \n     constitutional restraint been breached?\n       If the ``deeming'' procedure is invalid, the validity of \n     the deeming feature of Rule XLIX of the House of \n     Representatives is highly suspect. Under that Rule, adoption \n     by the House of Representatives of the conference report on \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget, or on the concurrent \n     resolution itself if there is no conference report, is deemed \n     to be a vote in favor of a joint resolution setting a \n     statutory limit on the public debt, different than the limit \n     then in effect, and the joint resolution is engrossed and \n     transmitted to the Senate. There is no precise equivalency \n     between the Rule and the proposal; yet, there is sufficient \n     identify to present the same constitutional question.\n       In some respects, as we briefly touch on below, the \n     appropriations committees, and perhaps some legislative \n     committees, may have to alter how they report bills that are \n     to be subject to this process, inasmuch as to continue the \n     present mode of bill drafting would require the enrolling \n     clerk[s] to exercise too much judgment, too much \n     discretion,in breaking down the bills, with the result that \n     to make sense of some sections designated as separate bills, \n     these bills would not be identical to the bill previously \n     passed. This reservation is meant only to suggest that some \n     separate enrollments might present an as-applied \n     constitutional challenge. We are here concerned with the \n     facial constitutional questions.\n       Issues of validity could also be influenced in \n     determination by two other factors. That is, first, Congress \n     is not seeking to aggrandize itself or to infringe on the \n     powers of another branch. Instead, the procedure would be, in \n     effect, and act of self-abnegation, a giving-up of some \n     degree of congressional power and influence in order to \n     enlarge the power and influence of the President and to lodge \n     in him the burden of deficit reduction. Second, to forestall \n     the argument that Congress might have invalidly given up too \n     much power, might have over-balanced presidential power, it \n     must be observed that these rules are entirely an internal \n     matter, subject to alternation by simple resolution at any \n     time in either House. There is no irrevocable conveying away.\n       Finally, as we suggested above, it may be necessary for the \n     appropriations committees to revamp the mode of reporting \n     bills. In addition to the necessity to achieve identify \n     between the original bill and the separated bills, to leave \n     to the enrolling clerk[s] too much discretion might violate \n     the principle, found in some cases, that Congress may not \n     delegate its legislative power to its Members or its officers \n     and employees. The legislative power is a collective one to \n     be exercised by Congress itself and not by delegates. \n     Metroplitan Washington Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the \n     Abagtement of Aircraft Noise, 501 U.S. 252, 271-277 (1991). \n     The details of this revamping remain open for consideration.\n       In conclusion, we have argued that the deeming procedure \n     may present a political question unsuited for judicial review \n     and thus that Congress would not be subject to judicial \n     review. We have considered, on the other hand, that the \n     courts may find they are not precluded from exercising \n     authority to review this proposal. If the proposal is \n     reviewed by the courts, and even if it is not, we have \n     presented an argument leading to sustaining the deeming \n     procedure as not in violation of the principle that a bill, \n     in order to become law, must be passed in identical versions \n     by the House of Representatives and the Senate. Because of \n     the lack of available precedent, we cannot argue that any of \n     the three versions of the argument is indisputably correct; \n     indeed, there are questions about all three. In the end, \n     Congress must exercise a constitutional judgment when \n     deciding on passage of the proposal.\n\n                                            Johnny H.

I will respect their views. I, \nhowever, will not agree.\n  Mr. President, in this morning's Washington Times, there is an \narticle by Mr. Stephen Moore, who is the director of fiscal policy \nstudies at the Cato Institute. As we all know, the Cato Institute is a \nwell-regarded organization and one that is dedicated to many causes, \nincluding fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I will read some parts of this article because I think \nit is important, and I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 21, 1995]\n\n                     Sharpening the Budget Scissors\n\n                           (By Stephen Moore)\n\n       This week the Senate begins debate on the line-item veto \n     for the president, Taxpayers have been demanding this act of \n     fiscal sanity for at least 15 years.\n       Now, there they go again, Just when it appeared that the \n     line-item veto would become a reality, several moderate \n     Senate Republicans are lining up with liberal Democrats to \n     submarine the effort by insisting upon a line-item veto with \n     a dull blade. Yet the experience of the states--where 43 \n     governors have line-item veto authority--indicates that \n     weakened versions of this budget cutting instrument are \n     almost the equivalent of no-item veto at all. The GOP needs \n     to band together to block this fraudulent alternative and \n     rally behind the toughest measure possible--the Coats-McCain \n     bill.\n       Once during the last year of the Reagan administration I \n     was asked to testify on the line-item veto before the House \n     Judiciary Committee. It was a miserable experience. One \n     Democrat after another savaged the idea as nothing more than \n     a blatant partisan power-grab. There message was \n     unmistakable: Reaganites are trying to pull an end run around \n     the Democrat-controlled Congress because they can't win at \n     the polls.\n       In hindsight, it is understandable why House Democrats \n     thought that way. Republicans seemed to have a permanent \n     electoral padlock on the White House, while the notion of a \n     GOP Congress seemed as improbable as the Speaker of the House \n     and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee being \n     ejected from office in the same year. How ironic that the \n     first president to snip spending with the new veto scissors \n     may well be Democrat Bill Clinton, and he will be empowered \n     to do so by a Republican-controlled Congress. So much for the \n     partisan power-grab argument.\n       Now opponents have shifted gears. Today, we hear two new \n     objections to the line-item veto--both of which are also \n     wrong. The first argument is that the line-item veto would \n     involve a huge and unprecedented power shift in the direction \n     of the White House. Powerful Senate appropriators Robert Byrd \n     and Mark Hatfield are endlessly preaching that message.\n       But history disproves it. The line-item veto is only a \n     partial restoration of the rightful budgetary powers of the \n     president, which were stripped from the executive branch by \n     the 1974 Budget Act. That act took away the president's right \n     to impound funds--a power that was exercised routinely by \n     every president from Thomas Jefferson through Richard Nixon. \n     Jefferson first employed the power to refuse to spend \n     appropriated funds in 1801 when he impounded $50,000 for Navy \n     gunboats.\n       The Founders believed that the president, as the head of \n     the executive branch and therefore responsible for executing \n     the laws and spending taxpayer funds judiciously, had \n     unilateral authority not to spend money appropriated by \n     Congress if that spending was unnecessary.\n       Impoundment was an extremely powerful White House authority \n     that was exercised often for nearly 200 years. Presidents \n     Roosevelt, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon used the impoundment \n     power rountinely--and in some years used it to cut federal \n     appropriations by more than 5 percent. In one year, Richard \n     Nixon impounded more than 7 percent of domestic \n     appropriations.\n       In 1974 Congress stripped the president of his lawful \n     impoundment powers and instead gave him two very weak \n     substitutes: the deferral and rescission authorities. But \n     rescissions require Congress affirmatively to approve a \n     presidential request not to spend money. Most rescissions are \n     simply ignored by Congress and never even voted on. Thus \n     through congressional in action, they are killed. Twenty-six \n     billion dollars of Ronald Reagan's rescissions were slain in \n     that fashion.\n       The second criticism of the line-item veto is that it won't \n     affect the level of spending or the debt. To test that \n     supposition, the Cato Institute recently surveyed 118 \n     governors and former governors about what budget process \n     measures Washington should adopt to help balance the budget. \n     Sixty-seven of the respondents were Republicans, 50 were \n     Democrats, and one was an independent. Since 43 states have \n     the line-item veto, governors are in the best position to \n     assess its value. Some governors, such as Tommy Thompson of \n     Wisconsin, have relied heavily on the line-item veto to cut \n     expenditures and balance the budget.\n       The major findings of our survey were as follows:\n       Sixty-nine percent of the governors described the line-item \n     veto as ``a very useful tool'' in helping balance the state \n     budget.\n       Ninety-two percent of the governors believe that ``a line-\n     item veto for the president would help restrain federal \n     spending.''\n       Eighty-eight percent of the Democratic governors believed \n     the line-item veto would be useful.\n       Then we asked the governors why they supported or opposed \n     the line-item veto. Here are some of the more interesting \n     responses we received:\n       Hugh L. Carey, the former Democratic governor of New York, \n     said, ``I support the line-item veto because it is an \n     executive branch function to identify budget excesses and \n     wasteful items. It is an antidote for pork.''\n       Massachusetts governor William Weld wrote, ``Legislators \n     love to be loved, so they love to spend money. Line-item veto \n     is essential to enable the executive to hold down spending.''\n       Ronald Reagan said, ``When I was governor of California, \n     the governor had the line-item veto, and so you could veto \n     parts of the spending in a bill. The president can't do that. \n     I think, frankly--of course, I'm prejudiced--government would \n     be far better off if the president had the right of line-item \n     veto.''\n       Mike O'Callaghan, the former governor of Nevada, and a \n     Democrat, was the most concise: ``The line-item veto is a \n     tremendous tool for saving money.''\n       Critics are right when they complain that the line-item \n     veto won't balance the budget. But a useful way to determine \n     potential budget savings from the line-item veto is to look \n     at rescissions that have been ignored by Congress in recent \n     years. If those had been approved, savings would have been $5 \n     billion to $10 billion a year in less shark research, lower \n     sugar subsidies, and fewer grants for obscene art.\n       And for those who still doubt the virtue of the line-item \n     veto, perhaps the most compelling case for this surgical tool \n     is made by Messrs. Byrd and Hatfield. Their violent \n     opposition should provoke a deep appreciation for the value \n     of these new fiscal scissors.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Mr. Moore's article begins:\n\n       This week the Senate begins debate on the line-item veto \n     for the President. Taxpayers have been demanding this act of \n     fiscal sanity for at least 15 years.\n       Now, there they go again. Just when it appeared that the \n     line-item veto would become a reality, several moderate \n     Senate Republicans are lining up with liberal Democrats to \n     submarine the effort by insisting upon a line-item veto with \n     a dull blade.\n\n  Mr. Moore wrote this article before we, all 54 Republicans, agreed to \nvote for cloture to cut off debate on this issue.\n\n       Yet the experience of the States--where 43 Governors have \n     line-item veto authority--indicates that weakened versions of \n     this budget-cutting instrument are almost the equivalent of \n     no-item veto at all. The GOP needs to band together to block \n     this fraudulent alternative and rally behind the toughest \n     measure possible--the Coats-McCain bill.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\n       Now opponents have shifted gears. Today, we hear two new \n     objections to the line-item veto--both of which are also \n     wrong. The first argument is that the line-item veto would \n     involve a huge and unprecedented power shift in the direction \n     of the White House.

There were times of \nwar when we ran up huge deficits, but after those emergencies subsided, \nwe again brought the budget into balance. It was in 1974 when the two \nbegan to diverge to an incredible degree.\n  I want to point out again, and it is not coincidental, in 1974, the \nentire annual deficit for that year was $6 billion. The entire national \ndebt was $483 billion. Now in 1994, the annual deficit is $203 billion, \nabout half of what the overall accumulated debt was, and the estimate \nof the total debt between 1974 and 1996 has risen from $483 billion to \n$5.299 trillion.\n  There is a direct correlation between the passage of the Budget \nImpoundment Act of 1974 and the exploding deficit and annual deficit \nand debt.\n\n       The Founders believed that the President, as the head of \n     the executive branch and therefore responsible for executing \n     laws and spending taxpayer funds judiciously, had unilateral \n     authority not to spend money appropriated by Congress if that \n     spending was unnecessary.\n       Impoundment was an extremely powerful White House authority \n     that was exercised often for nearly 200 years.

Thus \n     through congressional inaction, they are killed. Twenty-six \n     billion dollars of Ronald Reagan's rescissions were slain in \n     that fashion.\n       The second criticism of the line-item veto is that it won't \n     affect the level of spending or the debt. To test that \n     supposition, the Cato Institute recently surveyed 118 \n     Governors and former Governors about what budget process \n     measures Washington should adopt to help balance the budget: \n     27 of the respondents were Republicans, 50 were Democrats, \n     and 1 was an Independent. Since 43 States have the line-item \n     veto, Governors are in the best position to assess its value. \n     Some Governors, such as Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, have \n     relied heavily on the line-item veto to cut expenditures and \n     balance the budget.\n       The major findings of our survey were as follows:\n       Sixty-nine percent of the Governors described the line-item \n     veto as ``a very useful tool'' in helping balance the State \n     budget.\n       Ninety-two percent of the Governors believed that ``a line-\n     item veto for the President would help restrain Federal \n     spending.''\n       Eighty-eight percent of the Democratic Governors believed \n     the line-item veto would be useful.\n       Then we asked the Governors why they supported or opposed \n     the line-item veto.\n\n  And some of the responses were very interesting.\n  I will not go through all of those answers, Mr. President except to \nsay the article concludes by saying:\n\n       Critics are right when they complain that the line-item \n     veto won't balance the budget. But a useful way to determine \n     potential budget savings from the line-item veto is to look \n     at rescissions that have been ignored by Congress in recent \n     years. If those had been approved, savings would have been $5 \n     billion to $10 billion a year in less shark research, lower \n     sugar subsidies, and fewer grants for obscene art.\n       And for those who still doubt the virtue of the line-item \n     veto, perhaps the most compelling case for this surgical tool \n     is made by [others]. Their violent opposition should provoke \n     a deep appreciation of the value of these new fiscal \n     scissors.\n\n   Mr. President, I wish to address for a moment the issue of the \nconstitutionality of several issues that are raised here, and there are \na number of them. I will save some of them, but I wish to talk about \nthe aspect of the constitutional objection, the objection that it is \nunconstitutional because it would change the Constitution, specifically \nthe veto power, by act of Congress. The response is as follows:\n\n       Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution permits this \n     procedure. Nothing in article I, section 7 is violated by \n     this procedure. Under this proposal, all bills must be \n     presented to the President. He may sign or veto all bills. He \n     must return vetoed bills with his objections. Congress may \n     override any veto with a two-thirds majority of each House.\n       Under article I, section 5, Congress possesses this power \n     to define a bill. Congress certainly believes that it \n     possesses this power since it and it alone has been doing so \n     since the first bill was presented to the first President in \n     the first Congress. If this construction of article I, \n     section 5 is correct, the definition of a bill is a political \n     question and not justiciable. ``Prominent on the surface of \n     any case held to involve a political question is found a \n     textually demonstrable Constitutional commitment of the issue \n     to a coordinated political depart.'' Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. \n     186 (1962). ``A textually demonstrable constitutional \n     commitment'' of the issue to the legislature is found in \n     ``Each house may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.'' If \n     Congress may define as a bill a package of distinct programs \n     and unrelated items, it can define distinct programs and \n     unrelated items to be separate bills. Either Congress has the \n     right to define a bill or it does not. Either this proposal \n     is constitutional or the recent practice of Congress in \n     forming omnibus bills containing unrelated programs and \n     nongermane items is constitutionally challengeable. If the \n     latter, the President would be well advised to bring such \n     suit against the next omnibus bill.\n\n  Mr. President, there have been about 3 days of debate now. We are \ngoing into our 4th day. I have talked a great deal. The other side of \nthe aisle has not chosen to talk too much about it. I urge my \ncolleagues to take note of the fact that we are now open for \namendments. If there are amendments, I urge my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to bring forth those amendments so they can be debated and \nvoted on. And as I said, again, it is the intention on this side of the \naisle expressed by the majority leader to dispose of this issue this \nweek by means of cloture votes. At the same time, as to any substantive \namendments and proposals, I believe there is sufficient time for them \nto be considered and voted on.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from Nebraska in the Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, first of all I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Arizona, along with the Senator from Indiana, who has shown such \nleadership in this area for so many years. I welcome the opportunity to \nassist in the effort.\n  Mr. President, the debate is now joined on the line-item veto and we \nare hearing the arguments for and against. It has been joined before. \nIt has been discussed many times in this body. Hopefully, this time it \nwill pass. I think the time has come. The American people demand it and \nthe country needs it.\n  It has been said that the line-item veto or enhanced rescissions will \nnot in and of itself balance the budget. And that is certainly true. It \nwill require a President who is willing to use the tool that is given \nto him, and use it firmly. And, I might add, it will also require a \nPresident who will not use it simply to reprioritize his own programs \nover those programs of the Congress.\n  But while we are debating the likely effectiveness of this issue, I \nthink it is important that we remember why we are engaging in this \ndebate at all, why the line-item veto is brought up again year after \nyear in this body, the reason for its overwhelming popularity among \n[[Page S4219]]  the American people and even the reason that for many \npeople in this country it has now become a virtual battle cry.\n  Mr. President, the short answer is that it is because we as a people \nare struggling mightily in this country, some might even say \ndesperately, for ways to restrain Congress from irresponsible spending, \nfor ways to stop Congress from continuing down the road of fiscal \nirresponsibility and the eventual bankruptcy of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Congress, in times past, has shown that it cannot restrain itself. We \ncontinue to look at $200 billion deficits every year as far as the eye \ncan see. We have debated in this body, over a period of 60 years or \nmore, the need for a balanced budget. We have reached almost unanimous \nconsensus, even in the debate over the balanced budget amendment, that, \nyes, indeed, we must move toward a balanced budget, we must exercise \nsome fiscal restraint. Year after year over that period of time, we \nhave passed resolutions calling for a balanced budget. We have required \nthe President to submit budgets to Congress that were in balance. We \neven passed a law in 1979 making it the law of this land that the \nbudget be balanced by 1981. And, of course, when 1981 rolled around, \nanother substantial deficit. Even our own laws were ignored by us.\n  In 1981, Congress was concerned, the entire Nation was concerned, as \nthe debate turned toward the fact that we were approaching a $1 \ntrillion debt in this country.\n Those were dire circumstances.\n\n  Now we are approaching a $5 trillion debt. Not only have we failed \nlegislatively, Mr. President, but we have proven that we cannot \nrestrain ourselves by means of a constitutional amendment. The balanced \nbudget amendment failed in this body, even though it enjoyed the \noverwhelming support of the American people.\n  Appeals to self-interest and fear and shortsightedness carried the \nday once again in this body. Social Security, the last refuge of those \nin Congress who panic at the very thought of putting the lid on the \npork barrel, was trotted out once again, even though we all know that \nthe greatest threat and the only threat to Social Security is to \ncontinue down the road of deficit spending, is to do nothing and \nmaintain the pattern that we have maintained in this Congress for so \nmany years, because we all know within a few years, it is going into \nthe red and we must have the farsightedness to address that now.\n  This is part of what we are about today, Mr. President. Now, having \nfailed legislatively, having failed to adopt a constitutional \namendment, the American people are saying that we should at least give \nthe President of the United States the opportunity to have the most \negregious, the most unnecessary, and the most wasteful spending \nmeasures made a little bit more difficult--not to make them \nimpossible--to make them a little bit more difficult by requiring \nCongress to come up with a two-thirds majority vote if they want to \npass it. I suggest to you that this is, indeed, a modest proposal in \nlight of the dire economic circumstances that we find ourselves in as a \nnation.\n  And so for the second time in less than a month, we come together on \nthe floor of the Senate to debate whether or not we have the courage to \ntake the first step toward economic responsibility and recovery or \nwhether, once again, we are going to fail ourselves, fail our \nconstituents and fail the next generation. We simply must do better.\n  For 33 of the last 34 years, the Federal Government has run deficits \nand our elected officials have not had the will to change that course. \nOur Federal Government has run a deficit every year for the past 25 \nyears--an entire generation--and we have not taken steps to break this \ninsidious, this persistent pattern. It took our Nation more than 205 \nyears to reach a $1 trillion national debt, but it only took another 11 \nyears to quadruple it. And still we lack the will.\n  Now, for the next 5 years at least, the President has proposed annual \nbudgets in excess of $200 billion a year. This means for the next 5 \nyears, the Nation will accumulate another trillion dollars of debt, \ndebt that is stifling investment, cutting into productivity, debt that \nhas changed us from a creditor nation to a debtor nation.\n  Our economic growth has been anemic and one day surely, as night \nfollows day, if we continue this course of action, America will decline \nas a great power. The first warning shot of that decline perhaps has \nalready been fired.\n  I am sure that we have all noted with concern the precipitous drop in \nthe dollar against the German mark and the Japanese yen since the \nfailure of Congress to pass the balanced budget amendment. I submit to \nyou that this is no accident. For decades, the U.S. dollar has been the \nstandard against which the value of all other currencies in this world \nare measured. For many nations, it has served as a reserve currency. As \nsuch, the dollar is used as a storehouse of value in exchange for goods \nand services the world over. Investors buy the dollar because the U.S. \neconomy has had a long reputation for reliability and for stability. \nImportant commodities, such as oil, are priced in dollars. Any country \nthat wishes to import oil must pay in dollars. We have been fortunate \nin this respect because of the high value placed upon the dollar in \nmaking it attractive as an investment vehicle and, thus, giving us our \nability to, in large part, finance our national debt with foreign \ndollars.\n  When our debt was a small percentage of the gross national product, \nwe could afford deficit spending and the inflation that it produced, \nbut now our mounting deficits scare away capital and the value of the \ndollar. My distinguished colleague from Colorado, Senator Brown, \ndemonstrated recently in stark relief before the Senate Banking \nCommittee the fall of the value of the dollar against the yen and the \nmark when the President announced the Mexican bailout. But more \nimportantly, he showed the clear and unmistakable drop in the dollar's \nvalue when the balanced budget amendment was defeated in the Senate of \nthe United States. That drop occurred for only one reason--one reason \nand one reason only --and that is that the world's investors lost faith \nin the political leadership of this country to act as wise stewards of \nAmerica's Treasury.\n  That loss of confidence, manifested by the recent drop in the dollar, \nwill have an inflationary impact on our economy. Goods will become more \nexpensive as the price of imported components rise. Americans traveling \nabroad will find it to be increasingly expensive. Finally, the drop in \nthe dollar's value will likely cause interest rates to rise and further \nexacerbate our budget deficit.\n  We are deluding ourselves if we think that simply because of our \ngreat wealth and natural resources that we are immune from economic \nloss and that our reputation for economic stability and growth will \nmake us immune. We cannot continue to draw on this much foreign \ninvestment to finance our deficit indefinitely, and we only have to \nlook to our neighbors to the south to give us some indication of what \ncan happen.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware that we have a system of checks and \nbalances in this country, a system of separation of powers, and that \nthere is a constant pulling and tugging between the executive and the \nlegislative branches of Government for power and authority, and \nsometimes in our history, even ascendancy. This is right and proper \nbecause this was one of the most fundamental parts of the framework \nthat our Founding Fathers put together in the operation of our \nGovernment.\n  Some say that the line-item veto would give too much authority to the \nPresident and take that system out of balance in favor of the \nPresident. However, I think that in viewing history that we must \nconclude on the contrary that the current legislation before this body \nwould bring things more into balance.\n  In fact, the 1989 report of the National Economic Commission has \nsuggested that ``the balance of power on budget issues has swung too \nfar from the executive toward the legislative branch.''\n  Virtually all Presidents have impounded funds as a routine matter of \ntheir executive discretion to accomplish what they believe is \nefficiency of management and Government. In the 1950's and 1960's, \ndisputes arose over the impoundment authority--in fact, disputes have \ngone back much further \n[[Page S4220]]  than that--but during that particular period of time in \nour history, which resulted from the refusal of several Presidents to \nfund certain weapons systems, for example, to the full extent \nauthorized by Congress. President Johnson made broad use of impoundment \nauthority during his administration by deferring billions of dollars on \nspending in an effort to restrain inflationary pressures on the economy \nduring that period of time.\n  Conflict over the use of impoundment has greatly increased, of \ncourse, during the Nixon administration. A moratorium was placed on \nmany things that are currently on the table again and being debated and \ndiscussed. Ironically enough, subsidized housing programs, community \ndevelopment activities, certain farm programs--all were either \nsuspended or eliminated altogether during that period of time by \nPresident Nixon.\n  However, by 1974, the Congress of the United States found not only a \nweakened President Nixon because of Watergate but, because of that same \nscandal, a weakened Presidency, and employing a vacuum, Congress moved \nin and asserted itself and responded by passing the 1974 Budget Control \nand Impoundment Act, which greatly diminished the President's authority \nto impound funds.\n  So while this may be only one of many reasons--and it certainly is--I \nthink it not inappropriate to point out that since that time, we have \nnot had a balanced budget in this country. Since the President's \nrescission now does not go through unless Congress actually votes \nwithin 45 days to support him, few rescissions actually occur anymore.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, in the past 20 years \nsince this Budget Act was passed, there have been 1,084 Presidential \nrescissions reflecting a total of $72.8 billion. Congress has agreed \nwith only 399, or about 23 billion dollars' worth.\n  That is why we are here today to consider this legislation, to \nfinally put some teeth into the rescission process. After 20 years in \nwhich we have managed to cut only about $1 billion a year, time for \namending the 1974 act, I submit, is long overdue. We must finally \nprovide some recourse for the Nation's Chief Executive to reduce \nspending that is actually sinking America $200 billion more in debt. \nThis legislation obviously is not a cure-all or a panacea, not for \neverything that ails us. In reality, it is perhaps little more than a \nfew sandbags in the dike. But it is a beginning. It is a movement by \nCongress in the right direction for a change. It is a step forward.\n  Mr. President, the current legislation is a result of many years of \nhard work by many people. I have already recognized Senator McCain, \nSenator Coats, Senator Domenici, and others who have worked on this so \nhard--Senator Stevens on our side and several from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  I think what we now have is a true bipartisan piece of legislation. \nIt represents already much compromise and much accommodation to the \nlegitimate concerns that have been expressed by Members on both sides \nof the aisle. Now I think it represents a real opportunity to finally \ninject some discipline into the budgetary process. It has been needed \nfor a long time. It does some things, from my understanding and review \nof the history, which have not been done before, which have not been \nsubmitted at this stage of the process before. For instance, it covers \nany increase in any budget item. There has been criticism in times past \nthat proposals have only covered discretionary spending. And as we all \nknow, discretionary spending is becoming a smaller part of the overall \nbudget--I think now down to around 16 percent. This proposal would also \ncover mandatory spending. As far as the future is concerned, it also \nreaches targeted tax benefits that have the practical effect of giving \ntax breaks to limited groups of taxpayers.\n  Now, this is an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss. Following \non the heels of the agonizing and divisive defeat of the balanced \nbudget amendment, the 104th Congress needs to recover and go on down \nthe road, Mr. President. There is much that this Congress can \naccomplish if it does not dissolve into shortsightedness and partisan \nbickering. This is a time and a place and a legislative proposal where \nwe can come together and put that to an end. If it is true that every \njourney starts with one step, then let this measure before us serve as \nthat first step toward real budgetary reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \nstatement in support of the line-item veto. He has only been here a few \nmonths, but already he has been a powerful voice for change in this \ninstitution. It is change which I believe the taxpayers and \nconstituents that we represent called for in the November elections. \nThey want a change in the way we do business. They want a change in the \nway Congress represents them, a change in the mechanics. They are tired \nof hearing promises delivered from this floor over and over and over \nagain that, yes, give us another chance; we will do better next time.\n  What we are seeking to do with this line-item veto proposal is change \nfundamentally the way we make decisions and the way that we spend \ntaxpayers' dollars. The effort that Senator McCain and I and others \nhave been working on for so long appears to be reaching a point where \nwe will be making a final decision as to whether or not we will bring \nthat fundamental change to this body.\n  The substitute which Senator Dole offered last evening on this floor \nwas the result of days and weeks of some very tough negotiations \ninvolving Members who have had a history of involvement with the \nappropriations process, with the tax writing process, with the \nentitlements process, with the spending process of this Congress.\n  We took an idea, a concept that has been discussed, as I indicated on \nthis floor yesterday, for nearly a century, that is enjoyed by 43 \nGovernors, that has been called for, asked for, requested by, with one \nexception, every President of this entire century.\n  The request is simply to allow the President a check and balance \nagainst a practice that Congress has been engaging in which allows \nMembers of the legislative branch to attach to major pieces of \nlegislation, most of which they are pretty confident the President has \nlittle or no choice of signing, specifically targeted items, \nspecifically designated items that go to provide a benefit for a \nparticular class of individuals, small group of individuals, which \ncannot be defined in any sense in the national interest.\n  It may have been something that was generally accepted and overlooked \nin the past as we were running budgets which were roughly in balance. \nIt was seen as a way of, I guess, making the process work here: You \nsupport this for me; I will support that for you, or I need to take \nthis back home to let the constituents know that I am looking out \nspecifically for them.\n  At a time when our annual deficits are running $200 billion or more, \nat a time when our national debt is reaching staggering proportions, \nnearly $5 trillion, we can no longer afford to practice business as \nusual. The vote which will eventually occur on this item is a vote for \none of two courses. One course is business as usual. The other is for a \nchange in the way business is done, for a discarding of the status quo.\n  For my colleagues who are in the process now of studying the final \nproposal that was put forth and is the result of several weeks of \nnegotiations, let me just explain that it is not all that complicated. \nIt is only five pages and one line of language which essentially takes \nthe line-item veto concept--that is, the two-thirds vote that is \nnecessary to override a decision of the President of the United States \nwhich will be granted to him, the authority of which will be granted to \nhim to line-item out specific spending requests or items that increase \nspending, send them back to the Congress, and if the Congress wants to \nreinstate those, it will require a two-thirds vote.\n  That is the core concept of line-item veto--veto, the process of \noverriding a decision, that process which involves a two-thirds vote, \nand it is embodied in the Constitution of the United States. We are \nincorporating that into this process. We are then applying that \nprinciple of two-thirds to the various functions of spending that take \nplace as we write legislation.\n  Originally, the McCain-Coats proposal only addressed appropriated \n[[Page S4221]]  items, items that came out of the Appropriations \nCommittee that affected discretionary spending. As Senator Stevens has \ncorrectly pointed out, we were targeting then the line-item veto \nprocedure to too narrow a slice of spending. We were applying it to an \narea under the control of the Appropriations Committee, which \nadmittedly carried what most would describe as pork-barrel, pork-\nspending items, but which only went to a portion of our entire budget. \nSenator Stevens suggested that that ought to be expanded, and we looked \nfor ways to do that. Interestingly enough, we reached back into a \nprocess that has been debated at length on this Senate floor. It goes \nback a decade or more.\n  We reached back to a process which has been suggested by prominent \nmembers of the Democrat Party, led by committee chairmen who have \neloquently debated the rationale behind the need for the process called \nseparate enrollment but which also can be described as line-item veto, \nand we used that as the basis for putting together this new legislation \nthat was introduced yesterday evening by the majority leader, Senator \nDole. We took that process and we applied it to a broader range of \nspending, so now not only will appropriations bills be subjected to \nline-item veto, but we will also subject other portions of the budget \nto line-item veto. We have included direct expenditures, expenditures \nof dollars, that occur outside the appropriations bills, including the \nappropriations bill process but also go to authorizations which provide \nfor new spending.\n  We have expanded it to new entitlements. We are not changing the law \nin terms of benefits that are currently available under the law to new \nenrollees or to current enrollees within the entitlement programs, but \nwe are saying, if there is an attempt to expand that program as it \ncurrently exists into new spending, then it will be subjected to the \nPresident's new authority, should this bill pass, new authority to \nline-item veto that.\n  Again, Congress could come back and with a two-thirds vote override \nthe President's decision, but obviously it will be much harder for \nCongress to enact new spending. And we have expanded this to include \nwhat we call targeted tax benefits. There is tax pork as well as \nspending pork. Often what is described as the pork barrel involves not \njust appropriated items but tax breaks targeted for specific groups of \npeople, specific individuals, a specific business entity within a \nbroader group, so it is directed to help a particular targeted group, \nnot the group as a whole.\n  This would not allow the President to veto a broad tax deduction on \nthe books, or a broad tax provision such as mortgage interest \ndeductions, such as real estate tax deduction, such as some of the \ndeductions that Americans now enjoy under the Tax Code. But it would go \nto those specifically targeted items that often are added somewhere \nalong the line in the tax-writing process and go, not to benefit a \nlarge group, but go to benefit a very specific targeted interest.\n  So the bill has been expanded considerably. It has a much broader \nscope than it had before. It applies a discipline to the process that \nis currently not available. It has a provision under the tax provision \nand has a provision available to Senators that, if they do not agree \nwith the way in which a bill is brought forward and enrolled and think \nthere is something that has been excluded, they can raise a point of \norder on this floor. Under that point of order they can subject that \nparticular item to the separate enrollment procedures which would allow \nit then to be subject to the line-item veto of the President.\n  So, if a Senator does not believe that new entitlement spending or \ntargeted tax benefits have been fully identified in a reported tax bill \nor an appropriations bill, the Dole amendment provides a means by which \nthose Senators can challenge the bill. If the Senator's point of order \nis sustained, the relevant committee would then have to flush out or \npull out that particular provision and enroll it separately before the \nbill could be in order on the floor.\n  So we have addressed that question that has been raised about: What \nif the bill slips something in but does not separately enroll it and a \nSenator believes it should be separately enrolled? We provided a \nprocess for that.\n  Finally, let me state, because the questions have been raised: We are \nnot exactly sure how all this will work and we are a little bit nervous \nabout the authority we are giving to the President; should we not test \nthe idea? I suggest the idea has been tested. It has been tested for a \ncentury by our Governors in working with our legislatures. But in order \nto accommodate that concern, we have put a sunset in this bill so \nCongress can revisit this new authority, can examine it on the basis of \nhow it applies, and if it wants can modify it or, of course, even \nrepeal it. So it does contain a sunset. It will provide a test period \nto see how well it works.\n  Madam President, I suggest we will never know how fully effective the \nline-item veto power to the President will be, in terms of \naccomplishing real spending cuts, because it will fundamentally change \nthe way we think and behave. That fundamental change will mean that \nitems which would have been attached to appropriations bills or would \nhave been incorporated in the tax bills will not be, because of the \nfear that they will be exposed to public scrutiny before it finally \nbecomes law.\n  It is shining the light of public scrutiny on our debate, on how we \nwrite our legislation, and it is requiring a separate vote by Members \nin support of or in opposition to a particularly targeted item that \ndoes not benefit the national interest or the group as a whole but only \ngoes to benefit a particular individual or a particular entity. It is \nthat process which will, I believe, prevent most of what has taken \nplace in the past that we find so egregious. So we will never be able \nto total up the amount of money that we have saved for our constituents \nand for the taxpayer because the line-item veto will have accomplished \nits purpose--its purpose being to prevent this kind of activity from \ntaking place in the first place; to prevent the kind of embarrassment \nthat we go through on an annual basis when we discover the items that \nhave been slipped into the appropriations bills, slipped into \nlegislation, slipped into tax bills at the last minute in conference, \nbehind closed doors, late at night, and then presented in a massive \nbill with a limited time period for debate in the House of \nRepresentatives and an urgency because of the end of the session or \nwhatever might occur--the urgency to get the legislation on the \nPresident's desk and signed.\n  The President then looks at this massive bill and says: Ninety or \nninety-five percent of what is in here is what is beneficial to this \ncountry, what I want to support. But you are forcing me--as President \nTruman said, ``blackmailing me''--into either accepting the whole bill \nwith the egregious provisions or rejecting the whole bill. And the \nemergency we are under, the timeframe we are under, requires that I \nhave little choice except to not reject the whole bill.\n  That is what we are offering here today. I trust my colleagues will \nlook at it carefully. I hope we can gain their support. It has the \nsupport of the sponsors of the bill and the vast majority of \nRepublicans. It has support, I believe, of Democrats who have been \nprominent in helping us advance this concept. And we look forward to \nadvancing it, hopefully, this week, and putting it on the President's \ndesk soon--something we should have done a long, long time ago.\n  Madam President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, I offer my congratulations to the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana on the bill that has come before the \nSenate, the new line-item veto bill. Many of the provisions in the \nline-item veto bill that is before the Senate are provisions that were \nembodied in the original bill that I introduced and the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana cosponsored. The Dole bill does include a sunset \nprovision, as I understand it. After 5 years we will be able to see \nwhether this bill actually does tip the balance between the executive \nand the legislative branches of Government. It, as I understand it, \nalso includes separate enrollment, which is the way the bill deals with \nthe constitutional question in addition to the sunset.\n  The bill, as I understand it, also includes tax expenditures and does \nso in a way that is broader than the original \n[[Page S4222]]  House bill. As I understand it, it essentially says \nthat the President can veto tax expenditures that have the practical \neffect of benefiting a particular taxpayer or limited class of \ntaxpayers when compared with other similarly situated taxpayers. While \nthere is some ambiguity, I take this provision to have a broad \ninterpretation.\n  I might offer an amendment during the course of the debate to clarify \nthat this provision should be interpreted broadly, or I might through \nthe course of the debate, in hearing what other Senators say about it \nand my own interpretation of the amendment, decide not to offer such an \namendment. But I do think that it is a step far in the right direction. \nThis is really an opportunity to bring tax expenditures into the line-\nitem veto in a significant way, and allow the President of the United \nStates not only to veto those pork projects that are in the \nappropriations process but also to look at every tax bill that often is \ndotted with special interest provisions or attempts to expand special \ninterest provisions that are already in the Code and strike those lines \nwith a line-item veto.\n  So, Madam President, when we have the cloture vote on Wednesday, I \nintend to vote for cloture. And I hope that we will be able to dispense \nwith this bill by the end of this week and move on to other matters. I \nthink this is an important measure.\n  I look forward to working with the distinguished Senator from Indiana \nwho has been a good colleague throughout this process. I compliment him \non the bill that has come before the Senate.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from New \nJersey for his remarks and commend him for his longstanding efforts on \nbehalf of the line-item veto concept.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has talked to me on numerous occasions \nabout expanding the original concept of the bill that Senator McCain \nand I have proposed to include--not just appropriated items but also \ntax expenditures. He, as a member of the Finance Committee, detailed \nfor me the process of what most would consider tax pork that occurs as \ntax bills are written. It is not just the appropriations process.\n  I am pleased that we could address this issue in this bill as an \namendment introduced last evening by the majority leader. I say to the \nSenator from New Jersey our goal, I believe, is the same--to address \nthe same items that he attempts to address. I hope that as we debate \nthrough this and work through this we can clarify that so that Members \nknow exactly what we are after. It is hard to get the exact words in \nplace so that we understand just exactly how this applies to tax items. \nBut I believe that the targeted tax expenditures which are targeted in \nthe Dole amendment very closely parallel what the Senator from New \nJersey has tried for so long to accomplish.\n  So we look forward to working with him. I thank him for his support.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/21/senate-section/article/S4212-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have to attend a meeting in Delta \nJunction, AK, pertaining to Fort Greeley on Friday, March 24. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be excused from attendance in the Senate from \n3:45 on Thursday, March 23, until the Senate convenes on March 27.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this afternoon I rise in support of S. 4, \nthe Legislative Line-Item Veto Act.\n  What is now ongoing is, in my opinion, the long overdue and what I \nhope is a historic debate toward resolution of this very important \nissue.\n  Let me recognize both Senator Coats and Senator McCain, as well as \nChairman Pete Domenici and Majority Leader Dole, for their willingness \nto work together to bring us to a point of compromise that I think has \nproduced a line-item veto product in S. 4 that can pass the Senate, \nwork through the conference with the House, and ultimately be placed on \nthe President's desk with the degree of confidence I think we now have \nthat he will sign it.\n  This is one of those items that an overwhelming majority of the \ncitizens of our country say they agree with. It is certainly something \nthat most Senators have agreed with in principle, and now that we have \nbeen able to refine it, we have a product that I think the majority can \nsupport.\n  The issues, of course, were the two-thirds override: What kind of \nauthority would the President have in the ability to veto and in our \nability to react to that veto? I think it has to be a tough vote, a \nsupermajority vote. The idea of a simple majority, while I supported a \nconcept like that a year ago, now clearly, if we can get the tougher \nversion, we ought to do so.\n  The idea of separate enrollment or rescission is an issue that has \nbeen discussed. To extend the line-item veto authority in new, direct \nentitlement spending as well as appropriations is another issue that we \nhad to work our way through. And, of course, to extend the targeted tax \nbenefits, again, is another one of those issues that I am extremely \npleased to see that we have been able to deal with.\n  Let me first talk about the majority versus the two-thirds override \nwhich is really at the heart of all of this. It is the heart of the \ndivision of authority and responsibility and the power associated with \nthat authority. As I have mentioned, I have supported both approaches \nin the past, but I have always argued in doing so it was extremely \nimportant that the Congress of the United States pass the strongest \npossible line-item veto. In fact, as Senator McCain read earlier \nyesterday, that is exactly what the President has now said publicly he \nwants--the\n the strongest possible product that the Senate of the United States or \nthe Congress collectively can yield.\n\n  Last year's House passed a majority override. This year, an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan House, by a majority of 294 to 134, passed \nthe two-thirds override, an important signal from that new Republican \nHouse.\n  Now that Senators know we are firing with what all of us know are \nreal bullet votes, it is an opportunity to get our two-thirds. That is \nthe product at hand now. That is why I am extremely pleased that we can \ndeal with it.\n  The second issue I mentioned, the idea of separate enrollment versus \nrescission--as I say, I have sponsored both and cosponsored both \nbecause, whether I was in the majority or whether I was in the \nminority, I have always argued that we had to get to the President's \ndesk and into his power some form of line-item veto. The stronger \nversions were always greatly appreciated by this Senator, but at the \nsame time I felt it was critically important that we move the issue. \nNow my preferences lie clearly with a strengthened rescission approach. \nIt is simpler. In enrollment, transmission to the President, and at \nsigning of a law, it could be used as a scalpel instead of the idea of \na butcher knife, because rescissions can reduce as well as zero out an \nitem. I think that is the way we want to handle this.\n  But I will vote for a separate enrollment--or I would have, if that \nhad been \n[[Page S4223]]  the case. We think that is not going to be.\n  It should not sacrifice the good at the altar of the perfect. We have \nworked out what can be called near perfect on this issue, and I am \npleased that all of the Senators came together to strive to build the \ncompromise. The only line-item veto that will become law is the one \nthat we can send to a conference with the House and work out our \ndifferences on. From what I am hearing from some of my former \ncolleagues in the House, we can get that done now with the work product \nthat we are debating here at this time.\n  Separate enrollment was a second-best approach. That still makes it \ndefinitely preferable to the status quo. Senator Bradley and Senator \nHollings have introduced a version of that concept. The Senate Budget \nCommittee reported one out several years ago. The Senate considered a \nseparate approach in 1985. It is not mysterious, last-minute kind of \nwork. It is simply the kind of product that had to be looked at as we \nworked our way through the differences with this kind of legislation.\n  Opponents can have it both ways, I guess, in their arguments. Some of \nthose who criticized us for defending a balanced budget amendment as \nreported from the committee now are complaining that the committee-\nreported bill may be changed on the floor. We now have built a majority \nconsensus so that kind of issue will not have to be worried about or \ndealt with as we work our will in the final debate, moving through \ncloture, I hope, to final passage.\n  At a policy lunch today the leader, Leader Dole, mentioned it was \npossible we could get to a unanimous-consent agreement that would not \ntake us through cloture. I hope that will be the case. This ought not \nbe a contentious debate, or protracted. When an overwhelming majority \nof the American people want their Government to perform in a certain \nway, then we ought to make every effort to get that done. And certainly \nboth Senators McCain and Coats, working with the other Senators \nmentioned, I believe have tried to accomplish that. And S. 4, I think, \nclearly embodies that kind of effort on the part of the Senate.\n  Extend it to targeted tax benefits, the other issue I have mentioned. \nIt is important to remember that taxing and spending are fundamentally \ndifferent kinds of things. When Congress reduces someone's tax burden \nwe are not giving out something that is the Government's, although \nthere are some here who would like to argue, when we talk about this \nkind of thing, that somehow it is taking money away from the \nGovernment. I strongly argue taxpayers' money is theirs in the first \ninstance. It is a majority issue of Government, when Government decides \nto ask the citizens of this country to give a certain amount of their \nhard-earned effort in behalf of Government. But the idea that we are \ngiving something back, to me has always been an astounding attitude on \nthe part of many in Congress. I simply have argued the opposite and \nalways will continue to do so.\n  I believe in a free society it is the citizens who govern and not the \ngovernment. In this instance, I think we are caught in a debate of that \nkind of argument when we deal with the differences.\n  It is why I support the concept of a flat tax and always have. The \nline-item veto should extend to the tax side of the budget, and that is \nwhat we are trying to do now. If it is limited to a veto over narrowly \ntargeted tax benefits--in other words, tax pork--then we ought to look \nat that. That is what this ought to do and that is exactly what we will \nbe attempting to accomplish. Generally applicable tax relief, like rate \nreduction, indexing, or deductions or exclusions that apply to all \ntaxpayers who are similarly situated, should not be the subject in some \ninstances of a line-item veto. It should apply only in cases where \nsimilarly situated taxpayers within a group are targeted directly and \nare arbitrarily dealt with in tax legislation.\n  Let us debate substance in this instance and quit playing the \npolitics of this. Let us pass a bill and send to the conference and to \nthe President a document that truly works with the kind of issues we \ndeal with and gives the President substantive participation in the \nprocesses of budgeting. I hoped what happened on the balanced budget \namendment is not going to happen here. It now appears we have been able \nto strike a compromise that will allow it. But there is also something \nelse important to remember. Balanced budget amendments require two-\nthirds votes. This will require a majority of the Senate voting in \nfavor of this.\n  If we had been able to solve the problem of cloture, if we have been \nable to pass through that now with a unanimous-consent agreement--and I \nhope we can get there in the next few hours--let me tell you, it is \ngoing to be awfully important in resolving this issue and showing the \nAmerican people the Congress of the United States and the Senate can be \nresponsive to the issues at hand.\n  Promoting fiscal responsibility--that really is the issue underlying \nall that we do with the line-item veto. In 1974, from then until \nOctober 1994, the President requested 1,084 rescissions totaling $72.8 \nbillion. Of the 1,084 rescissions, Congress approved 399, or about 37 \npercent. That amounted to $22.9 billion or 31 percent of dollar volumes \nrequested.\n  Alone, a line-item veto process is not going to be enough to balance \nthe budget. But it is widely estimated it can save at least an \nadditional $10 billion a year in the current budgeting scenario. To \nparaphrase Senator Everett Dirksen: $10 billion here and $10 billion \nthere, and pretty soon we are talking about real money.\n  Interestingly enough, while we might forget that, thank goodness, the \ntaxpayers and the American public have not forgotten it. That is why \nthe line-item veto constantly over the years has increased in \npopularity as a concept and an important device for the executive \nbranch of Government to have.\n  Does it yield exclusive power to the President or to the executive \nbranch? Absolutely not. But what it does, whether it is a Republican \nPresident or Democrat President, it gives that President the \nopportunity to single out some of the budgeting and expenditure \nactivities that have gone on here on this Hill far too long. The \nspecial project of the special Senator, knowing full well that project \nalone could not come to the floor and sustain itself with a majority \nvote of the Senate itself, but because it has been tucked away in an \nappropriations bill, because it was give a little here and get a little \nfrom another Senator--that game has been played for years. And \nliterally hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent for very \nquestionable projects in individual States that should never have been \nallowed. That is the goal of a line-item veto. That alone would save us \nbillions of dollars a year, but that is not the only goal of a line-\nitem veto. The other goal is for the President himself or herself to \nparticipate directly, to deal with broader issues, if they will, to \ncause the targeting of the debate when it comes to the expenditure of \ntax dollars in ways that simply have not been targeted.\n  I have served in State government where Governors had line-item \nvetoes. I have had to go against a veto, take it to the floor of the \nState Senate in Idaho, and argue why we ought not to sustain the \nGovernor's veto in many instances.\n  Let me tell you. It really works to refine your thinking. It forces \nyou to do your homework. It forces that issue to the floor in a laser \nkind of direction of the conference or in this instance the Senate's \nattention on a given legislative issue, a given appropriation issue. \nAll of us who have served here for any length of time know very clearly \nthat when many of these appropriation bills come to the floor they are \nvery large in nature, and the balance on them that has been created is \noftentimes very precarious.\n  So the question of legislative accountability, as I have been talking \nabout, has to be one of the other most important issues in bringing \nabout a line-item veto. As I have said, many of these appropriations \nbills involve hundreds of pages of detail, and it is virtually \nimpossible for every Senator and for all staff to read every bill, \nevery page, every area of fine print.\n  Certainly, if it has happened to me once, it has happened to me many \ntimes over the course of my years in \n[[Page S4224]]  serving Idaho both in the House and in the Senate to go \nhome and to hold a town meeting and to have someone come and say, \n``Senator, did you know that in that bill you just passed there was \nthat provision in it?'' In all fairness I have to say, ``You know, I \ndid not know that. If I had known it, it might have changed my vote or \nit might have changed the attitude in which I dealt with a given \nissue.'' That is the responsibility that comes about as a result of \ngiving the President the kind of authority that is now offered in S. 4, \nthis very critical piece of legislation.\n  Very simply, that is why the American people by an overwhelming \nmajority have supported this concept.\n  So as we have worked out our differences in dealing with the style of \nvote, and the way we handle different items that target the President's \nattention and his authority under the line-item veto, in all fairness, \nMr. President, I am extremely proud of the work that we have been able \nto do and what I think will show on the final vote to be a very \nbipartisan issue.\n  One of my voters in Idaho said the other day, ``Well, Senator, do you \nreally think this is the time to give the President a line-item veto? I \nmean he is a Democrat, you know.'' I laughed and said, ``There is no \ngood time, and there is no bad time. I have always supported this idea, \nand if it is good enough for Ronald Reagan and George Bush, it is good \nenough for Bill Clinton, and all of the other Presidents who will serve \nafter them.'' Why? Because it is good public policy. It is the right \nthing to give the executive branch of Government because it fine tunes, \nit brings about accountability, and it causes the Congress of the \nUnited States and the Senate to do its homework in the kind of detail \nthat we have not been producing in the past.\n  In the final analysis, when I mentioned that 1,084 rescissions that \nPresidents have asked for and the 300-plus that we have been able to \nagree on, and the tens of billions of dollars that have been saved, and \nthe more that will be saved by the kind of effort that we are involved \nin today, that is the bottom line. That is the bottom line we all \nstrive for. That is why this line-item veto embodied in S. 4 is good \npublic policy.\n  I hope that we can work out the necessary unanimous consent so that \nwe do not have to march down the road of a cloture vote and that we can \nthen bring ourselves to the finality of the debate and final passage. \nBut in the end, if we cannot, then I will certainly support cloture. It \nis time we bring this issue finally to the floor for debate or for a \nvote, and I hope we can accomplish that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \ncomments, for his support, and for this effort. I appreciate the \ncontributions that he has made over the past several years in \nattempting to deal with this.\n  Mr. President, I note the Senator from West Virginia is on the floor. \nI certainly have no immediate requests for time at this point. I would \nbe happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from West Virginia \n[Mr. Byrd] is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suppose one of the evils that was included \nin Pandora's box was the evil of the common cold, and I seem to have \nbeen stricken with that virus for the present.\n  At last, we have seen unveiled the amendment which is the product of \nthe frenetic efforts of our Republican friends to come up with \nsomething of a line-item veto nature behind which they could rally a \nmajority of their Members. Even a cursory examination of the amendment \nwill compel one to say, with, Macduff, ``Confusion now hath made his \nmasterpiece.''\n  I think it is prudent to reflect with some care and detail on this \nfar-reaching measure. I find the transfer of power from Congress to the \nPresident, which would occur if this amendment were adopted and \nimplemented, a disturbing proposition. Mr. President, I fully realize \nthat when a Senator starts to talk about the shifting of power from the \nlegislative branch to the executive branch, his words, in great \nmeasure, fall upon deaf ears insofar as his colleagues are concerned. \nOne may talk until he is blue in the face, though he may have lungs of \nbrass and a voice that will never tire, he simply cannot get within the \neardrums of a good many of the Members of this body if he happens to be \ntalking about separation of powers and checks and balances. They pay \nlittle or no heed to what is being said. Consequently, I daresay that \nwhat I have to say today will probably be treated in the norm. That is, \nit will not be listened to by many Senators. Those who may happen to \npass by a TV screen and may hear it will nevertheless pay little \nattention to it. Even if they were to sit in front of me here in a \nchair and listen raptly, it would have no impact upon them.\n  I am sorry to say that we have come to such a state in the U.S. \nSenate that we are not disturbed when measures come before this body \nthe effect of which would be to transfer power from the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people, in the legislative branch, to \nthe Chief Executive. But that is one thing this is all about.\n  This is not a line-item veto measure. It may be called that, as a \nduck may be called a goose or a guinea pig or a chicken. But the duck \nis still a duck, and all may call this a line-item veto who wish to \ncall it that. But it is not a line-item veto. Nevertheless, if it is \nenacted, the shift of power will have taken place. The only good thing \nI can say about the amendment that has been offered by the \ndistinguished Republican leader is that it does have a sunset date.\n  Consequently, there will come a time when the Senate, if it has \nlearned anything in the meantime, will perhaps make a determination not \nto go down that fateful path again and renew the life of this measure. \nI do not denigrate those who support this measure. I know that the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] and the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] have long labored in this vineyard, \nand undoubtedly they believe in what they are doing. They believe it is \nthe right thing to do for the country and the right thing to do in the \neffort to get some kind of control over our massive deficits. So I do \nnot in any way cast aspersions on them. We differ. We differ in our \nphilosophy, I suppose. We probably differ in our concept of the Senate \nand the part that it is to play in the universe of institutions created \nby the Constitution.\n  I think it is prudent to reflect with some care, as I say, on the \ndetails of this far-reaching measure. I do find it a disturbing \nproposition to contemplate the transfer of power from Congress to the \nExecutive. The power we are talking about here is the control over the \npurse. I will not belabor the Senate with the long history of the \npeople of the British Isles, the long history of the English people, \nwho fought for centuries to bring about the logic of that power over \nthe purse in the hands of the elected representatives of the people of \nEngland, the reposing of that power over the purse in Parliament. I \nhave not sought to belabor that point at this time. I think that that, \nlike almost anything else one may say on this subject, would probably \ngo unheard, even though there may be those with ears who might \notherwise listen. The fact that our Framers drew upon the experience of \nthe colonists and the States, which in turn had drawn upon the \nexperience of Englishmen for centuries, really means nothing in the \nwaiting ears of most of today's Members of this body.\n  Few people attach any, or certainly not very much, significance to \nthe checks and balances and separation of powers which our Framers \nconstructed. Few people attach any significance to the purpose of that \nseparation of powers. Few understand that that mechanism grew out of \nthe experiences of centuries of time in the motherland of most of our \nforebears.\n  So it might be a waste of time to attempt to dwell upon those things, \nexcept if one wishes that the record, which will last a thousand years, \nwill still be read by some, at least, who do work in the research field \nand may find it of interest accordingly. But to most of us here today, \nmost of us who serve in this body, we do not pay much attention to \nhistory. History is bunk, as Henry Ford was supposed to have said. And \nI gather that most of my colleagues look at history in about the same \nfashion.\n  [[Page S4225]] But the time will come when there will be those of \nposterity who will look back and see the record. They will know where \nthe parting took place and where the delinkage occurred.\n  The power of the purse, which has been lodged in the legislative \nbranch for over 200 years, would, in considerable measure, be shifted \nto the executive branch, and specifically to the Office of Management \nand Budget.\n  That is where the power is going to go, to the Office of Management \nand Budget.\n  One needs only to recall the words of David Stockman a decade ago \nwhen asked, at the American Enterprise Institute Conference on the \nCongressional Budget and Empowerment Control Act, what the line-item \nvetoes effect on the Federal deficit would be. In a burst of candor, \nDavid Stockman replied: ``Marginal, if at all.'' Mr. Stockman amplified \nhis answer by saying: ``Line-item veto is about political power and \npolitical control. It can be used for lots of things. It would be great \nfor the director of OMB.'' David Stockman's words could not be more \ntrue, and when applied to this amendment, they hit the nail right on \nthe head--right on the head.\n  There are those who say, ``Well, the States have the line-item veto. \nWhy not give the President the line-item veto?''\n  There are those who, as former Governors, say, ``I had the line-item \nveto when I was Governor. Why not let the President have the line-item \nveto?''\n  Mr. Reagan said when he was Governor of California, ``I had the line-\nitem veto. Now give me the line-item veto as President of the United \nStates.''\n  Well, I think the problem with that is that being Governor of a State \nis one thing; being President of the United States is an entirely \ndifferent thing.\n  I have in my hand what we know of as the ``West Virginia Blue \nBook''--the ``West Virginia Blue Book.'' Well, in this ``West Virginia \nBlue Book,'' there are many items of interest, but the thing I shall \npoint to today is the Constitution of the United States of America. It \nis printed in the ``West Virginia Blue Book.'' And in the ``West \nVirginia Blue Book,'' it covers all of 15 pages. That is it. That is \nthe Constitution of the United States of America--15 pages in length. \nRight here.\n  It is 60 pages in length--60 pages for the constitution of West \nVirginia; 15 pages for the Constitution of the United States.\n  The constitution of the State of West Virginia goes into much detail \nabout numerous and sundry items that are of interest to the State of \nWest Virginia, of interest to a State.\n  And I daresay that there being 50 States, I would assume there are 50 \nconstitutions of 50 States in this country. And I would also assume \nthat not one of those other constitutions, not one of the other 49 \nconstitutions, is the same, precisely, as the constitution of my State \nof West Virginia. They are all different.\n  Any high school student who is worthy of graduating from high school \nunderstands that the State government and Federal Government are two \ndifferent things. Each operate in a separate sphere. The State is \nsupreme in its sphere. The Federal Government is supreme in its sphere. \nTwo far different entities, and one is not to be confused with the \nother.\n  The Constitution of the United States provides certain powers for the \nCongress: ``To borrow money on the credit of the United States.'' That \nis a power of the Congress.\n  Let me read just a few of the section 8 powers, section 8 of article \nI of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To Lay and collect Taxes, \n     Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for \n     the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States.\n\n  Now not one of the 50 States' constitutions have that proviso in it. \nNot one.\n  ``The Congress shall have Power . . . To borrow money on the credit \nof the United States.''\n  ``The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce with \nforeign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian \nTribes.''\n  Not one of the 50 States, not one, provides that power upon the \ngovernment of the State.\n  ``The Congress shall have Power . . . To establish a uniform Rule of \nNaturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies \nthroughout the United States; To coin money''--no State in this country \nmay coin money. Prior to the creation of this Republic, States could \ncoin money in America. Under the Articles of Confederation, the States \ncould coin money. But no longer. Only the Federal Government.\n  ``The Congress shall have power . . . To coin Money, regulate the \nValue thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and \nMeasures.''\n  I know it is old fashioned to read the Constitution any more around \nhere. Before it is finally relegated to the rare book section of the \nLibrary of Congress,\n I would advise my friends to come to me and get a copy of this \nConstitution. I carry it in my pocket. This is the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It cost me 15 cents. It is a little worn now. I think it \ncosts $1 now, but this one only cost me 15 cents. I have several copies \nof these which I will give to any Member of the Senate who supports \nthis line-item veto. I will be especially happy to give it to them. \nCome and get a copy of the Constitution and read it. See the difference \nin the State governments vis-a-vis the Federal Government.\n\n       To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the \n     Securities and current Coin of the United States;\n       To establish Post Offices and post Roads.\n\n  And so on and so on.\n\n       To declare War . . .\n       To raise and support Armies . . .\n       To provide and maintain a Navy.\n\n  These people argue about Governors having the line-item veto, give it \nto the Governors; why not give it to the President of the United \nStates?\n\n       To provide and maintain a Navy . . .\n       To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \n     carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other \n     Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the \n     United States, or in any Department or officer thereof.\n\n  And so the Framers deliberately created this system of separation of \npowers and checks and balances.\n  Now, at the State level, the system is not so clearly and delicately \ndelineated, as it is at the Federal level. There is a system of \nseparation of powers at the Federal level. There is a system of checks \nand balances at the Federal level. One can stand and talk until he is \nblue, until his gills turn blue and we will still have Senators saying, \n``Well, the Governors have line-item veto; this is just process.'' \nWell, it may be just process, but it is part of the constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances and separation of powers and it is worth \nfighting over.\n  I cannot conceive of a reelection for the U.S. Senate being so close \nthat I would be defeated because I voted against the line-item veto. I \ncannot conceive of that, and if it is, then so be it. I believe, having \ntaken an oath to support this Constitution 13 times in going on 49 \nyears now, I believe in that oath. I believe in supporting and \ndefending this Constitution, and that entails the defense of the \nseparation of powers and checks and balances. We cannot do that with a \nwink and a nod. We cannot just brush it aside and say, ``Oh, that's \nprocess. The Governors have it, we ought to let the President have \nit.''\n  I know that there are a lot of Governors who believe that that is a \nsufficient argument to make and that it is defensible. But I say read \nthe Constitution of the United States. Read the Federalist Papers. \nThere are 85 of them. About two-thirds were written by Hamilton; about \na third by Madison. Some of them are in dispute as to who is the \nauthor, Madison or Hamilton. Five were written by John Jay. No. 2, 3, \n4, 5 and I believe No. 64 were written by John Jay. Read them.\n  One cannot really fully understand this system which was created by \nthe Framers, among whom were Hamilton and Madison, without reading the \n85 Federalist papers. It is the most marvelous exposition of this \nsystem of Government that one may find anywhere under the Sun. And we \nare about to lightly toss away this power over the purse, which is the \ncritical balance wheel in the system of checks and balances.\n  The novel approach of this amendment--and this is a novel amendment, \na novel approach--the novel approach of this amendment would empower \nthe enrolling clerk of the body in which an \n[[Page S4226]]  appropriations measure originated to dissect the bill \nor joint resolution item by item, paragraph by paragraph, section by \nsection and then create bills and joint resolutions--so-called bills \nand joint resolutions--for each of those items, add to them fictitious \nenacting clauses--fictitious enacting clauses--and send the composite \nproducts to the President as though these items were legislative \nmeasures passed by both the House and the Senate in the format in which \nthey are presented.\n  For those who have the patience to listen and who may really care--\nand I do not expect all my colleagues to be in that category, and \nperhaps I cannot blame them. Because I feel so strongly and so deeply \nabout this, a common cold will not keep me from speaking. Oh, that my \nvoice would carry to the hills or the mountains, and though I had to be \nbrought into this Chamber on a stretcher, I would still fight for this \nConstitution and its system. It is not a process. Process. This is the \nConstitution we are talking of here. This is the constitutional system \nthat we are about to imperil.\n  This amendment that has been brought in by the distinguished majority \nleader--and he is a distinguished majority leader, a very distinguished \nmajority leader--this amendment provides, in essence that a bill--this \nis a bill. This bill is H.R. 4506. It is a bill that passed the \nCongress in the 103d Congress, the second session. It is an act making \nappropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 1995, and for other purposes. We would refer to \nthis as the energy water bill. It is not a very lengthy bill.\n  This bill that is 43 pages--43 pages--includes the Senate amendments. \nThis bill came over from the House. H.R. 4506 came to the Senate from \nthe House, and the Senate acted to amend the bill in certain places. \nThere is the bill as passed by the Senate and the House.\n  Now, the bill went to conference so that the differences between the \ntwo Houses could be resolved. When the bill came back from conference, \nthis is what it looked like. This is the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 4506, making appropriations for energy and water development for \nthe fiscal year ending 1995, and for other purposes. And so I hold in \nmy hand this conference report. This means conferees from both Houses \nsat down in conference, spent several hours, perhaps days, in resolving \nthe differences between the two Houses in connection with this bill, \nH.R. 4506.\n  This conference report lays out in minute detail the items of \nappropriation, setting forth the budget estimate on each item and the \nconference agreement on each item. There they are, hundreds of them.\n  Now, when this conference report was agreed on by both Houses, then \nthe act went down to the President for his signature. This conference \nreport did not go to the President for his signature. He could not look \ninto the conference report and veto items in that conference report \nbecause the conference report does not go to the President.\n  He looks at the bill. Here is the final public law, Public Law 103-\n316, August 26, 1994, and it is composed of--I have not counted the \nnumber of pages in it--17 pages. That is the final product. If someone \nwants to see the final act making appropriations for the Department of \nDefense, Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, and so on, they \nwould ask for Public Law 103-316, 103d Congress. There it is. That is \nthe product of months of work, starting with this bill which is sent \nover from the House, amended in the Senate, going to the conference, \nwith the conferees bringing back to each House this conference report, \nand it went down to the President. He signed it. This is the final \nproduct. That is public law.\n  Now, at the State level, under the State constitutions, the State \nlaws, most of the bills making appropriations at the State level are \nset forth by items in the bill that is to go to the Governor's office, \nand the Governor can line item this out, strike through it with his \npencil, put his initial there; go down to this item, strike it out, and \nput his initial there; go down to the next item, strike it out, and put \nhis initial there. He has line-item vetoed several of the provisions in \nthat bill.\n  Well, I have already shown why the President cannot line-item veto \nhere. In the first place, he does not have the constitutional authority \nto line-item veto, never had it, does not have it today. But the items \nare not set forth in such minute detail, even if he had it. Most of the \nitems are set forth in large sums of moneys. To find out what is in \neach sum, one goes to the conference report to find out the details.\n  Now comes this amendment which says that any appropriation bill, once \nthe amendment is agreed to, that hereafter becomes law, any \nappropriation bill that comes to either body that does not have each of \nthese items set forth in the bill may be sent back to the committee \nunless there is a waiver by three-fifths of the persons elected and \nsworn. So every bill will now have each of these items, each item in \nthe bill. When it goes to conference and comes back, the conference \nreport, if the conference report which heretofore I have had in my hand \nas representing the conference report on H.R. 4506 comes back at a \nfuture time, the bill to which it relates will have to have every item, \nevery item enumerated therein.\n  And then what would happen? Well, now, this is sleight of hand. If I \never saw sleight of hand, this is it in its rawest form. This bill will \nbe sent back to the clerk, the enrolling clerk of the body in which the \nbill originated. Appropriations bills by custom, not by the \nConstitution but by custom, originate in the other body. They originate \nin the House of Representatives.\n  Consequently, the bill, once the conference report is agreed to in \nboth bodies, will be sent back to the enrolling clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives where the bill originated, and that enrolling clerk in \nthe House of Representatives will break out each item, each unnumbered \nparagraph, each section, and enroll each item, each section, each \nparagraph as a bill. It will be kind of a cut-and-paste operation. In \norder to speed up the process, I assume that the clerk will have a lot \nof preprinted forms, and those preprinted forms will have on them, ``Be \nit enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United \nStates of America and Congress assembled.'' That will all be already \nprinted on the form. And then the clerk must in the wee hours of \nmidnight--he will undoubtedly have others help him--there in the \nsubterranean caverns of this massive Capitol, the enrolling clerk with \nhis helpers will break that bill down into those hundreds of little \npieces and each will be deemed to have been a bill passed by both \nHouses. And each of those so-called bills or joint resolutions will \nthen be signed by the Speaker of the House and by the President pro \ntempore of the Senate, or their designees, and sent to the President, \nto the White House.\n  Now, let me just show you what this would have meant in the case of \nthis one bill, H.R. 4506. Remember, this is the bill that came to the \nSenate. This is the final product, the conference report. There it is, \nthe conference report, setting forth all the paragraphs, sections, 116 \npages. Now, that bill was enrolled and sent down to the President. Here \nit is. That is the public act, 16 pages.\n  But now for the enrolling clerk to have broken down that bill into \neach item, here is what it would have looked like. This is it. Ipso \nfacto, the enrolling clerk waves the magic wand, the enrolling clerk of \nthe House of Representatives waves a magic wand over that bill, and \nhere is what we have: more than 17 pounds of so-called bills--there are \nover 2,000 of them--that go to the President for his signature.\n  Here is one of the bills. Here is another one. These are all to be \nsent down to the President after having been enrolled by the clerk of \nthe originating House--which, as I say, in this instance it will be the \nother body. Each of those will go to the President.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber believe that the President is going to \nsit down and look at those and decide which he will sign and which he \nwill not? No. Those will be handed over to the Office of Management and \nBudget and those fine, unelected, unidentified, nameless, anonymous \nbureaucrats--and they are all good people--will take a look at those \nand they will determine which of these, or somebody will determine and \ngive to the President--determine those that ought to be signed, those \nthat ought to be vetoed.\n  [[Page S4227]] Let us see what the Constitution says. Let us see what \nthe Constitution says about bills. This is article I, section 7, clause \n2. This is the Constitution. This is not the so-called Contract With \nAmerica. This is the Constitution of the United States. This is the way \nit has appeared for 206 years. There has been no change in this \nlanguage in 206 years. That is the same language that was there when \nWashington became President; when Adams became President; when \nJefferson and Madison and Monroe became President; when John Quincy \nAdams became President, the same language; and Andrew Jackson, William \nHenry Harrison--no, Van Buren, Van Buren--he found it written just like \nthat. Then Harrison, then Tyler, Polk, Taylor, Fillmore, Pierce, \nBuchanan, Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, and Grant. They found the same \nlanguage. Never a change.\n  Johnson, Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, Garfield, Chester A. Arthur, \nCleveland, Benjamin Harrison, Cleveland again, McKinley, Roosevelt, \nWilliam Howard Taft, Wilson.\n  I was born in the administration of Woodrow Wilson. He had the same \nlanguage--it has not been changed. It was not changed. That is the same \nlanguage that has been there all the time.\n  Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Roosevelt found it--not a blemish, \nnot a stain. Just like it was when George Washington said when he had \nto sign a bill he had to sign it all. There was not any line-item veto \nin it.\n  It has not been changed since Roosevelt. Truman did not change it, \nEisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter. Reagan wanted a \nline-item veto. But that is it. It withstood the trials of time.\n  The War of 1812; the war with Mexico, 1848; the Civil War, Spanish-\nAmerican War; World War I, World War II, Korean war, Vietnam war, the \nPersian Gulf war. All of the panics and depressions, the panic of 1837, \n1857, 1873, 1893, 1907, 1929, and 1930. This language has served \nthroughout all of American history.\n  And what does it say? It says:\n\n       Every Bill, which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States . . .\n\n  Let us read that again.\n\n       Every Bill, which shall have passed the House of \n     Representativesandthe Senate. . .\n\n  That indicates to me that when something reaches the President's desk \nthat is called a bill, it is something that shall have passed the House \nof Representatives and the Senate. It cannot possibly mean something \nthat was enrolled by the enrolling clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives. Can any Member truthfully say that if this legislation \nhad been adopted prior--this amendment by Mr. Dole--had been adopted \nprior to the passage of this energy water bill, can any one of us say \nthat we voted for this bill? Can we say we voted for that bill? Can we \nsay we voted for this bill? No. I never saw it. That bill did not pass \nboth Houses. That bill did not even pass one House.\n  Each of these little billettes will have to carry a designation on it \nthat will distinguish it from each of the other 2,000 little billettes. \nSo I suppose this would be H.R. 4506 (1). The next one will be H.R. \n4506 (2). The next will be H.R. 4506 dash, or parenthesis, 3.\n  Finally we would get to H.R. 4506-1909, H.R. 4506-2001.\n  Then, to make believe that each of these passed the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate is like looking at the noonday Sun and \nsaying it is midnight, without a star in the sky.\n  This is tomfoolery. I cannot believe that we Senators in our \ngeneration are going to fall for this kind of sleight of hand.\n  This is public law here, H.R. 4506. Where are we going to find the \npublic law on H.R. 4506 when it is broken down into over 2,000 little \nmake-believe bills that have been enrolled by an enrolling clerk who is \nnot answerable to the voters and sent down to the President? Where is \nthe public law? Show me the public law.\n\n       Every bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approves, he shall sign it . . .\n\n  What is the antecedent of ``it''? The antecedent is ``bill.'' If it \nis 2,000 little ``it's,'' how is he going to sign ``it''?\n\n     but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that \n     House in which it shall have originated . . .\n\n  Obviously, one item, one bill, is being contemplated by the Framers. \nThey are saying you cannot past two bills with the same number at the \nsame time.\n\n       If after such reconsideration two-thirds of that House \n     shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with \n     the objections, to the other House, by which it shall \n     likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of \n     that House, it shall become a law.\n\n  We are going to have over 2,000 laws in one bill, and some bills will \ncontemplate more laws than that. Some not as many, but some more. We \njust cannot be in control of our mental faculties if we are going to \nlook at this monstrosity and vote for it. We surely cannot be kidding \nanybody but ourselves.\n  Have we read the Constitution lately? From the very beginning, S. 1 \nin 1789 was the Judiciary Act. It was a Senate bill. It started out in \nthe Senate. Its number was S. 1. That created the judiciary. And ever \nsince bills have been denominated S. 1 or H.R. 1. Resolutions are S. or \nS. Res. 1 or S. Con. Res. 1 or S.J. Res. 1, depending on whether they \nare simple resolutions or concurrent resolutions or joint resolutions. \nThis has been the style from time immemorial going back into the \ncolonial legislatures, going back into the British Parliament. It has \nbeen ever thus.\n  The passage of a single appropriation bill by both Houses would be \nfollowed by a cut-and-paste operation in the office of the enrolling \nclerk of the originating body, and out of the wee hours of the night, \nthe fructifying wet pen, the scissors and paste and the whiz of the \ncomputer of the enrolling clerk and his staff, would pour out a vast \nlitter of mini-bills, or ``billettes,'' not a single one of which had \nbeen passed by either body of Congress.\n  Each of these is going to have a fictitious enacting clause on it.\n  The genuine bill, adopted by both Houses, will have been kidnapped, \nand subjected to the prostitution and mutilation of a cut-and-paste \noperation which may rightly be termed ``a getter of more bastard \nchildren than war's a destroyer of men.'' Hundreds of little orphan \nbills--nobody is going to claim these little orphan bills by the \nenrolling clerk. ``And where did you come from?'' ``I came out of the \nenrolling clerk's office.'' Who enacted this bill? Who will lay claim \nto have enacted this bill? What Senator will lay claim to have voted on \nthis bill? Not I. Not one of these bills will have passed the House and \nthe Senate or the House or the Senate, not one.\n  Hundreds of little orphan bills will then make their way to the \nSpeaker's desk and to the desk of the Senate President pro tempore to \nbe laboriously signed and sent in a seemingly endless stream to the \nOval Office, there to be signed or vetoed by the President.\n  I tell you, I am glad this was not the practice when I was President \npro tempore of the Senate. Signing all of those bills will be a never-\nending job in itself. It will keep the President pro tempore busy just \nto sign those bills.\n  Whatever else one may call it, this amendment will certainly prove to \nhave been a prolific one, and the period of incubation or gestation \nwhich it will have created will put to shame that of the guinea pig or \nrabbit or a mouse. This multiple mutation of the legislative process \nwill boggle the mind.\n  We surely cannot be in our senses. We are about to take leave of our \nsenses to vote for this piece of junk. This is not a line-item veto. \nWhy do we not bring on the line-item veto? Let us vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to give the line-item veto. Let the people \ndecide to give the line-item veto to the President.\n  As compared with the line-item veto, in the raw sense, this amendment \nis a thing of unnatural deformity--``nothing but mutation, ay, and \nthat, from one bad thing to worse.''\n  It is a proposal which represents a significant abdication of power \nby the legislative branch in favor of the executive branch.\n  It is an indication of power. We are becoming not only fools but lazy \nfools. Just turn it all over to the President. Abdicate our power. Give \nit to the man downtown. Bow down to power. Bow down to power. Remember \nwhat David Stockman said. This is a ``power play.''\n  [[Page S4228]] It is a pale substitute for really doing something \nsubstantial about the alarming budget deficits.\n  The amendment would also strengthen the House of Representatives at \nthe expense of the Senate.\n  Do we want to do that to the Senate?\n  Consequently, the House of Representatives would determine the format \nof the measure that is sent here and would determine how these measures \nwould be broken apart into items or paragraphs or sections. Great power \nto the President. More power to the Speaker. Great power to the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget.\n And all resulting in diminished authority of the U.S. Senate. Senators \nall know that when appropriations bills come to the Senate, the Senate \nhas a right to amend them. The two features about the Senate which, \nmore than all others, make the Senate the premier upper body in the \nworld are the ability to amend and the ability to speak at length. Now \nwhen appropriation bills come to the Senate, the format will have been \nlaid out by the other body. When all of these little ``billettes,'' \nthese little illegitimates that cannot really point to any parent--they \ncannot point to a parent bill because the bill that passed both Houses \nno longer exists. Where does it go? What does the enrolling clerk do \nwith it? Does he keep it? Does it go to the Archives? Does it go to the \nDepartment of State? What happens to that bill? All of these little \nillegitimates--I could call them bastards, but I will not do that; I \nwill call them illegitimates. All of these flow down to the President \nin a stream. Let us say the President vetoes 75 of these 2,000. He \nvetoes 75 and they all come back. Where do they go when they come? Do \nthey go back to the Senate? How many would say they go back to the \nSenate? They go back to the body in which they originated. Of course, \nthese did not originate anywhere. They originated in the enrolling \nclerk's office. But they would go back to the House of Representatives. \nThe House would determine whether or not it will vote to override the \nveto. If the House does not vote to override the veto, then the Senate \ndoes not get a crack at it at all.\n\n  We all know that the Senate does add to the bills that come from the \nHouse by way of amendments. Some of the little ``billettes'' that the \nPresident would amend, some of these little illegitimate offspring that \nthe President would decide to veto, would have originated in the Senate \nbecause the Senate has a right to amend. Do you think the Senate is \ngoing to get a second crack at that? Why, no. The House undoubtedly \nwill not attempt to override a veto that the President has attached to \none of these ``bills,'' which originated in the Senate.\n  This is an amendment by Robert C. Byrd that originated in the Senate. \nThat is supposed to be called a bill under this amendment. It \noriginated here. But it is not going to be sent back to the Senate. It \nis going to go to the House because it will have a House number on it--\nH.R. 4506, in this case. This number will be H.R. 4506-219, which \noriginated in the Senate. It was an amendment added by the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Exon]. But it will not come back to the Senate. The House \nwill decide whether or not there will be an attempt to override that \nveto, and if the House decides not to attempt to override it, the \nSenate does not get a second crack at it.\n  I do not know about other Senators, but I am not in favor of \nsubordinating the Senate to the other body. The Framers meant for the \ntwo bodies to be equal, each to play its own role. There were checks \nand balances between the two Houses. There will not be any checks and \nbalances here in this situation. The Senate will not be a player.\n  So let us take a look at this marvel of legislative fecundity.\n  This is an amendment on which there is no committee report and in \nconnection with which there are no printed hearings. That is the \namendment that was offered yesterday by Mr. Dole and immediately a \ncloture motion was thrown in, to bring it to a vote. That is what we \nhave come to now in this body. We bring in an amendment which is a \nbrand new bill, which the Members of the minority had nothing to do \nwith insofar as helping to shape it. It is offered and a cloture motion \nis offered on that amendment, and that means we have to vote up or \ndown, one way or the other, on the cloture motion the following day but \none, meaning tomorrow in this case.\n  No printed hearings. No committee report. The amendment comes before \nus much like Minerva, who sprang from the brain of Jove, or Aphrodite, \nwho sprang from the ocean foam. It is the product of a collective \nfertile mind, and from it will flow fertile confrontations, fertile \nvetoes and, in all likelihood, it will undoubtedly prove to be a \nfertile field for exploitation by the lawyers of the country.\n  It requires each item of any general or special appropriation bill or \nany joint resolution making supplemental, deficiency, or continuing \nappropriations that is agreed to by both Houses of Congress to be \nseparately enrolled as separate bills or joint resolutions for \npresentation to the President. Any appropriations measure that passes \nboth Houses of the Congress will be turned over to the enrolling clerk \nof the House in which the appropriations measure originated, to be then \nenrolled as a separate measure for each item in the appropriations \nbill. Each of these little orphan bills--Little Orphan Annie is going \nto feel put upon when she sees all these multitude of orphan bills \nrunning down to the White House--each of these little orphan bills \nshall bear the designation of the parent measure of which it was a ward \nprior to such enrollment, together with such other designations as may \nbe necessary to distinguish each little baby bill from the other \nhundreds of measures enrolled pursuant to the provisions of the \namendment. Each appropriations ``billette'' will contain one item in \nthe original bill and each of these little offspring will be deemed to \nbe a bill under clauses 2 and 3 of section 7 of article I of the \nConstitution of the United States. Each shall be signed by the Speaker \nof the House and the President of the Senate, or their designees, and \npresented to the President for approval or disapproval in the manner \nprovided by the Constitution for bills and joint resolutions generally.\n  We will take a look at the phraseology of the Constitution on the \nchart to my left again.\n  Article I of section 7 of the Constitution provides that, ``Every \nbill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the \nSenate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the President \nof the United States''; note that the Constitution refers to ``every \nbill which shall have passed'' both Houses of Congress shall be \npresented to the President for his approval or rejection. But this \namendment now reads, in part, on page 4 of the amendment:\n\n       A measure enrolled pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection \n     (a) with respect to an item shall be deemed to be a bill \n     under clauses 2 and 3 of section 7 of article I of the \n     Constitution of the United States--``shall be deemed to be a \n     bill.''\n\n  Well, the Constitution does not say that every bill which may be \ndeemed or which shall be deemed to ``have passed'' the two Houses. It \nclearly states that every bill which shall have passed. We do not deem \nit to have passed. We do not consider it to have been passed. We do not \nthink of it as something that has passed. We do not look upon it as \nsomething which otherwise may have passed. It is something that passed. \nEvery bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the \nSenate shall be presented to the President for his signature.\n  Under this rogue amendment, not a single one of the bogus bills \nenrolled by the clerk of the originating House of Congress will have \n``passed'' either the House or the Senate, to say nothing of both \nHouses. Not a single Senator nor a single House Member will have voted \non the cut-and-paste so-called bill which goes to the President. \nHundreds of mini-bills will flow from a single appropriation bill or \njoint resolution, and not one of these ``fictions'' will have \n``passed'' the House and Senate in accordance with the requirements of \nthe Constitution. Not one will be a ``bill'' in the traditional sense \nof the word; each will be ``deemed to be a bill.''\n  Each will be ``deemed'' to be a bill; each will be pretended to be a \nbill. Not one will be a bill in the traditional sense.\n  It will be claimed that this odd construction is in keeping with \nsection 5 of article I of the Constitution which provides that each \nHouse may determine the rules of its proceedings.\n   [[Page S4229]] So there will be those who will say, ``Well, in view \nof the fact that under the Constitution each House may determine the \nrules of its proceedings, it is within the power and authority of each \nHouse to determine what is a bill. And if the House and Senate want to \ndeem something to have passed, well, that is within the rules of the \nbody.''\n  But certainly, the Framers could not have intended that any interim \nrules of the two Houses could invalidate the clear instructions of the \nConstitution with respect to the passage of a bill.\n  So if, within our internal rules, we may decide to ``deem'' a certain \npiece of paper as being a bill, surely the internal rules of the two \nHouses can never supersede or override the clear language of the \nConstitution itself which says, ``Every bill which shall have passed \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \nlaw, be presented to the President of the United States.''\n  So the Framers could not have intended that any internal rules of the \ntwo Houses could invalidate the clear instructions of the Constitution \nwith respect to the passage of a bill.\n  Now if a bill may be ``deemed'' to have passed both Houses, then \nmight not the first clause of section 7, article I, be also ``deemed'' \nin its thrust?\n  Let us read the first clause of section 7, article I.\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives.\n\n  Now, if Congress may deem this to have been a bill passed by both \nHouses, why could not Congress deem this to be a revenue bill that was \ndeemed to have originated in the House of Representatives? If Congress \nmay deem a piece of paper enrolled by the clerk of either body, which \nno Member of the Senate or the House has ever seen, if that may be \ndeemed a bill and be deemed to have passed both Houses, then why not \ndeem this tax revenue measure which originated in the Senate, why not \ndeem it to have originated in the House? That would be as much a use of \nthe internal rules of the Senate as would be the case in the former \ninstance.\n  There are those who say that, what Congress gives Congress can take \naway. True. But when Congress seeks to take back this giveaway of its \npowers, it must be prepared to produce a two-thirds vote in both Houses \nto override a Presidential veto. This is a lose-lose proposition, as \nfar as Congress is concerned. Appropriations for national defense and \nfor the national welfare would be determined by unelected, unidentified \nbureaucrats in the Office of Management and Budget, who would \ndetermine, for the President, which of the orphan measures may be \nconsidered worthy of his signature and which should be the victims of \nhis wet veto pen. No matter what pretty face one may attempt to put on \nthis hydra- headed monster, practically speaking, it will result in a \nmassive shift of power over the purse from the legislative branch to \nthe executive branch.\n  I know that means little or nothing to some of the Members of this \nbody who have sworn to uphold and support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States. I realize that means nothing. But, nevertheless, \nit is there.\n  The Constitution should not be demeaned and debased by this kind of \nslight-of-hand work that would result from this amendment.\n  It is nothing less than legislative sleight-of-hand, and no self \nrespecting Member of the Congress should allow himself or herself to \nparticipate in this emasculation of the Constitution to which we have \nall sworn an oath to support and defend.\n  The great name of Thomas Jefferson has been frequently used in this \nChamber over the past several weeks during the debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. Let us see what Thomas Jefferson \nhas to say with respect to the passage, the enrollment, and \npresentation of a bill to the President.\n  Mr. President, I do not have in my hand a copy of the manual of \nparliamentary practice by Thomas Jefferson, but I have one downstairs \nin my office. The title of it is ``A Manual of Parliamentary Practice \nfor the use of the Senate of the United States.'' It is by Thomas \nJefferson, first edition, 1801.\n  On page 73 of Jefferson's manual, it is stated, ``After the bill is \npassed, there can be no further alteration of it in any point.''\n  Now those who have been invoking the great name of Thomas Jefferson \nthroughout the debate on the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, let them hear. Jefferson, in his manual, states, ``After \nthe bill is passed, there can be no further alteration of it in any \npoint.'' And for his authority, Jefferson cites William Hakewill, who \nprepared a manual entitled ``The Manner and Method How Laws are there \nEnacted by Passing of bills, collected out of the Journal of the House \nof Commons,'' 1671.\n Thus, a bill, as contemplated by this amendment, stripped out of the \nparent measure and enrolled by the enrolling clerk, presumably on a \npredetermined form, with a fictitious enacting clause, flies in the \nface of tradition, custom, and parliamentary practice coming down to us \nfrom time immemorial, from the British Parliament, the Colonial \nLegislatures, the American States that existed before the Constitution, \nand the practices of 206 years of legislative history under the \nConstitution. This is nothing less than legislative heresy, and ``With \nnew opinions, divers and dangerous, which are heresies, and, not \nreform'd, may prove pernicious.'' It is a pernicious amendment, and it \nis bound to have pernicious effects, if it is written into law.\n\n  Let us now take a look at rule XIV of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate and determine whether or not each of the so-called bills and \njoint resolutions will have complied with the provisions of rule XIV.\n  Rule XIV, paragraph 2, reads as follows:\n\n       Every bill and joint resolution shall receive three \n     readings previous to its passage, which readings on demand of \n     any Senator shall be on three different legislative days . . \n     . and the Presiding Officer shall give notice at each reading \n     whether it be the first, second, or third.\n\n  Now, are we to pretend, Mr. President, that each of these little \nillegitimate ``billettes'' which are going to be sent down to the \nPresident for his signature, does anyone here have the gall to say that \neach of these will have been read three times? Well, that is what rule \nXIV says with regard to bills and joint resolutions. It says:\n\n       Every bill and joint resolution shall receive three \n     readings previous to its passage, which readings on demand of \n     any Senator shall be on three different legislative days.\n\n  Paragraph 3, rule XIV, Standing Rules of the Senate:\n\n       No bill or joint resolution shall be committed or amended \n     until it shall have been twice read, after which it may be \n     referred to a committee.\n\n  Mr. President, not one of these 2,000 little ``billettes'' will have \nbeen referred to a committee. Not one will have been twice read. Not \none will have been once read. Not one will have been three times read. \nNot one will have seen the inside of a committee room, and it will be \nsure they will see the inside of the enrolling clerk's committee room. \nHe might be able to take them home at night, over the weekend, do his \nwork at home, get a pair of scissors, scotch tape, or old-fashioned \nlibrary glue and take home some of these pre-prepared forms and enroll \nthe bills. Do it at home.\n\n       No bill or joint resolution shall be committed or amended \n     until it shall have been twice read, after which it may be \n     referred to a committee.\n\n  Paragraph 4:\n\n       Every bill and joint resolution reported from a committee, \n     not having previously been read, shall be read once . . .\n\n  Not one of these little orphans will have been reported from a \ncommittee. And so rule XIV will not be complied with.\n\n       Every bill and joint resolution reported from a committee, \n     not having previously been read, shall be read once, and \n     twice, if not objected to, on the same day, and placed on the \n     Calendar in the order in which the same may be reported.\n\n  Not one of these will ever see the calendar. Not one will ever be on \nthat calendar, and we can thank heavens for that, because if all these \nappeared on the calendar, the calendar itself would weigh, with 13 \nappropriations bills if they all land on there at the same time toward \nthe close of the fiscal year, the Calendar of Business would be thicker \nthan this stack of bills. That would be an illegitimate calendar made \nup of illegitimate little bills.\n  Paragraph 5:\n\n       [[Page S4230]] All bills, amendments, and joint resolutions \n     shall be examined under the supervision of the Secretary of \n     the Senate before they go out of the possession of the Senate \n     . . .\n\n  Not according to this amendment. They are not going to be examined \nunder the supervision of the Secretary of the Senate. They are going to \nbe examined under the supervision of the clerk of the other body. The \nSenate will turn over everything to the other body. Let the enrolling \nclerk of the other body, because that is where the bills are going to \noriginate, let the enrolling clerk in the other body do the enrolling; \nlet him do the cutting and pasting, gluing together. The Secretary of \nthe Senate can take a walk. He will not have anything to do with it.\n  It says:\n\n       . . . All bills and joint resolutions which shall have \n     passed both Houses shall be examined under the supervision of \n     the Secretary of the Senate, to see that the same are \n     correctly enrolled . . .\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate is not going to do that under this \namendment. Under this amendment, the clerk of the other body will see \nthat they are correctly enrolled.\n\n     . . . and, when signed by the Speaker of the House and the \n     President of the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate shall \n     forthwith present the same, when they shall have originated \n     in the Senate, to the President of the United States.\n\n  Well, most of these will not have originated in the Senate.\n  Reading from paragraph 7:\n\n       When a bill or joint resolution shall have been ordered to \n     be read a third time, it shall not be in order to propose \n     amendments, unless by unanimous consent, but it shall be in \n     order at any time before the passage of any bill or \n     resolution to move its commitment; and when the bill or \n     resolution shall again be reported from the committee it \n     shall be placed on the Calendar.\n       When a bill or resolution is accompanied by a preamble, the \n     question shall first be put on the bill or resolution and \n     then on the preamble . . .\n\n  So, Mr. President, if there is a preamble on each of these bills--the \npreamble on the parent bill, I presume, would have to be on each of the \nlittle mini-bills, and the question would have been first on the bill \nand then on the preamble.\n  No Senator can, of course, say with a modicum of truth and honesty \nany vote occurred on that bill or preamble.\n  So much for the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  Perhaps that can bear further study on a later date.\n  The hundreds of little counterfeit bills and joint resolutions will \nnot have received three readings prior to their passage, nor will they \nhave been examined under the supervision of the Secretary of the Senate \nto see that they have been correctly enrolled.\n  Simply put, what this amendment does is to require the enrolling \nclerk of the House, or the Senate, to take appropriation bills as well \nas direct spending bills and those containing certain targeted tax \nbenefits and break those bills down into numerous parts after they have \nbeen passed by both Houses. How many parts would depend on how many \nnumbered sections and unnumbered paragraphs the enrolling clerk found \nin the complete bills.\n  To make matters worse, however, section 2 of the amendment requires \nthat any appropriation measures reported by the Committees on \nAppropriations of the House and the Senate must contain the ``level of \ndetail on the allocation of an item of appropriation as is proposed by \nthat House such as is set forth in the committee report accompanying \nsuch bill.'' The same requirement would be placed on conference \nreports, as well. These requirements could be waived or suspended in \nthe House or Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \nMembers of that House duly sworn or chosen. Similar requirements would \napply to tax expenditure and direct spending bills.\n  What this means, Mr. President, is that the Appropriations Committees \nwould be required to place into each bill all of the literally hundreds \nand in some cases thousands of items that are now contained in the \ncommittee reports and the conference report, whereupon each of these \nitems would then be separately enrolled and become a separate law.\n  This process fails to recognize that unlike those of States, which \nare highly itemized, Federal appropriation bills generally contain a \nnumber of large appropriations, with the details of how the funds are \nto be spent set forth in the accompanying reports. This practice has \nworked well and is favored by the executive branch because it enables \nagencies to respond to budgetary changes during a fiscal year by moving \nfunds from one area to a more pressing area. This process of \nreprogramming funds is conducted pursuant to well-established \nprocedures which ensure that the Federal Government can carry out its \nresponsibilities within the general purpose specified in each account.\n  For example, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 1995 contains a lump-sum of $983,668,000 to cover general \nconstruction for the Corps of Engineers. The statute identifies 34 \nspecific projects, totaling $120,126,500. Most of the detail, however, \nis contained in the conference report, which I have shown, instructing \nthe Corps of Engineers how to spend the nearly $1 billion. Because the \ninstructions are in a nonstatutory source and not a public law, the \nagency can shift funds within the lump sum in response to their needs--\noften requiring approval from review committees.\n  Yet, under the pending proposal, reprogrammings will no longer be \npossible. Rather, every item listed in appropriations conference \nreports would be considered an ``item'' and, as such, would be \nseparately enrolled. If that were done, then all of these items would \nbe frozen in their own separate laws and it would be illegal to shift \nfunds from one area to another without a change in statute. This would \nmean a large increase in congressional workload. For every mid-course \ncorrection needed by every agency of Government, the President would \nhave to seek legislation and we would have to enact every shift in \nfunds. Imagine how inefficient and cumbersome this would be.\n  I asked our Appropriations Committee staff to count up the number of \n``items'' there are in each of the fiscal year 1995 appropriations acts \nand conference reports which would have to be separately enrolled under \nthe pending amendment. Senators will recall that, under section 2(c)(1) \nof the amendment, it will not be in order to report an appropriation \nconference report that fails to contain the level of detail of an item \nof appropriation such as is set forth in the statement of managers \naccompanying that report. This means that every appropriation now named \nin these statements of managers will have to be placed in the \nconference report and, subsequently be separately enrolled and sent to \nthe President as a separate minibill which, if the President signs it, \nwill become a separate law.\n  One of the 1995 appropriation acts with the largest number of items \nis the Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act.\n  And as I have already demonstrated, the law is 17 pages in length and \nthe statement for which every item has been provided is 116 pages in \nlength.\n  These two documents--the Public Law and the conference report \ncontaining the statement of managers--are the culmination of months of \nhearings, of subcommittee and full committee markups, of passage by the \nHouse and Senate, and of a conference to settle the differences between \nthe two Houses. After all that work, and after adoption of the \nconference report and the amendments in disagreement, this \nappropriation bill finally became a public law and it is being carried \nout pursuant to this conference report and statement of the managers.\n  Mr. President, as I have already shown, this stack of paper has been \nprepared for the Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act for \n1995 in conformance with Mr. Dole's proposal. And just in case there \nmay be some Members or staffs or people out there in TV land, this is \nthe energy and water--I cannot say bill. These are the 2,000 odd bills \nthat would be enrolled by the clerk of the other body and sent down to \nthe President and which in fact constituted the one bill, which had \nonly 16 pages, which is referred to as Public Law 103-316 that is the \nenergy and water appropriation bill. That is it, 17 pounds--17 pounds.\n  Each of those would have to be signed by the President pro tempore \nand the Speaker of the House, and each would have to be signed by the \nPresident, unless he decided to veto them or not sign them and let them \ngo into law without his signature. He might ease \n[[Page S4231]] his workload by following that course of action.\n  Each of the items contained in that public law, which I hold in my \nhand--right here--itemized in the tables of the conference report have \nbeen enrolled separately pursuant to section 4 of the amendment that \nhas been offered by the distinguished majority leader. Each item of \nappropriation will have to be separately signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse and by the President of the Senate, and so instead of that one \npublic law and that one conference report we will have over 2,000 \npublic laws for just one appropriation act.\n  Mr. President, is this not sheer madness? Sheer madness. All 12 of \nthe other appropriation acts will face similar requirements. The \nestimates are that if the amendment offered by Mr. Dole had been in \neffect for fiscal year 1995, the Agriculture Appropriation Act would \nhave been broken down into 757 separate acts; the Commerce, Justice, \nState, and Judiciary Appropriation Act would have been broken down into \n924 acts; the District of Columbia Appropriation Act would have been \nbroken down into 165 little enrolled bills which later became acts, \npublic laws; the Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act as I \nalready have said would have been broken down into 2,000 acts; the \nInterior Appropriation Act would have been broken down into 1,000 \nseparate acts; the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education \nAppropriation Act would have been broken down into 200 acts; the \nTransportation Appropriation Act would have been broken down into 750 \nacts; the Treasury, Postal Service Appropriation Act would have been \nbroken down into 479 acts; the Defense Appropriation Act would have \nbeen broken down into 2,000 acts; the Military Construction \nAppropriation Act would have been broken down into 225 acts; the \nForeign\n Operations Appropriation Act would have been broken down into 225 \nacts; the VA/HUD Appropriation Act would have been broken down into 800 \nacts; and the Legislative Branch Appropriation Act would have been \nbroken down into 100 acts.\n\n  Perhaps we should call them actlettes, 100 actlettes.\n  That comes to a total of 9,625 minibills, or billettes or actlettes, \nor public lawlettes--public lawlettes, 9,625 that would have been \nnecessary in 1995 rather than the 13 annual appropriation acts under \nwhich we are currently operating.\n  So, here we will have passed 9,625 public laws and I would have \ngotten credit for only voting on 13 of them--13; 13 rollcall votes. I \nanswered every one of them, yet there would have been 9,625 separate \nlegislative acts, not one of which passed the House or the Senate, to \nsay nothing of both Houses.\n  Since most of the annual appropriation bills are not finalized until \nthe last few days before the beginning of the fiscal year to which they \napply, one can see that this proposal, if enacted, would succeed in \nbringing the appropriation process to a virtual standstill. It would \nalso be next to impossible for the President to approve these thousands \nof bills before the beginning of the fiscal year, because there would \nbe no practical way to process that many bills, get them signed by the \nSpeaker and the President of the Senate, sent to the White House, and \nsigned by the President in such a short time.\n  Therefore, what we would be setting up is a more complicated process \nunder which a President and a Congress, through no fault of their own, \nwould not be able to complete its work in a timely fashion. We would be \nvirtually guaranteeing a return to government by continuing resolution.\n  But, on the other hand, think of the increased media attention it \nwill bring to bill-signing ceremonies.\n  I have been down at White House on a few occasions, a few occasions. \nI have attended bill-signing ceremonies. The distinguished Senator from \nNebraska has been there on bill-signing ceremonies. We stand there \nbehind the President. We might even get up against him so we can say to \nour grandchildren, this coat--this coat touched the President's coat. \nSee? This coat touched the hem of his garment. And the President signs \nthe bill, just a little bit at a time, and hands back the pen; signs \nanother little portion and hands back the pen.\n  I take that pen home and have it framed and I am able to tell my \ngrandchildren that there is a pen that the President used in signing \nsuch and such a bill. Yes, the pen, he gave it to me. I never would \nhave thought it, this boy from the hill country--I never thought I \nwould be in the White House, never would have thought I would have been \nin the Oval Office. And here, just to think of it, here is a pen that \nthe President signed the bill with and gave it to me.\n  ``Aren't you proud of your grandpa? Aren't you proud of your \ngrandfather?\"\n  My, what I have been missing, though. I have only had a few of those \npens.\n  Now think of the increased media attention that would be given to one \nof those bill-signing affairs. For just the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriation Act the President would have to sign all \nthese 2,000 little minibills. That would become an all day affair; let \nus go down there for a whole day, the whole day. You would have to go \ndown to the White House early in the morning with the subcommittee \nchairman, in this case it would be Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Johnston.\n  We would go down with the subcommittee chairman and ranking member, \nleading the honored guests along with their House counterparts. The \nPresident and appropriate members of the Cabinet would greet the \ncongressional delegation out on the White House lawn--would you say? \nOut at the Rose Garden. They would be all lined up out there in the \nRose Garden. Up would drive one of these 16-wheelers, a big truck. It \nwould back its way up to the gate and they would start unloading all \nthose pens to sign those bills.\n  After a photo-op, the President would take out his first of many pens \nand begin to sign this stack of 2,000 or so bills into law. He would \nhand out pens to the gathered congressmen. There might be 24 separate \nlaws for New Mexico projects, so Senator Domenici would get 24 pens. \nPerhaps Louisiana would have 32 projects and, therefore, 32 laws. So, \nSenator Johnston would get 32 pens, and so on.\n  This process of signing over 2,000 minilaws would take quite some \ntime. There would probably have to be a lunch break, followed by more \nsignings in the afternoon. The President would say ``You boys''--he \nwould call us boys. I would not think anything of it, he calling me \nboy. My mom used to call me boy. She would say, ``Robert, you be a good \nboy. I'll always pray for you.'' He would say, ``You boys come back \nthis afternoon after lunch and we will finish signing these bills.'' Of \ncourse we would be back because we would not want to miss out on our \npens.\n  I expect he would draw a good deal of attention. It would become a \nvery popular ritual for Congress and the President alike.\n  Now, let us look at what happens when a President decides he does \nnot----\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. I have been listening with great interest. The Senator left \nout whether or not he has made any calculation as to what the cost to \nthe taxpayers would be, for all of those pens? Do you have any \nestimation of what that would be, in dollars, at the present time? Or \nis that just a minor matter?\n  Mr. BYRD. It is not a minor matter. We put it on the computer and the \ncomputer blew up. We tried to get that information out of the computer \nand the computer blew up.\n  Mr. EXON. Gone.\n  Mr. BYRD. Gone.\n  Mr. EXON. More expenses to the taxpayer. I thank my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I am sorry he has \ndecided to retire, after this term. We will miss him and he will miss \nreceiving all those pens. He will miss traveling down to the Rose \nGarden, having the President hand him all those pens, for items that \nare in the bill for Nebraska.\n  Seriously, I do say I shall miss him. He is a stalwart Member and one \nwho is forthright always with what he says. He has a backbone, the \ncourage of his convictions.\n  Now let us look at what happens when a President decides he does not \ncare to sign a number of these many \n[[Page S4232]] thousands of appropriation bills. In this case, those \nunsigned bills must be returned to the House of Congress which \noriginated them. In the case of appropriation bills, the overwhelming \nmajority will have originated in the House of Representatives. \nTherefore, any of these thousands of annual appropriation bills which \nthe President returns unsigned will go to the House of Representatives. \nUnder article I, section 7, clause 2 of the Constitution, the House of \nRepresentatives will then have total control of whether, and if so, \nwhen to schedule a veto override vote. Let us say, for example, that a \nPresident decides that he will not sign 5 percent of these thousands of \nappropriation bills. The other 95 percent are fine--they get the \nblessing of the President's unelected advisers. But these same advisers \nrecommend, and the President agrees, that 5 percent of them should not \nbe signed. That is not an unlikely scenario. The President's OMB \npersonnel will have scoured every one of these thousands of bills and \nthey are likely to find reasons to send a number of them back to the \nHouse of Representatives; in this example 5 percent, or several hundred \nof the bills are returned. What happens next? Under the Constitution, \nthat will be left entirely up to the House of Representatives. If the \nHouse decides not to schedule a veto override vote on any or on all of \nthese returned bills, that is the end of it. The Senate will have no \nsay in the matter. Are Senators prepared for that state of affairs? Are \nyou prepared, Senators, to have to beg the House to take up a vetoed \nbill?\n  I say to the Senator from Michigan, the able Senator from Michigan \n[Mr. Levin], are you prepared to go over to the other body and beg the \nHouse to take up that vetoed bill so that you at least get a vote in \nthe other body on the item that is of importance to your State?\n  Mr. President, this amendment, in the opinion of various scholars, \nwould be, in all likelihood, unconstitutional. For example, in recent \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Walter Dellinger, \nAssistant Attorney General of the U.S. Department of Justice, made the \nfollowing statement:\n\n       As much as I regret saying so . . . [the] proposal for \n     separate enrollment also raises significant constitutional \n     issues, you know, that would atomize or dismember one of \n     these large appropriations bills into its individual items \n     which the President could then sign. I think it is either \n     invalid under the clause, in my view, or, at a minimum, it \n     raises such complicated questions under the Presentment \n     Clause that it is a foolhardy way to proceed because if we \n     and all of our predecessors are right, I think that which has \n     to be presented to the President is the thing that passed the \n     House and the Senate, and that which passed the House and the \n     Senate is the bill they voted on on final passage, not some \n     little piece of it or a series of little pieces of it. So I \n     have doubts about it.\n\n  That was Mr. Walter Dellinger, constitutional scholar, speaking.\n  Mr. President, although the bill before us today is being touted by \nits sponsors as a line-item veto bill, that description is not correct. \nThis bill would not give the President line-item veto authority. The \nonly way for Congress to confer such power is through an amendment to \nthe Constitution. It cannot be done by mere statute. Therefore, a \nfundamental thing that needs to be said about this bill is that it is \nnot, in any way, shape, or form, a line-item veto measure.\n  We could not give the President a line-item veto. Congress could not \npass that power on to the President. Only the people could do that by \nway of constitutional amendment. But we could be just as effective in \nshifting the power of legislative branch over the purse to the \nPresident by way of a statute. That is what is about to occur.\n  Indeed, I question why, if not for partisan political reasons, anyone \nwould tell the American people the Senate is considering a line-item \nveto bill, when, in fact, we are not?\n  In fact, we are not. That kind of misinformation does nothing but \nconfuse, mislead, and further alienate an already cynical public. So \nSenators can disabuse themselves of that notion right from the start. \nNo one is going to be able to go home, and, in all honesty, claim \npolitical favor by telling the voters they were for or against the \nline-item veto.\n  Instead, what we have before us is a separate enrollment bill, an \nenormously different creature. In short, what we have here is a slice-\nand-dice approach to legislating.\n  I have been in the legislative branch for 49 years. I have never seen \nanything like that.\n  Semantics aside, though, what the proponents of this measure have \npresented to the Senate is a piece of legislation that would set up a \nlogistical nightmare, that would create an unworkable process, and that \nis obviously not well thought out. This is the product of a desperate \npolitical compromise aimed at getting anything through Congress which \ncan be mislabeled line-item veto.\n  Logistics are not, however, the only problem. In fact, they are not \neven the most serious. What is fatal to this measure, as it would be \nwith any type of separate enrollment procedure, is that the entire \nscheme is unconstitutional--unconstitutional. My colleagues and I have \nbeen in this business for years. This is my seventh term. I am in my \nseventh term. Seven times I have asked the people of West Virginia to \nreturn me to the U.S. Senate, and three times in the other body prior \nto my coming to the Senate, two times in the State House and once in \nthe State Senate. In all of those years, not once have I ever met a \ncreature like this, a bill that is not a bill, but call it a bill; and \nwe deem that it is passed in the House and the Senate.\n  What is fatal is that this bill is not constitutional, in my \njudgment.\n  Anyone who reads the plain language contained in the first and \nseventh sections of article I of the Constitution will see this to be \ntrue. For those who I suggest are attending a matinee and who arrived \nlate on the scene, let me read again. Read the words, those two \nsections and one will see why this measure violates the supreme law of \nthe land.\n  Article I, section 1, states:\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  So there are 25 words that state where legislative power under the \nConstitution will vest. It will vest in a Congress of the United States \nwhich shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives. All \nlegislative power will repose in this branch, this legislative branch.\n  With those 25 words, the very first sentence of the Constitution, the \nFounding Fathers established the doctrine of separation of powers.\n  We find in section after section, article after article, paragraph \nafter paragraph, following on that first section of the first article \nthe doctrine of separation of powers laid out in great detail.\n  They explicitly placed all legislative powers in a Congress. The \npower to fashion the laws that guide this Nation, the power to repeal \nthose laws as we see fit, and the power to amend a bill as it makes its \nway through the two Houses of Congress, those powers reside here in the \nCongress. The Constitution does not confer those powers upon any other \nindividual, or upon any other branch of government.\n  The President is not licensed by those powers, by those words, to \nlegislate.\n  All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress \nof the United States which shall consist of a House and a Senate and a \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The Constitution does not confer those powers upon any other \nindividual, upon the President, upon any enrolling clerk, or upon any \nother branch of government. The President is not licensed by those \npowers to legislate. He alone cannot pass a bill. The President alone \ncannot repeal a bill. The President alone cannot amend a bill. Only the \nCongress has such power.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, and the able \nSenator from Michigan, that under this bill things will have changed.\n  Under this amendment, the President would be given legislative power. \nDo you believe that? He will have been given legislative power. Now, if \nI hope to get an amendment added to the bill, I send to the desk an \namendment, the clerk reads the amendment, and the question is then on \nthe amendment by the Senator from West Virginia. If the Members of the \nSenate, or the majority thereof, support my amendment, it is added to \nthe bill. That is not enough. That amendment has to be agreed to in \n[[Page S4233]] the other body. So I cannot amend a bill; I can only be \nan instrument in the amending of it. I alone cannot amend a bill. It \nrequires a majority of both Houses to support the instrument which I \nsend to the desk in the form of an amendment.\n  But under this amendment which Mr. Dole has introduced, and which is \ncosponsored by several Republican Senators, the President alone can--by \nhis hand alone--repeal a bill. Here is a section of the bill that is \nsent to the President by the enrolling clerk. Here is another section \nof the bill. Here is another item of the bill sent down by the \nenrolling clerk. The President may, by his wet veto pen, strike that \none. He has amended that bill by his veto pen. He may strike that one. \nThat is a whole section. He amended that bill--one man alone. And if \ntwo-thirds of both Houses do not override him, then he has altered that \nbill; he has amended it just as surely as I would have amended the bill \nby sending a piece of paper to the desk, having a number on it and \nstriking from the bill that particular section. One man will have the \npower that only a majority of both Houses on the hill here could have \nin amending a bill.\n  So he will have been given the power, unilaterally and selectively, \nto change what had previously been passed by the legislative branch. \nThrough a separate enrollment procedure, the President becomes the \nlegislative equal with the House and Senate, because he would have the \npower to amend. No longer would the Congress be the sole legislative \nbody in our tripartite system. That is why this bill implicitly \nvitiates the separation of powers, because it hands to the executive \nbranch one of the most important characteristics of legislative power.\n  The ability to amend legislation, and the right of extended debate, \nare the two most important features that set the U.S. Senate apart from \nevery other legislative body in the world. This is the only upper \nChamber that has essentially unlimited amendment and debating powers. \nWith very few exceptions, which we ourselves have instituted, the \nSenate can take any bill passed by the House of Representatives and \nchange that bill any way the Members think necessary and proper. But \nunder the process contained in this bill--I will call it a bill; it is \na substitute bill introduced by the majority leader--under the process \ncontained in this bill, the President would share that power. If he \nwere to veto even one of the thousands of bills created as a result of \nseparate enrollment, he would have altered the original bill agreed to \nby the House and Senate. And that original bill, may I say to the \nSenator from Nebraska, that original bill, may I say to the Senator \nfrom Michigan--if the amendment stricken by the President had been \nstricken by the Senate or by the House, the bill may never have passed, \nbecause it would have been altered. Yet, the President can do that if \nthe substitute bill is agreed to. He would not have vetoed the entire \nbill; he will have altered the bill. He would have vetoed only a \nportion of it, thereby amending the underlying bill.\n  How does that situation square with the words in article I, section 1 \nof the Constitution, that ``all legislative powers'' herein granted \n``shall be vested in the Congress of the United States.'' The ability \nto amend is a legislative power, and all legislative powers are to be \nvested in the Congress of the United States. How, then, can anyone \nstand here and say they see no infraction of the clear mandate \ncontained in the Constitution? How can it be claimed that a President \nwho can amend has not been given legislative power?\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, in its landmark ruling in the 1952 case of \nYoungstown Sheet and Tube Company versus Sawyer, the steel seizure \ncase, spoke to the argument perfectly. The Court said:\n\n       In the framework of our Constitution, the President's power \n     to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea \n     that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his \n     functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of \n     laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. \n     And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about \n     who shall make laws which the President is to execute.\n\n  Mr. President, recommending laws and vetoing laws are the only two \nlawmaking functions that constitutionally confer to the President, \naccording to the Supreme Court. They did not include the power to \namend. They did not say the President is authorized to selectively \namend what has previously been passed by the Congress. All the \nConstitution allows, as interpreted by the Court, is the vetoing of \nlaws.\n  In addition, this question of procedure, as it pertains to the \nseparation of powers, is hardly academic. It goes to the very heart of \nour constitutional form of government. Again, I refer my colleagues to \nthe words of the Supreme Court. In its 1982 ruling in INS versus \nChadha, the Court noted that:\n\n       Explicit and unambiguous provisions of the Constitution \n     prescribe and define the respective functions of the Congress \n     and of the Executive in the legislative process.\n\n  Those provisions, the Court said, ``. . . are integral parts of the \nconstitutional design for the separation of powers.'' Thus,\n\n       It emerges clearly that the prescription for legislative \n     action in Article I, sections 1,7, represents the Framers' \n     decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government \n     be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and \n     exhaustively considered, procedure.\n\n  But in no way would this new process coincide with the ``single, \nfinely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure'' contained in \narticle I.\n  Separated powers, and the system of checks and balances that maintain \nthe separation, were not an abstract or fleeting concept to the men who \nframed our Constitution in Philadelphia. The doctrine is writ large \nthroughout the entire document. It is fused into every article, every \nsection, and nearly every clause of that great charter. One need only \nread the Constitution to understand how fervently our Founding Fathers \nembraced separated powers. But with this measure, we say those ideals \nare not really important, that they do not matter. I am not prepared, \nas others may be, to declare myself so wise as to be willing to undo \nwhat was so finely done more than 200 years ago.\n  As such, all Senators effectively lose the power of their vote. We \nwould be creating a glut of little ``its''--note that in the \nConstitution it refers to ``it,'' ``it,'' ``it''--the pronoun with the \nantecedent ``bill.'' ``It.'' There is not going to be any ``it'' with \nan appropriation bill that passes if this amendment by Mr. Dole is ever \nadopted. There will be hundreds and hundreds of little ``its.'' Read \nthe bill. Read it and see how each of us gives up the right to vote on \nany of the new bills.\n  We will not have voted on a single one of them. Not one of the bills \nthat goes to the President will have been voted on by Mr. Levin. Not \none. This amendment by Mr. Dole does not say where the original bill \nwill be kept. Nobody knows what happens to it.\n  The enrolling clerk in the House presumably can just throw it in the \nwastebasket.\n  Read the bill. Read it and see how each and every one of us gives up \nthe right to vote on any of the new bills.\n  Mr. President, what this charade amounts to is a colossal non \nsequitur. It simply does not make sense. On the one hand, we are being \ntold that a bill is a bill, which means the President can veto it. On \nthe other hand, though, the sponsors turn right around and claim that a \nbill is not necessarily a bill--it can be ``deemed'' to be a bill--so \nit does not need to be passed by the House and Senate. Which is it? \nWhen does a bill become a bill? How can the sponsors of this \nlegislation tell us that any of those new bills are not really a bill? \nHow can they claim that the process created under separate enrollment \nis a constitutional process? They cannot.\n  Even the authors of this legislative sorcery agree that, on its own, \nthe separate enrollment process cannot meet the test of \nconstitutionality. Again, I implore Senators to read this measure which \nis now pending before the Senate. Read section 4(b), starting on page \n4, line 8. It says, and I quote:\n\n       A measure enrolled pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection \n     (a) with respect to an item shall be deemed to be a bill \n     under Clauses 2 and 3 of Section 7 of Article 1 of the \n     Constitution of the United States and shall be signed by the \n     Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, or \n     their designees, and presented to the President for approval \n     or disapproval (and otherwise treated for all purposes) in \n     the manner provided for bills and joint resolutions \n     generally.\n\n  So here, Mr. President, we have a clear acknowledgement, an absolute \ndeclaration from the very people who \n[[Page S4234]] wrote this bill that the process that they want to \ncodify is unconstitutional. They are not talking about bills. They are \ntalking about counterfeit measures that are deemed to be bills.\n  So this is an absolute declaration from the very people who wrote the \nbill that the process they want to codify is unconstitutional, that it \ndoes not meet the standard set up under article I of the Constitution.\n  The authors say, right there in that passage, that ``a measure \nenrolled pursuant to paragraph (1),'' which means taken out and \nseparately enrolled, ``shall be deemed to be a bill.''\n  Now, what does the dictionary say that ``deem'' means? Deem means to \nconsider--considered to be a bill; to be considered. We will just \npretend that it is a bill, may be thought of as a bill, but when you \nstrip all that language away, it is not a bill. If it were a bill, it \nwould not say it may be ``deemed'' to be a bill.\n  The authors say right there that ``a measure enrolled pursuant to \nparagraph (1),'' which means taken out and separately enrolled, ``shall \nbe deemed to be a bill'' for purposes of the Constitution.\n  So how can any of my constituents hold me responsible for the \nenactment of any one of these little billettes, these little \nillegitimate offspring of unknown parents? How can anyone hold me \nresponsible for having voted for them, those thousands of new little \n``its'' that were created through the separate enrollment process, that \nare going to be ``deemed'' to be bills? What the sponsors are admitting \nin that language is that those new bills are not, in fact, really \nbills. They readily concede, right there in their own legislation, and \nin their own words, that all those new little ``its'' are not bills.\n  If a piece of legislation that comes about as a result of being \nseparately enrolled is an actual bill, then why is it necessary to have \nit ``deemed'' to be a bill. The answer is that the deeming is required \nbecause none of those mini-bills are, in reality, legal, \nconstitutionally enacted bills. And the authors of this measure know \nthat fact.\n  I can assure my colleagues that none of this is some misguided \nconclusion arrived at as a result of applying a radical new \ninterpretation to the Constitution. This is not judicial logic gone \nawry. Quite the opposite. It is the considered judgement of renowned \nscholars that a separate enrollment procedure is unconstitutional on \nthe grounds that it violates the presentment clause as written in \nArticle I, section 7, clause 2.\n  The truly sad fact in all of this, is that we do not need to proceed \nalong these lines. We do not need to trample on the Constitution to \naccomplish what is intended. We have an alternative option, which \neveryone agrees is constitutional. The bill originally introduced by \nSenators Domenici and Exon, S. 14, would accomplish the goal of \nguaranteeing the President a vote on his rescission proposals. And, \nmost importantly, it would do it through a process which does not \nsacrifice to the alter of political expediency the sacred tenets \ncontained in the United States Constitution.\n  S. 14 would have allowed the President to go through any \nappropriations bill and any tax bill containing targeted tax \nexpenditures and excise those items he felt were unwarranted. The \nCongress would then have been forced to vote on each of those \nproposals. It would not have created an unworkable process. It would \nhave maintained the separation of powers. It would have been \nconstitutional. But for some reason, the authors of the bill before us \ndo not want that. They are not satisfied with the procedure in S. 14. \nIn short, they are apparently not happy unless we ravage the most \nimportant constitution ever laid down in writing.\n  The procedure which is set forth in this amendment is not, in my \nopinion, in agreement with the words of the Constitution which govern \nthe passage of a bill. It is not in agreement with those words. The \nConstitution, in article I, section 7, clause 2, says that a bill shall \nhave passed both Houses before it is presented to the President. It is \ninteresting to note that those who wrote the Constitution in clause 2 \nreferred to a bill, whereas in clause 3 of section 7 of article I, they \nwrote of resolutions, orders, and votes. In other words, they covered \nthe entire legislative landscape. They knew exactly what they were \ndoing.\n  Whatever the particular vehicle--whether it be a resolution, or vote, \nor an order. Of course, orders do not go to the President for his \nsignature; votes do not go to the President for his signature; \nresolutions do not go to the President. So whatever the particular \nvehicle, it had to travel the same legislative course outlined in \nclause 2 for a bill. In other words, whatever it is, it has to be \npassed by both Houses and presented to the President. He may then sign \nit, veto it, or let it become law without his signature, or he may give \nit a pocket veto, depending on the circumstances.\n  Furthermore, nothing in the pending amendment would deal at all with \nthe more than $400 billion of lost revenue each year that results from \nexisting tax expenditures. I know Senators have heard the proponents of \nthis proposal say that it is very broad. They say it will cover \neverything--appropriation bills, direct spending bills, and bills \ncontaining tax preference items. But is that true? The answer is no.\n  All any Senator has to do is read the language of the amendment. It \nreads as follows, as it related to entitlements and targeted tax \nbenefits in section 2(b)(1) on page 2 of the amendment:\n\n       A committee of either the House or the Senate shall not \n     report an authorization measure that contains new direct \n     spending or new targeted tax benefits unless such measure \n     presents each new direct spending or new targeted tax benefit \n     as a separate item and the accompanying committee report for \n     that measure shall contain such level of detail including, if \n     appropriate, detail related to the allocation of new direct \n     spending or new targeted tax benefits.\n\n  So, there you have it. This proposal will not touch one dollar--not \none thin dime--of any existing direct spending program or any of the \n124 existing tax expenditures. Not one dollar. Not one dime. Not one \ncopper penny. The problem is, you see, that once these tax breaks are \nwritten into law, they rarely get reviewed again. And, nothing in the \namendment that is before the Senate will require that these existing \ntax breaks should be looked at and made subject to veto by the \nPresident, just like annual appropriation bills.\n  These are the tax dollars that are lost to the Federal treasury due \nto special provisions contained in the Federal Tax Code. These various \nprovisions allow deductions, exemptions, credits, or deferrals of taxes \nand, in effect, reduce the amount of tax paid by those who qualify for \nsuch items. The word ``expenditure'' is used to highlight the fact that \nthese tax preference items are, in many respects, no different than if \nthe government would write a check to the different individuals or \nbusinesses who qualify for them.\n  The plain truth is that tax expenditures are nothing more than \nanother form of government spending. Unfortunately, they receive \nlittle, if any, scrutiny because they are not subject to the annual \nauthorization or appropriation processes that other programs are \nsubjected to. Rather, once they are enacted into law, tax expenditures \nrarely ever again come under congressional scrutiny. In fact, in a June \n1994 report on this issue, the General Accounting Office found that \nalmost 85 percent of 1993 revenue losses from tax expenditures were \ntraceable to provisions enacted before 1950, while almost 50 percent of \nthose losses stem from tax expenditures enacted before 1920.\n  Because these tax breaks have largely escaped congressional review, \nmany have simply outlived their economic usefulness. But until they \ncome under the same scrutiny as other Federal spending, we will not \nknow for sure which ones should be modified or eliminated and which \nones should be kept.\n  We do know that, like entitlement spending, tax expenditures are \nprojected to grow dramatically over the next several years. In a \ncommittee print issued in December 1994 by the Senate Budget Committee \nentitled, ``Tax Expenditures, Compendium of Background Material of \nIndividual Provisions,'' the aggregate cost of these provisions will \nequal $453 billion for fiscal year 1995 and will rise each year \nthereafter to a total of $568.5 billion in fiscal year 1999.\n  The cumulative increase for those 4 years will equal $283.9 billion. \nThat level of increase dwarfs the total amount that is spent each year \non our \n[[Page S4235]] entire domestic discretionary budget which amounts to \nonly $225.5 billion for fiscal year 1995 and is not projected to grow \nat all over the next four years. In fact, to the contrary, it appears \nthat domestic discretionary spending will be called upon to suffer even \nfurther cuts below a hard freeze than are already contemplated under \nOBRA 1993.\n  When one considers that this area of the budget alone, namely, tax \nexpenditures, escapes the deficit-cutting axe that is being faced by \ndiscretionary spending and hopefully to the area of entitlement \nspending as well, it is little wonder that special interest groups find \nthese tax breaks to be very appealing.\n  I am not saying that all tax expenditures are bad. In fact, many \nserve a worthwhile public purpose. The earned income tax credit has \nbenefited many hard-working Americans by lifting them out of poverty \nand has enabled them to be able to support their families. A number of \nothers--such as those for charitable contributions, home mortgage \ninterest deduction, as well as a number of others--clearly serve a \nuseful purpose and are in the national interest. But I am convinced \nthat a number, perhaps a large number, of the more than 120 separate \ntax expenditures in current law could be either modified or eliminated \naltogether.\n  In its June 1994 report on this subject, the General Accounting \nOffice recommended that tax expenditures should be further integrated \ninto the budget in order to highlight the vast resources lost to the \nFederal Government by these tax breaks. Moreover, these expenditures \nshould have to undergo periodic program reviews within the \ncongressional tax-writing committees. One way to ensure such scrutiny \nwould be to sunset most tax expenditures, thus requiring the \nreenactment of those that are still worthwhile at regular intervals. \nBut, as I have shown, this amendment fails to do that.\n  And I am fully prepared to work with my colleagues in attempting to \nenact legislation that would improve the existing rescission process \nand would guarantee that a President's rescission proposals get \nconsidered and voted upon--just as the proposal that was authored by \nMr. Domenici and Mr. Exon would have done--and, further, that any \nsavings resulting therefrom be applied only to deficit reduction. What \nI am unwilling to do is to support any legislation that does not \nadequately guard the constitutionally granted congressional power of \nthe purse.\n  I believe that the separate enrollment measure is constitutionally \nflawed and would so encumber the existing appropriations and rescission \nprocesses as to make it impossible for Congress and the President to \nmeet their responsibilities of enacting the annual appropriation bills \nby the beginning of each fiscal year.\n  Finally, and critically important, Mr. President, this amendment will \nnot result in any deficit reduction whatsoever. None. Zilch. The reason \nthat is the case is because nothing in the amendment reduces Federal \nspending. Under this amendment, any savings that might result from \nvetoes of items in appropriation bills, or from vetoes of new direct \nspending or new tax breaks, will not go toward deficit reduction. \nInstead, those savings can simply be spent on something else. That is \nthe case because, unlike S. 14 or the Democratic alternative, which Mr. \nDaschle will present, nothing in the Dole proposal reduces the \nallocations of committees by the amount of the savings that will result \nfrom the vetoes. Incredible as it may seem, the substitute does not \napply any of these spending cuts toward reducing the deficit. The \nauthors of the proposal, therefore, have chosen to allow all spending \nreductions under their ``Separate Enrollment and Item Veto Act of \n1995'' to be respent, rather than be applied to deficit reduction.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to defeat this proposal and \nto vote for the Democratic alternative that will be presented by the \ndistinguished minority leader, which many of us will cosponsor, and \nwhich will apply all of its savings from budget cuts to deficit \nreduction.\n  I thank Senators who have patiently waited, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciated the comments of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. I have been anticipating his arrival on the floor \nto debate this issue. It is an important issue. It deserves full \ndiscussion and debate.\n  We began this latest discussion, of course, on Thursday evening of \nlast week. Senator McCain and I discussed our proposal at length and \nthen, of course, we debated on Friday and all day Monday, and now it is \nTuesday.\n  Last evening, the majority leader offered an amendment to the \noriginal proposal, offered by Senator McCain and myself, which, in this \nSenator's opinion, substantially strengthens the effort which we are \nundertaking by expanding the scope of the line-item veto to include not \njust appropriations, but targeted tax expenditures, any new direct \nspending and new spending in entitlements that change the law which \ncurrently exists. It does not mean that new enrollees are not subject \nto the benefits of entitlements as they currently exist on the books.\n But it means that if attempts are made to expand those categories and \nto provide new spending, they are also incorporated.\n\n  These were suggestions offered by Members of the Congress, in \nparticular Senator Stevens of Alaska, Senator Domenici of New Mexico. \nWe negotiated these changes. Many of these ideas originated in years \npast, some of them offered by Senators from the other party.\n  I do not intend to take a great deal of time in responding to the \ncomments of the Senator from West Virginia. However, there are several \npoints I wish to make.\n  The Senator from West Virginia began his presentation by citing--and \nI believe I am correctly quoting him--the ``frenetic efforts of \nRepublicans'' to bring a measure to the floor. Yes, there was \nconsiderable negotiation, but it is negotiation upon a core and a base \nof discussion around a concept which has been very much a part of the \nhistory of this body.\n  Recent history, of course, in the last decade or so has shown that a \nnumber of attempts have been made to bring line-item veto to a vote in \nthis body. All of them have been unsuccessful. There have been a number \nof votes, all falling short of the necessary votes to either waive \nprovisions of the Budget Act or to break an attempted filibuster of the \neffort.\n  So we have not been able to achieve 60 votes to bring the matter to \nfull debate and vote. But the concept of separate enrollment has been \ndiscussed before on this floor at length and voted on, at least in a \nprocedural way. The underlying concepts of either enhanced rescission \nor a process described as line-item veto or a discussion of line-item \nveto, all of this has been very much a part of the debate and \ndiscussion that has been present on this floor during the past decade. \nBut the concept of line-item veto goes back historically much further \nthan that.\n  In fact, it was in 1876 that then Representative Charles Faulkner of \nWest Virginia introduced for the first time the line-item veto concept. \nIt was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary where it there died, \nand since that time about 200 line-item veto bills have been \nintroduced. In fact, in nearly every succeeding Congress a proposal has \nbeen offered in varying forms but all centered around the same basic \npremise, and that is will this legislative body cede to the President \nsome semblance of authority to provide a check and balance against the \nspending power exercised by this body.\n  Now, as the Senator from West Virginia has enumerated, we are all \nwell aware of the provisions of the Constitution article I, section 7, \nwhich outlines the procedures by which the legislature passes \nlegislation and by which the President approves it. And of course, \narticle I, section 7 clearly grants to the President the power to \nreject what the Congress has proffered to him, or perhaps return is a \nbetter word. It says that ``If any bill shall not be returned by the \nPresident within 10 days after it shall have been presented to him, the \nsame shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it.''\n  But it also says that the President may ask this body to reconsider \nwhat it has done and send back to us bills that we have forwarded to \nhim and it will require two-thirds vote of each body, both the House \nand the Senate, \n[[Page S4236]] in order to overturn what the President has done.\n  So the constitutional authority for the President to veto or reject \nor return, however you want to phrase it, what this legislature has \npresented is obviously well established as a part of the Constitution. \nBut the separate question is do we want to go one step further in \nallowing the President the right within the legislation sent to him to \nline item items back to this legislature, to look at the legislation \nthat we send to him and give the President the opportunity to say I \nwill accept this portion but not that portion. I will accept most of \nwhat you sent but I want you to reconsider that separate portion.\n  That really is the question before us. As I said, there have been \nnearly 200 attempts to do that. Most of those have died in committee. \nVery few have been reported, and those that have were mostly reported \nwith adverse recommendations.\n  Our Founding Fathers discussed this issue. They were concerned about \nthe balance of power between the respective branches. That is why I \nbelieve they wrote the veto power in the Constitution to the President. \nBut they were concerned about the unchecked power, the unbalanced power \nof the legislative branch over the executive branch. In the Federalist \nPaper No. 73, it was Hamilton who had this to say about the executive \nveto.\n\n       The first thing that offers itself to our observation is \n     the qualified negative of the President upon the acts or \n     resolutions of the two houses of the legislature; or, in \n     other words, his power of returning all bills with objections \n     to have the effect of preventing their becoming laws, unless \n     they should afterwards be ratified by the two thirds of each \n     of the component members of the legislative body.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield? Will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. COATS. I would like to be able to give my statement and then I \nwill be happy at the end of that to yield. I know the Senator would \nhave many questions. I do not want to spend an excessive amount of time \nbecause there are other Senators waiting to speak. If I could go \nthrough my statement and then address the question, I would prefer to \ndo that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Mr. COATS. Presidents throughout our history have asked for the line-\nitem veto. It goes all the way back to Ulysses Grant. It was President \nTruman who said:\n\n       One important lack in the Presidential veto power, I \n     believe, is the authority to veto individual items in \n     appropriations bills. The President must approve the bill in \n     its entirety or refuse to approve it or let it become law \n     without his approval.\n\n  He later went on to say that it was a form of ``legislative \nblackmail''--those are his words, legislative blackmail--when the \nlegislature sends to him a bill it otherwise knows needs to be approved \nby the President or else the Government will cease to function or else \nimportant appropriations for the provision of our national defense or \nfor the meeting of national emergency will have to be vetoed by the \nPresident or accepted in whole even though it contains items which the \nexecutive feels are not in the national interest and bear no \nrelationship to the legislation that is sent to him.\n  It is that practice that brings us to this point. It is the practice \nof a Congress which has discovered that under the powers granted to it \nby the Constitution rests and resides what I would term as an abusive \npower, a power that does not go toward meeting the needs embodied in \nthe original appropriation or the original bill that is sent to the \nPresident but which goes toward placating or pleasing an individual \nparochial interest and is attached even though it is totally irrelevant \nto the purpose for the original appropriation, attached because, as \nPresident Truman said, we can hold this over the President's head \nknowing that he needs this particular expenditure in order to meet a \npressing national need and his choice is limited to accepting the whole \nor rejecting the whole.\n  It was in 1974 that this Congress stripped the President of his \nexecutive power that was being exercised to impound funds, the power \nthat was exercised routinely from every President from Thomas Jefferson \nto Richard Nixon. In fact, it was Jefferson who first employed the \npower to refuse to spend appropriated funds in 1801 when he impounded \n$50,000 that was appropriated for Navy gunboats. And it is the \nparticularly egregious practice, in this Senator's opinion, of loading \nup otherwise necessary appropriations with items that are deemed \nunnecessary, that necessitates, through line-item veto power, a check \nand balance for the President, a restoration of the check and balance \npower that allows someone--in this case the Executive--to put a \nquestion mark on what we have done and to say, ``If you really believe \nthat is a necessary item, you have the constitutional power to override \nmy objection by a two-thirds vote.''\n  What that does is it sheds the light of public exposure, public \ndebate, and individual vote--an individual yea or nay on a particular \nitem--so our constituents, those we represent, have the ability to \nexamine how we have handled their tax dollars so that they can hold us \naccountable, either favorably or unfavorably, for our actions, not on a \nmassive bill as a whole but on an individual item.\n  No longer will we be allowed the excuse of saying, ``Yes, I voted for \nthat particular measure, not because it contained the items you object \nto, but because it had such a pressing national interest that it \noverrode the specific objections.''\n  Our constituents say, ``But why did you not protest that particular \nitem?'' Frequently we find that particular item was buried deep within \na bill that was rushed to the floor to meet some national emergency or \nwas added in conference and brought back in a way that, under our \nrules, is not amendable.\n  So what we are attempting to do with this process, with this concept \nof separate enrollment, what we are attempting to do is to provide the \nPresident with presentations from the legislature which are specified, \nitem by item by item, which the President with his able staff and with \nthe resources at their disposal can easily examine. They can look at \nthese items which do not comport with the thrust of the legislation \npresented and send them back here for our review and, if we so choose, \nour overriding that particular veto.\n  As opposed to the statement that the Senator from West Virginia made \nabout his fight to save the constitutional system, I would argue that \nline-item veto is a fight to save the constitutional system, it is a \nfight that honors what the Framers of our Constitution and what our \nFounding Fathers attempted to achieve: a system of checks and balances. \nIt is difficult for this Senator to believe that the Founding Fathers \nof this country, the Framers of the Constitution, intended that we \nwould present the Executive with a continuing resolution embodying \nevery penny of spending for this entire Federal Government and place it \non the desk of the President at the end of a session--sometimes it is \nafter we have adjourned that it arrives at his desk, although we are \nstill here in pro forma to finalize the formal adjournment--and say, \n``Mr. President, take it or leave it. The entire budget of the United \nStates of America sits on your desk in one piece and your choice is to \ntake it all or reject it all.''\n  I would claim that is an abuse of the spending power, an abuse of the \npower of the purse, an abuse of the Constitution, an abuse of what the \nFounding Fathers intended as the way that body should act--act \nresponsibly.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has said that when all is finally said \nand done, when we take Public Law 103-316, Making Appropriations for \nEnergy and Water Development for the Fiscal Year Ending September 30, \n1995, and for other purposes--that all we send to the President is this \nnice, neat little several-page piece of legislation. And that is a much \nneater process than sending to the President the stack of separately \nenrolled bills. In one sense it is, because it is much easier to read \nthrough this small, little booklet than it is to peruse through that \nstack of bills.\n  But what we have here and what we present to the President is \nsomething that is so general that it is very difficult to itemize out \nall that it accomplishes. It is a very neat way for Members to say, ``I \ndid not know what was in the final product.''\n  Under title I of this particular act that I am reading, it \nappropriates, in \n[[Page S4237]] one section here, ``$181,199,000 to remain available \nuntil expended, of which funds are provided for the following \nprojects,'' in the amounts specified. And then it lists about 10 \nprojects. But that $181 million actually goes to fund an additional 326 \nprojects. So, when the President looks at this, it is extremely \ndifficult to determine which items are going to receive the specific \nexpenditures and which ones are not. Of course, it is impossible for \nhim to examine the legislation and come to the conclusion that there \nare portions of this that should not be spent because he is forced to \naccept the entirety or reject the entirety. He has no power, no \nauthority, granted to him to send back items that he does not deem \nnecessary.\n  The Senator from West Virginia talked about the process as a cut-and-\npaste operation, conducted in the wee hours of the night with clerks \nassigned from perhaps the Government Printing Office helping enroll the \nseparate bills. That is the way it used to be done. That is the way, I \nwould say to the Senator from West Virginia, that enrollment of \nlegislation used to be conducted.\n  It would be a mechanical problem--not an insurmountable one but a \nmechanical problem--as we used to do it. But we do not do it that way \nanymore. Modern computer technology has arrived in the Senate and \narrived at the House.\n  I spent some time with the enrolling clerk asking him how he now goes \nabout this process. He said, ``Well, it is very easy.'' He showed me a \ncomputer sitting on his desk about this wide and about that high. He \nshowed me a software package which is called XyWrite, and he said, ``We \nnow do in a matter of minutes what used to take us hours, and we now do \nin a matter of a few hours what used to take days.'' He said, ``While I \nhave authority to bring over people from the Government Printing \nOffice, I never have to call them anymore because the miracle of modern \ntechnology allows us to separately enroll items literally with a push \nof a few buttons. What used to take dozens if not hundreds of hours now \ncan be done literally in minutes.''\n  So it is not a mechanical problem. It is something that is easily \nprocessed and easily handled by the enrollment clerk. The House clerk \nhas the same technology as the Senate.\n  The question of do we cede power to the enrolling clerk I do not \nbelieve is valid any longer either because, as the enrolling clerk \nexplained to me, he does not have the authority. It is not vested in \nhim to make a determination as to what should be enrolled or what \nshould not be enrolled. It is the purview of the appropriators or those \nwho write the bill to define the items of expenditures in those bills. \nAnd the power of the enrolling clerk only goes to enrolling that \nparticular separate item. To the extent that we are sloppy in our \nefforts, that would raise a question as to what ought to be enrolled. \nBut I am confident that, if we understand that each item in a \nparticular appropriation or a tax bill or other item of legislation is \ngoing to be separately enrolled, we will make sure it is separately \nenumerated in the legislation that we send down to the enrolling clerk. \nAny ambiguity relative to a question mark on enrollment can easily be \nresolved by our own efforts.\n  As Senators know, the expansion of this legislation incorporates \ntargeted tax expenditures. The Senator from West Virginia is absolutely \nright when he cites that the problem and the dimension of the problem \nthat we face does not fall solely on the shoulders of the \nappropriations process to the discretionary account. In fact, I believe \nit is less than 20 percent of the budget. In recognition of that, part \nof the process in negotiating the amendment that was offered by the \nmajority leader was to expand the scope of the veto power of the \nPresident, individual item veto power of the President, to incorporate \nnew spending, new spending in the entitlement functions, targeted tax \nspending where specific tax--what I call tax pork--is incorporated in \ntax legislation which goes not to serve a broad interest or a broad \nclassification like charitable deductions, like mortgage interest \ndeductions, items that the Senator from West Virginia mentioned, but go \nto please or to satisfy a particular narrow interest, an individual \ninterest or a specific interest within a class rather than to the class \nitself. That is defined in this bill. That will now be brought into \nthis bill.\n  That is an idea that was brought forward by the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Senator Bradley, who offered that last year on this \nfloor. So we have incorporated that idea. It is a good idea. It \nimmeasurably improves and expands the scope of the line-item veto. And \nwe have added expenditures which would be added under the category of \nnew expenditures to entitlement programs. It does not change the law \nrelative to entitlement programs--as to who is eligible and what \nbenefits they are eligible for. But, if this Congress changes the \nbenefits provided under the entitlement and expands those and that \nresults in increased expenditure, that too would be subject to the \nPresident's veto. So we have expanded it far beyond the original \nprovisions of just applying it to the appropriations process.\n  I would like to conclude by making some points on the constitutional \nquestion because that is a valid question and one which I believe \nMembers need to address.\n  Under article I, section 5, each House of Congress has unilateral \nauthority to make and amend rules governing its procedures. Separate \nenrollment speaks to the question of what constitutes a bill. It does \nnothing to erode the prerogatives of the President as that bill is \npresented. Under the rulemaking clause, our procedures for defining and \nenrolling a bill is ours to determine alone.\n  There is precedent provided in House rule 49, the Gephardt rule. \nUnder this rule the House clerk is instructed to prepare a joint \nresolution raising the debt ceiling when Congress adopts a concurrent \nbudget resolution which exceeds the statutory debt limit. The House is \ndeemed to have voted on and passed a resolution on the debt ceiling \nwhen the vote occurs on the concurrent resolution. Despite the fact \nthat a vote is never taken, the House is deemed to have passed it.\n  The American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service \nanalyzed separate enrollment legislation and indicated the following:\n\n       Evident, it would appear to be, that simply to authorize \n     the President to pick and choose among provisions of the same \n     bill would be to contravene this procedure. In separate \n     enrollment, however, a different tack was chosen. Separate \n     bills drawn out of a single original bill are forwarded to \n     the President. In this fashion, he may pick and choose. \n     Formal provisions of the presentation clause would seem to be \n     observed by this device.\n\n  Laurence Tribe, who is a distinguished constitutional professor of \nlaw, who is frequently quoted on the Senate floor more often by \nDemocrats than Republicans, but nevertheless is a respected \nconstitutional scholar, has also observed that this measure is \nconstitutional. He recently wrote, and I quote:\n\n       The most promising line-item veto idea by far is that \n     Congress itself begin to treat each appropriation and each \n     tax measure as an individual bill to be presented separately \n     to the President for his signature or veto. Such a change \n     could be effected simply and with no real constitutional \n     difficulty by a temporary alteration in the congressional \n     rules regarding the enrolling and presentment of bills.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Courts construing the rules clause of article I, section 5, \n     have interpreted it in expansive terms, and I have little \n     doubt that the sort of individual presentment envisioned by \n     such a rules change would fall within Congress' broad \n     authority.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, during his \ntenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote extensive \nadditional views in a committee report on a constitutional line-item \nveto. He wrote about a separate enrollment substitute which he offered. \nAnd I quote from Senator Biden.\n\n       Under the separate enrollment process instituted by the \n     statutory line-item veto, the items of appropriation \n     presented to the President would not be passed according to \n     routine lawmaking procedures. Congress would vote on the \n     original appropriations bill but would not vote again on the \n     separately enrolled bills presented to the President.\n      And the absence of a second vote on the individual items of \n     appropriation has raised questions of constitutionality. \n     For the following reasons, such concerns are unfounded:\n       One, this does not change congressional authority. Each \n     House of Congress has the power to make and amend the rules \n     governing its internal procedures. And, of course, \n     [[Page S4238]] Congress has complete control over the content \n     of the legislation that passes. Thus, the decisions to \n     initiate the process of separate enrollment to terminate the \n     process through passage of a subsequent statute, to pass a \n     given appropriations bill and to establish the sections and \n     paragraphs of that bill, are all fully within Congress' \n     discretion and control.\n\n  That is exactly the process which is presented in Senator Dole's \namendment. We, the Congress, have complete control over the content of \nthe legislation we pass. Thus, the decisions to initiate the process of \nseparate enrollment, or to terminate that process through passage of a \nsubsequent statute, or by a sunset provision, which this Dole amendment \ncontains, and to establish the sections and paragraphs of the bill, \nwhich we have the authority and the power to do, all are fully within \nour control and discretion.\n  Quoting again from Senator Biden:\n\n       A requirement that Congress again pass each separately \n     enrolled item would only be a formal refinement, not a \n     substantive one. It would not prevent power from being \n     shifted from Congress to the President, because under the \n     statutory line-item veto, Congress will retain the full \n     extent of the legislative power. Nor would it serve to shield \n     Congress from the process of separate enrollment, because \n     Congress will retain the discretion to terminate the process.\n\n  If we pass the whole, surely we pass the parts. How can we argue that \nhaving passed an appropriation bill that covers spending for certain \nfunctions of Government--let us say the Commerce Department--it does \nnot incorporate the separate items of spending listed within that bill? \nTo argue otherwise is to say that Congress, in passing the whole, does \nnot pass the separate items. And it seems to me that a more legitimate \nprocess--if you are concerned with that question--is to separately \nenroll the items. Then there is no doubt that we have passed those \nseparate items. So passing the whole incorporates the parts.\n  Senator Biden said:\n\n       The second reason why he believes the constitutional \n     concerns are unfounded relates to House rule 49, the \n     statutory limit on public debt.\n\n  I will refer to that later.\n\n       Rule 49 of the House of Representatives empowers the \n     enrolling clerk of the House to prepare a joint resolution \n     raising the debt ceiling, when Congress adopts a concurrent \n     resolution on the budget, exceeding the statutory limit on \n     the public debt. This procedure, which has been in existence \n     since 1979, provides a clear precedent for the separate \n     enrollment of items of appropriation. The House never votes \n     on the joint resolution. Nonetheless, the House is deemed to \n     have voted on the resolution because of its vote on the \n     concurrent resolution. House rule 49 states, in part:\n       The vote by which the conference report and the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget was agreed to in the House shall be \n     deemed to have been a vote in favor of such joint resolution \n     upon final passage in the House of Representatives. The \n     committee report continued to elaborate on that by saying \n     House rule 49 has not been found unconstitutional because of \n     its modification of routine rulemaking procedures. It is \n     transmitted to the Senate for further action and presented to \n     the President for signature.\n\n  This process has been in effect for a decade. Despite the absence of \na separate vote by the House on the joint resolution, there have been \nno constitutional challenges.\n  The American law division has supplied me with a number of cases \nwhich further elaborate these points. In United States versus Balan, \ndecided in 1892, the Court articulated the power of the Congress to \ndetermine its rules of proceeding. It said:\n\n       The Constitution empowers each House to determine its rules \n     of proceedings.\n\n  That is the Court speaking.\n\n       It may not by its rules ignore the constitutional \n     constraints or violate fundamental rights, and there should \n     be a reasonable relation between the mode or method of \n     proceeding established by the rule and the result which is \n     sought to be attained. But within these limitations, all \n     manners of method are open to the determination of the House, \n     and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some other \n     way would be better, more accurate, or even more just. It is \n     no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one \n     has been prescribed and enforced for a length of time. The \n     power to make rules is not one which, once exercised, is \n     exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be \n     exercised by the House and within the limitations suggested, \n     absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body or \n     tribunal.\n\n  So is that not what we are doing? Are we not exercising that \ncontinuous power articulated by the Court to make our rules? Once \nexercised, that power is not exhausted, as the Court said. It is always \nsubject to be exercised. In this case, the Court was referring to an \naction by the House. Obviously, it could apply to the Senate equally.\n  So it is not impeachment of the rule to say that some other way would \nbe better, more accurate, or even more just. Who is to say that this \nmethod is not more accurate? I believe it is more accurate. It is \ncertainly more accurate than the 10- or 12-page bill presented to the \nPresident for his signature, which does not begin to enumerate the \nactions of this body. You can pore through this and not begin to \nunderstand how the taxpayer' dollars are going to be spent. But if we \nseparately enroll, every Member of this Congress will have at his or \nher disposal, immediately, exactly how dollars are spent, exactly how \nprojects are funded and which projects they are. They will be able to \npull pieces of paper out and say, ``I do not think this is the way we \nought to deal with the taxpayer's expenditures.'' And the light of day \nwill be shed on our actions. I think that is a more accurate and a more \njust way of being held accountable to the very people that send us here \nto deal with the allocation of their hard-earned dollars.\n  Killian asks:\n\n       Within this capacious concept, what provision of the \n     Constitution would the ``deeming'' provision violate? We \n     certainly cannot point to any fundamental right that is \n     abridged. The constitutional constraint that is applicable is \n     the first section of article I, which sets a bicameral \n     requirement for the exercise of lawmaking. But Congress in \n     the proposal does not disregard the bicameralism mandate. A \n     bill in identical form has passed both Houses. Then, a \n     functionary, the enrolling clerk, follows instructions \n     embodied in the rules and separates out of this bill a series \n     of sections identical to the sections contained in the larger \n     bill and enrolls these sections into separate bills; these \n     bills are signed by the Speaker of the House and the \n     President of the Senate, and these bills are then presented \n     to the President for his signatures or his vetoes.\n       One can readily see that the question is much more narrow \n     than the mere issue whether Congress can pass a law that has \n     not cleared both Houses in an identical version. The \n     separately enrolled bills, taken together, are identical to \n     that initial bill. If Congress should conclude that this two-\n     step process comports with the constitutional requirement of \n     bicameral passage of a legislative measure, in what way has a \n     constitutional restraint been breached?\n       The issue of validity could also be influenced in \n     determination by two other factors. That is, first, Congress \n     is not seeking to aggrandize itself or to infringe on the \n     powers of another branch . . . second . . . it must be \n     observed that these rules are entirely an internal matter, \n     subject to alteration by simple resolution at any time in \n     either House. There is no irrevocable conveying away.\n       2. There is some question about whether the judiciary will \n     review this case at all. There is some precedent to indicate \n     that the judiciary may construe separate enrollment as a \n     political question unsuited for judicial review.\n       Marshall Field v. Clark (143 US 649 (1892):\n       The signing by the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and by the President of the Senate, in open session, of an \n     enrolled bill, is an official attestation by the two House of \n     such bill as one that has passed Congress. It is a \n     declaration by the two Houses, through their presiding \n     officers, to be President, that a bill, thus attested, has \n     received, in due form, the sanction of the legislative branch \n     of the Government, and that it is delivered to him in \n     obedience to the constitutional requirement that all bills \n     which pass Congress shall be presented to him. And when a \n     bill, thus attested, receives his approval, and is deposited \n     in the public archives, its authentication as a bill that has \n     passed Congress should be deemed complete and unimpeachable. \n     . . . The respect due to coequal and independent departments \n     requires the judicial department to act upon that assurance, \n     and to accept, as having passed Congress, all bills \n     authenticated in the manner stated leaving the courts to \n     determine, when the question properly arises, whether the \n     act, so authenticated, is in conformity with the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Judith Best, a distinguished political scientist summed up these \narguments well. She said:\n\n       Under article I, section 5, Congress possesses the power to \n     define a bill. Congress certainly believes that it possesses \n     this power since it and it alone has been doing so since the \n     first bill was presented to the first President in the first \n     Congress. . . . The definition of a bill is a political \n     question and not justiciable. ``Prominent on the surface of \n     any case held to involve a political question is found a \n     textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue \n     to a coordinate political department. (Baker v. Carr, 369 US \n     186 (1962)) A ``textually demonstrable constitutional \n     commitment'' of the issue to \n     [[Page S4239]] the legislature is found in Each House \n     determine the Rules of its Proceedings. If Congress may \n     define as a bill a package of distinct programs and unrelated \n     items, it can define distinct programs and unrelated items to \n     be separate bills. Either Congress has the right to define a \n     bill or it does not. Either this proposal is constitutional \n     or the recent practice of Congress in forming omnibus bills \n     containing unrelated programs and ungermane items is \n     constitutionally challengeable.\n\n  Mr. President, despite the best efforts of those who oppose line-item \nveto in any form to characterize this bill as unconstitutional, I am \nconfident that separate enrollment clearly passes the constitutional \nhurdle. Both conservative and liberal constitutional scholars agree; \nthe American Law Division of CRS and the former chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee have spoken clearly to its constitutionality.\n  If I thought that we would win the votes of those who are committed \nto kill the statutory line-item veto by passing a constitutional \namendment, I would offer that amendment. However, I strongly suspect \nthat the very same Senators who are raising constitutional concerns \nwould fight just as hard against granting the President line-item veto \nauthority through a constitutional amendment. The real issue at hand is \nnot constitutionality, but Congress' willingness to change.\n  Mr. President, let me state that the real reason we are here is that \nthis body, this Congress, this legislature, has been unable to \nresponsibly exercise the authority and power given to them on behalf of \nthe people of the United States, or a reasonable exercise of expending \nthe money, which we require them to send to the Federal Government.\n  In 1994 we spent an average of $811.7 million a day on interest \npayments. That is $33.8 million an hour, $564,000 a minute. Those \ninterest payments are due because this Congress did not have the \ncourage or the will to go before the taxpayer and demand payment up \nfront at the time of expenditure for items which it passed. And we \nhave, over the past 20 years, and I point the finger of blame at every \nMember of this body, including myself--we have seen the national debt \nincrease in the last 15 years from under a trillion dollars to nearly \n$5 trillion, a more than 500 percent increase.\n  Because we have not had the courage to go to the public and say, ``If \nwe are going to pass this program, which is pleasing to many, we are \ngoing to have to ask you to pay for it as the money is expended.'' And \nwe have, in the process, passed on to future generations a staggering \ndebt burden which, as the Congressional Budget Office has enumerated, \nadds a crushing debt load which will provide a stagnant standard of \nliving for future generations, which will place a burden on them that \nwe have not had placed on our own shoulders.\n  I believe what we have done borders on or, if not, is outright \nimmoral. I am not the first person to say that. Distinguished Americans \nhave said that. They have warned about that, and now they have observed \nus doing it. It is grossly unfair for us to enjoy the fruits and the \nblessings of this country without having to pay for them. A lesson that \neach of us tries to teach our children has been ignored by this \nCongress, and that is that debt will ultimately crush you. It will \nultimately destroy your hopes and your dreams.\n  Those items that we have deemed part of the American dream, at least \nthat are part of the vision and dreams for most of us--owning our own \nhome in which to raise our family, having the wherewithal to educate \nour children, providing for their needs, their necessities, whether it \nbe transportation, clothing or food--those dreams and visions are going \nbe infinitely harder for future generations because we have failed to \nact responsibly, because we have failed to honestly face the taxpayer \nand honestly exercise the responsibilities they have given to us, \nbecause we have had a very convenient excuse, and that is we can \npostpone the day of reckoning, we can postpone the day of payment to a \nfuture Congress, to a future generation.\n  To those who say that all we need do is stiffen our backbones and \nexercise will, I say it has not been done. It has not been done in 55 \nout of the last 63 years and for 25 straight years it has not been \ndone. For one reason or another, there is always an excuse to postpone \nit, usually past the next election. It is a natural human tendency \nwhich we all fall prey to and that is a tendency to avoid a very \nfundamental, basic principle of not having more than you can afford, of \nbeing able to pay for it up front. But because the Federal Government \nis allowed to float debt, because the Federal Government, unlike other \ninstitutions, has a convenient out, we are able to tell our \nconstituents that they can have it all now and somebody else will pay \nfor it later. That is why we are here.\n  Now, in my opinion, we failed to enact the structural reform \nnecessary to change the way we behave, and that was the balanced budget \namendment. I regret that that failed by one vote. The line-item veto is \nanother structural reform that changes the way we behave. It is almost \nas if we are trying to save ourselves from ourselves.\n  That is why I felt the balanced budget amendment was necessary \nbecause, despite all the promises--and I have been here through the \nbudget deals and through the tax deals and through the promises--that \nwe are going to get it right the next time, despite all that, we fail. \nWe fail because it is so much easier to say yes than it is to say no, \nbecause of that natural human tendency of wanting to go home and say \nyes to the group that will vote in the subsequent November election on \nwhether or not they want us to stay here, who will be pleased if we say \nyes and will be very unhappy if we say no.\n  And so that natural human tendency overcomes all of our best \nintentions. And each year, then, we fail to step up to the \nresponsibilities of making the hard choices. Oh, we make some hard \nchoices, but they are just trimming at the margins.\n  So I have believed for a long time that the only way we are going to \naccomplish what all of us, I believe, deep down in our hearts know we \nneed to accomplish is to put in place structural changes which will \neither force us to accomplish that or make it much more difficult to \ncontinue past practices.\n  The balanced budget amendment would have forced us to accomplish \nthat. We would have had to put our left hand on the Bible and our right \nhand in the air and each time swear to uphold that Constitution. And \nthat Constitution would have required us to balance the budget. It \nwould have liberated us. It would have liberated us from the pressures \nof constituencies, from special interests, from lobby groups. We could \nhave looked them in the eye and said, ``Yes, that is a worthy idea, but \nyou are going to have to sell it to the taxpayer, because I am \nconstitutionally bound to not spend more than we take in. You are \neither going to have to suggest a reduction in an offsetting program or \nyou are going to have to suggest a tax increase that will pay for it. \nBut, by the end of the session, we have to balance the books.''\n  What a liberation that would be. We ought to self-liberate. That is \nwhat I hope we will do now that we have not passed the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I hope we will realize and understand the gravity of the impact of \nthis debt. As Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  I hope that we will take that to heart and that we will summon the \nwill to accomplish that end.\n  The line-item veto is a pale shadow in comparison to the balanced \nbudget, but it is the only other game in town--the only other game in \ntown other than what we have been doing for 25 straight years, and that \nis running deficits; despite our promises, despite our rhetoric, \ndespite our best intentions, the only other game in town that changes \nthe way in which this body operates, that provides a check on the way \nwe do things, a balance on the way we do things that makes it more \ndifficult for us to continue this practice of saddling future posterity \nand generations with unnecessary debt as a result of spending that goes \nto the narrow interests rather than national interests.\n   [[Page S4240]] And so what is before us now is the second attempt in \na month or so to fundamentally change the way we do business.\n  Some will argue for the status quo, saying that we are \nconstitutionally bound. I do not accept that argument. Neither do other \nrespected constitutional experts.\n  Some will say that we are tradition bound. What a tradition. Who can \ndefend the tradition of a $5 trillion debt? Who can possibly defend the \nway that we have done business when faced with such staggering debt?\n  So the line-item veto, as I said, is just a shadow of what might have \nbeen accomplished under a balanced budget amendment, but, nevertheless, \nan important tool, an important tool to end the practice or at least to \nmake the practice substantially more difficult than the practice that \nhas been the traditional course of action here for perhaps the history \nof this body, but certainly since 1974 when we took away the \nPresident's right of impoundment.\n  It is a tool we need. It is a tool we need because it forces us to be \nhonest legislators, to own up to the individual item that somebody has \nproposed and to defend it. And if it is defensible, if it is \nmeritorious, then it will pass. It will gain the votes and the support \nof the Members of this body.\n  If it is not, it will fail. My guess is that many will not see the \nlight of day because those items are items that we know cannot generate \na majority of support, otherwise they would be brought as individual \nitems to this floor.\n  We will never know the full impact of line-item veto because most of \nthe items that would have been vetoed will never be put on the bills in \nthe first place. We will not risk the embarrassment of the \nappropriation or the special tax break that will be labeled ``spending \npork'' or ``tax pork.'' Most will not risk that embarrassment of having \nthe President call out that separate bill and stamp ``veto'' on it and \nsend it back here and bring it up for debate and for a vote. We know in \nour hearts it would never achieve a majority, let alone a two-thirds \nvote.\n  So line-item veto will not be measured in the amount of money that it \nsaves in the future. Only we know in our hearts and in our minds what \nitems we might have attached if we had not had line-item veto. Those \nare the broader reasons, Mr. President. We can argue the \ntechnicalities. We can argue as we always do that, yes, I support the \nconcept but not this bill, not this definition.\n  Well, we have been going through and saying this now for more than a \ndecade. I do not know what perfect piece of legislation lies out there. \nAll I know is it is not offered. We have wrestled and wrestled with \nthis. We want something that is real, something that has teeth, \nsomething that makes it harder for Congress to spend. Not 51 votes. We \nwant two-thirds, something that allows the President to know exactly \nwhat it is we have done.\n  We do not want a 14-page bill sent to him that incorporates in its \nfirst paragraph, 326 separate items. We would like those items defined, \nin detail. A little extra work, yes. But we are not quill and pen any \nmore. We are computerized. We have the technology to do this, to do \nthis easily, to do this accurately, to do this fairly, to do this \njustly.\n  Mr. President, I would hope our colleagues would conclude that the \ntime is now, the time to make a structural change, to make a \ndifference, is now. If we postpone this, if we continue to postpone it, \nwe simply will have a much more difficult task in the future.\n  So, let Members at least, having failed a balanced budget amendment, \nlet Members at least pass line-item veto so that we can say, ``We did \nsomething different. We made some change in the way we do business.'' \nSo that we do not have to go home and say ``Despite the mandate of \nthem, despite the burden of the debt, despite the speeches that each \nMember has given about the insidiousness of the debt and \nuncontrollability of this debt we did nothing structurally different. \nWe did nothing to change the way we did business.''\n  Does any Member want to go home and say that? This is our chance. \nThis is our time. I urge support for the amendment by the Senator from \nKansas, the majority leader, Senator Dole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I asked the Senator from Indiana to yield. \nHe did not wish to yield.\n  He had two opportunities to vote for deficit reduction packages--and \nI will be very brief--in 1990 and again in 1993.\n  Did he vote for either of those deficit reduction packages? The \nopportunity was there to cut the deficits by a total of around $900 \nbillion in both bills, 1990 and 1993. Did the Senator vote for either \nof them?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, if the Senator from West Virginia will \nyield, first of all I apologize to the Senator for not yielding. I \nguess I got carried away with my own rhetoric and conclusion. I forget \nI promised the Senator from West Virginia that I would yield for a \nquestion. I trust he will accept my apology for that.\n  The question the Senator from West Virginia has propounded to me is: \nDid I vote for the 1990 or the 1993 budget resolution? The answer to \nthat is no.\n  I would like to explain why I did not. Because this Senator believes \nthat my constituents from Indiana have been taxed enough. And both of \nthose resolutions contained substantial increases in taxes, as well as \nspending cuts. It was the philosophy of some who offered those \nresolutions that our deficit ought to be attacked by a combination of \ntax increases and spending cuts.\n  It is this Senator's opinion that we have taxed the taxpayers enough, \nand that we ought to attack the deficit on the basis of spending cuts--\nthis Government has grown too large--and that our first priority ought \nto be to reduce the scope and size of Government and to reduce \nexpenditures. Only then consider the possibility of an increase, if it \nis needed, to address the balanced budget amendment.\n  So, if the vote was on a measure as we have had a number of votes, to \njust reduce spending, this Senator is more than happy to vote for it. \nBut not if it includes raising taxes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator has answered my question. The \nanswer is, he did not vote for either of those packages, which together \nsaved upward of $900 billion, would reduce the deficits by almost $1 \ntrillion over 5-year periods. He did not choose to vote for either of \nthem and he says, ``Because they contained tax increases.''\n  Well, tax increases are one of the tools that has to be on the table, \nin my judgment, if we are going to consider reducing the deficits. \nNobody likes to vote for tax increases. I do not like to. I have voted \nfor tax increases, I have voted for tax cuts. I would much rather vote \nfor tax cuts.\n  But tax increases is one of the options that we may have to use if we \nrelieve the burden of debt that is going to be placed upon our children \nand grandchildren by virtue of our using the national credit card for \nthe last dozen to 15 years. We may have to use that option to increase \ntaxes.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator refers to the Gephardt rule. The \nGephardt rule has never been adjudicated by the courts. We do not know \nhow the courts would hold on the Gephardt rule.\n  Furthermore, I might suggest that if we can deem, in the words of the \namendment that has been offered by Mr. Dole, if we can deem, and I read \nthe language therefrom, ``a measure enrolled pursuant to paragraph one \nof subsection (A) with respect to an item shall be deemed to be a bill \nunder clauses 2 and 3 of section 7 of article I.''\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Indiana says that we \n``may deem'' such measure to be a bill under clause 2 and 3, and he \nsays that we may do that based on article I, section 5, which leaves to \nthe two Houses the judgment of determining their own rules, but I would \nhope that the Senator would not argue that the Senate or the House \nunder the cloak of article V, the determining of the rules that the \nHouse and Senate could supervene a clear clause in the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  Neither House can create a rule that would in itself, violate the \nConstitution of the United States, or supervene it, or take precedence \nover it. All rules of the House and Senate--even though the House and \nSenate are given the power and authority under article I, \n[[Page S4241]] section 5, to determine the rules of--all Senate and \nHouse rules must fall if inconsistent with the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  Now, if a bill enrolled pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection (A) \nwith respect to this item shall be deemed to be a bill, if one of these \nlittle ``billettes'' may be deemed to be a bill, if the Constitution \nsaid ``Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives \nand the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the \nPresident of the United States''; if we can deem that and thereby avoid \nthe requirements of the Constitution, I wonder if we might not just \ndeem an appropriation bill that passes the House of Representatives, \njust deem that it has passed the Senate?\n  Any appropriation bill that passes the House, why not just deem it to \nhave passed the Senate and go home? It would seem to me to be just as \nappropriate to deem an appropriations bill that has passed the House, \ndeem it as having passed the Senate, as to deem the section or a \nparagraph or an item in the appropriations bill, deem that to be a \nbill.\n  There is one final suggestion I have. The distinguished Senator spoke \nof the qualified negative which the constitutional Framers gave to the \nPresident, and they did reject the idea of giving the President an \nabsolute negative, an absolute veto. They gave him a qualified veto. \nBut in practice, it would seem to me that if the pending amendment \nbecomes law, it could, in effect, be the same as giving the President \nan absolute veto for this reason:\n  Let us say that the several States in the Northeast--Maine, New \nHampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and so on--let us say \nthat those States were able to get something into an appropriations \nbill that was very vital to the Northeast region. Suppose the President \nvetoed that item or those items from the bill and sent those bills back \nto the House of Representatives where they originated. Well, obviously, \nthe votes of all the States in the Northeast, when added together, in \nthe House of Representatives would fall far short of being sufficient \nto override a Presidential veto. The small States would be hard put to \ncorral the votes necessary to override a Presidential veto of items \nthat affected the small States.\n  West Virginia has three votes in the House and, in effect, then, it \nwould seem to me that the President, in exercising his veto under the \namendment that has been offered by Mr. Dole, would, in practice, as far \nas practicality is concerned, be exercising an absolute veto. Small \nStates should look at this amendment with great concern. Perhaps the \nStates of California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, New York, Indiana, and \nIllinois could come together and marshal enough votes among themselves \nto at least uphold a Presidential veto, sustain it.\n  But the President could take that bill and knock out items that were \nof importance to the smaller States, and it would be very, very \ndifficult, if not impossible, for the small States to garner the \nsupport in the House of Representatives to override that veto. They \nwould not be able to produce the two-thirds vote. So, in essence, it \ngives to the President an absolute veto, which the Framers discussed \nbut rejected.\n  Mr. President, I have had more than my share of time here this \nafternoon. I apologize to those other Senators who have been waiting. I \nyield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe the next Senator is the Senator from \nCalifornia. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is a very short statement. I do \nappreciate the opportunity to make it. I rise today in support of the \nsubstitute amendment to S. 4.\n  For more than 100 years now, arguments both pro and con have been \nmade revolving around whether a President should or should not have a \nline-item veto. As a matter of fact, since 1876, more than 200 \nresolutions have been introduced on this subject. Presidents, \nDemocratic and Republican, have asked for this special blue pencil. \nThis President has asked for the strongest possible bill, and I believe \nthat there are several Democratic Senators prepared to vote for this \nlegislation.\n  Basically, the arguments on a line-item veto are either philosophical \nor constitutional. But regardless, the trend on many levels has clearly \nbeen toward a stronger chief executive in both State and local \njurisdictions.\n  Today, 43 States have a line-item veto, and mayors of cities, big and \nsmall, as well as county executives, are being granted this authority.\n  In California, the latest city to grant a line-item veto to a newly \nstrengthened mayor is Fresno, a major city with a population of 667,000 \npeople in California's Central Valley breadbasket. The Fresno mayor \nwill have this authority beginning in 1997.\n  In Maryland, the State legislature is this year considering granting \nthis authority to the county executive.\n  In California, the line-item veto has been used 254 times in the last \n4 years. The Governor has had this authority since 1908, and a recent \nsurvey found that 92 percent of all current and former State Governors \nbelieve that the line-item veto would help curb spending.\n  Before New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a $15 billion \nsupplemental budget into law this past year, she used the blue pencil \nto cut $3.17 million from the bill.\n  The most powerful line-item veto is probably that provided in \nWisconsin, where the Governor cannot only veto lines but also \nindividual words. Governor Thompson has used it over 1,500 times since \n1987, sometimes to change actual policy. It is my understanding that \nthis is not the case in the legislation being considered today.\n  Virtually all businesses' and corporations' CEO's or CFO's have this \nauthority. But the President of the United States, who runs the largest \ncombination of major governmental enterprises in the world, does not \nhave this authority.\n  Today, the President has little recourse to fine tune a budget passed \nby the Congress, except to shut down entire segments of the Government \nby vetoing an entire appropriations bill.\n  In 1992, the General Accounting Office estimated that a line-item \nveto could have pared $70.7 billion in pork-barrel spending between \n1984 and 1989. That is just 5 years. If in the next 5 years a similar \namount could be cut, then the line-item veto will have done its job.\n  Enacting a line-item veto will, of course, give the Executive more \nauthority, and I recognize that that is a problem for some. And even \nthough a President may not use that power frequently, the threat of \nsuch action may be the impetus needed to force Congress to be more \nresponsible in the formulation of the budget.\n  I believe the line-item veto will increase positive relations between \nthe executive and legislative branches because Members will no longer \nhave the ability to insert special projects that have little overall \nmerit in appropriation bills without the concurrence of the Chief \nExecutive. The line-item veto can force executive-legislative \ncooperation and agreement before the bill reaches the White House for \nsignature or veto.\n  It also encourages caution on the part of the Chief Executive who \nwould use it sparingly in order to prevent his veto from being \noverridden. Really, what a line-item veto is all about is deterrence, \nand that deterrence is aimed at the pork barrel. I sincerely believe \nthat a line-item veto will work.\n  In our caucus today, some papers were passed around which showed a \nparagraph from a bill involving the Patent and Trademark Office, and \nthere were several subsets attached--items which were certainly not \nreflected in the paragraph of the bill. One of these stated:\n\n     * * * of which not to exceed $11 million shall remain \n     available until expended for furniture and furnishings \n     related to new space alteration and construction projects.\n\n  Now, if I were President, I would say to my staff--take a look at \nthis. Does the Patent and Copyright Office really need $11 million in \nfurnishings? I think it is worth a look.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was the one who circulated this paper. This has nothing \nto do with the Patent Office. This had to do with the Federal courts, \nwhich \n[[Page S4242]] shows the problem with the pending substitute before us, \nwhich is there is no way of telling from the bill that will be \nsubmitted to the President what it relates to. It is just language \npulled out of bills and you do not even know what it relates to. The \nSenator is saying that this was from the Patent Office.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me respond to that. The fact is, I do not care \nwhat department it is; any $11 million item for furniture should \ncertainly be looked at a second time, whether it is courts or \nagricultural offices or Interior or anything else.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from California will yield further, this \nlanguage was language which the computer produced, and the Senator from \nIndiana handed the computer to State, Commerce and Justice \nappropriations. And the Senator from Indiana said, gee, that computer \ndoes it simply, fairly, accurately, and the Senator from California \nsaid that this related to the Patent Office. And in fact it has nothing \nto do with the Patent Office.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me apologize. The papers were passed out together \nat our caucus, and I made perhaps the mistaken and inadvertent, but not \nsurprising, conclusion that since they were passed out together they \nrelated to one another.\n  Now, if I might finish my statement----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe that what a line-item veto essentially does \nis encourage caution on the part of both the Chief Executive and the \nlegislative body. I think the time has come for fiscal discipline. As I \nsaid, I sincerely believe the line-item veto can help us achieve that \ngoal.\n  Let me give an example. When I was mayor of San Francisco, the budget \ndid not correspond with the size of the Federal budget, but there were \n52 departments, and the budget was over $1 billion. Yet, it was very \ndifficult to get down to the actual line items. There was one line for \nsalaries. As a chief executive, I really had no opportunity to go \nthrough every salary to make judgments about how many people should be \ncontinued and how many people should not.\n  A line-item veto gives the chief executive this opportunity, and I \nthink the blue pencil is a necessary tool of government for a Chief \nExecutive in a modern day.\n  I also believe that tax breaks and appropriations should be treated \nsimilarly. They may be two different items, but the results are very \nmuch the same: they benefit a small segment of the population at the \nexpense of the greater good of all the people. Regardless of the item, \nthey both reduce the amount of money in the U.S. Treasury.\n  Currently, debates are raging at every level of government about the \ninstitution of a line-item veto. Maryland, as I said, is now debating \nit. Fresno, CA, has just granted it. I believe that the people of this \ncountry understand the benefits of a line-item veto and are expanding \nthe use of it. I believe we ought to give this power to our President.\n  So I am very pleased to be able to support the legislation before \nthis body.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I just want to make an announcement to my \ncolleagues on both sides to know what the program is for the remainder \nof the evening.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader has given me a list of potential \namendments which numbers 33 on that side, 4 on this side, for a total \nof 37, and I am not in a position to say that is an agreement that we \nwould want to agree to. So I would just suggest tonight, if somebody \nwants to debate the bill, it is all right to have the debate, but we \nare not going to take up any amendments tonight. And then I will meet \nwith our leadership tomorrow morning on this proposal.\n  I do not see how we are going to complete 37 amendments between now \nand Friday morning. Many will probably be the same amendment we have \nhad time after time after time in an effort to delay and delay and \ndelay action on a bill that ought to be passed around here in 2 or 3 \ndays. It is something we debated 7 times in the past 8 years. But I \nknow Members have a right in the Senate to offer all the amendments \nthey want. And if we cannot get cloture, why, I assume they can offer \nall the amendments they want. But I do not think it would be in the \ninterest of anybody to start off and suggest we are going to finish by \nFriday when we have 37 amendments with no time agreement on a single \namendment. It is the same thing we have done all year long--throw in \nall the amendments you can think of, clean out the garbage can, \nwhatever, and then put them on a list and say take it or leave it. My \nview at this time is to leave it. If anybody wants to make speeches on \nthe bill or on any amendment tonight, there will be no disposition of \nany amendment tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am sorry to hear what the leader has just \nsaid. We were prepared to offer an amendment. There have been those of \nus in the Chamber today who have not had a chance to talk. Some people \ndo not follow the usual order around here, but I was prepared to yield \nto my colleague from Illinois for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  Do I understand that the leader is saying he does not want any \namendments offered as of now?\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not object to an amendment being offered; there just \nwill not be any vote tonight if the Senator from Illinois would like to \noffer an amendment, if somebody else would like to offer another \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I have listened to the statement made by the leader, and I \nwould simply say that we are prepared to move ahead on these things as \nquickly as possible. This is a very important piece of legislation, and \nI have listened to a lot of talk today that some people misconstrue \nwhat most of us on this side want to do, and that is pass some \nacceptable version of the line-item veto or enhanced rescission \nproposal.\n  So we are not being dilatory. I do not think anybody is \nfilibustering. There has been no threat of a filibuster. I hope, for \nthe purpose of moving ahead now, to show we want to get things done--as \nsoon as the Chair thinks it appropriate, I would appreciate him \nrecognizing the Senator from Illinois for the purpose of offering an \namendment to get on with what we think the request of the majority \nleader is. Let us get going on offering the amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will just take 1 additional minute. Again, everybody has \nthe right to offer amendments. We certainly learned that this year. We \nhave voted on the same amendments time after time after time. I bet \nhalf of them are right on here again. Everybody out trying to make \npoints: Social Security, children, or somebody else--offering these \namendments.\n  That is a right we have on both sides of the aisle, but we do not \nhave to take a week just because Friday is coming. We do not have to \nsay we cannot finish this bill before Friday. We have a lot of work to \ndo if we are going to have any Easter recess around here.\n  We have a list of ``must do'' legislation. There comes a point when \nyou must get it done. I think if we can finish this bill on Thursday, \nstart on either the supplemental appropriation, the second supplemental \nor the modified bipartisan measure on regulatory reform--not the \nmoratorium but the 45-day review period, which I think Senator Reid and \nSenator Nickles are working on--then after that, we have the self-\nemployed tax deduction, which is going to be very important to our \nconstituents. Tax time is coming. We need to pass that early next week. \nThen we have the second supplemental with billions of dollars in there \nfor FEMA, among other things. Then we have a couple of conference \nreports on the first supplemental; and then on paper simplification.\n  My view is, if we do not push on this one we are--and if we do a \ncouple of amendments tonight, that would only leave 35.\n  My view is, certainly if the Senator from Illinois wants to offer an \namendment, he can do that tonight. But I suggest we then have the vote \non that amendment tomorrow, and we will just start and see how far we \ncan go until we have a cloture vote tomorrow sometime.\n   [[Page S4243]] Mr. SIMON. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. Let me just explain, the amendment I hope to offer simply \ncalls for expedited judicial review. It is identical to an amendment \nthat was accepted on the House side.\n  I think, whether you are for or against this bill, it makes sense. I \nbelieve it would be acceptable to both sides but I at least want to lay \nit down tonight and then, if there is not agreement tonight, then we \ncan agree on it tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is the Senator going to send the amendment to the desk?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. If the Senator will yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kansas yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I did not hear all the words of the \ndistinguished majority leader, but I did hear the end of his comments.\n  Let me say again, as I have said to him personally: it is not our \ndesire to hold up this piece of legislation. Our desire all along has \nbeen to work in good faith with the Republican majority. We have \nconsulted with a number of our colleagues, all of whom have indicated \ntheir amendments are relevant.\n  I am somewhat surprised myself, frankly, with the list of amendment. \nI had indicated publicly I did not think the list was going to be as \nlong as the list is. But I have given the assurance to the majority \nleader that we desire to finish this bill this week. We have also \nindicated that our message to all Members would be that they would have \nto offer their amendments prior to 10 o'clock on Thursday. That is an \nexcellent guarantee.\n  We have also indicated that the amendments that we intend to offer \nwould be relevant. These have not necessarily been offered in the past, \nand I hope we could find some way to accommodate all Senators here. If \nwe have to go to a cloture vote, we will go to a cloture vote. But the \nissue, if we go to a cloture vote, will be whether we, as a minority, \nhave the opportunity to be heard on a very important issue, and to \noffer all relevant amendments.\n  We only received this amendment yesterday evening. It is a substitute \nthat was laid down yesterday. We have not been given an opportunity \ntoday to even offer an amendment. There will be no votes on amendments \ntonight.\n  So I hope that everyone shows some accommodation, and some \nwillingness to cooperate. We are doing our best. We may be able to get \nthat list down even some more. But I hope we can continue to work in \ngood faith. And let me emphasize to the majority leader and to others, \nI think if we do work in good faith, we can accommodate all Senators in \na responsible way.\n  But to lay down this substitute, then to file cloture, then to tell \nus that we cannot even offer amendments--most of which or all of which \nshould be relevant--in my view is just unacceptable. I hope in the end \nwe can deal with this in a reasonable way. I am sure that we can.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we may have an opportunity overnight to go \nback and shorten the list some. I cannot believe there are 37--34 \namendments on that side of the aisle. First there were 40; then they \nreduced it to 34. I cannot believe all those amendments. I think there \nmay be some legitimate amendments. There are probably a half dozen, but \nI do not think there are 34.\n  Maybe we can come back and take another look. We now have three \namendments or four amendments on this side of the aisle. The important \nthing is, it is not just this legislation. We took 4 or 5 weeks on the \nbalanced budget amendment. We listened to--everybody got to offer their \nSocial Security amendment on the other side. They tried to make that \nthe issue. Many people who voted for the balanced budget amendment last \nyear, the identical measure, stood right here and voted no this year. \nThere were a couple of minor changes.\n  We do not want to go through that process again. You are either for \nor you are against a line-item veto, and we ought to find out. Those \nwho are for it on both sides--not everybody is for it on this side. But \nthose who are for it on both sides, I think, would want us to move \nahead and get on to the next piece of legislation if, in fact, we are \ngoing to have a recess, which would come when, if it happens? April 7.\n  But there are some things we need to do. I understand today there is \nsome treaty the administration wants us to do that may take some time.\n  So we are trying to accommodate the administration. In fact, the \nline-item veto is something the President says he is for. He said today \nat the White House they did not mind these separate enrollments. They \nhave a lot of pens at the White House. They make good souvenirs. If \nthere are a lot of enrollments, they could have a lot of signing \nceremonies. That is what, in effect, Mr. McCurry said, the President's \npress spokesman, I think, on that line-item veto.\n  So we would be happy to work with the leader overnight. But I say to \nthe Senator from Illinois, if he wants to offer the amendment, he \ncertainly has every right. If somebody else wants to offer an \namendment, Senator McCain said he would stay here until 8, 9, 10 \no'clock, so we could stack some of those votes if they are not subject \nto second-degree amendments and have those votes tomorrow morning.\n  We do not want to keep anybody from offering amendments. I just do \nnot want to try to do this this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me emphasize to Senators on our side \nof the aisle that I hope we could offer some amendments tonight. Now, I \nunderstand the majority leader to say if we have the ability to vote on \nthem, let us do that. Let us move ahead.\n  But there are really two issues here. The first issue is whether or \nnot the Democratic minority will have the right to offer amendments to \nbe heard on any one of a number of bills that may come before us. I do \nnot think the Republicans in the past have been any more willing to \naccept the majority laying down a bill, cutting off debate, and not \nallowing amendments, especially those that may be germane or relevant, \nfrom being considered and debated upon and ultimately voted on.\n  That is not how we should do business here. What I thought we did was \nto try to work out arrangements whereby both the majority and the \nminority would have the opportunity to offer amendments in a reasonable \nway, and to have votes on those amendments and ultimately work through \nthe legislative process. If we are precluded from doing that, then in \nmy view we have no choice but to vote against cloture and to drag this \nprocess out as long as we must. Nobody wants to do that. But I think I \ncan say for many members of the Democratic caucus that we will do that \nif that is our only recourse.\n  Second, let me just say this is not just a question of a line-item \nveto. Obviously, there are legitimate differences of opinion with \nregard to what is the most appropriate form of a line-item veto. There \nare differences on both sides of the aisle. Our hope is that we can \nwork through those differences and come up with a meaningful piece of \nlegislation that will enjoy broad bipartisan support. But whether we \nhave broad bipartisan support depends upon whether or not there is \nbipartisan cooperation. It is not just a vote on a line-item veto. It \nis a vote on various concepts involving line-item veto or line-item \nrescission and I am fairly optimistic that ultimately as we work \nthrough these amendments, and as we work through the course of the \nweek, that we can come to some ultimate closure on this issue in a way \nthat would allow everyone here to feel good about our progress.\n  So I hope cooler heads can prevail, and that we can truly accomplish \nall that both the majority leader and I and others have expressed a \ndesire to do this week.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Democratic leader yield? I would like to say \nthat the distinguished Democratic leader that I am prepared to stay \nhere. We are prepared to consider amendments. I hope all of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle understand that.\n   [[Page S4244]] It is my understanding that the majority leader would \nlike to stack those votes tomorrow, which I hope is acceptable to the \nDemocratic leader. I hope we can move forward, and hopefully by \ntomorrow perhaps we can find, as we usually do, that some of those \namendments that are on that list are not necessary so we can achieve \nthe goal that both of us seek.\n  I fully understand and appreciate the desire and commitment of the \ndistinguished Democratic leader to protect his and the rights on that \nside of the aisle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will not belabor this point. Let me \nstate one last reminder to my colleagues. If we have an agreement, that \nagreement will entail, at least as it stands now, an understanding that \nall Senators would have to file their amendments no later than Thursday \nmorning. That leaves tonight and tomorrow and Thursday morning up to a \ntime certain to offer amendments. So if Senators are serious about \noffering these amendments, I hope they will come to the floor tonight \nas late as it takes. This is an opportunity to present your amendments. \nCome to the floor tomorrow. But take advantage of what I think is an \neffort on both sides of the aisle to accommodate Senators with serious \nsuggestions and proposals as to how to improve this piece of \nlegislation. If we do that, I am sure the distinguished Senator from \nArizona is correct. We can reach some agreement tomorrow as to how to \ndispose of this bill in a way that will accommodate all Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to briefly thank the distinguished \nDemocratic leader for his patience. I want to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for a very important statement, and frankly one that I think \nhas gotten a lot of very important messages associated with it. I \nappreciate her support of the line-item veto. I appreciate also the \npatience of the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I assure my colleagues I will just take a few minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 393\n\n          (Purpose: To provide for expedited judicial review)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in behalf \nof myself and Senator Levin, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], for himself and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 293.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the pending amendment, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC.   . JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Expedited Review.--\n       (1) Any Member of Congress may bring an action, in the \n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \n     for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground \n     that any provision of this Act violates the Constitution.\n       (2) A copy of any complaint in an action brought under \n     paragraph (1) shall be promptly delivered to the Secretary of \n     the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and \n     each House of Congress shall have the right to intervene in \n     such action.\n       (3) Any action brought under paragraph (1) shall be heard \n     and determined by a three-judge court in accordance with \n     section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.\n       Nothing in this section or in any other law shall infringe \n     upon the right of the House of Representatives or the Senate \n     to intervene in an action brought under paragraph (1) without \n     the necessity of adopting a resolution to authorize such \n     intervention.\n       (b) Appeal to Supreme Court.--\n       Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any order of \n     the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \n     which is issued pursuant to an action brought under paragraph \n     (1) of subsection (a) shall be reviewable by appeal directly \n     to the Supreme Court of the United States. Any such appeal \n     shall be taken by a notice of appeal filed within 10 days \n     after such order is entered; and the jurisdictional statement \n     shall be filed within 30 days after such order is entered. No \n     stay of an order issued pursuant to an action brought under \n     paragraph (1) of subsection (a) shall be issued by a single \n     Justice of the Supreme Court.\n       (c) Expedited Consideration.--\n       It shall be the duty of the District Court for the District \n     of Columbia and the Supreme Court of the United States to \n     advance on the docket and to expedite to the greatest \n     possible extent the disposition of any matter brought under \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I believe this is an amendment that will be \nacceptable to both sides. But my colleagues will have overnight to look \nat it and make a determination. It is identical to the language that is \nin the House. It says that any Member of Congress may bring the \nquestion of constitutionality before the Federal court, and a panel of \nthree judges will make a determination of its constitutionality and \nthen it can be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  What we do not want is to live in limbo. We have people like John \nKillian of CRS and Prof. Larry Tribe of Harvard who believe it is \nconstitutional. You have others like Louis Fisher of CRS and Walter \nDellinger, who believe it is not constitutional. I do not know who is \nright. The courts have to make that determination. But we ought to know \nas quickly as possible whether it is constitutional. My sense is it \nwill pass, and it is clearly going to be signed by the President. Let \nus find out whether it meets constitutional test.\n  That is what we are asking. And that very simply is what the \namendment does.\n  I thank the President. I thank my colleagues for yielding, and \nparticularly Senator Levin who was here on the floor before I was.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Illinois. It is a very good one, and a very timely \none. This amendment is simply good and prudent planning.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia has detailed our real \nconcerns with the separate enrollment concept advanced by the \nRepublican substitute. Legal scholars can debate whether the separate \nenrollment violates the clause of the Constitution. That would be \naffected regardless of where the Senate comes out on this issue of \nseparate enrollment. It is a constitutional question.\n  I hope that all can agree that we do not want a constitutional cloud \nhanging over what I think we will eventually pass in the form of \nwhatever kind of line-item veto or enhanced rescission we come up with \nhere in our debate on a final vote. We do not want that cloud hanging \nover forever.\n  The pending amendment simply allows a speedy resolution of this \nconstitutional issue. It does not allow a legal challenge to hang over \nall the bills for years upon years. Let us provide an expedited \njudicial review, which the Senator from Illinois suggested. As I \nunderstand it, it is identical to what was passed in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Possibly this is something that can be passed by a voice vote, since \nI know of no objection to it on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the intentions of the Senator \nfrom Illinois. I am in agreement, except with one caveat; that is, that \nthe opening paragraph of the amendment says any Member of Congress may \nbring an action in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for \ndeclaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground that any \nprovision of this act violates the Constitution.\n  I have not seen the House language, I say to my friend from Illinois. \nBut I am concerned about any provision of the act which is \nunconstitutional, and whether the entire act would be unconstitutional, \nif that was the intent of the amendment. If it was the intent of the \namendment, would a severability clause added to the amendment be \nacceptable to the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, Mr. President, \nI am sure we can work that out. If the Senator's staff will work with \nmy staff overnight, I think we are reaching a point of agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Arizona yield briefly?\n   [[Page S4245]] My understanding is that language tracks the Gramm-\nRudman judicial review language as well. That may be helpful as a \nprecedent as you review this overnight.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senators from Illinois and Michigan.\n  I would like to ensure--and I think the Senator from Illinois is in \nagreement with me. If one minor provision of the act is declared \nunconstitutional, I would not want the entire act to be declared \nunconstitutional. I know what the opponents of this legislation are \ntrying to get at. It is primarily separate enrollment. I understand \nthat. If it were declared unconstitutional, then obviously, the entire \nact would be out. If it is a minor aspect of it, I would like to not \nsee the entire legislation knocked out.\n  So I look forward to working with the staff of the Senator from \nIllinois overnight, and obviously with the good counsel of the Senator \nfrom Michigan. I hope we can work that out during the course of the \nevening.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we will not accept the amendment at this \ntime until we get the language worked out and also in keeping with the \nwishes of the majority leader that we not do any amendments this \nevening. But I also would like to assure the Senator from Illinois that \nI think it is entirely fair and justified to see an expedited review of \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I have been listening all afternoon to the \nexcellent presentation by Senator Byrd from West Virginia and learned a \ngreat deal. I think we would all agree that the Senator from West \nVirginia is a very talented and experienced constitutional lawyer. I \nthought he brought up some excellent points today, and I simply say \nthat I think it is very important that the Congress listen to somebody \nwith the experience of Senator Byrd and not get ourselves into a \nsituation where we, once again, try, and maybe this time pass, some \nversion of a line-item veto and then have it promptly set aside by the \ncourts. None of us want that. There have been a lot of arguments back \nand forth, and I will submit for the Record at this juncture a \nstatement by Walter Dellinger in front of the Judiciary Committee in \nJanuary of this year which disagrees with the holding of Senator Biden \nof the Judiciary Committee, the former chairman, with regard to this \nconcept of enrollment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpt of Mr. Dellinger's Testimony Before the Subcommittee on the \n                       Constitution, January 1995\n\n       As much as I regret saying so, I think that Senator Biden's \n     proposal for separate enrollment also raises significant \n     constitutional issues, you know, that would atomize or \n     dismember one of these large appropriations bills into its \n     individual items which the President could then sign. I think \n     it is either invalid under the clause, in my view, or, at a \n     minimum, it raises such complicated questions under the \n     Presentment Clause that it is a foolhardy way to proceed \n     because if we and all of our predecessors are right, I think \n     that which has to be presented to the President is the thing \n     that passed the House and the Senate, and that which passed \n     the House and the Senate is the bill they voted on on final \n     passage, not some little piece of it or a series of little \n     pieces of it. So I have doubts about it.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, during the extensive debate that has gone on \nnow since 2:15 this afternoon, a lot of things have been talked about. \nI simply emphasize once again that, as far as this Senator is \nconcerned, I am working very hard and have been for many years to try \nto come up with something that we can generally agree on, get it \npassed, hoping it is constitutional. I go way back to 1986 when the \nthen Indiana Senator, Dan Quayle--the predecessor to Senator Coats, who \nwas in the chair most of the afternoon--and I combined at that time on \nwhat was called the pork-buster bill. That launched one of the first \nrecent initiatives trying to do something about putting some brakes on \nsome of the pork that goes into the bills.\n  So, therefore, I wanted to march shoulder to shoulder, as I did with \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, this year in \nintroducing S. 4. And then came, of course, S. 14, which came after S. \n4. It was introduced by Senator McCain and others. We held a very \ninteresting hearing on that. It now seems that many of the things \nembodied in S. 4 have changed to the new concept offered by the \nmajority leader last night. I think some significant changes were made \nthat brings the proposal that is now before the body much, much closer \nto S. 14, which Senator Domenici and myself introduced under the number \nS. 14.\n  So I think we are making progress. I think we are going to pass \nsomething now. But I certainly hope that we recognize and realize that \nnothing is perfect, and the substitute offered last night, which I \nunderstand has been agreed to by most of the Senators on that side of \nthe aisle in the majority, is something that we are looking at. I think \nsome changes would be in order, and I certainly hope that we will not \ndismiss out of hand the detailed presentation made by Senator Byrd \ntoday. The points he made, I thought, were tremendously important, and \nwe should take a look at that.\n  I am not sure where and when it came after the introduction of S. 4 \nand S. 14, which were the two principal bills in this area, that had \nnothing about actions of an enrollment clerk. I am not sure yet how \nthat has become such a centerpiece. I hope that those on that side of \nthe aisle will at least listen to those of us here who would like to \nsuggest and have a vote on what we may think would be a better way that \nwould keep us, hopefully, away from the courts intervening and saying \nthat we have done something unconstitutional.\n  I simply say that I believe there are some concerns with regard to an \nenrollment clerk. I listened to the Senator from Indiana this afternoon \ntalk about how computers could be used to expedite this process and it \nwould not be as laborious as indicated in the presentation by Senator \nByrd. I wonder if we recognize that the Constitution probably does not \nallow computers to sign bills or ``billettes,'' as they were called \ntoday by Senator Byrd in his rather extensive debate.\n  When you start talking about this enrollment proposition, I do not \nbelieve that the Framers of the Constitution ever envisioned that an \nenrollment clerk would be involved in such an intricate way. If the \nenrollment clerk would be required to enroll all of these bills \nseparately, given that, we also have to recognize that the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, \nand the President of the United States all have to sign these. I \nsuspect and would hope that we would not have changed the system so \nmuch that we do not require the signature of those key officers, as \nestablished in the Constitution, and that they can sign through a \ncomputer. It might well be that we have advanced to the point where the \ncomputer can sign the name of the President of the United States. But I \nsuspect that that might be somewhat suspect from a constitutional \nstandpoint.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that all we are trying to do here is to \nmove ahead aggressively. Let us have an open debate. Let us not try to \nshut off debate, because this is a very important matter. Certainly, \nwhen you are talking about matters like this, matters that we debate at \nsome length regarding the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget--an item, by the way, on which this Senator sided with those on \nthe majority side of the aisle. I still think constructive debate, \ndialog and discussion is part of the Senate process, and we should not \ntry to move as quickly on everything as does the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I remind all that the U.S. Senate is not the House of \nRepresentatives. If there is one thing that was made clear by the \nFramers of the Constitution, they felt that the U.S. Senate should be \nthe more deliberative body. That does not mean we should be so \ndeliberative that we get nothing done. Nor does it mean that we have to \nrace down the track like they do in the House of Representatives to \nmeet some magic 100 days that I think means little, if anything, if we \nare going to properly \n[[Page S4246]] discharge our duties in the manner in which we have \ntraditionally done it in the U.S. Senate.\n  I was extremely disappointed by the vote on the balanced budget \namendment. However, we cannot spend the rest of the session licking our \nwounds and assigning blame. The world did not come to a screeching halt \nbecause the balanced budget amendment failed to carry the day. We \ncontinue to run deficits and we continue to pile up debt. It is time to \nmove forward on a bipartisan basis. It is time to balance the budget \nwith or without a balanced budget amendment.\n  Oftentimes, during the balanced budget amendment, I found people \ntalking by each other, as I thought we did to some extent this \nafternoon. I was here all afternoon. I listened very carefully to the \nSenator from Indiana. I thought the Senator from Indiana was setting up \na straw man and knocking the straw man down, because I have not seen \nanybody on this side of the aisle or that side of the aisle who has \nbeen up talking against the concept, at least, of enacting some kind of \nenhanced rescission line-item veto. Call it what you will.\n  So I hope that we are not going to be talking a great deal during \nthis debate assuming that there are people on this side of the aisle \nthat are trying to stop this. I assure you, Mr. President, and I assure \nall Members on both sides of the aisle that I see no determination on \neither side of the aisle of a filibuster.\n  But I do see a desire to thoroughly think things through and then \nmove ahead.\n  But back to the situation at hand. A long time ago, I hitched my \nwagon to fiscal discipline and responsibility. I certainly do not plan \nto switch horses because of one setback in the form of the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Nebraskans care more about what we leave than what we take. I do not \nchoose to leave other's children or my grandchildren trillions of \ndollars in debt.\n  I will not leave them a Nation where we spend 17 cents of every tax \ndollar for interest on the debt. I will not rob them of thousands of \ndollars that they will have to pay to service the debt even before we \nbegin to start reducing the principal. That is what the debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment and it is what the debate here is all about--\nhow do we best do these things in a fashion that gets them done?\n  I will not cheat them, my children or grandchildren, out of the \nlegacy they so richly deserve. We must do everything in our power to \nblot out the red ink.\n  I am a realist, though, Madam President. The legislation before the \nSenate today will not break the back of the deficit, and we should all \nunderstand that. It will not cause the mountain of debt to vanish into \nthin air. But it will rein in pork-barrel spending, and that is an \nenormous step in the right direction.\n  Madam President, there is a common thread between this legislation \nand the balanced budget amendment. When we debate either measure, this \nChamber sounds like a revival tent of sinners repenting. Senators vow \nto refrain from wasteful spending.\n  I say, ``All evidence to the contrary.'' We have been out of control \nand spending abounds. The only thing in short supply is self-restraint.\n  Revenue acts are chocked full of special interest tax credits and \nexpenditures. Appropriations bills are larded with pet projects that \ncost the taxpayer billions of dollars. There are groaning with pork \nthat is carefully tucked away--so carefully placed that the President \ncannot extract it without bringing down the entire bill.\n  Our colleagues have become quite skillful in slipping in these \nprojects. The President has a tough choice to make. Will the President \nveto an appropriations or revenue bill just to get rid of the pork?\n  My colleagues know the drill and how it works. The President brings \nout the scales and weighs the good against the bad. More often than \nnot, the President holds his nose and signs the bill.\n  The obvious solution is to grant the President the line-item veto, \nmore properly called, I suspect, an ``expedited'' or ``enhanced'' \nrescission authority. That is what we are about and I think that we are \ngoing to accomplish it this time.\n  Suffice it to say, there are few in this body and even fewer in the \nHouse who have firsthand experience with or have ever experienced a \nline-item veto. It is my hope that the limited few, with firsthand \nexperience, will be listened to.\n  Today, 43 of the 50 State Governors have some form of veto authority. \nAs Governor of the State of Nebraska, I was privileged to have that \nline-item veto. It was an invaluable weapon in my arsenal to control \nspending by my State legislature.\n  I think the President of the United States, President Clinton and all \nthe Presidents that come after him, should have a line-item veto \nauthority so that they can take similar action, as I think the \nPresident of the United States can and should do if we can do it in a \nfashion--and I emphasize, Madam President, if we can do it in a \nfashion--that is not on its face constitutionally suspect.\n  I have long believed that the President should have this power. All \nbut two Presidents in the 20th century have advocated some type of \nline-item veto authority. President Clinton strongly supports it.\n  On the first day of the 104th Congress, I joined in introducing the \nlegislative line-item veto proposal, known as S. 14. This bipartisan \ncompromise was cosponsored by the distinguished Republican and \nDemocratic leaders, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, and Senators Bradley, Craig and Cohen. The original S. 14 \nstood in stark contrast to some of the other line-item veto proposals.\n  I am not saying that ours was perfect and I do not think others were.\n  S. 14, though, would have forced Congress to vote on the cancellation \nof a budget item proposed by the President. However, it needed only a \nsimple majority of both Houses of Congress to override the President's \nveto. This proposition was a viable alternative if it was still a fact, \nas I suggest it was and maybe still is, that S. 4 as introduced would \nfall to a filibuster. I do not think any of us wanted that.\n  S. 4, as originally introduced, would be the legislative equivalent \nof shooting oneself in the foot, in my view. If we are serious about \nreducing the deficit, tax expenditures should be included in any line-\nitem veto legislation. Anything else would be a half measure. The \nsignificantly revised S. 4 that has been introduced by the Republican \nleader as of yesterday has come a considerable distance towards \naddressing the concerns that this Senator had with that portion of S. \n4. But S. 4 also had a lot of good things in it.\n  Mr. President, a little history, I think, is in order. On February 3, \n1993, the Budget Committee held a hearing on the impact of tax \nexpenditures on the Federal budget. What we found was rather startling. \nAt that time, tax expenditures were projected to cost more than $400 \nbillion and were slated to increase to $525 billion by the year 1997. \nToday, tax expenditures are $450 billion and are projected to rise to \n$565 billion in 1999.\n  Like entitlement programs, tax expenditures cost the treasury \nbillions of dollars each year. And like entitlements, they receive \nlittle scrutiny once they are enacted into law. Even though they \nincrease the deficit like mandatory programs, tax expenditures escape \nany sort of fiscal oversight. Indeed, by masquerading as tax \nexpenditures, a program or activity that might not otherwise pass \ncongressional muster could be indirectly funded. Certainly I would say \nthat we have to take a look at these things and a close look.\n  Office of Management and Budget Director Alice Rivlin correctly \nsummed up the situation, and I quote:.\n\n       Tax expenditures add to the Federal deficit in the same way \n     that direct spending programs do.\n\n  If we are willing to subject annual appropriations to the President's \nveto pen, then that same oversight should be granted to the President \non tax expenditures. Pork is pork. We should be willing to say ``no'' \nto both spending pork and tax pork. The revised S. 4 finally recognizes \nsome of its earlier shortcomings, in the view of this Senator.\n  For too long, many of our colleagues have clung to the thin reed that \nwe can \n[[Page S4247]] solve the deficit by cutting only appropriated spending. \nUnfortunately, the reed has given way and we are sinking in an ocean of \nred ink.\n  In spite of the pay-as-you-go provisions of the 1990 Budget \nEnforcement Act, entitlement spending is the largest and fastest \ngrowing part of the Federal budget. The terrible truth is that \nentitlement or mandatory spending is projected to grow from about 55 \npercent of the Federal spending in the current fiscal year to 62 \npercent in the year 2005.\n  The surge occurs in Federal health care programs. They are the only \nprograms that will grow at a rate significantly faster than the \neconomy, increasing from 3.8 percent of the gross domestic product in \nfiscal year 1995 to 6 percent of GDP in 2005.\n  On the other hand, discretionary spending, which currently makes up \nonly about one-third of all of the Federal budget, has been \nsignificantly curbed. It is expected to decline as a percent of the \neconomy over the same time period.\n  However, we cannot take much comfort in this success story. As much \nas we cut away at the fat and well into the bone in appropriated \nspending, we get to a point of diminishing returns. We will not be able \nto balance the budget if we rely essentially only on appropriated \nspending, as anyone who understands the budget process knows. Sooner or \nlater we must look the deficit squarely in the eye and make some tough \nand painful choices.\n Entitlement spending and tax expenditures are two that we can no \nlonger avoid.\n\n  The new found Republican realism about a sunset provision in the \namended S. 4 is helpful in improving chances to pass the legislative \nline-item veto. This is a brandnew legislation that is untried and \nuntested. The sunset provisions will allow Congress to look at any \nglitches and problems that may arise. If for some reason the line-item \nveto does not perform to our expectation, we can trade it in and start \nanew.\n  I also have been stressing that the only way to bring down the \ndeficit is on a bipartisan basis. I support the line-item veto \nlegislation, but some of my colleagues have doubts. A sunset provision \nwill ease some of those concerns because this bill will not be carved \nin stone. We will be able to revisit the bill at a day certain and make \nsome changes if necessary.\n  During markup, I offered several sunset provisions that failed on \nparty line votes. I am pleased that the majority has reconsidered.\n  The legislative line-item veto does not exist in a vacuum. We must \nrevisit the entire Budget Act in 1998. That is when the caps and other \nmajor provisions, including the one that creates a 60-vote point of \norder and the system of sequesters, expires. What better time to \nreexamine the legislative line-item veto?\n  Madam President, I have finally had an opportunity to review the \nmajority party substitute version of the line-item veto legislation. I \nmust say at the outset that I am extremely disappointed by the manner \nin which this bill was brought to the floor and how the majority party \napparently hopes to force this bill through very quickly.\n  As the majority leader knows and as the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee knows, there are many on this side of the aisle who would \nlike to see a line-item veto bill pass this Senate. I think it will. We \nhave been working on a bipartisan basis to do so. As evidence of the \nbipartisan effort, I note that the majority leader and the minority \nleader were cosponsors of S. 14 as introduced by Chairman Domenici and \nmyself. As a long-time supporter of the line-item veto legislation, I \nam very encouraged that this topic is finally being debated on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I hope and trust that the majority leader will back off of some of \nthe tactics and the ``hurry up'' actions that have been so far \ndemonstrated.\n  I am reminded of what the great historian Barbara Tuchman wrote about \nthe 14th-century knights of war:\n\n       They were concerned with action, not the goal--which was \n     why the goal was so rarely attained.\n\n  If we can have a free and open debate, absent hardball politics, and \nif we can keep our focus on the attainable goal and not just partisan \nreactions, we can prevail.\n  Madam President, I have some concerns regarding the substitute that \nis before the Congress, although I think it is a vast improvement over \nwhat we have considered previously. Although I understand the need for \nchanges and compromises, this bill raises some questions that I think \nneed to be fully explored.\n  For example, the majority party has chosen to vest in the enrolling \nclerk the power to divide up appropriations bills into many, perhaps \nhundreds, of pieces. How might such a procedure actually work in \npractice? Is such a procedure realistic? Legislative drafters already \nare coming up with ways to get around this bizarre mechanism.\n  There are many other troubling questions regarding the substitute, \nbut I think they can be corrected if we can work together, at least \ncorrected to satisfy this Senator and most on this side of the aisle.\n  For example, what is to prevent the Congress from enacting provisions \nthat do not take effect until other specified provisions take effect? \nOr, what about a provision that spends $80 million if, and only if, a \nsecond provision spends $20 million, but suspends $100 million if the \nsecond provision is not enacted? What about a provision that funds \nevery item specified in a separate piece of legislation?\n  The majority substitute does not allow the President to veto these \nprovisions effectively. The legislative process may end up the victim \nmuch more so than all would like to see.\n  The measure before Members raises constitutional questions as well, \nas Senator Byrd so eloquently pointed out earlier today. It would be \nvery unfortunate if after all of these years the Congress was finally \nsuccessful in passing a line-item veto, only to have it declared \nunconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Other proposals such as S. \n14 do not have that potential Achilles heel.\n  There are also issues which the substitute does not address that I \nthink it should. I believe that most Members would agree as they look \nat the measure objectively. For example, the President cannot--I \nemphasize cannot--reduce any amount. The President can only sign or \nkill it. He cannot scale it back to a more reasonable amount. Under S. \n4, the President had that option of reducing the amount.\n  In closing, let me say, Madam President, what about the goal of \nreducing the deficit? S. 14 wisely includes a lockbox to ensure that \nany money saved in rescission goes to reduce the deficit. The \nRepublican substitute includes no deficit reduction lockbox. I think it \nshould. And I think when my friends on that side of the aisle take a \nlook at that, they will agree.\n  In conclusion, then, I believe the substitute needs further \nconsideration, although I am disappointed by the process used by the \nmajority leader to force a cloture vote immediately--supposedly \ntomorrow--to cut off debate on this important matter. I am encouraged \nthat the substitute bill has moved in the right direction by including \ntax expenditures, which previous versions of that did not. Yet it is \nfar from a perfect bill and could be improved by addressing some of the \nconcerns that I have mentioned and others that will be addressed by \nSenator Levin and other of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, in the hours and days ahead, I hope we can put aside \noverheated rhetoric and partisanship on the legislative line-item veto. \nNo Senator has a monopoly on all of the issues. No Senator is all right \nor all wrong. No Senator has all the answers.\n  I hope that we can accommodate as many views as possible during the \nupcoming debate. If we stay on this track, Madam President, we will \npass a legislative line-item veto--or call it what you will--that is as \ngood as a promise that I think we can do in keeping faith with the \nAmerican people. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be very brief. I have a lot of responses to the \nstatement from Senator Exon, but I think for the record, it might be \ninteresting to point out that I count 22 of the 34 amendments from that \nside come from Senator Exon.\n  [[Page S4248]] One, sunset in 1997; sunset in 1998. When I see the \namendments, I understand the frustration of the majority leader. I can \nassure the Senator from Nebraska there may be changes made to this \nbill. One thing I can assure the Senator from Nebraska. We will not \nchange the two-thirds majority required to override the President's \nveto.\n  If there is anything that is clearly unconstitutional, it is to call \na veto a majority vote by one House. I would be more than happy to \nrespond to the other remarks of the Senator from Nebraska after the \nSenator from Michigan and then the Senator from Wisconsin finish their \nstatements.\n  I also finally state unequivocally, the Senator from Indiana on the \nfloor here was not setting up any straw men. The Senator from Indiana \nhas been involved in this issue with me for 8 years. The Senator from \nIndiana does not set up straw men.\n  I have watched the debate, and the Senator from Indiana has \nconducted, I thought, a very illuminating and important debate between \nhimself and Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd, as always, does an outstanding \njob, and I am proud of the outstanding job defending his point of view \nand his perspective that the Senator from Indiana conducted himself in \nsuch fashion. I am proud. I reject any allegation that he sets up any \nstraw men.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, if I could correct just one impression \nthat the Senator from Arizona said about the filing of amendments.\n  As a manager of the bill, I filed a whole series of amendments before \n1 o'clock today, which I had to do to protect this side from a whole \nseries of important matters that we thought were necessary on this \nside.\n  I simply advise my colleague from Arizona that as of the breakdown, \nthe Senator from Nebraska has only four amendments, and I think we will \ndismiss two of those, which gives the manager of the bill only two \namendments. And I think, by any measure, that is reasonable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first let me comment on a couple of the \npoints the Senator from Nebraska made in which I concur. He indicated \nmost, if not all of us, support some form of line-item veto, and I \nthink he is right. I think that just about every Member of this body \nwants to give the President greater control over individual items in \nappropriations bills. I am one of those. I happen to support S. 14. I \nthink it is constitutional, which is very important to me, and I think \nit gives the President additional power without running into the clear \nprovisions of the Constitution relative to the presentment clause.\n  I also agree with the Senator from Nebraska when he says not to rely \ntoo much on line-item veto to cure our budget problems and our deficit \nproblems. It has proven historically not to be a significant cure in \nStates when it comes to the amount of money which has been vetoed by \nGovernors. It is a deterrent. That is worth something, clearly.\n  We, at one point, submitted a budget, I believe, to President Reagan \nand said, ``If you had line-item veto, what would you veto?'' And I \nthink his total vetoes came to be about 1 or 2 percent of the deficit \nthat year, a very small percentage of the deficit. So it is not a major \ncure for willpower.\n  It may or may not do some good, depending on how the President uses \nit. It actually can do some harm if he uses it wrong. Nonetheless, the \nSenator from Nebraska is correct that it is not going to significantly \nreduce the deficit. It may help somewhat slightly, but do not rely on \nit too heavily.\n  Further evidence of that is the fact that the President controls \nevery line of the budget that he submits to the Congress. Each line in \nthose budgets is a line which has been approved by the President or the \nPresident's staff.\n  During the 12 years of the two Reagan administrations and the Bush \nadministration, six times out of the 12 years, the appropriations in \nCongress exceeded those requests. Six times Congress reduced \nappropriations below the level requested by those two Presidents.\n  If you look at the average appropriations level that the Congress \nappropriated compared to the appropriations requested by the President, \nagain, where the President has control over every line, in the Reagan \nyears, the average appropriation by Congress was $1.7 billion less than \nrequested by President Reagan, and the appropriations during the Bush \nyears were $3.7 billion less than the appropriations requested by the \nPresident.\n  So we cannot just say Congress has been the source of the deficit \nproblem. It has been a joint problem. Presidents, as well as Congress, \nhave contributed to it at least equally--at least equally. And if you \nlook at averages, slightly more by the executive branch than by the \nlegislative branch. So when we talk about those add-ons, those back-\nhome projects, that does not explain the deficits that we have run up \nduring the 1980's. It is much deeper than that. It is much more \ncomplicated than that, and if we think line-item veto is going to cure \nit, we are making a mistake, because it will not. Will it help? I think \nit could.\n  In my book, it has to be constitutional or I cannot vote for it. S. \n14 is constitutional and I am able to support that and vote for it as a \nsubstitute to the substitute when we get to it. But the Dole substitute \nbefore us, I believe, is unconstitutional and is unworkable.\n  Before the Dole substitute was presented to us, we had two line-item \nveto bills reported out of the Budget and Governmental Affairs \nCommittees, two different line item vetoes. One was an enhanced \nrescission and one was expedited rescission. One clearly \nconstitutional, one of debatable constitutionality.\n  But now we have a third one, a very different bill than was reported \nby either the Budget or the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The top constitutional experts of the Clinton administration and the \nBush administration do not probably agree on a whole lot, but they do \nagree on one thing. As much as they want to see the enactment of a \nline-item veto, because both President Bush and President Clinton want \nline-item veto, both their top constitutional experts have serious \nconstitutional problems with this separate enrollment approach which is \nnow before us. I think it is fair to say that both--and I am going to \nread their words --believe that this approach is unconstitutional.\n  The Constitution, as Senator Byrd has gone through this afternoon, \nestablishes the method by which laws are enacted and by which they are \nrepealed. It specifies a bill becomes a law when it is passed by both \nHouses of Congress, signed by the President, or if the bill is vetoed \nby the President, when that veto is overridden by a two-thirds vote in \neach House.\n  The substitute before us purports to create a third way by which a \nlaw can be made, by giving the Clerk of the House of Representatives \nand the Secretary of the Senate the power to enroll and to send to the \nPresident for his signature bills that have never passed either House \nof the Congress.\n  Madam President, I do not believe that we can or should seek to \noverride constitutionally mandated procedures by statute. We cannot do \nit if we wanted to, but we should not do it and should not try to do \nit.\n  Article I, section 7 of the Constitution says that each ``bill which \nshall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate shall be \npresented to the President for signature.''\n  The Constitution does not say that pieces and parts of bills passed \nby the Congress may be presented to the President for signature. It \ndoes not say that line items or paragraphs or subparagraphs of bills \npassed by the Congress shall be presented. It says that bills passed by \nthe Congress shall be presented to the President for signature.\n  Lewis Fisher of the Congressional Research Service explained the \nproblem several years ago when he testified relative to an early \nversion of this separate enrollment approach, and this is what Dr. \nFisher said.\n  He said under that bill:\n\n       The enrolling clerk would take a numbered section or \n     unnumbered paragraph and add to it an enacting or resolving \n     clause, provide the appropriate title and presumably affix a \n     new Senate or House bill number. Such a bill, in the form as \n     fashioned by the enrolling clerk, and submitted to the \n     President would not appear to have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n\n  [[Page S4249]] In other words, the bill that is presented, or the \nbills, the wheelbarrow full of bills that is presented to the \nPresident, has not passed the Senate and the House. It is different \nfrom the bill that we passed. It is bits and pieces of a bill that we \npassed, and that is the problem with the Dole substitute before us. It \npurports to give to the Clerk of the House of Representatives or to the \nSecretary of the Senate the power to attest and to send to the \nPresident for his signature bills which have not been passed by the \nHouse or the Senate.\n  Under the Constitution, a bill cannot become law unless that bill has \npassed both Houses of Congress.\n  Madam President, I have no doubt that the Congress could, after \npassing an appropriations bill, take that bill up again, divide it into \n100, 200, even 1,000 separate pieces and pass those pieces again as \nfreestanding measures. Those separate bills then would have been \napproved by the Congress and could be sent to the President for \nsignature. I even suppose that we could adopt some form of streamlined \nprocedures for consideration of these separate parts, these separate \npieces of legislation.\n  While that approach would result in the President spending hours and \nhours signing various pieces of a single appropriation bill, it at \nleast would be constitutional. We would have adopted the same bills \nthat the President is signing. But the bill before us contains no \nrequirement for any consideration of the separate measures by the \nSenate and the House. Rather, it directs the enrolling clerks to create \nsuch separate bills and to send them to the President as if--as if--\npassed by the Congress.\n  The Supreme Court held in the Chadha case that the legislative steps \noutlined in article I of the Constitution cannot be amended by \nlegislation. We cannot amend article I of the Constitution by \nlegislation. We may want to do it. We may have a good motive in doing \nit. Our goal may be important and great. But we cannot amend the \nConstitution by legislation. And this is what the Chadha Court said:\n\n       The explicit prescription for legislative action contained \n     in article I cannot be amended by legislation. The \n     legislative steps outlined in article I are not empty \n     formalities. They were designed to assure that both Houses of \n     Congress and the President participate in the exercise of \n     lawmaking authority.\n       The bicameral requirements--the presentment clauses, the \n     President's veto, and the Congress' power to override a \n     veto--were intended to erect enduring checks on each branch \n     and to protect the people from the improvident exercise of \n     power by mandating certain prescribed steps. To preserve \n     those checks and to maintain the separation of powers, the \n     carefully defined limits on the power of each branch must not \n     be eroded.\n       With all the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness, and \n     potential for abuse, we have not yet found a better way to \n     preserve freedom than by making the exercise of power subject \n     to the carefully crafted restraints spelled out in the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Madam President, President Clinton favors a line-item veto. His top \naide, the top official of the administration on matters of \nconstitutional law, Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, \ntestified earlier this year that the enhanced rescission bill \nintroduced by the Senator from Arizona would probably be found to be \nconstitutional, a conclusion with which I happen to disagree but \nnonetheless the top constitutional lawyer in this administration found \nthat the approach of Senator McCain would likely be found to be \nconstitutional.\n  However, even Mr. Dellinger could not find a way to get around the \nconstitutional problems with the Dole substitute now before us. The \nseparate enrollment approach, Mr. Dellinger testified, runs into the \nplain language of the presentment clause in article I. This is what Mr. \nDellinger said:\n\n       As much as I regret saying so, I think that the proposal \n     for separate enrollment also raises significant \n     constitutional issues. I think it is either invalid under the \n     presentment clause or at a minimum it raises such complicated \n     questions under the presentment clause that it is a foolhardy \n     way to proceed.\n\n  This is the sentence that I now want to emphasize of Assistant \nAttorney General Dellinger.\n\n       If we and all our predecessors are right--we and all of our \n     predecessors in that office are right--\n       that which has to be presented to the President is the \n     thing that passed the House and the Senate and that which \n     passed the House and the Senate is the bill they voted on \n     final passage, not some little piece of it or a series of \n     little pieces of it.\n\n  Now, on March 16, just a week ago, in a memorandum to Judge Mikva, \nWhite House Counsel, Dr. Dellinger, reiterated the constitutional \nproblems with the amendment now before us, with the Dole substitute, \nand this is what he said.\n\n       On what seems to us to be the best reading of the \n     presentment clause, what must be presented to the President \n     is the bill in exactly the form in which it was voted on and \n     passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     rather than a measure or a series of measures that \n     subsequently has been abstracted from that bill by the clerk \n     of the relevant House.\n\n  That is the top constitutional official in the administration, in \nthis administration that wants line-item veto. That is what they have \nconcluded. The best reading of the presentment clause says that the \nbill going to the President has to be the same bill in the same form \nthat we passed.\n  He went on to state--but, of course, this constitutional question is \nopen to debate like all constitutional questions, I presume. He also \nsaid that it would have a better chance to be ruled constitutional if \nit made some provision, in this approach, for Congress to take up the \nseparate bills and to pass them en bloc.\n  The substitute before us, Madam President, contains no such provision \nto address the constitutional infirmity that Mr. Dellinger pointed out.\n  Now, President Bush has also been a strong advocate of line-item \nveto, but the top constitutional law expert of his administration also \nhas taken the position that separate enrollment is unconstitutional. \nFormer Assistant Attorney General Timothy Flanagan testified before the \nJudiciary Committee as follows:\n\n       One type of line-item veto statute would attempt to avoid \n     the problem of the Constitution's all-or-nothing approach to \n     Presidential action on bills by providing that after a bill \n     had passed the House and Senate, individual titles or items \n     of the bill would be enrolled and presented to the President \n     as separate bills.\n       Such an approach suffers from a number of constitutional \n     defects. First and foremost, the Constitution plainly implies \n     that the same bill upon which the Congress voted is to be \n     submitted to the President. If the Constitution's text is to \n     be read otherwise to permit the presentment requirement to be \n     met by dividing a bill up into individual pieces after \n     Congress has passed it and before presentment, then there is \n     no logical reason why the opposite process could not be \n     permitted. Congress could require individual appropriation \n     bills as well as others to be aggregated into a giant omnibus \n     bill before presentment to the President as a single opus.\n\n  And again this is what President Bush's top constitutional lawyer in \nthe Justice Department is telling us. He concluded:\n\n       In my view, the Constitution permits neither result but \n     requires that the bill be presented to the President as \n     passed by Congress.\n\n  As passed by Congress.\n  So the top constitutional experts, Madam President, of both this \nadministration and the prior administration agree that the separate \nenrollment approach taken by this substitute has great constitutional \nproblems.\n  Now, the amendment before us attempts to address the constitutional \nproblems with the separate enrollment approach by stating that each, \neach of the separate bills enrolled and sent to the President ``shall \nbe deemed to be a bill under clauses 2 and 3 of section 7 of article I \nof the Constitution.''\n  Now we are going to amend the Constitution by a statutory deeming \nprocess, and how convenient.\n  I suppose we could pass other laws, under this theory, which \ncontravene the Constitution, and deem those provisions to be \nconstitutional as well. We do not have that power. We did not have it \nbefore Chadha, when the Supreme Court wrote that we cannot amend the \nConstitution by legislation. And we do not have it after Chadha.\n  It does not do any good to deem separate measures as bills. The \nquestion is not whether they are bills in an abstract sense, the \nquestion is whether they are bills ``which shall have passed\" both \nHouses of Congress as required by the Constitution.\n  These bits and pieces, the product of disassembling a bill, these \nparts have not passed either House in that form \n[[Page S4250]] and may never have passed either House in that form. No \namount of deeming, as convenient as it is, can change that.\n  The Constitution does not say that pieces and parts of bills passed \nby the Congress may be presented to the President. It does not say that \nline-item vetoes or paragraphs or subparagraphs of bills passed by \nCongress shall be presented to the President. It says that the actual \nbills passed by Congress shall be presented to the President for \nsignature.\n  This may all sound like process and a technicality, but it is the \nessence of what we do around here. A vote for a bill is not the same \nthing as a separate vote on each of its provisions. The bill is a whole \nand we finally vote on it as a whole. We all vote for bills. I think \nevery one of us has said on the floor of this Senate or on the floor of \nthe House or in a speech somewhere: I do not agree with every provision \nin this bill but I am going to vote for it because on balance there are \nmore good provisions than bad provisions.\n  When we, as Members of the Senate, vote for final passage of a \nparticular bill, we are not voting on each provision as though standing \nalone. We are voting for the whole. And the reality \nis--our real world is--that if we chop up a bill into its component \nparts for the President to sign we would be creating very different \nbills from the one bill that actually passed the Congress.\n  Let me just take the supplemental appropriations bill that we just \npassed. This was a defense supplemental appropriations bill that was \nadopted last week. By my count, there are approximately 78 separate \nitems in this bill and that does not include suballocations, which \nwould make it a much larger number of items. But just not including \nsuballocations, I think there are 78 separate items in this bill. Each \nof these would be enrolled under the Dole substitute before us. That \nincludes 12 paragraphs of appropriations for military personnel, 20 \nparagraphs of rescissions--20 paragraphs of rescissions of DOD \nappropriations--and 18 paragraphs of rescissions of non-DOD funds. \nThere are also 20 general and miscellaneous provisions in here, in this \nbill we just passed, which would have to be enrolled separately under \nthe amendment before us.\n  I voted for this supplemental bill. I did not vote for each of those \n78 items separately and I would not have voted for a lot of those \nseparately. Under the approach that is before us now, the President \nwould be voting--each separate 78, the President would be deciding on \nwhether to sign 78 separate bills, whereas we did not vote separately \non 78 separate bills, and a whole bunch of those may not have passed as \n78 separate bills. And the whole bill may not have passed had some of \nthose 78 separate items not been included in the bill.\n  If we had a separate vote on each of the separate items in the \ndefense appropriations bill, some might have passed, some might not \nhave passed. But we did not do that. We voted on the package. If we had \nvoted again on each of these items separately, the final outcome might \nhave been very different. Some may have voted for the final bill, this \nfull bill, specifically because of the inclusion of specific items in \nthe package. That may have actually won the vote of some of us. We do \nthat all the time. ``Unless these provisions, 1, 10, 30, and 38, are in \nthis bill, I cannot vote for it.'' If those items were in separate \nbills, some of us may have chosen not to vote for this single \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  Let me just give a couple of examples. Section 108 of the defense \nappropriations bill contains a requirement for a report on the cost and \nthe source of funds for military activities in Haiti. This is a \nseparate section of the bill, section 108. Under the substitute before \nus, it would be separately enrolled and the President could veto it. \nBut some of us may have voted for the funds provided in this bill for \noperations in Haiti only because there was another provision in this \nbill requiring a very important report. Would the appropriation have \npassed without the reporting requirement? We do not know. We did not \nvote on it.\n  Section 106 of this bill contains defense rescissions. Those \nrescissions are intended to pay for the appropriations that are made in \nthe bill. We are rescinding some previous appropriations in order to \npay for some current appropriations. Under the amendment before us, \neach of the rescissions would be separately enrolled and sent to the \nPresident for signature. The President could veto any or all of the \nrescissions. But how many of us would have voted for the appropriations \nif they were not paid for by the rescissions? Would the appropriations \nhave passed without the rescissions? That is a very basic point. That \nwas a matter of real contention, as to whether or not we should be \nappropriating money in this supplemental unless we were defunding, \nunappropriating, rescinding previous appropriations. Would that bill \nhave passed without those rescissions? We do not know. We did not vote \non that.\n  Under the substitute before us, the President will decide whether to \nsign separately the rescissions and the appropriations. That is very \ndifferent from what we voted on, one package with both.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill that we passed last week was \nactually a rather simple bill as appropriations measures go. We \nroutinely pass appropriations bills that contain hundreds, even \nthousands of items. Here is a quick listing of last year's \nappropriations bills, how many items they had, not including what are \nnow called suballocations. I will get to that issue in a moment. But \nwithout getting even to pulling apart paragraphs, just looking at \nparagraphs themselves, numbered or unnumbered, without subdividing \nparagraphs into suballocations, last year's appropriations \nbills had the following number of items: Commerce, Justice, and State \nhad 214; Defense, 262; Transportation, 150; foreign ops, 150; \nAgriculture, 160; Treasury-Postal, 252.\n  I will stop there, and I ask unanimous consent the list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations--214\n       Defense Appropriations--262\n       Transportation Appropriations--150\n       Foreign Operations Appropriations--151\n       Agriculture Appropriations--162\n       Defense Construction Appropriations--45\n       Veterans Affairs, HUD, and Indep. Agencies--174\n       Treasury, Postal Service Appropriations--252\n       Legislative Branch Appropriations--114\n       District of Columbia Appropriations--86\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am told one of the omnibus \nappropriations bills that passed the Congress in the mid-1980's had \nover 2,000 line items. Again, I think that is without those \nsuballocations, so we could multiply that significantly.\n  Some of the items, by the way, some of the items in appropriations \nbills increase spending levels. We know that. That is what is usually \nthought of when we increase spending.\n  But other items in appropriations bills decrease spending levels or \nthey set conditions on spending or they prohibit spending for certain \npurposes. We have provisions in appropriations that reduce or limit \nspending. Those are rescissions. There are also conditions placed on \nexpenditures, and prohibitions, again, for spending for particular \npurposes.\n  If those provisions are placed in separate sections, as they \nfrequently have been in the past, they could be vetoed under the \nsubstitute before us. The President could use the line-item veto to \nactually repeal, to stop, the prohibitions on spending that we put in \nthe appropriations bills. That would increase spending. They are not \nuncommon. Limitations on appropriations or on rescissions are not \nuncommon. We have plenty of them just voted on. Yet, a line-item veto \ncould be used. When used against rescissions or prohibitions on \nlimitations, it could end up increasing spending and not cutting \nspending.\n  The bottom line is that Members who vote for an appropriations bill \nusually do not support every item in it. We do not vote on each of \nthose items separately. We would not know what the result would be if \nwe cast such votes on each item separately. We finally vote on an \nentire packet. That is the bill that we pass, and that is the bill that \nmust be sent to the President under the Constitution. I believe that in \nan appropriations bill of any size, each of \n[[Page S4251]] us likes some of the provisions and dislikes others. \nThat balancing is the essence of the legislative process. It is what \nenables us to legislate. In many cases, it is what enables us to cut \nappropriations.\n  For instance, I may be willing to accept a significant cut in a \nprogram that affects my State because I know that a sacrifice will be \nshared, because I know that in the bill it causes a cut in a program \nthat is good for my State where other programs that benefit other \nStates are being cut in the same bill. That does not mean that I would \nhave voted for the cut on the one appropriation involving my State as a \nfreestanding measure. It is because the pain is distributed as part of \na package so that we are often able to support an overall measure.\n  The Constitution says one thing that is so critical to this \nsubstitute. Only those bills which shall have passed the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives are to be sent to the President for signature. \nThe substitute before us says something quite different; that the \nPresident would get pieces of bills that we have passed instead of the \nbills themselves. That approach is plainly at odds with the \nrequirements of the Constitution, and we should reject it.\n  Madam President, I do not know if there are others who are waiting to \nspeak. I have some additional points that I want to make on the \npractical problems with the enrollment process that relate to an \namendment that I will be offering tomorrow. I am wondering if I might \nask my friend from Wisconsin about how long he expects to be, if I may \nask unanimous consent to make that inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I think roughly half an hour.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will try to conclude in about 10 \nminutes and then give my friend some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the majority leader said yesterday that \nthe Senate would have an easy time adopting this substitute. One of the \nreasons was that most of its provisions have been considered by the \nSenate and passed. There is a lot of new language in the substitute. It \nis worth taking some time to analyze that new language. For example, \nthe first half of the substitute is devoted to points of order against \nany appropriations bill that fails to include in the bill language \ndetail that is in the committee report. I do not think that has been \nproposed before.\n  We tried to check the separate enrollment approach. I do not believe \nthat has ever been part of the bill before. I do not think it has been \nconsidered by the Senate. If I am wrong, I will stand corrected. But it \nis going to have a significant impact on the appropriations process. It \nis going to be much more rigid. We are going to have much lengthier, \ncumbersome appropriations bills. But, nonetheless, whether it is good \nor bad, it is different from what we have had before.\n  But I want to focus on a different provision. That is the definition \nof the term ``item.'' This provision is the key to the entire bill \nbecause an ``item'' is what must be separately enrolled. That is the \ntest of whether or not the enrollment must be made separate by the \nclerk. There is some very significant new language in this substitute \nwhich again, to the best of our ability, does not appear in previous \nlegislation that we have considered.\n  The term ``item'' means (a) with respect to an appropriations \nmeasure; No. 1, any numbered section; No. 2, any unnumbered paragraph, \nor, No. 3, any allocation or suballocation of an appropriation made in \ncompliance with section (2)(a) contained in a numbered section or an \nunnumbered paragraph.\n  It is those words ``allocation or suballocation'' which are the new \nmaterial. The earlier bills referred to items as being either numbered \nsections of a bill or unnumbered paragraphs of a bill. So the enrolling \nclerk could take any numbered section or any unnumbered paragraph and \nseparate it out and enroll it. That is what has been considered in \nthese bills today relative to separate enrollment. But now in the \nsubstitute before us we have an additional thing that has to be \nsubdivided out. That is something called an allocation or a \nsuballocation of an appropriation that is contained in either a \nnumbered section or an unnumbered paragraph.\n  How do we break the allocation or suballocation out of a bill and \nenroll it as a separate bill? We do not have to wonder totally about \nthat because the Senator from Indiana has already asked the enrolling \nclerk to put together a sample appropriations bill for us based on last \nyear's Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill and has asked the \nenrolling clerk to take that actual bill and to subdivide it according \nto this substitute. That is what the Senator from Indiana called a \ntrial run. He is a very, very thorough and a very thoughtful Senator \nand took the time to go to the enrolling clerk and say, ``Here, take \nlast year's State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill and apply the \napproach that is used in the substitute to that bill.''\n  He explained on the floor the other day--and he explained again this \nafternoon--that we have all kinds of new technology. We can use \ncomputers. We can punch buttons, and we can subdivide bills in pieces. \nWe do not have to have the enrolling clerks in green eyeshades who are \ntrying to figure out what is going on and type things out in longhand. \nWe have computers. ``Modern technology'' is what the Senator referred \nto; ``miracle of modern technology.'' It is no longer a difficult \nprocess. He used the words ``easy, accurate and fair.'' I believe those \nare his words. I hope I am quoting him correctly. He quoted the \nenrolling clerk last week. He said it is at least 1,000 times faster \nthan the old system with today's technology. Then he said he asked the \nenrolling clerk to do a trial run. He took the largest bill that we \npassed, State-Justice-Commerce and Judiciary, and asked him to \nseparately enroll it.\n  Well, the stack of paper which we got from the enrolling clerk was \npretty thick. Here is a copy of the way it came out. This is what we \nsent to the President last year. This is what goes to the President \nthis year. The pamphlet was about 50 pages long.\n There are 582 bills in here, or items. This is just one appropriation \nbill. This is a 3-inch-thick stack. Mind you, this is not a 3-inch \nbill. This is 582 bills here that go to the President--each separate, \nsigned by the Speaker, signed by the President of the Senate, sent to \nthe President for signature. But that is only the writer's cramp part \nof it. That is interesting, but that is just hours and days of the \nPresident's time.\n\n  Another interesting question is what is in these pieces of paper, \nthis trial run, this bill, that was said to be so successful by our \nfriend from Indiana. What is the product when you punch the computer \nand come out with 582 pages, when you suballocate a paragraph, you rip \nout a paragraph, and you get a bill that can stand on its own, with \nfour corners? We tried looking at that. Here is one of the bills. The \nChair has good eyes, but I am afraid this is far away. I will read it. \nIt has all the formal headings, and it sure looks like a bill. If you \ntook a quick glance at that, you would say it is a bill. It has fancy \nwriting at the top; it is italicized. All good bills are italicized. \n``103d Congress, second session, in Washington,'' and then it says, \n``An act making appropriations for the Department of Commerce, Justice, \nand State, related agencies * * * be it enacted * * * the following \nsums are appropriated out of the Treasury''--and then you get to the \ntext of the bill. What looks like a bill is incomprehensible. This is \nthe text of that bill. It says, ``of which $200,000 shall be available \npursuant to subtitle (b) of title I of said act.''\n  That is the bill the President is supposed to sign in this test run. \nWhat act? This act? No, not this act. If you go back to the bill which \nno longer exists, which has been cut up like a salami into all these \nslices, then you can figure out that they are not relating to this act. \nIt is some other act. It is the crime bill of last year. The computer \ngenerated this in a successful trial run. Hundreds of pages are just \nlike this.\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, has the Senator ever examined \nthe appropriations bills that are normally passed through here and \ntried to ascertain which funds went where, under what circumstances, \nand maybe he can explain why it takes days, weeks, sometimes months, to \nfigure \n[[Page S4252]] out who got what money under what circumstances? I \nsuggest--and I ask the Senator from Michigan if that is more \ncomplicated than that is, since I have spent a lot of years trying to \nfigure out where the pork goes in appropriations bills and it has taken \nweeks and months for experts to figure it out. I think it might be \neasier to figure it out that way. All they have to do is pick up the \nphone and ask, ``What is that $200,000 or $300,000 for?'' And then they \ncan respond.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Where do you look to find out?\n  Mr. McCAIN. You call up the people who wrote the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The bill----\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is far better, in my view, to have a single line there \nthan the pork that is hidden away and tucked into little areas of the \nappropriations bills which sometimes people never ever find.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I tell my friend that at least you can find them if you \nlook. In this bill you cannot find them. That is the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is the bill. That applies to a certain section, \nwhich all you have to do is ask, ``What does it apply to?'' If the \nPresident asks that and it applies to a piece of pork, he can say, \n``Fine, I will veto that.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the whole bill. It says, ``$200,000 shall be \navailable pursuant to subtitle (b) of title''----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, and they might say, ``Well, it is a special project \nin Michigan.'' And the President might say, ``Fine, thanks. Now I know \nthat, and I will veto it.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is no way of knowing if it is a special project. \nThis is the entire bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All they have to do is ask.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can say to my friend from Arizona, when the computer \nsplit up this appropriations bill into these pieces, this is the bill \nwhich the President signed. He can ask day and night for all the \ninformation he wants. That is what the bill says. In an appropriations \nbill now, sure it may take you some time to figure out what the \ncrosswalks are, but you can find out from that bill and the conference \nreport for that bill exactly what it is. In this, 571 bills that are \ngoing to the President, each one a separate bill, and it is gibberish, \nyou cannot figure out what that is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I can respond to my colleague, and I know we are \nskirting the rules of the Senate. All I have to do is ask, ``What \nsection is that under; what part of the entire bill was enrolled by the \nenrolling clerk?'' There was a bill that was enrolled, and what does \nthat apply to? I think that is pretty easy. I thank my colleague for \nhis patience.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My understanding is that the whole bill is not enrolled by \nthe clerk. I am wondering whether the Senator is saying the bill, \nbefore it was disintegrated, was enrolled.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It was passed by both Houses. So all I had to do was pick \nup the bill and say, ``See what was in it.'' That is not really \ndifficult.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question of my friend was, Was the bill that was passed \never enrolled?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Portions were enrolled that have appropriations \nassociated with them, obviously. But the bill as passed is available \nfor reference to be looked at to find out where that applies to. In my \nview, that is far better than looking through bills. And I have spent \nhours in fine print, and we find out we are spending $2.5 million to \nstudy the effect on the ozone layer of flatulence in cows, and nobody \nknew it was in there until long after it was spent. That is what we are \ntrying to stop here by having a single bill there that says exactly \nwhat that is being spent for. All you have to do is go back to the \noriginal legislation that was passed and you will know--the President \nwill know whether or not to veto it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question is, When the Senator says the legislation that \nwas passed, the legislation no longer exists, and would my friend agree \nthat what he called ``the bill, as passed'' was never enrolled? Would \nhe agree?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would agree that the relevant portions of the bill that \nwere going to be signed into law were enrolled.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator agree that the bill as passed--passed as \none bill--was never enrolled as a bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. I agree that the relevant portions that are important \nto the taxpayers of America were enrolled in each separate bill. Again, \nI thank my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let us go back to what goes to the \nPresident. That goes to the President. It is without meaning. Nobody \ncan look at this bill. This is now a bill. This is no longer a part of \na bill. This is the bill. Nobody looking at that is going to be able to \nsay what it means. One is going to have to go back to a bill, which no \nlonger exists, and was never enrolled, to try to figure out what that \nmeans. Let me go into some more detail as to what the complications are \nwhen one does that.\n  This is another line that comes out of the bits and pieces of \nCommerce, State, Justice. This goes to the President. This is the bill. \nThis is it. It is one of 572 bills that go to the President. It reads, \nafter the italic and all of the other stuff--this is the total text:\n\n     . . . of which $6 million is available only for the \n     acquisition of high performance computing capability.\n\n  If he signs that, that is the law of the land. That is a law. The $6 \nmillion is available only for this. That is a limitation on something. \nIt is a limitation on the expenditure of funds.\n  What is it or what was it a part of?\n  Let us go back and look at what that was a part of. That was part of \nthe Patent and Trademark Office appropriations, State, Commerce, \nJustice, which said the following, ``For necessary expenses of the \nPatent and Trademark Office provided by law, including defense of suits \n. . . $83 million to remain available until expended.''\n  That is another bill, by the way. That goes to the President just \nthat way.\n  Now, if the President signs the $83 million, he then, if you look \nback at the bill that was passed but never enrolled, gets to this \nsection: ``Of which $6 million is available only for the acquisition of \nhigh performance computing capability.''\n  That is a restriction on the money. That is a restriction on the $83 \nmillion. It is a limit. If this is vetoed, then he has greater use of \nthe $83 million, not less.\n  This is an example where an appropriations bill's limitation, \nrestriction, limits the use of money, does not enlarge it.\n  And so, now what? Now we have an appropriation of $83 million and if \nthe President signs that, if he does not want to be limited in that \nway, he now has $83 million to spend without any limit. That is \nsupposed to be an elimination of pork, to give the President $83 \nmillion unlimited instead of $83 million with a restriction on it?\n  And then the one that I discussed with the Senator from California. \nThis is a bill that goes to the President. The total bill, total text: \n``Of which not to exceed $11 million shall remain available until \nexpended for furniture and furnishings related to new space alteration \nand construction projects; and''.\n  That is the text of a bill that goes to the President of the United \nStates. The Senator from California said, ``Well, gee, the President \nshould probably veto that. We do not need new furniture and \nfurnishings.''\n  This says no more than $11 million, not to exceed $11 million. This \nis a restriction on how much money will be spent on furniture. This \ndoes not say that $11 million must be spent. It says not to exceed. It \nis exactly the opposite of how the Senator from California interpreted \nthis. And that is the problem of giving this kind of gibberish to the \nPresident. There is no context.\n  In trying to give the President more power, we are creating an \napproach here which is going to be so cumbersome, so empty, such a \nvoid, so much of an unrecognizable mishmash, hundreds and hundreds and \nhundreds of bills to the President like this.\n  By the way, a lot of Governors have the line-item veto. A lot of \nStates have the line-item veto. I do not think there is one State in \nthe United States which has a separate enrollment approach. If there \nis, I would like to know about it.\n  This makes it impossible to know what you are signing. The bill that \npassed the legislature, in this case the Congress, no longer exists. It \nwas not enrolled as a bill. It was split up, sliced like a salami, \nsliced into bits and \n[[Page S4253]] pieces, and the bits and pieces go to the President. And \nsomehow or other, the President is going to figure out the context.\n  Well, I think we can do a lot better than that as a legislative \nprocess. That is not what this process is all about.\n  Again, this is not my summary here. This is not my test case. This is \na real test case of the Senator from Indiana, who gave a real bill to \nan enrolling clerk and said, ``Apply the Dole approach, the separate \nenrollment approach, with these suballocations''--I emphasize the word \n``suballocations,'' because that is what these are --``and apply it to \na real bill.'' That is a test case, said to be successful. ``Punch a \ncomputer button, folks. It will solve our problems for us.'' It is \ngoing to create a lot more problems than we solve.\n  I have no doubt that we could craft 582 separate bills that actually \nput together the right allocations and suballocations and the right \nconditions so that it all made sense and the bills could then really be \nsigned or vetoed independent of each other. They really could be bills. \nThey would not just be like pieces of a puzzle thrown up into the air \nand then coming down in 582 pieces. We could do that. We could actually \ncraft 582 bills. It would be a lot of work, but it is doable. But it is \nnot doable this way.\n  It would probably take a lot of effort of the Appropriations staff \nworking around the clock for weeks to do it. We would then all have to \nreview it carefully to make sure that they really did it right. Are the \nright conditions attached to the right appropriations?\n  There is a name for that process. It is called legislation. That is \nwhat the name of that process is: legislation. It is something that we \ndo as Members of Congress. It cannot be done by an enrolling clerk and \nit cannot be done by a computer.\n  So I say to my colleagues, wherever you are on this subject, whether \nyou are sure you are for the substitute or not, get a copy of this \nseparately enrolled document which the Senator from Indiana got \nproduced from the enrolling clerk. Get a copy of it before you vote on \nthe substitute before us, because whichever way you are voting on it, \nthis is what we are going to be producing for ourselves if it passes. \nAnd we ought to be very careful.\n  It is worth taking the time to analyze this process and to make sure, \nin trying to give the President additional power, we are not creating \ntotal uncertainty, total confusion, total chaos and, I think, at the \nend of the game, probably, instead of reducing expenditures, perhaps \nincreasing expenditures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I took much more than the 10 minutes I said I would take at the end.\n  I thank my friend from Wisconsin for his patience.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan for a very \nintelligent and persuasive argument.\n  I am sure, as the Senator from Michigan mentioned, he knows that the \nlegislation will be written differently. The process will change. In \nfact, this whole line-item veto is a change in the process.\n  The Senator from Michigan knows very well that in envisioning the \nseparate enrollments taking place that there will be legislation \nwritten in a different fashion so that they will be clear. Even if they \nare not totally clear, the President of the United States can ask what \nit applies to before he signs or vetoes a bill.\n  Finally, I found it interesting that the President of the United \nStates, in his comments today, did not find it a difficult task. In \nfact, he said, I believe, that he looked forward to having lots of \nsigning pens and does not view with such alarm the process or obstacles \nthat he may face as outlined by the Senator from Michigan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the \nmanagers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Simon amendment be temporarily set \naside so I can offer two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 356\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act \n  of 1974 to limit consideration of nonemergency matters in emergency \n                              legislation)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I send amendment numbered 356 \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 356.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment #374, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  . TREATMENT OF EMERGENCY SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Emergencty Appropriations.--Section 251(b)(2)(D)(i) of \n     the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new sentence: \n     ``However, OMB shall not adjust any discretionary spending \n     limit under this clause for any statute that designates \n     appropriations as emergency requirements if that statute \n     contains an appropriation for any other matter, event, or \n     occurrence, but that statute may contain rescissions of \n     budget authority.''.\n       (b) Emergency Legislation.--Section 252(e) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Act of 1985 is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new sentence: ``However, OMB shall \n     not designate any such amounts of new budget authority, \n     outlays, or receipts as emergency requirements in the report \n     required under subsection (d) if that statute contains any \n     other provisions that are not so designated, but that statute \n     may contain provisions that reduce direct spending.''.\n       (c) New Point of Order.--Title IV of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n\n                 ``point of order regarding emergencies\n\n       ``Sec. 408. It shall not be in order in the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill or joint \n     resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report \n     thereon, containing an emergency designation for purposes of \n     section 251(b)(2)(D) or 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 if it also provides an \n     appropriation or direct spending for any other item or \n     contains any other matter, but that bill or joint resolution, \n     amendment, or conference report may contain rescissions of \n     budget authority or reductions of direct spending, or that \n     amendment may reduce amounts for that emergency.''.\n       (d) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents set forth \n     in section 1(b) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \n     Control Act of 1974 is amended by inserting after the item \n     relating to section 407 the following new item:\n``Sec. 408. Point of order regarding emergencies.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This amendment is based upon legislation, S. 289, the Emergency \nSpending Control Act of 1995, which I introduced on January 26 with the \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], the manager of the bill before the \nCongress, as well as the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], the \nSenator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], and the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell].\n  This is a measure which had passed the other body in the 103d \nCongress by an overwhelming vote, and was designed to limit \nconsideration of nonemergency matters in emergency legislation.\n  The Washington Post, in an editorial dated August 22, 1994, called \nthis legislation ``a good idea.'' And it is a good idea.\n  The line-item veto legislation before Congress is intended to allow \nthe President to remove pork-barrel spending from appropriations bills. \nThis amendment is designed to prevent some of that pork from getting \ninto appropriations bills in the first place.\n  Anyone who has watched the congressional appropriations process at \nany length knows exactly what we are talking about. An emergency \nappropriations bill begins moving through the legislative process and \nit is almost as if a red alert is sounded that a fast-moving \nappropriations vehicle is on the launch pad.\n  What happens, Mr. President, is staff begin drafting legislative \nlanguage to insert some project that did not get funded in the regular \nappropriations bill or got left out in the conference \n[[Page S4254]] committee cutting floor, to insert into this bill.\n  In some cases, the proponents simply do not want to wait for a \nregular appropriations bill to present their arguments on behalf of an \nitem. They just see this opportunity of an emergency bill to shortcut \nthe whole process.\n  Mr. President, that is the way things have operated in Congress for \nmany years. That is the way the Federal dollars have poured into \nspecial projects that might not otherwise be able to compete for \nlimited Federal funds. That is the way that public confidence in our \nability to achieve fiscal discipline has been eroded over the years.\n  Mr. President, it is time that we stop this abuse of the legislative \nprocess. Emergency spending bills should be limited to what they are \nsupposed to be for--emergency spending. They should not become vehicles \nfor an odd assortment of spending projects.\n  As the Washington Post said in its editorial last year, there should \nbe no ``hitchhikers in an ambulance.'' Specifically, Mr. President, my \namendment limits emergency spending bills solely to emergencies by \nestablishing a new point of order against nonemergency matters other \nthan rescissions of budget authority or reductions in direct spending, \nspending in any bill that contains an emergency bill or an amendment to \nan emergency measure or a conference report that contains an emergency \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, as an additional enforcement mechanism this amendment \nadds further protection by prohibiting the Office of Management and \nBudget from adjusting the caps on discretionary spending or from \nadjusting the sequester process for direct spending and receipt \nmeasures for any emergency appropriations bill if the bill includes \nextraneous items other than rescissions of budget authority or \nreductions in direct spending.\n  Mr. President, though this proposal, like the underlying line-item \nveto measure, can help in the fight to reduce the deficit, I want to \nstress that process rules themselves do not solve the deficit problem. \nNo rule can--whether it is a procedural rule of the Senate, a statute, \nor even a constitutional amendment.\n  The only way we can lower the deficit is through specific policy \naction. Still, Mr. President, the budget rules can help Members \nmaintain the kind of discipline that is necessary to achieve our goals \nof deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that the main coauthor of this \namendment, or the bill that led to this amendment, is the manager on \nthe majority side, Senator McCain, who called me after the election and \nsaid, ``Aren't there some reforms items we can work on together?'' And \nthis is one of the first we chose to work together on.\n  In general, Mr. President, the rules require that new spending--\nwhether through direct spending, tax expenditures, or discretionary \nprograms--be offset with spending cuts or revenue increases.\n  However, the rules provide for exceptions in the event of an \nemergency, and I think, rightly so. The deliberate review through the \nFederal budget process, weighing one priority against another, in some \ncases may not permit a timely response to an international crisis, a \nnational disaster, or some other emergency.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we do not ask that earthquake victims \nfind a funding source before we send them aid. Mr. President, the \nemergency exception to our budget rules designed to expedite a response \nto an urgent need has become something very different. It has become a \nloophole, abused by those trying to circumvent the scrutiny of the \nbudget process.\n  These abuses have taken essentially two different forms: First, \ndeclaring some expenditure to be an emergency that is truly not an \nurgent or unexpected matter. A second approach is adding nonemergency \nmatters to emergency legislation that is receiving the special \naccelerated consideration that appropriate emergency measures are \nsupposed to get.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does not prevent every abuse of the \nemergency spending exceptions to our budget rule. In fact, it is only \naimed at the second problem I just identified. That is, adding those \nnonemergency matters to emergency legislation. This proposal will not \nstop Congress and the President from declaring a matter to be an \nemergency thus funding it by adding it to the deficit when it is not \ntruly urgent or unexpected.\n  I am not saying we should not do that. I am saying that is something \nwe must address in the future.\n  In fact, we saw this recently as last year when the Department of \nDefense's continuing peacekeeping operation in Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq, \nand Haiti were declared emergencies, suddenly with the costs added to \nour Federal budget deficit.\n  In most cases, those operations had been ongoing for significant \nperiods of time. They were not sudden, urgent, or unforeseen costs \nwhich would have justified circumventing budget rules.\n  I offered an amendment last year during floor consideration of H.R. \n3759 to strike these questionable provisions. Although there were only \na handful of votes for this amendment, a number of Members expressed \nconcern about whether such spending was appropriately tied to the \nCalifornia earthquake emergency. The basic problem is that when these \nspending items are packaged together on a fast track, it is difficult \nto separate questionable items for fear of jeopardizing the entire \nmeasure which is supposed to respond to some very immediate human needs \nin places such as California after the earthquake.\n  Although this amendment does not address this particular problem, it \nis aimed at limiting the abuses surrounding emergency measures by \nhelping to keep those measures clean of extraneous matters on which \nthere is not even an amendment to make an actual emergency designation.\n  When the appropriations bill to provide relief for the Los Angeles \nearthquake was introduced last session it officially did four things: \nProvided $7.8 billion for the Los Angeles quake, $1.2 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense peacekeeping operations that I mentioned, $436 \nmillion for Midwest flood relief, and $315 million more for the 1989 \nCalifornia earthquake.\n  Mr. President, it went a lot further than that. By the time the Los \nAngeles earthquake bill became law it also provided $1.4 million to \nfight potato fungus, $2.3 million for FDA pay raises, $14.4 million for \nthe National Park Service, $12.4 million for the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, $10 million for a new Amtrak station in New York. I guess we \ngot on the wrong side of the country on that one.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator respond to a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to respond.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator from Wisconsin saying the San Andreas \nfault extended all the way to New York City?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Apparently, under a new geographical approach used by \nthe Senate on this bill. We are hoping to change that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. To continue the litany, including the Amtrak station in \nNew York, we not only had a geographical amazement with regard to our \ncontinent, we had $40 million for the space shuttle in the California \nearthquake bill, $20 million for a fingerprints lab, $500,000 for the \nU.S. Trade Representative travel office, and $5.2 million for the \nBureau of Public Debt.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator say $20 million for a fingerprints lab?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is what I understand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Where is the location of that fingerprints lab?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I guess more the eastern side of the United States than \nthe west.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Although nonemergency matters attached to emergency \nbills are still subject to spending caps established in the current \nbudget resolution as long as total spending remains under those caps, \nas the Senator well knows, these unrelated spending matters are not \nrequired to be offset with spending cuts.\n  In the case of the Los Angeles earthquake bill because the caps have \nbeen reached, the new spending was offset by rescission, but in my view \nthose rescissions might otherwise have been used for deficit reduction. \nWe lost an opportunity for deficit reduction of those offsets because \nthey had to be \n[[Page S4255]] used to offset the items I have just listed that did not \nbelong in the California earthquake bill.\n  Moreover, by using emergency appropriations bills as a vehicle these \nextraneous proposals avoid the examination through which legislative \nproposals must usually go to justify Federal spending.\n  If there is truly a need to shift funds to these programs, an \nalternative vehicle--a regular supplemental appropriations bill, not an \nemergency spending bill--is what should be used.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today will end that kind \nof misuse of the emergency appropriations process. It is a reasonable \nfirst step toward cleaning up our emergency appropriations process.\n  Adding nonemergency extraneous matters to emergency appropriations \nnot only is an attempt to avoid legitimate scrutiny of our normal \nbudget process, it can also jeopardize our ability to actually provide \nrelief to those who are really suffering from a disaster to which we \nare trying to respond.\n  Just as importantly, adding superfluous material to emergency \nappropriations bills degrades those very budget rules on which we rely \nto impose fiscal discipline. Mr. President, I think that only \nencourages further erosion of our efforts to reduce the deficit.\n  This amendment that I am offering today to the line-item veto \nproposal passed the other body in the last Congress with overwhelming \nbipartisan support, first as a substitute amendment on a vote of 322 to \n99, and then as amended by a vote of 406 to 6.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this effort to end this abusive \npractice. As I indicated in my opening remarks, this amendment is both \nconsistent with and complementary to the underlying bill. It is an \nattempt to impose a prior restraint on Congress so that this kind of \nspending is not added in the first place to an emergency spending bill.\n  This amendment is an attempt to make a fundamental change in the way \nCongress has done business in the past. Slipping pork projects into \nappropriations bills may at one time have been the hallmark of a \nsuccessful legislator, but I hope in this new era of fiscal constraint \nit is time that this practice ended. I hope that this amendment will \nreceive the broad bipartisan support that it surely deserves.\n  I wish to conclude this part of my remarks by again thanking the \nSenator from Arizona for his work with me on this and for his rather \neffective questioning during my presentation.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Wisconsin \non this amendment. I think it is a very important one. I say with some \nmodesty, Mr. President, I believe that I have come over the years to \nhave a degree of expertise on pork-barrel spending. I have found over \nthe years that perhaps one of the most egregious abuses of the \nlegislative process is the issue which the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin addresses. That is, when we have a genuine emergency \nwhich requires near immediate action because it is clear that there are \nAmerican citizens who need help, and it is our responsibility as a \nCongress to cooperate with the executive branch and provide that much-\nneeded emergency relief--in the case that the Senator from Wisconsin \nwas describing, the terrible and tragic earthquakes in California--all \ntoo often we discover it is used as a vehicle for pet projects, \nappropriations which have no relation to the emergency, bear no \nrelation to the emergency, and in fact are an egregious abuse and \nmisuse of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  I would suggest, if the Senator from Wisconsin took the time, he and \nI could go back through virtually every emergency appropriations bill \nover the past 10 or 15 years and would find similar abuses, some of \nthem a bit amusing.\n  As I mentioned, San Andreas fault stretched all the way to New York \nCity in one case and, of course, fingerprint labs would probably not \nhave been appropriated in that fashion, at least without some \ndiscussion and debate.\n  But the point is that rather than look back and criticize, as I know \nneither the Senator from Wisconsin nor I wish to do, it is time to look \nforward, and that is to enact the amendment of the Senator from \nWisconsin to prevent it in the future, so there will not be any \ntemptation involved.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin not only on this bill but a \nvariety of other issues where he has worked on legislation which would \nrestore, to some degree anyway, the image that the American people want \nto have of this body, one that is responsible with their tax dollars, \nbehaves responsibly, and is not going to act in a fashion that makes \nthem lose their confidence in their ability to trust our Government.\n  Mr. President, I suggest to the Senator from Wisconsin that on this \namendment it is possible it may be accepted. I have obviously some \nobjections to a voice vote at this time. But I know that the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin may want the yeas and yeas, and that is perfectly \nacceptable. But I might suggest that he wait until tomorrow to ask for \nthe yeas and nays in case it happens to be acceptable. It may save time \nof this body.\n  So I assure the Senator from Wisconsin, if it is objected to, I would \nalso make sure that the yeas and nays are ordered and it not be \ndisposed of on a voice vote without his permission.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. That \nsounds like a very reasonable approach to this amendment. I hope it can \nbe accepted.\n  I wish to again thank him for his willingness and effort to work on a \nbipartisan basis, and also for his personal efforts and the efforts of \nhis staff over the years to identify those pork projects. I think it is \none of the reasons that these kinds of amendments have a chance of \nprevailing in this environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside my first \namendment so that I can call up my second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 362 to Amendment No. 347\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding deficit \n                        reduction and tax cuts)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have a second amendment No. 362 \npending at the desk that I call up and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself and \n     Mr. Simon, proposes an amendment numbered 362 to amendment \n     No. 347.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment No. 347, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DEFICIT REDUCTION AND \n                   TAX CUTS.\n\n       The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Federal budget according to the most recent \n     estimates of the Congressional Budget Office continues to be \n     in deficit in excess of $190 billion;\n       (2) continuing annual Federal budget deficits add to the \n     Federal debt which soon is projected to exceed $5 trillion;\n       (3) continuing Federal budget deficits and growing Federal \n     debt reduce savings and capital formation;\n       (4) continuing Federal budget deficits contribute to a \n     higher level of interest rates than would otherwise occur, \n     raising capital costs and curtailing total investment;\n       (5) continuing Federal budget deficits also contribute to \n     significant trade deficits and dependence on foreign capital;\n       (6) the Federal debt that results from persistent Federal \n     deficits transfers a potentially crushing burden to future \n     generations, making their living standards lower than they \n     otherwise would have been;\n       (7) efforts to reduce the Federal deficit should be among \n     the highest economic priorities of the 104th Congress;\n       (8) enacting across-the-board or so-called middle class tax \n     cut measures could impede efforts during the 104th Congress \n     to significantly reduce the Federal deficit, and;\n       (9) it is the Sense of the Senate that reducing the Federal \n     deficit should be one of the Nation's highest priorities, \n     that enacting an across-the-board or so-called middle class \n     tax cut during the 104th Congress would hinder efforts to \n     reduce the Federal deficit.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. I also ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Simon of Illinois be added as a cosponsor to this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment having to do with tax cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [[Page S4256]] Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise now to urge my colleagues to support the amendment that I have \noffered with the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and the Senator \nfrom Illinois [Mr. Simon], expressing the sense of the Senate that \nreducing the Federal deficit should be one of the Nation's highest \npriorities, and that enacting an across-the-board, so-called middle-\nclass tax cut during the 104th Congress would actually hinder efforts \nto reduce the Federal deficit.\n  I have argued against broad tax cuts on a number of occasions, and I \nam especially pleased to be joined by the Senator from Arkansas and the \nSenator from Illinois in this effort. And I might note that the manager \nof the bill on the minority side, Senator Exon, was one of the first \npeople to identify the absurdity in the rush to tax cuts. He has been a \nvery key leader on this issue, both in his own right and as the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee.\n  All of these Senators are passionate advocates for deficit reduction. \nI am also pleased to see that many others share our concern that broad \ntax cuts will impede our efforts to reduce the deficit.\n  Today's Washington Post featured a story that included a number of \nstatements from colleagues in which they expressed their concerns about \nbroad tax cuts at this time. The ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Mr. Moynihan, of New York, was quoted as saying that deficit \nreduction was the issue and that tax cuts were out of order. With his \nusual eloquence, the senior Senator from New York has nicely summarized \nthe matter in two short statements. Mr. President, deficit reduction is \nthe issue and tax cuts are out of order.\n  Mr. President, the underlying measure before us proposes to enhance \nthe ability of the President to pare down spending by exercising \nsomething like a line-item veto authority. In great part, this measure \nis before us because of those continued budget deficits. Although we \ncertainly will not balance the budget simply by granting the President \nsome form of a line-item veto authority, many of us do feel that such \nauthority can in a small way help alleviate some of the pressure on the \ndeficit.\n  Mr. President, the amount of pork that the President can trim from \nour budget pales in comparison to the effect a broad middle-class tax \ncut will have on our deficit or that our resistance to such a tax cut \ncould have on reducing the deficit.\n  The President's budget proposes $63 billion in tax cuts. If the only \nchange we made to that budget was to eliminate those tax cuts, we would \nsave not only that $63 billion but another $9 billion in interest costs \nfor a total savings of $72 billion in additional deficit reduction. In \nfiscal year 2000 alone, we could lower the deficit by $24 billion more \nthan is projected, achieving nearly $4 billion in deficit reduction \njust from interest savings.\n  Mr. President, forgoing the tax cuts imposed by the Contract With \nAmerica produces even more telling results. If we just could resist the \ntax cuts called for in the Contract With America, we would save this \ncountry over $200 billion and about $20 billion in interest costs \nalone.\n  Assuming those tax cuts were offset with spending cuts, doing nothing \nmore to the budget than forgoing those proposed tax cuts could reduce \nthe deficit by $80 billion in fiscal year 2000 and we would be \napproaching an annual deficit of $114 billion.\n  Mr. President, at this point I am delighted to ask unanimous consent \nthat the senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, also be added as \nan original cosponsor of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. Exon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to compliment my friend and colleague \nfrom the State of Wisconsin. Let me just make a brief statement in \nsupport of the amendment he is offering. The numbers speak for \nthemselves, I suggest. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated \nthat the tax cuts in the so-called Contract With America will worsen \nthe deficit by over $700 billion over the next 10 years. Added to that \nthe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that we will need to cut \nspending by $1.2 trillion to balance the budget over the next 7 years. \nWhat this means is that if we want to cut taxes as proposed in the \nContract With America, we will have to make some pretty dramatic \nadditional cuts in spending.\n  My position is that I am all for tax cuts but we have to cut the \ndeficit first, then consider what we can do, if anything, about tax \ncuts.\n  I thank my friend from Wisconsin. I think it is a good amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska. He is \nthe perfect person to be describing the specifics of what this does \nabout reducing our Federal deficit. Nobody knows the issue better. I \ncan only say my only regret is that the Senator has chosen not to seek \nreelection. I think his being here in the next 6 years would be one of \nthe keys to eliminating this Federal deficit, but we will certainly be \ndelighted to have the benefit of his great skills in the area of \ndeficit reduction over the next several months.\n  Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thought the Senator was finished. I am sorry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will continue just a brief time longer.\n  Mr. President, let me take a couple of other points on this matter of \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Some proponents of these tax cuts argue that they have to be a high \npriority because the American people are insisting on them. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] a distinguished member of our tax-writing \ncommittee, had a very good response to this contention.\n  In today's Washington Post he was quoted as saying, ``We do not have \na lot of people marching on Washington asking for tax cuts.''\n  The Senator from Louisiana hit the nail on the head. There is no \ngreat demand for tax cuts, but there is widespread support for us to \ncut spending and to use those savings to reduce the deficit.\n  I have been speaking out on this issue for several months now, \nbasically since November 8 when I first saw the Republican contract and \nthen after I saw the President's proposal on December 15. I took issue \nwith the President's proposed tax cuts last December on the day he \nannounced them, and I did so because I felt tax cuts were just not \nfiscally responsible right now.\n  I concede that I would be tempted to make this argument even without \nstrong support from my constituents. Sometimes that is part of this \njob. The voters elect you to make some tough calls, not to constantly \nstick out your finger to test the political winds before every vote. On \nthis issue, the people of Wisconsin have been overwhelmingly \nsupportive. They realize what they would get back in lower taxes--a \nmeaningful amount to many people--was simply not worth the devastation \nit would cause our Federal budget. In just the last few weeks, the \nphone calls and letters to my office have been running 7 to 1 in favor \nof reducing the deficit over cutting taxes. Here are just a few of the \nthings they have been saying.\n  A gentleman from Janesville wrote:\n\n       As popular as a ``middle class tax cut'' may be, this is \n     not the time for such action. . . . I urge you to keep your \n     eye on the prize. Concentrate your efforts on balancing the \n     budget and then, begin to pay down our national debt. Please, \n     do not make this process more difficult by returning a \n     pittance to this over taxed citizen.\n\n  A woman from Prairie du Sac wrote:\n\n       . . . any tax cut at this time would be pure folly. . . . \n     Reducing the deficit must be the number one priority of this \n     Congress now and for many years to come. Our country's \n     economy is dependent on this. . . .\n\n  And a gentleman from Minong, just a few miles from the Minnesota \nborder, wrote this to me:\n\n       It's not that I don't believe the middle class deserve a \n     tax cut. I just don't think we can afford to cut taxes when \n     we can't cover our budget right now. . . . When we are out of \n     debt, then the time has come to grant tax cuts. Not before.\n\n  My office has received hundreds of calls and letters that are similar \nto these.\n  And, though I do not presume to speak for the constituents of other \nMembers, I think this view is widely shared outside Wisconsin as well.\n  [[Page S4257]] A USA Today/CNN poll published on December 20 found \nthat 70 percent of those polled said if Congress is able to cut \nspending, then reducing the deficit is a higher priority than tax cuts.\n  A Washington Post-ABC News poll from January 6 showed that people \nfavored deficit reduction over tax cuts by a 3-to-2 margin.\n  And in a column in today's Washington Post, James Glassman notes that \nan NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found only 13 percent of respondents \nsaid taxes were the ``most important economic issue facing the \ncountry'' while nearly three times as many said it was the deficit.\n  Mr. President, while polling often can be one-dimensional measures of \nopinion, there was nothing one-dimensional about the response to the \nfield hearings of the House Budget Committee on this matter.\n  The crowds that attended those hearings showed clear, vocal \nmajorities supporting deficit reduction over tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, it is frustrating to hear constituents, who could \ncertainly use the money, urge Congress to make deficit reduction a \nhigher priority than tax cuts, and then watch the rush to see who can \npropose the bigger tax cut.\n  In his column, Mr. Glassman calls upon Republicans to immediately \nshelve their plans to cut taxes this year and instead devote all their \nenergy to cutting spending.\n  I will add that I think both Democrats and Republicans should shelve \nplans to cut taxes.\n  Let us focus on the task of identifying spending that can be cut, and \nthen use the savings we achieve from those cuts to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that copies of the column by \nJames Glassman, and the story headlined ``Senate GOP Prepares to \nInvalidate Tax Provisions of House `Contract,''' both from today's \nWashington Post, be included in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 21, 1995]\n\n                          Shelve the Tax Cuts\n\n                         (By James K. Glassman)\n\n       Republicans should immediately shelve their plans to cut \n     taxes this year and instead devote all their energy to \n     cutting spending.\n       Don't get me wrong. I think taxes are too high. They now \n     consume a bigger share of the average family's expenses than \n     housing, food, clothing and medical costs combined. High \n     taxes are a drag on economic growth and a license for \n     government to increase wasteful spending. And our current tax \n     system bears much of the blame for the shamefully low U.S. \n     savings rate.\n       For these reasons, tax reform is a necessity, and a flat \n     tax or a consumption tax is almost certainly the best answer. \n     But such changes can't possibly be approved in 1995--or even \n     1996. Americans need a full-scale debate, preferably during a \n     presidential campaign.\n       Instead of building support for major reform later, the \n     Republican strategy this year is to enact a typical \n     Christmas-tree tax bill, festooned with baubles for \n     businesses, investors, retirees and middle-class families. \n     President Clinton introduced his own, smaller tax cut plan in \n     February.\n       Tax relief is normally a crowd pleaser, but not today. On \n     fiscal matters, Americans seem to have just one thought in \n     mind: Balance the budget. Only 13 percent of respondents to \n     an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll said taxes were the ``most \n     important economic issue facing the country'' while nearly \n     three times as many said it was the deficit.\n       ``They aren't thinking taxes now,'' says Kellyanne \n     Fitzpatrick of the Luntz Research Cos. of Arlington, the firm \n     that helped House GOP leaders draw up the Contract With \n     America. ``People are vehement about having spending cuts \n     first.''\n       Politicians are at last starting to notice how the public \n     is ordering its priorities. On Capitol Hill last week, I \n     found no members who were truly enthusiastic about tax cuts. \n     Economists aren't clamoring for them either. With gross \n     domestic product rising nicely, the cuts aren't needed as a \n     short-term economic stimulus; on the contrary, they'll \n     probably boost inflation.\n       So the logical conclusion is to forget taxes entirely for \n     this year. Unfortunately, the Contract has a mind of its own.\n       Last week, the tax-relief bill passed the Ways and Means \n     Committee on a party-line vote. It includes a reduction in \n     the capital-gains rate, a tax credit of $500 per child for \n     families earning up to $200,000, a revival of IRAs, a modest \n     credit to make up for the ``marriage penalty'' on two-earner \n     couples and a few other goodies. Over the next five years, \n     the changes in the bill will make the deficit a total of \n     about $190 billion larger than current projections.\n       The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House next week, \n     and already dozens of Republicans\n      are asking House Speaker Newt Gingrich to scale it back. \n     They know that, based on projections by the Congressional \n     Budget Office, we can allow federal spending to rise \n     another $350 billion between now and 2002 and still \n     balance the budget--but only if we refrain from reducing \n     tax revenue.\n       If the tax bill passes, it goes next to the Senate Finance \n     Committee, whose chairman, Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), has \n     indicated that his panel would give it a frosty reception. \n     Packwood is a big thinker who almost certainly would prefer \n     reforming the whole tax system--but only after spending is \n     cut, a step he believes will lead to lower interest rates as \n     the government's borrowing requirements fall.\n       Either a consumption tax or a flat tax would remedy two of \n     the greatest problems of the current system--that it's too \n     complicated and that it imposes marginal rates so high they \n     discourage investing. The flat tax also has an amazing appeal \n     that many politicians have overlooked: Americans at all \n     income levels believe it's more fair than what we have now; \n     they suspect that fat cats use loopholes to avoid their fair \n     share.\n       Under the flat tax proposed by House Majority Leader Dick \n     Armey (R-Tex.) earlier this year, a married couple making \n     less than $26,200 would pay no federal income tax. Beyond \n     that, the rate would be 17 percent on all income, with no \n     deductions allowed.\n       A flat tax could easily be linked by law to a balanced-\n     budget requirement: At the start of each year, Congress would \n     have to set a single rate (whether it's 17, 18 or 22 percent) \n     that would bring in enough revenues to cover federal \n     expenses. That would be as powerful a deterrent to overtaxing \n     and overspending as any constitutional amendment.\n       Fitzpatrick says that Luntz has conducted polling \n     nationwide and focus groups in three cities, and the results \n     are clear: ``The flat tax is a big home run for everybody.''\n       She added, however, that Americans are so intent on \n     balancing the budget that ``some people in the focus groups \n     actually complained that they themselves would pay zero under \n     a flat tax. They want to contribute something to balancing \n     the budget.''\n       Gingrich would be nuts to ignore that kind of sentiment. He \n     should postpone the tax-relief vote indefinitely, concentrate \n     on spending cuts and lay the groundwork for Republicans to \n     run on a flat-tax platform next year--unless Clinton is \n     cleaver enough to beat them to it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 21, 1995]\n\n  Senate GOP Prepares to Invalidate Tax Provisions of House `Contract'\n\n                    (By Eric Pianin and Dan Morgan)\n\n       Senate Republicans have begun moving on several tracks to \n     rearrange key tax and spending provisions of the House GOP's \n     ``Contract With America.''\n       Senate Finance Committee Republicans emerged from a weekend \n     retreat with their Democratic colleagues resolved to block \n     passage of the House GOP's $188 billion tax cut package and \n     to put off action on tax reliefs proposals until Congress \n     completes work on the major deficit reduction this summer.\n       Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) said \n     yesterday that Congress would reduce the deficit by ``an \n     immense magnitudes beyond what people believe is possible,'' \n     but that major tax reductions along the lines advocated by \n     House Republicans were not in the cards.\n       ``To the extent that we can both reduce the deficit to zero \n     over seven years and have tax cuts, so much the better,'' \n     Packwood said in a speech to the national Association of \n     Manufacturers. ``But I don't thing we should\n      put the priority of tax cuts first and then reducing \n     spending later.''\n       House Republican leaders plan to complete work on their tax \n     package--including both a $500-per-child tax credit for \n     families making up to $200,000 a year and a sharp reduction \n     in the capital gains tax--before Congress leaves for the \n     Easter recess. Nearly 100 Republicans plan to deliver a \n     letter to the House GOP leadership today, urging that the \n     credit be targeted to families making a maximum of $95,000 a \n     year.\n       However, an aide to House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) \n     said such a change is unlikely.\n       Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (N.Y.), the ranking Democrat \n     on the Finance Committee, who attended the weekend retreat, \n     said Democrats and Republicans generally agreed that \n     ``deficit reduction was the issue'' and that ``tax cuts were \n     out of order.''\n       Sen. John Breaux (D-La.), another committee member at the \n     retreat, said, ``We do not have a lot of people marching on \n     Washington asking for tax cuts.''\n       But committee member Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) \n     predicted that some ``modest'' tax relief would emerge from \n     Congress later this year to satisfy the demands of Sen. Phil \n     Gramm (Tex.), a Republican presidential candidate, and other \n     conservatives sympathetic to the House tax proposals.\n       ``They [the tax cuts] don't have to be as great as the \n     House wants and they must be oriented toward the family,'' \n     Grassley said.\n       The Senate also may put its imprint on a recision bill \n     passed last week by the House that would pare $17.1 billion \n     from spending that had been approved in the current budget. \n     Cumulatively, the bill would reduce congressional ability to \n     make spending commitments by $40 billion to $50 billion over \n     five years.\n       [[Page S4258]] The House legislation exempted defense and \n     military construction accounts, but Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-\n     Ore.), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said \n     yesterday that he has directed that those accounts be \n     screened for possible cuts as well.\n       Some Democrats and Republicans say deficit reduction should \n     take precedence over everything, including tax cuts and \n     increases in Pentagon spending, or the spending cuts could be \n     branded as imprudent and unfair.\n       The liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \n     concluded that 63 percent of the House cuts are in programs \n     for low-in-come families and individuals. Hatfield suggested \n     yesterday in an interview that military spending could not be \n     ``disconnected'' from the deficit problem any more than the \n     tax cut issue could be.\n       ``They're asking people to make sacrifices at the same time \n     they're saying military spending must escalate,'' he said.\n       On Sunday, House Budget Committee Chairman John R. Kasich \n     (R-Ohio) said House Republican leaders had agreed to freeze \n     defense spending at the current $270 billion for at least the \n     next five years, rather than increasing it.\n       Hatfield, who was attacked by senators within his own party \n     for casting the lone Republican vote against the balanced \n     budget amendment, indicated that the size of the Senate's \n     spending recision package would be in the same ``ballpark'' \n     as the House-passed version, but with different spending \n     cuts.\n       In addition to possibly tapping defense and military \n     contruction, Hatfield said the Appropriations transportation \n     subcommittee that he chairs probably would make deeper cuts \n     than the House did.\n       ``We'll never balance the budget on the baseline of \n     discretionary spending,'' Hatfield said, referring to the \n     one-third of the total budget that does not cover interest on \n     the debt or Social Security, Medicare and other such \n     ``entitlement'' programs.\n       Speaking to reporters after his speech to the manufacturers \n     association, Packwood said that he agreed with Republican \n     budget committee leaders in the House and Senate that the \n     budget could be balanced by 2002 merely by slowing the growth \n     of spending by $1 trillion or more, but that ``nothing is \n     sacred,'' including Social Security and other entitlement \n     programs.\n       ``I have said all along Social Security should be on the \n     table,'' he said, but ``we haven't crossed that yet.'' \n     Packwood said that while cuts in Social Security benefits \n     have been ruled out by Republican leaders, his committee \n     would consider trying to eliminate a bias in a formula that \n     overstates cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security \n     payments.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I understand the majority leader intends \nto stack votes on amendments offered tonight for some time to be \ndetermined and I ask unanimous consent, on the amendment I just \nproposed, it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will defer the request for the yeas \nand nays on the first amendment in response to the suggestion of the \nmanager, the Senator from Arizona. I thank both the managers for their \nkindness and cooperation in my opportunity to offer these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with regard to \nthe Simon amendment No. 393.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. President, I had not finished with the debate on the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just want to briefly respond to the \namendment of the Senator from Wisconsin. I know there will be objection \non this side, as he knows. The so-called Contract With America was \nclear on the point that middle-income Americans--middle-class \nAmericans--deserve a tax cut. I understand the Senator from Wisconsin's \nzeal to balance the budget. I appreciate it. I believe I share it.\n  I would like to point out that in 1950, a median-income family of \nfour in America--that is a man, woman, and two children--sent $1 out of \n$50 of their income to Washington, DC, in 1950. In 1990 that same \nfamily of four, median-income American family, sends $1 out of every $4 \nto Washington, DC, in the form of taxes. Then, when you put on State \nand local taxes, they rapidly jump up into the 40 percent bracket. If \nwe do not add another entitlement program between now and the turn of \nthe century, if we do not add one penny to Federal spending, that \nnumber will be $1 out of every $3.\n  I say to my friend from Wisconsin, we cannot afford to lay this \nburden on middle-income Americans or we will see the disappearance of \nmiddle-class America. They are staggering under a crushing tax burden. \nI believe it makes it much more difficult to both reduce the deficit \nand enact tax cuts, but I, frankly--maybe the Senator from Louisiana \nhas not heard of people marching on Washington, saying ``cut taxes.'' \nAround April 15 there will be people marching on my office and calling \nmy office when they file their income taxes again this year and find \nout that, again, their taxes have gone up and it will now require, I \nbelieve the date is May 15, to which they will work in order to pay \ntheir State and local and Federal taxes before they start earning a \npenny for themselves and their families.\n  I understand very well what this $4.8 trillion debt, now projected by \n1996 to be a $5.2 trillion debt, can do to America. But I also know \nwhat a crushing tax burden means to the average American family which \nis bearing an enormous burden and that burden has contributed \nsignificantly to the most startling and, in my view, alarming polling \nnumber, polling statistic, that we got out of the 1994 elections. That \nis that the majority of Americans who voted in the 1994 election do not \nbelieve that their children will be better off than they are. They \nbelieve that for a variety of reasons, I say to my friend from \nWisconsin. But one of the reasons they say that is that they do not \nbelieve they will have enough income to provide for their children's \nfutures.\n  The essence of the American dream, as most of us know it, is that \npeople came to this country, worked hard, put in sweat and blood and \ntears in order to ensure the future generations--their children--would \nhave a better opportunity than they.\n  I say to my friend from Wisconsin, that is not the case anymore. One \nof the reasons for that is because they see so many of their hard-\nearned dollars going to Washington and to State and local taxes, so \nthey do not believe they will be able to afford to pay for their \nmedical bills, their children's education, and the other necessities \nthat are required for people, not only for the rest of their lives but \nto ensure the future of their children.\n  But I do not disagree with the Senator from Wisconsin about the \ndaunting task we face when we say we are both going to reduce the \ndeficit and the debt and at the same time relieve the tax burden on \nmiddle-income Americans.\n  Mr. President, I apologize for interrupting the Senator from \nNebraska. I just wanted to respond to the Senator from Wisconsin on \nthis amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I had an \nopportunity to speak, but this may be the only debate on this amendment \nthe way this is structured.\n  Let me make two quick points. First of all, I am pleased to note this \nis a nonpartisan issue. Everyone watching should be aware things are \nnot breaking down on a partisan basis. There is a disagreement on the \nRepublican side and there is a disagreement on the Democrat side \nwhether we can go with tax cuts. I think it is heartening for people to \nrealize the Senate can function in this way and we can resolve the \nissue on other than a Democrat or Republican basis, and I hope that is \nthe way this tax cut debate will continue.\n  The other point I would just make in response to the Senator from \nArizona is that I am also willing to examine the impact that this issue \nof tax cuts and deficit reduction has on the bottom line for American \nfamilies. I had a meeting yesterday in Wisconsin with a business \nadvisory group, and the business men and women there were absolutely \nconvinced that doing the tax cut, rather than using the money for \ndeficit reduction, would mean that the actual budgetary picture of \nthose individual families would be worse with the tax cut, for two \nreasons. One, they believed if we do not reduce the deficit as \ndramatically as we can right now, in other words not using the tax \ncuts, that the interest we have to pay on the Federal debt will \ninevitably cause them to have less money of their own because so much \nof our national economy will be going toward paying the \n[[Page S4259]] horrible burden that the interest on the debt already \ncauses.\n  The other point was very specific. Their belief was that the increase \nin interest rate that will occur because of the failure to deal with \nthe deficit, and possibly because of the tax cuts, could generate an \ninflationary effect and would mean a greater increase in their costs \nmonthly in the form of interest on car payments and home payments.\n  So I think the Senator's analysis is a fair approach, not just the \nmacroeconomic one of what happens to the whole society and our deficit, \nbut the macroeconomic issue of what happens to those individual \nfamilies. I hope, as we go on this debate, that we will look at it from \nboth points of view. Both are central to this issue.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, what is the pending question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment 393 offered \nby the Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 393, as Modified, to Amendment No. 347\n          (Purpose: To provide for expedited judicial review)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom Arizona have been working on the language of the Senator's \namendment on judicial review that was debated briefly an hour or so \nago. Senator Simon has given me language that he believes addresses the \nconcerns of the Senator from Arizona regarding severability. Senator \nSimon asked me to seek to modify his amendment to reflect the changes.\n  So, Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Illinois, I send a \nmodification of his amendment numbered 393 to the desk, and I ask that \nit be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 393), as modified, to amendment No. 347, is as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Expedited Review.--\n       (1) Any Member of Congress may bring an action, in the \n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \n     for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground \n     that a provision of this Act violates the Constitution.\n       (2) A copy of any complaint in an action brought under \n     paragraph (1) shall be promptly delivered to the Secretary of \n     the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and \n     each House of Congress shall have the right to intervene in \n     such action.\n       (3) Any action brought under paragraph (1) shall be heard \n     and determined by a three-judge court in accordance with \n     section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.\n       Nothing in this section or in any other law shall infringe \n     upon the right of the House of Representatives or the Senate \n     to intervene in an action brought under paragraph (1) without \n     the necessity of adopting a resolution to authorize such \n     intervention.\n       (b) Appeal to Supreme Court.--\n       Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any order of \n     the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \n     which is issued pursuant to an action brought under paragraph \n     (1) of subsection (a) shall be reviewable by appeal directly \n     to the Supreme Court of the United States. Any such appeal \n     shall be taken by a notice of appeal filed within 10 days \n     after such order is entered; and the jurisdictional statement \n     shall be filed within 30 days after such order is entered. No \n     stay of an order issued pursuant to an action brought under \n     paragraph (1) of subsection (a) shall be issued by a single \n     Justice of the Supreme Court.\n       (c) Expedited Consideration.--\n       It shall be the duty of the District Court for the District \n     of Columbia and the Supreme Court of the United States to \n     advance on the docket and to expedite to the greatest \n     possible extent the disposition of any matter brought under \n     subsection (a).\n       (d) Severability.--\n       If any provision of this Act, or the application of such \n     provision to any person or circumstance is held \n     unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the \n     application of the provisions of such Act to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 393), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 402 to Amendment No. 347\n\n (Purpose: To provide a process to ensure that savings from rescission \n                  bills be used for deficit reduction)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 402 to amendment No. 347.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the matters proposed to be inserted, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC.  .\n\n       (a) Not later than 45 days of continuous session after the \n     President vetoes an appropriations measure or an \n     authorization measure, the President shall--\n       (1) with respect to appropriations measures, reduce the \n     discretionary spending limits under section 601 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for the budget year and each \n     out year by the amount by which the measure would have \n     increased the deficit in each respective year;\n       (2) with respect to a repeal of direct spending, or a \n     targeted tax benefit, reduce the balances for the budget year \n     and each outyear under section 252(b) of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by the amount by \n     which the measure would have increased the deficit in each \n     respective year;\n       (b) Exceptions.\n       (1) This section shall not apply if the vetoed \n     appropriations measure or authorization measure becomes law, \n     over the objections of the President, before the President \n     orders the reduction required by subsections (a)(1) or \n     (a)(2).\n       (2) If the vetoed appropriations measure or authorization \n     measure becomes law, over the objections of the President \n     after the President has ordered the reductions required by \n     subsections (a)(1) or (a)(2), then the President shall \n     restore the discretionary spending limits under section 601 \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 or the balances under \n     section 252(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 to reflect the positions existing before \n     the reduction ordered by the President in compliance with \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, let me just briefly address this because I \nhad talked briefly about it earlier. This amendment would add to the \nbill what is called a lock box to insure that any and all savings \nachieved as a result of the line-item veto under the bill would go to \ndeficit reduction. This is simply a truth-in-advertising amendment. All \nthis amendment does is to ensure that, if you promise deficit reduction \nin a veto, you actually have to deliver deficit reduction at the end of \nthe day.\n  I have nothing further on the amendment at the present time. I assume \nwe will have, if it is not accepted, probably a vote on it on tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am in support of the concept of this \namendment. I think clearly any savings should go to reduce the deficit. \nThere are objections on this side of the aisle at this time.\n  So I withhold approval. But hopefully some of those objections can be \nsatisfied before being voted on tomorrow.\n  I agree with the Senator from Nebraska that any savings should go to \ndeficit reduction rather than expenditures on other Government \nprograms.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has been a long day for the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. I will try to be relatively brief. I do not believe \nthere are any more amendments proposed for tonight.\n  I would just like to make some additional comments and then proceed \nto wrap up, since we will be beginning at the hour of 9:30 in the \nmorning, it is my understanding.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to discuss this issue that has been heavily \nargued today as far as the constitutionality of separate enrollment. \nEarlier today, he included in the Record a statement from Mr. Johnny \nKilliam, who is the senior specialist on American constitutional law in \nthe Congressional Research Service. The subject of this memorandum is \nthe separate enrollment bill and the Constitution. I am not going to \nread the entire thing. I would like to again repeat the concluding \nparagraph of his 12-page dissertation on the constitutionality of \nseparate enrollment.\n  He says:\n\n       [[Page S4260]] In conclusion, we have argued that the \n     deeming procedure may present a political question unsuited \n     for judicial review, and, thus, that Congress would not be \n     subject to judicial review. We have considered, on the other \n     hand, that the courts may find that they are not precluded \n     from exercising authority to review this proposal. If the \n     proposal is reviewed by the court, and even if it is not, we \n     have presented an argument leading to sustaining the deeming \n     procedure as not in violation of the principle that a bill in \n     order to become law must be passed in identical versions by \n     the House of Representatives and the Senate. Because of the \n     lack of available precedent, we cannot argue that any of the \n     three versions of the argument is indisputably correct. \n     Indeed, there are questions about all three. In the end, \n     Congress must exercise a constitutional judgment when \n     deciding on passage of the proposal.\n\n  What Mr. Killiam has said--and it is a very in-depth and in some ways \nesoteric discussion--various cases have appeared before the Supreme \nCourt, and he argues at the end of his dissertation that there are \narguments that lead in favor of the constitutionality of separate \nenrollment, but it could be subject to judicial review.\n  And his last sentence, I think, is probably the most operative, where \nhe said:\n\n       In the end, Congress must exercise a constitutional \n     judgment when deciding on passage of the proposal.\n\n  I also say to those who are concerned about the constitutionality of \nthis issue, the Simon amendment--and a similar amendment was adopted by \nthe House of Representatives--will call for expedited judicial review. \nWe will find out. I am not using that as an argument for somebody who \nfeels there is a clear constitutionality problem here and believes it \nis unconstitutional to therefore vote for this legislation just because \nit is going to receive judicial review. But I am saying to those who \nmay have some doubts that this issue will be resolved and resolved in a \nvery short period of time.\n  I also want to take a few minutes to quote from Judith Best, who has \nbeen a well-known expert on this particular issue. It is a very short \nquote. This part of her dissertation, entitled ``The Constitutional \nObjection.''\n\n       The objection is that the proposal is unconstitutional--\n\n  Meaning separate enrollment is unconstitutional.\n\n     because it would change the Constitution, specifically the \n     veto power, by act of Congress alone. The response is as \n     follows: Article I, section 5 of the Constitution permits \n     this procedure. Nothing in Article I, section 7 is violated \n     by this procedure. Under this proposal, all bills must be \n     presented to the President. He may sign or veto all bills. He \n     must return vetoed bills with his objections. Congress may \n     override any veto with a two-thirds majority of each House. \n     Under Article I, section 5, Congress possesses the power to \n     define a bill. Congress certainly believes that it possesses \n     this power, since it alone has been doing so since the first \n     bill was presented to the first President in the first \n     Congress. If this construction of Article I, section 5 is \n     correct, the definition of a bill is a political question and \n     not justiciable. Prominent on the surface of any case held to \n     involve a political question is found a textually \n     demonstrable constitutional commitment to issues to a \n     coordinate political department. A textually demonstrable \n     constitutional commitment of the issue to the legislature as \n     found in each House may determine the rules of its \n     proceedings. Congress may define as a bill a package of \n     distinct programs and unrelated items to be separate bills. \n     Either Congress has a right to define a bill or it does not. \n     Either this proposal is constitutional or the recent practice \n     of Congress informing omnibus bills containing unrelated \n     programs and nongermane items is constitutionally \n     challengeable. If the latter, the President would be well \n     advised to bring such suit against the next omnibus bill.\n\n  I think, basically, Professor Best lays it out there. The Congress \nhas a right to determine what a bill is. The Congress may define as a \nbill a package of distinct programs and unrelated items. And her \nargument, which I support, is that therefore the Congress of the United \nStates can define a single enrollment which was part of a package as a \nbill as well.\n  But we will probably have much more debate on that in the couple of \ndays ahead. I want to express again my admiration for Senator Byrd, the \nSenator from West Virginia, for his erudite and compelling and well-\ninformed arguments. I watched a great deal of the debate today between \nthe Senator from Indiana and the Senator from West Virginia. I think it \nwas edifying, and I think many of my colleagues had the opportunity to \nobserve them. I think most of the arguments concerning \nconstitutionality, enrollment, and other aspects of the line-item veto \nwere well described. I, again, express my admiration for the talent and \nenormous knowledge that the Senator from West Virginia possesses.\n  Again, I want to emphasize again that a lot of time has been taken, \nand more time will be taken on the floor on this issue. This is a \nfundamental and structural change in the way we do business. I believe \nit deserves thorough ventilation and debate. At the same time, I \nbelieve we can probably bring it to a close.

On August 19, 1994, in Executive Order No. 12924, I declared a \nnational emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers \nAct (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to deal with the threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States \ncaused by the lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as \namended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.) and the system of controls \nmaintained under that Act. In that order, I continued in effect, to the \nextent permitted by law, the provisions of the Export Administration \nAct of 1979, as amended, the Export Administration Regulations (15 \nC.F.R. 768 et seq.), and the delegations of authority set forth in \nExecutive Order No. 12002 of July 7, 1977 (as amended by Executive \nOrder No. 12755 of March 12, 1991), Executive Order No. 12214 of May 2, \n1980, Executive Order No. 12735 of November 16, 1990 (subsequently \nrevoked by Executive Order No. 12938 of November 14, 1994), and \nExecutive Order No. 12851 of June 11, 1993.\n  2. I issued Executive Order No. 12924 pursuant to the authority \nvested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates, including, but not limited to, IEEPA. At that \n[[Page S4261]] time, I also submitted a report to the Congress pursuant \nto section 204(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)). Section 204 of IEEPA \nrequires follow-up reports, with respect to actions or changes, to be \nsubmitted every 6 months. Additionally, section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act (NEA) (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) requires that the \nPresident, within 90 days after the end of each 6-month period \nfollowing a declaration of a national emergency, report to the Congress \non the total expenditures directly attributable to that declaration. \nThis report, covering the 6-month period from August 19, 1994, to \nFebruary 19, 1995, is submitted in compliance with these requirements.\n  3. Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12924, the Department of \nCommerce has continued to administer and enforce the system of export \ncontrols, including antiboycott provisions, contained in the Export \nAdministration Regulations. In administering these controls, the \nDepartment has acted under a policy of conforming actions under \nExecutive Order No. 12924 to those required under the Export \nAdministration Act, insofar as appropriate.\n  4. Since my last report to the Congress, there have been several \nsignificant developments in the area of export controls:\n\n\n               bilateral cooperation/technical assistance\n\n  --As part of the Administration's continuing effort to encourage \n    other countries to implement effective export controls to stem the \n    proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as certain \n    sensitive technologies, the Department of Commerce and other \n    agencies conducted a range of discussions with a number of foreign \n    countries, including governments in the Baltics, Central and \n    Eastern Europe, the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former \n    Soviet Union, the Pacific Rim, and China. Licensing requirements \n    were liberalized for exports to Argentina, South Korea, and Taiwan, \n    responding in part to their adoption of improved export control \n    procedures.\n\n\n                            australia group\n\n  --The Department of Commerce issued regulations to remove controls on \n    certain chemical weapon stabilizers that are not controlled by the \n    Australia Group, a multilateral regime dedicated to stemming the \n    proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. This change \n    became effective October 19, 1994. In that same regulatory action, \n    the Department also published a regulatory revision that reflects \n    an Australia Group decision to adopt a multi-tiered approach to \n    control of certain mixtures containing chemical precursors. The new \n    regulations extend General License G-DEST treatment to certain \n    categories of such mixtures.\n\n\n                     nuclear suppliers group (nsg)\n\n  --NSG members are examining the present dual-use nuclear control list \n    to both remove controls no longer warranted and to rewrite control \n    language to better reflect nuclear proliferation concerns. A major \n    item for revision involves machine tools, as the current language \n    was accepted on an interim basis until agreement on more specific \n    language could be reached.\n  --The Department of Commerce has implemented license denials for NSG-\n    controlled items as part of the ``no-undercut'' provision. Under \n    this provision, denial notifications received from NSG member \n    countries obligate other member nations not to approve similar \n    transactions until they have consulted with the notifying party, \n    thus reducing the possibilities for undercutting such denials.\n\n\n                missile technology control regime (mtcr)\n\n  --Effective September 30, 1994, the Department of Commerce revised \n    the control language for MTCR items on the Commerce Control List, \n    based on the results of the last MTCR plenary. The revisions \n    reflect advances in technology and clarifications agreed to \n    multilaterally.\n  --On October 4, 1994, negotiations to resolve the 1993 sanctions \n    imposed on China for MTCR violations involving missile-related \n    trade with Pakistan were successfully concluded. The United States \n    lifted the Category II sanctions effective November 1, in exchange \n    for a Chinese commitment not to export ground-to-ground Category I \n    missiles to any destination.\n  --At the October 1994 Stockholm plenary, the MTCR made public the \n    fact of its ``no-undercut'' policy on license denials. Under this \n    multilateral arrangement, denials notifications received from MTCR \n    members are honored by other members for similar export license \n    applications. Such a coordinated approach enhances U.S. missile \n    nonproliferation goals and precludes other member nations from \n    approving similar transactions without prior consultation.\n          modifications in controls on embargoed destinations\n\n  --Effective August 30, 1994, the Department of Commerce restricted \n    the types of commodities eligible for shipment to Cuba under the \n    provisions of General License GIFT. Only food, medicine, clothing, \n    and other human needs items are eligible for this general license.\n  --The embargo against Haiti was lifted on October 16, 1994. That \n    embargo had been under the jurisdiction of the Department of the \n    Treasury. Export license authority reverted to the Department of \n    Commerce upon the termination of the embargo.\n\n\n                           regulatory reform\n\n  --In February 1994, the Department of Commerce issued a Federal \n    Register notice that invited public comment on ways to improve the \n    Export Administration Regulations. The project's objective is ``to \n    make the rules and procedures for the control of exports simpler \n    and easier to understand and apply.'' This project is not intended \n    to be a vehicle to implement substantive change in the policies or \n    procedures of export administration, but rather to make those \n    policies and procedures simpler and clearer to the exporting \n    community. Reformulating and simplifying the Export Administration \n    Regulations is an important priority, and significant progress has \n    been made over the last 6 months in working toward completion of \n    this comprehensive undertaking.\n\n\n                           export enforcement\n\n  --Over the last 6 months, the Department of Commerce continued its \n    vigorous enforcement of the Export Administration Act and the \n    Export Administration Regulations through educational outreach, \n    license application screening, spot checks, investigations, and \n    enforcement actions. In the last 6 months, these efforts resulted \n    in civil penalties, denials of export privileges, criminal fines, \n    and imprisonment. Total fines amounted to over $12,289,000 in \n    export control and antiboycott compliance cases, including criminal \n    fines of nearly $9,500,000 while 11 parties were denied export \n    privileges.\n  --Teledyne Fined $12.9 Million and a Teledyne Division Denied Export \n    Privileges for Export Control Violations: On January 26 and January \n    27, Teledyne Industries, Inc. of Los Angeles, agreed to a \n    settlement of criminal and administrative charges arising from \n    illegal export activity in the mid-1980's by its Teledyne Wah Chang \n    division, located in Albany, Oregon. The settlement levied criminal \n    fines and civil penalties on the firm totaling $12.9 million and \n    imposed a denial of export privileges on Teledyne Wah Chang.\n  The settlement is the result of a 4-year investigation by the Office \nof Export Enforcement and the U.S. Customs Service. United States \nAttorneys offices in Miami and Washington, D.C., coordinated the \ninvestigation. The investigation determined that during the mid-1980's, \nTeledyne illegally exported nearly 270 tons of zirconium that was used \nto manufacture cluster bombs for Iraq.\n  As part of the settlement, the Department restricted the export \nprivileges of Teledyne's Wah Chang division; the division will have all \nexport privileges denied for 3 months, with the remaining portion of \nthe 3-year denial period suspended.\n[[Page S4262]]   --Storm Kheem Pleads Guilty to Nonproliferation and \n    Sanctions Violations: On January 27, Storm Kheem pled guilty in \n    Brooklyn, New York, to charges that he violated export control \n    regulations barring U.S. persons from contributing to Iraq's \n    missile program. Kheem arranged for the shipment of foreign-source \n    ammonium perchlorate, a highly explosive chemical used in \n    manufacturing rocket fuel, from the People's Republic of China to \n    Iraq via Amman, Jordan, without obtaining the required validated \n    license from the Department of Commerce for arranging the shipment. \n    Kheem's case represents the first conviction of a person for \n    violating section 778.9 of the Export Administration Regulations, \n    which restricts proliferation-related activities of ``U.S. \n    persons.'' Kheem also pled guilty to charges of violating the Iraqi \n    Sanctions Regulations.\n  5. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from August 19, 1994, to February 19, 1995, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to export controls \nwhere largely centered in the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export \nAdministration. Expenditures by the Department of Commerce are \nanticipated to be $19,681,000 most of which represents program \noperating costs, wage and salary costs for Federal personal and \noverhead expenses.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \ncontrol illegal immigration to the United States, reduce incentives for \nillegal immigration, reform asylum procedures, strengthen criminal \npenalties for the smuggling of aliens, and reform other procedures; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, and now \nsend to the desk, the Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement Act \nof 1995. This bill incorporates many of the concepts in the immigration \npackage that I introduced in the last session of Congress. New \nproposals have been added, however, after consultation with many, \nincluding California's law enforcement officials and others interested \nin curbing illegal immigration.\n  Mr. President, I offer this legislation not to compete with Senator \nSimpson's S. 269, which he introduced on January 24, but rather to \ncomplement it. Little in this bill is duplicative of Senator Simpson's \nlegislation. I am convinced that, combined, these two bills could offer \na strong, straightforward program to stop illegal immigration.\n  There simply is no time to lose. The crisis of illegal immigration \ncontinues in California and throughout the Nation.\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n  Too many people are still able to illegally cross our borders, and \ntoo few States, most notably California, carry the burden of having to \nsupport, educate, and often incarcerate the hundreds of thousands who \nenter this country illegally each year.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that our border enforcement has improved \nin the last 2 years and I want to thank this administration for an \nunprecedented commitment to that end. I am equally convinced, however, \nthat steps already taken have been insufficient to fully address the \nproblem.\n  Despite its major flaws and probable unconstitutionality, proposition \n187 in California was overwhelmingly approved by voters last November. \nThe message was clear: Stop illegal immigration. If Congress does not \nheed this warning, I fear an even more serious backlash nationwide \nagainst all immigrants, including those who want to come to our country \nlegally.\n\n\n                          Impact on California\n\n  One reason proposition 187 passed by such a large margin is that \nCalifornians know the impact of immigration on our State. According to \n1993 INS statistics, 45 percent of the Nation's illegal immigrants are \nnow in California. That means between 1.6 and 2.3 million illegal \nimmigrants now reside in our State; 15 percent of California's State \nprison population--or almost 20,000 inmates--is comprised of \nincarcerated illegal immigrants; 45 percent of all persons with pending \nasylum cases reside in California; 35 percent of the refugees to this \ncountry claimed residency in California in 1993; and almost 30 percent \nof the legal immigrants in this have country chosen to live in \nCalifornia.\n  According to the Governor of our State, illegal immigration in fiscal \nyear 1995-96 will cost California an estimated $3.6 billion, including \nan $2.66 billion for the federally mandated costs of education, health \ncare, and incarceration. By anyone's estimation, that is a staggering \nsum, and a tremendous burden on just one State.\n\n\n                    The Need for Immigration Reform\n\n  I believe our Federal response to the problem of illegal immigration \nmust address four key goals: First, control illegal immigration at the \nborder; second, reduce the economic incentives to come to the United \nStates illegally; third, deal swiftly and severely with document \nforgers and alien smugglers; and fourth, remove criminal aliens from \nour Nation's prisons and jails, while assuring that their sentences are \nserved in their countries of origin.\n\n\n                             Border Control\n\n  This legislation requires that at least 700, and up to 1,000, new \nBorder Patrol agents be hired in each of the next 3 fiscal years. It \ndiffers from the crime bill in one critical respect. The crime bill \nauthorized the hiring of up to 1,000 new agents in each of Fiscal Years \n1996, 1997 and 1998. This bill further requires that a minimum of 700 \nagents per year be hired. It thus adds a floor to the crime bill which \nwill assure that no fewer than 2,100 new agents, and up to 900 support \npersonnel, will be on board by the end of Fiscal Year 1998 for a total \nof 7,082 Border Patrol agents.\n  It mandates the hiring of sufficient INS border inspectors to fully \nstaff all legal crossing lanes at peak periods. The bill also provides \nfor improved border infrastructure and Border Patrol training.\n\n\n                          Reducing Incentives\n\n  Second, this legislation substantially expands existing employer \nsanctions and wage and hour law enforcement programs to reduce the \nbiggest incentives for undocumented persons to come to this country, \nnamely jobs.\n  Central to this effort is the creation of a counterfeit-proof work \nand benefits authorization verification system. Any employer--and any \nprovider of federally funded benefits--ought to be 100 percent certain \nthat a candidate is here legally. A counterfeit-proof verification \nsystem is the only way this can be achieved.\n  In addition, this bill dramatically increases the civil fines for \nanyone who knowingly hires, recruits, or refers illegal aliens for \nhiring. This is important because today the civil penalties for \nillegally hiring an illegal immigrant are very low. Fines range between \njust $250 and $2,000--per alien hired--for a first offense.\n  This bill would increase that range from $1,000 to $3,000 for the \nfirst offense.\n  Second offenses would carry per alien fines of between $3,000 and \n$7,000, and third or later offenses would cost $7,000 to $20,000 per \nalien--that is more than double the current $3,000 to $10,000 \nliability.\n  It dramatically increases the criminal penalties for a pattern or \npractice of hiring illegal immigrants. This bill doubles the maximum \ncriminal fine, and triples the maximum jail sentence, for anyone who \nfacilitates a fraudulent application for benefits by an unlawful alien \nby counterfeiting the seal or stamp of any Federal agency. If this bill \nis enacted, the new maximums will be $500,000, or 15 years in jail, or \nboth.\n  It provides for additional INS and Department of Labor inspectors to \nenforce existing laws and provides for the hiring of additional \nassistant U.S. attorneys to more aggressively prosecute these crimes.\n\n\n                      Smuggling and Document Fraud\n\n  Shutting down false document mills, counterfeiters, smugglers, and \nsmuggling organizations is the third priority at the core of this \nlegislation.\n  Smugglers and forgers will find this to be a very tough bill indeed. \nThis legislation broadens current Federal asset seizure authority to \ninclude those who smuggle or harbor illegal aliens, and those who \nproduce false work and benefits documents.\n  It imposes tough minimum and maximum sentences on smugglers, and it \nimposes those penalties for each alien smuggled. At the moment, \npenalties are assessed per transaction, no matter how many illegal \nimmigrants a smuggler takes across our borders.\n  This bill increases the penalty for smugglers in the event that an \nalien is injured, killed, or subject to blackmail threats by the \nsmuggler.\n  It makes it easier to deport so-called weekend warriors--legal \npermanent residents, green card holders, who are in the United States, \nsmuggle illegal immigrants for profit, and then try to use their \nimmigration status to avoid being deported from the United States.\n  It dramatically increases penalties for document forgers or \ncounterfeiters. First offenders will be sentenced to 2\\1/2\\ to 5 years, \n5 to 10 years with any prior felony conviction, and 10 to 15 years with \ntwo or more prior felonies. Currently, document forgers can receive as \nlittle as 0 to 6 months for a first offense.\n\n\n                            Criminal Aliens\n\n  This legislation is intended to once again signal that the President \nmust have the authority, by treaty, to deport aliens convicted of \ncrimes in this country for secure incarceration in such aliens' home \ncountries.\n  Although we have prisoner transfer treaty agreements with many \nnations now, they are subject to the consent of the prisoner to be \ntransferred. If the prisoner does not consent, he is not transferred.\n  This legislation eliminates that obstacle. It also would speed up the \ndeportation process and make more criminal aliens deportable by \nbroadening the definition of an aggravated felony for which aliens may \nalready be deported to include document fraud crimes not now \nindependent grounds for deportation; it classifies as aggravated \nfelonies certain offenses punishable by 3 years, rather than for which \nan alien has actually been sentenced to 5 years or more. As a result, \nit would definitely increase the number of criminals who would qualify \nfor deportation as having committed aggravated felony.\n  In addition, courts would have the authority to require that, in \norder to receive a sentence of probation rather than a prison term, an \nillegal alien convicted of a crime would be required to consent to \nbeing deported as a condition of probation. This would give prosecutors \nthe option of ejecting from the country relatively low-level offenders \nafter trial without going through an additional, and often lengthy, \ndeportation hearing.\n\n\n                      Sponsors of Legal Immigrants\n\n  Before concluding, let me note just one other feature of the bill \nwhich pertains to immigrants who have lawfully come to the United \nStates on the basis of a citizen's--usually an immediate relative's--\nsponsorship. The legislation would require anyone who sponsors a legal \nimmigrant for admission to the United States to make good on their \npromise of financial support should the \n[[Page S4264]] legal alien require assistance before becoming a \ncitizen.\n  In addition, past proposals to strengthen sponsorship agreements \ntypically exempted sponsors from liability for medical costs.\n  This legislation would make sponsors responsible for the costs of \nmedical care, requiring them to obtain health insurance for the \nimmigrant they have sponsored. The insurance would be of a type and \namount to be specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nand would be required to be purchased within 20 days of an immigrant's \narrival in this country. A safety valve is built into the bill, \nhowever, for sponsors who die, or who become impoverished or bankrupt.\n\n\n                          Border Crossing Fee\n\n  This bill also provides a funding mechanism for this package with a \nborder crossing fee of $1 per person, which could yield up to $400 \nmillion per year. The border control, the infrastructure, the training, \nthe additional narcotics abatement efforts provided in this bill all \ncould be underwritten by such a fee.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, immigration is too much at the core of \nwhat America means to each of us individually, and to our society \ncollectively, to politicize and polarize the coming debate. If we are \nto map common ground together, it is the spirit of compromise that must \nprevail. We owe America--America the Nation and America the idea--no \nless.\n  I look forward to continuing to work closely with the chairman of my \nsubcommittee, Senator Simpson, with Senators Kennedy and Simon, and \nwith all of my Republican colleagues on the subcommittee to present the \nfull Judiciary Committee and the Senate with the best possible \ncomprehensive illegal immigration legislation as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 582. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide that \ncertain voluntary disclosures of violations of Federal laws made \npursuant to an environmental audit shall not be subject to discovery or \nadmitted into evidence during a Federal judicial or administrative \nproceeding, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT PRIVILEGE LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, with the recent changes in \nCongress, we are presented with an important opportunity to take a \nfresh look at many aspects of our Federal legal and regulatory system. \nA return to federalism is underway including a movement to allow \ngreater flexibility in administering Federal programs. I support a full \nreview of the Federal regulatory straitjacket we have helped create and \nbelieve that greater flexibility should be extended to both the public \nand private sectors of this Nation.\n  As my colleagues know, it is difficult to have a conversation these \ndays with a business leader or a local government official without the \ntopic turning to the increasingly onerous burden of Federal \nregulations--particularly environmental regulations. It is now clear \nthe many of our laws and regulations designed to ensure a safer \nenvironment are now having the unfortunate effect of discouraging sound \nenvironmental practices.\n  The legislation I will introduce today makes the point that the \nFederal Government should encourage responsible actions by businesses \nwith incentives and flexibility, rather than through threats and \npenalties. Given the limited resources available for environmental \nenforcement and monitoring, it is vital that companies self-police and \nbe willing partners in the implementation of the Nation's environmental \nprograms. There is no other way to protect our people, our communities, \nand our environment.\n  In an effort to advance this idea, I am introducing the Environmental \nAudit Privilege Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my \nfriend from Colorado, Senator Hank Brown.\n  This legislation will create new incentives for companies to police \ntheir own environmental actions by establishing a limited legal \nprivilege for businesses that voluntarily audit their compliance with \nenvironmental laws and promptly proceed to correct any violations \ndiscovered.\n  In 1993, Oregon became the first State to codify a privilege for \nenvironmental audits. Under the Oregon law, an internal environmental \naudit, undertaken voluntarily, cannot be used against the company in a \ntrial or administrative action, unless efforts to comply were not \npromptly initiated and pursued with reasonable diligence or the \nprivilege was invoked for fraudulent purposes. The Oregon law garnered \nsupport not only from the business community, but also from the Oregon \nDepartment of Environmental Quality and the State attorney general. \nThese supporters have told me of the positive effects this law has had \nin Oregon.\n  Six other States have created a similar privilege, including \nColorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Illinois, and Wyoming. Nearly \ntwo dozen other States are considering bills to create an environmental \naudit privilege. Supporters of these State provisions argue that their \nefforts are undermined by the absence of a Federal counterpart. To \navoid the State privilege, a litigant must simply file suit in Federal \ncourt, where it is possible the State privilege will not be recognized.\n  The legislation I put forward today is an extension of legislation I \nintroduced in the 103d\n Congress which was based solely on the Oregon law. A new section has \nbeen added to this bill as a result of the very constructive efforts of \nSenator Brown. This new section is based on a worthy idea pioneered by \nthe State of Colorado.\n\n  The audit privilege portion of my bill strikes an equitable balance \nbetween protecting a company's right to self-police and ensuring that \nbusinesses comply with environmental regulations. There are clear \nlimits on the privilege, however. The privilege would cease to exist if \nused for fraudulent activities or if waived by a company. Furthermore, \nthe privilege is moot if the company does not promptly act to achieve \ncompliance when a violation is discovered in an audit. This factor \nensures a strong incentive for companies to immediately correct any \npotential or real problem in their activities.\n  Even if the company proceeds immediately to correct a violation, the \nprivilege is not absolute. The privilege only extends to information in \nthe audit report, not to the violation itself. It would not bar \nenforcement action for environmental violations; no environmental law \nis decriminalized nor are enforcement agencies barred from pursuing \naction. This protection does not prevent an agency or an injured party \nfrom pursuing legal action against a violator on the basis of \nindependent evidence of the violation.\n  Oregon's law has expanded employee involvement, which has made audits \nmore complete and accurate, and it has helped employees connect their \ndaily jobs with environmental compliance. It has also created new \nincentives for companies to independently pursue compliance while \nencouraging businesses to adopt more systematic approaches to examining \nand correcting their environmental activities.\n  Last, but by no means least, lawyers are no longer needed in Oregon \nto shield audit documents under the attorney-client privilege. \nCompanies can now feel secure in keeping records, and they have had \nmuch greater success in dealing with chronic problems. Removing lawyers \nfrom audits substantially reduces the cost of auditing and improves the \nfrankness of information flowing within companies.\n  The legislation I am introducing today also includes a very important \nsection which I will refer to as voluntary disclosure. This section \nprovides protection for companies that wish to step forward and \nvoluntarily disclose inadvertent violations of environmental laws that \ncome to light through the conduct of a voluntary environmental audit. \nAgain, these provisions are based on a law first passed in the State of \nColorado. It has been a pleasure to have worked with Senator Brown and \nhis fine staff over the past several months to reach agreement on this \nimportant section of the bill.\n  Under this section, if an audit reveals a previously unknown \nenvironmental violation, the company will be immune from \nadministrative, civil, or criminal penalties if it: First, promptly and \nvoluntarily discloses the violation to the regulatory agency; second, \ntakes prompt steps to correct the problem; and, third, fully cooperates \nwith the \n[[Page S4265]] regulatory agency. As with the privilege, this \nprotection does not prevent an agency or an injured party from pursuing \nlegal action against a violator on the basis of independent evidence of \nthe violation.\n  While Oregon did not include such provisions in its law, I believe \nproviding protections for voluntary disclosures is a meritorious idea, \nand one certainly worthy of the full consideration of the Senate. As \none of my colleagues recently noted, sunlight is an excellent \ndisinfectant. Thus, while the privilege portions of this bill allow an \nenvironmental audit to remain secret, the voluntary disclosure \nprovisions would give the public access to this important information\n and would require any violations be addressed promptly.\n\n  Last week, President Clinton announced his plans to encourage \nenvironmental audits as part of a package of regulatory reform \nmeasures. I want to commend the President and those at EPA who have \nrecognized the benefits of encouraging companies to engage in this type \nof self-analysis. I believe both business profitability and the \nenvironment will benefit from these efforts, and I look forward to \nworking with the administration on the legislative side of this effort.\n  I am aware the administration has serious misgivings about codifying \nand audit privilege and has raised questions about the voluntary \ndisclosure protection in this bill. I admit this is an issue that \nexcludes great common sense appeal upon first glance, but which \ncertainly grows more complex with each level of further analysis. While \nI am not a lawyer, my further analysis leads me to the conclusion that \nthis idea is sound and that the Nation would benefit from the debate \nthis legislative proposal will inevitably generate.\n  Self-enforcement by responsible companies is vital to the success of \nour environmental objectives. It is a fact that most companies want to \npolice themselves. Not only is it morally correct, it is also \nconsistent with a total quality management approach to business \nmanagement, for companies to take a proactive approach to environmental \nsafety. It makes business sense and is less costly for a company to \nfind and rectify a violation than it is to face regulatory, civil, or \ncriminal action. Incentives for self-enforcement will help free up the \nvery limited resources of Federal and State environmental and \nenforcement agencies, allowing them to pursue the most severe, \negregious, and dangerous violations of our environmental laws.\n  Federal policy must promote the delicate balance between protecting \nour environment and allowing business to flourish. The Environmental \nAudit Privilege Act will provide companies with greater flexibility and \nwith incentives for compliance with environmental protection \nregulations. Such protections will signal an important step toward \nensuring the success of our businesses and of our environmental \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

The purpose is to \n     protect environmental audits and provide qualified penalty \n     immunity for voluntary disclosures made as a result of \n     conducting environmental audits. The Act consists of the \n     following four sections:\n\n\n       A. Sec. 3801. Admissibility of Environmental Audit Reports\n\n       Generally, environmental audit reports prepared in good \n     faith are not subject to discovery and are not admissible in \n     any federal administrative or judicial proceeding.\n       Exclusions: The protection against admissibility does not \n     apply to documents or information: Required to be collected, \n     maintained or reported under environmental laws; available \n     due to the agency's own observation, sampling or monitoring; \n     or available from an independent source.\n       Waiver: Waiver can only occur by an express waiver by the \n     owner or operator of the facility that initiated audit.\n       Inapplicability: The protection is not applicable if: An \n     environmental audit report shows non-compliance with an \n     environmental law and the entity does not promptly initiate \n     actions to achieve compliance and pursue those actions with \n     reasonable diligence, or the protection is claimed for a \n     fraudulent purpose.\n       Determination of Applicability: A federal court determines \n     the applicability of the protection in an in camera review of \n     an audit report or portion of an audit report.\n       Burden of Proof: The person or government entity invoking \n     the protection has the burden of demonstrating its\n      applicability and if there are instances of non-compliance, \n     that appropriate efforts to achieve compliance have been \n     initiated. The party seeking discovery of the audit report \n     has the burden of proving that the protections were waived \n     or that the privilege was invoked for a fraudulent \n     purpose.\n       Other Statutes/Requirements: The Act does not affect any \n     existing statutory or common law rules of evidence, discovery \n     or privilege (such as attorney-client privilege and work-\n     product doctrine).\n\n\n                        b. Sec. 3802. testimony\n\n       Any person that performs an environmental audit is not \n     required to give testimony relating to the audit in an \n     administrative or judicial proceeding. This applies to \n     officers and employees of the person or government entity as \n     well as the person or government entity itself.\n\n\n              c. Sec. 3803. disclosure to a federal agency\n\n       The Act defines a disclosure as ``voluntary'' if: it arises \n     out of an ``environmental audit'' (as defined); it is made \n     promptly after learning of the information; actions are \n     undertaken to achieve compliance; and the person or entity \n     making the disclosure provides additional relevant \n     information as requested by the appropriate agency.\n       Involuntary Disclosures: Otherwise voluntary disclosures \n     will not be voluntary if the person or government entity has \n     committed repeated violations of federal or state \n     environmental laws or orders during the three years prior to \n     the disclosure.\n       Presumption of Voluntariness: Disclosures are presumed to \n     be voluntary, and unless rebutted, the person or government \n     entity is immune from administrative, civil or criminal \n     penalties for the violation(s) disclosed.\n       Rebuttal of Presumption: The federal agency has the burden \n     of rebutting the presumption of voluntariness of the \n     disclosure.\n                       d.

Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I understand you are favorably \n     inclined to introducing legislation this Congress for a \n     federal environmental audit privilege. Your bill would be \n     modeled along the lines of the law Associated Oregon \n     Industries pushed through the Oregon legislature in 1993. On \n     behalf of Associated Oregon Industries' 2,400 primary members \n     and 14,000 associate members, I applaud you efforts to \n     actively pursue a federal law protecting environmental audit \n     reports.\n       Oregon's environmental audit privilege was signed into law \n     by Gov. Barbara Roberts on July 22, 1994. Oregon's law is the \n     first of its kind in the nation. Since enactment, other \n     states have adopted similar laws.\n       As a whole, Oregon industry works hard to comply with \n     today's complex and voluminous environmental laws. Perfect \n     compliance at all times, however, is a virtually unattainable \n     objective for large facilities. Compliance is made all the \n     more difficult when reports, generated during a company's \n     voluntary environmental audit, are not confidential. Prior to \n     Oregon's law, environmental agencies could obtain such audit \n     reports and use them against a company in an enforcement \n     action. By making environmental audit reports privileged. \n     Oregon's law protects companies from ``hanging themselves'' \n     as long as actions are taken to correct any violations found.\n       Though Oregon's regulated companies are reacting positively \n     to the new state protections, Oregon's new law does not \n     complete the protection circle. The Environmental Protection \n     Agency is not bound by Oregon's environmental audit privilege \n     and occasionally inspects Oregon companies. This is why a \n     federal environmental audit privilege is needed.\n       Thank you for your efforts. I look forward to working with \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M. Whitty,\n     Legislative Counsel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                             Port of Portland,\n\n                                     Portland, OR, March 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of the Port of Portland, I \n     want to express the Port's strong support for the \n     environmental auditing privilege and voluntary disclosure \n     bill that you are sponsoring.\n       The Port conducts periodic environmental audits at all of \n     its facilities. The enactment of a federal environmental \n     auditing privilege and voluntary disclosure provision will \n     encourage many more businesses, especially medium- and small-\n     sized businesses, to start environmental auditing. By \n     limiting the fear that their voluntarily prepared \n     environmental audit reports will be used against \n     [[Page S4268]] them in enforcement proceedings, your bill \n     will spur this auditing activity.\n       In addition to the environmental audit report evidentiary \n     privilege, I understand your legislation includes a voluntary \n     disclosure component to protect persons who discover \n     inadvertent environmental violations from criminal or civil \n     penalties, if they report the violations to the proper \n     authorities and remedy them promptly. We believe this \n     voluntary disclosure provision is as important as the \n     environmental auditing privilege. We are pleased to see that \n     your bill includes both of these elements.\n       Your environmental audit privilege and voluntary disclosure \n     legislation should result in more companies conducting \n     environmental audits and in a substantial overall increase in \n     compliance with environmental requirements. Thank you for \n     your efforts. Please let me know if there are steps we can \n     take to support passage of this measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Lohman,\n     Director, Policy and Planning.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Litton Corp.,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I am writing on behalf of Litton \n     Industries, Inc. to express Litton's strong support for the \n     environmental auditing privilege and voluntary disclosure \n     bill that you are co-sponsoring with Sen. Brown, and that we \n     understand you intend to introduce imminently.\n       Litton is a leader in worldwide technology markets for \n     advanced electronic and defense systems, and a major designer \n     and builder of large, multimission combat ships for the U.S. \n     Navy and allied nations. Litton employs approximately 30,000 \n     people at numerous facilities across the country, including \n     approximately 200 people in our Grants Pass, Oregon facility.\n       Litton conducts periodic environmental audits at all of its \n     U.S. facilities. The enactment of a federal environmental \n     auditing privilege and voluntary disclosure provision will \n     encourage many more businesses, especially medium- and small-\n     sized businesses, to start environmental auditing programs, \n     without fear that their voluntarily prepared environmental \n     audit reports will be used against them in enforcement \n     proceedings.\n       In addition to the environmental audit report evidentiary \n     privilege, we understand that your legislation includes a \n     voluntary disclosure component which protects persons who \n     discover inadvertent environmental violations, report the \n     violations to the proper authorities, and remedy them \n     promptly from criminal or civil penalties. Litton views the \n     voluntary disclosure provision to be as important as the \n     environmental auditing privilege, and we are gratified that \n     your bill will include both of these elements.\n       Litton believes that your environmental audit privilege and \n     voluntary disclosure legislation will result in more \n     companies conducting environmental audits, and in a \n     substantial overall increase in compliance with environmental \n     requirements. Litton commends and will support your \n     environmental audit privilege and voluntary disclosure bill. \n     We believe that it represents a superior approach to \n     environmental compliance because it emphasizes improved \n     environmental quality rather than increased environmental \n     enforcement. Thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mark V. Stanga,\n     Environmental Affairs Counsel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              Ontario Produce,\n\n                                                   March 17, 1995.\n     Senator Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I would like to give my support for \n     your bill providing for a federal environmental audit \n     privilege similar to the Oregon law. It would allow \n     businesses to realistically correct problems without creating \n     more problems for themselves.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Robert Komoto.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                         AT,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: We at AT were pleased to learn \n     that you plan to introduce a bill establishing a privilege \n     for environmental audits and a limited ``safer harbor'' for \n     those who voluntarily correct and disclose environmental \n     infractions.\n       AT has a strong record of environmental compliance, has \n     performed environmental self-audits for many years, and is \n     continuously improving its environmental compliance \n     management systems. AT has played a strong role in \n     protecting our environment through voluntary reductions in \n     materials usage and recycling.\n       Environmentally responsible companies such as AT, which \n     perform voluntary self-assessments, are presently placed in \n     the uncomfortable position of creating documents in the \n     course of their voluntary compliance efforts which government \n     agencies and special interest groups will try to use against \n     them in penalty actions and citizen's suits.\n       Similarly, enforcement agencies often assess large \n     penalties as a consequence of a responsible company's \n     voluntarily disclosure of an environmental infraction \n     discovered through voluntary audits and self-assessment \n     processes and voluntarily corrected. Absent these voluntary \n     audit and self-assessment procedures, such violations would \n     likely continue uncorrected, undisclosed, and unpenalized. \n     Thus, current enforcement policy works as a disincentive to \n     voluntary compliance, and thus works against the environment.\n       AT salutes your efforts to legislatively remedy this \n     problem. AT would fully support a bill that would, under \n     appropriate conditions, protect environmental audits from \n     disclosure and create a safe harbor for companies that have \n     voluntarily discovered, corrected, and disclosed \n     environmental violations to the government.\n       We look forward to working with you, your staff, and other \n     interested parties toward the enactment of such legislation. \n     Such legislation would add a measure of fairness to the \n     enforcement process and would remove disincentives to engage \n     in voluntary audits, compliance management, and disclosure \n     activities.\n       By eliminating some of the inequities and disincentives in \n     the current enforcement scheme, we believe Congress will \n     cause a higher level of voluntary compliance by American \n     business with concomitant benefit to our environment.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Norm Smith.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Georgia-Pacific Corp.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: Georgia-Pacific Corporation is very \n     supportive of the need for the Congress to enact an \n     environmental audit protection bill. The State of Oregon has \n     passed legislation to afford legal protection to the \n     environmental audits we perform in our manufacturing \n     facilities to help us in compliance with a host of \n     environmental permits (air, water, solid waste, hazardous \n     materials).\n       The corporation is moving aggressively to increase the \n     audit program at every location to accomplish not only basic \n     compliance, but more importantly to elevate the importance of \n     environmental performance in the daily operation of our mills \n     and plants. We are ranking environmental performance on an \n     equal status of employee safety.\n       The potential misuse of this information in third party \n     litigation is a major problem. We have experienced such \n     misuse in Mississippi in connection with our water discharge \n     permit at paper mill. If public policy demands proper \n     compliance and monitoring, it should encourage--not \n     discourage--more auditing by companies. We have been \n     disappointed by EPA's own policy on environmental audits that \n     discourages auditing.\n       A number of States have enacted or are considering \n     legislation this year. However, this public policy should be \n     uniform nationwide. Thus, G-P's strong support for audit \n     protection legislation. G-P management in Oregon has advised \n     us of your interest in leading such legislation. Because of \n     your knowledge of our company in the State and your \n     responsible record on environmental issues, we strongly urge \n     you to take a leadership role on environmental audits.\n       I can assure you that should you introduce legislation to \n     afford appropriate protection to environmental audits, G-P \n     will not only be appreciative of this effort, but we will \n     work very hard in support of your effort with other Senators.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John M. Turner,\n     Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                 The GEON Co.,\n\n                                    Cleveland, OH, March 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: The Geon Co. strongly supports the \n     Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act, which we \n     understand will be introduced tomorrow. This Act will benefit \n     not only responsible members of the regulated community, but \n     the public as well, by encouraging companies to implement \n     strong and effective environmental auditing and oversight \n     programs.\n       It has been our experience that most potential compliance \n     problems are discovered and corrected through voluntary self-\n     audits. The fear of discouraging past compliance problems, \n     especially when they may give rise to huge potential civil \n     penalties, is a very real disincentive to proactive \n     compliance programs that rely on internal and external self-\n     audits.\n       Although the U.S. EPA has claimed that voluntary self-\n     disclosure issues can be addressed as a part of its \n     enforcement policies and that legislation is unnecessary, we \n     have, unfortunately, first-hand current experience that the \n     EPA has been woefully remiss in adopting or even pursuing any \n     enforcement policies that affect the purpose to which your \n     bill is addressed, and those policies the EPA has recently \n     proposed would fall far short of their state objectives.\n       [[Page S4269]] We believe that current EPA enforcement \n     policies often single out for punishment environmentally \n     responsible proactive companies, which are thereby placed at \n     a competitive disadvantage with their less proactive \n     competitors.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           William F.

Mark Hatfield,\n     US Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Hon. Senator Hatfield: Polaroid Corporation wishes to \n     express its support for legislation that you and Senator \n     Brown intend to introduce which will allow for a Federal \n     Environmental Audit Privilege and for Voluntary Disclosure \n     Protection. Polaroid is a worldwide manufacturer of various \n     Imaging Products, and the majority of its manufacturing \n     facilities are located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n       Polaroid believes that the fundamental policy \n     justifications underlying the proposed ``Voluntary \n     Environmental Audit Protection Act'' are consistent with this \n     nation's laudable goals of encouraging higher levels of \n     responsible environmental protection rather than simply \n     continuing the promotion of ``command and control'' style \n     environmental regulations. The substantial and measurable \n     levels of environmental improvement that have been achieved \n     in the United States over the past twenty-five years are, in \n     large part, the result of the combined actions of the US \n     Congress, the administrative agencies of the Executive, and \n     American Industry. But new, more positive and cost effective \n     incentives than those needed in the 1970's and 80's are \n     required to enhance environmental protection and improve \n     environmental performance in the 1990's. Polaroid supports \n     this legislation and your actions involved in introducing and \n     overseeing its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Harry Fatkin,\n\n                                          Division Vice President,\n     Health, Safety & Environmental Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            Environmental Auditing Roundtable,\n\n                             North Ridgeville, OH, March 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     US Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman hatfield: Following are the views of the \n     Environmental Audit Roundtable on the ``Voluntary \n     Environmental Audit Protection Act'' that you and Senator \n     Brown are introducing. The intent of the bill is to encourage \n     environmental auditing for compliance and effective \n     management systems to ensure compliance and continual \n     improvement.\n       The EAR, representing over 800 members, is the largest body \n     of professional Environmental Health and Safety Auditors in \n     the world.\n       As a general rule, our organization should be silent on \n     activity that are external to the auditing process unless \n     those activities promotes improvement in audit quality. We \n     believe the concept of improving disclosure through a \n     privilige mechanism will improve the quality of the audit \n     process in the followng ways:\n       1. Removing the fear of penalty when non compliance is \n     inadvertent will promote disclosure between the auditors and \n     the audited entity.\n       2. The concept will encourage implementation of \n     Environmental Audits.\n       3. The concept will facilitate the flow of information from \n     the regulated community to the agency with regard to \n     understanding and implementing environmental regulation. For \n     small and medium size enterprises that do not have large EH \n     staffs it is essential that an open dialogue with state and \n     federal agencies be promoted to assist in understanding and \n     implementing regulations. In addition, this\n      exchange of information will provide valuable feedback on \n     ways in which to make the regulation more understandable \n     and efficient. Under our current regime of command and \n     control there is little or no information flow from the \n     regulated community to the agencies because the \n     consequences are unpredictable.\n       4. The International Standards Organization (ISO) will be \n     issuing a series of standards in early 1996 that could \n     revolutionize the approach for managing and improving \n     environment performance. Linkage between our national \n     regulatory scheme and this international effort will depend \n     on the agencies ability to communicate with its regulated \n     customers. The concept of disclosure will elevate the level \n     of communication.\n       In conclusion EAR believes that the legislation will \n     promote environmental dialogue at all levels and improve the \n     quality of the audit process. We believe the current \n     regulatory mechanism of police and fine should be replaced \n     with a cooperative program of disclose and correct. \n     Legislation that promotes information exchange between state \n     and federal agencies and their regulated customers creates \n     fertile fields for innovative solutions and continual \n     improvement.\n           Regards,\n     Ronald F. Black.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Philips Electronics Corp.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: Philips Electronics is pleased to \n     support your legislation known as the Voluntary Environmental \n     Audit Protection Act. This legislation makes eminent sense in \n     that it removes the threat of unreasonable penalty for an \n     action of good faith to correct certain situations arising \n     from noncompliance with environmental law. Philips \n     Electronics and the vast majority of U.S. manufacturers \n     strive to be good corporate citizens with respect to \n     environmental and other laws. Your legislation will create an \n     enforcement atmosphere that will encourage such good \n     corporate citizenry.

Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of the Coalition for \n     Improved Environmental Audits (``CIEA''), we write in support \n     of your proposed legislation for environmental audit and \n     voluntary disclosure protection. We applaud your efforts in \n     conjunction with Senator Brown to introduce this legislation \n     into the Senate. CIEA was formed to support legislative \n     initiatives for the protection of environmental audits and \n     voluntary disclosures; therefore, we wholly support your \n     efforts to establish a qualified self-examination privilege \n     that helps encourage companies to conduct comprehensive \n     audits by reducing the risk that the audits will be used \n     against them in enforcement proceedings. CIEA membership \n     includes corporations and trade associations committed to \n     establishing useful and effective environmental auditing \n     programs. CIEA member companies own and operate facilities \n     throughout the United States and welcome your proposed \n     legislation to encourage and protect comprehensive \n     environmental audits at their facilities.\n       CIEA supports your efforts to introduce legislation that \n     establishes a federal environmental audit privilege and \n     immunity for voluntary disclosures. The privilege will \n     encourage corporations to establish useful and effective \n     environmental auditing programs. The conditional immunity \n     described in Section 3803 of the proposed legislation will \n     encourage corporations to conduct candid assessments and \n     timely remediation of any noncompliance with environmental \n     laws. Recognition of a qualified environmental audit \n     privilege and immunity provision will enhance compliance with \n     environmental regulations without harming the ability of \n     enforcement officials to prosecute significant wrongdoers.\n       U.S. industry can rely on a commitment made through \n     legislation. Therefore, your federal legislation for the \n     environmental audit privilege and voluntary disclosure \n     protection allows U.S. industry to conduct environmental \n     audits without the fear that the audit will end up being used \n     against them. Now that federal legislation for the \n     environmental audit privilege is moving forward (and seven \n     States have enacted similar statutes) EPA should establish \n     policy that reinforces this legislation.\n       The CIEA membership appreciates the opportunity to support \n     your forthcoming legislation for the environmental audit \n     privilege and voluntary disclosure immunity. We believe a \n     reasoned discussion of the issues of environmental audit \n     privileges will result in the passage of your bill, which \n     will encourage and improve corporate environmental \n     compliance.\n           Sincerely,\n     John L. Wittenborn,\n     Stephanie Siegel,\n                                          Counsel to the Coalition\n     for Improved Environmental Audits.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           The BFGoodrich Co.,\n\n                                        Akron, OH, March 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatfield: The BFGoodrich Company wishes to \n     express its support for legislation that you and Senator \n     Brown are introducing--``The Voluntary Environmental Audit \n     Protection Act.''\n       The BFGoodrich Company provides aircraft systems, \n     components and services and manufactures a wide range of \n     specialty chemicals. BFGoodrich manufactures in seven \n     countries and operates an international network of sales \n     offices and aircraft service centers with our Corporate \n     headquarters in Akron, Ohio.\n       Because of the Company's international presence, we are \n     exposed to a wide variety of environment, health and safety \n     requirements. In order to ensure compliance with these \n     requirements, our Company conducts environment, health and \n     safety audits worldwide.\n       [[Page S4270]] Only in the United States do we have a \n     system where responsibly managed organizations suffer severe \n     punishment for maintaining a review process to ensure \n     compliance. Our current system is subject to the whim of U.S. \n     EPA interpretations in the different regions of our nation. \n     This does not allow for certainty in interpretation or \n     fairness in enforcement.\n       Your proposed legislation, along with the legislation \n     already enacted in those states that have chosen a new \n     approach for the regulated community, will establish a \n     mechanism where those who are sincere in trying to improve \n     the environment will benefit--while those who continue to \n     disregard good practices will be subject to the full \n     enforcement of the law.\n       Your legislation is forward-looking and compatible with \n     international programs. It will encourage our government \n     agencies to focus their efforts on those who truly require \n     oversight while encouraging greater disclosure of information \n     and communications from the regulated community. Moreover, it \n     will provide regulatory agencies with information to improve \n     programs and better measure performance.\n       BFGoodrich supports your proposed legislation and actions \n     aimed at introducing and overseeing its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Jon V.

You \n     have recognized that environmental audits are valuable \n     management tools for improving environmental compliance, that \n     they are good for the environment, and that they will enhance \n     all of our collective efforts to improve environmental \n     performance.\n       Mr. Chairman, we thank you and Senator Brown, and your \n     staffs, for developing this important legislation and stand \n     ready to work with you to see it become law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carl A.

Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: We are pleased to support you and \n     Senator Brown in your efforts to enact the Environmental \n     Audit Disclosure Protection Act.\n       Environmental audits are proven management tools. They \n     provide the opportunity for companies and public facility \n     operators to take a close critical look at their operations, \n     determine compliance with the thousands of complicated, often \n     confusing and overlapping environmental regulations and \n     statutes now on the books and fix any problem discovered. In \n     Colorado with the passage of a bill in 1994 that is very \n     similar to yours, we are creating a climate of some \n     certainty, wherein a company or facility operator knows what \n     kind of enforcement treatment to expect before investing in \n     expensive and time consuming environmental audits and then \n     disclosing results to state regulatory authorities. We \n     strongly believe this certainty, albeit limited, goes a long \n     way toward promoting self-initiated audits.\n       However, that same certainty must be applied at the Federal \n     level to allow the Colorado statute, and others like it, to \n     be fully effective and widely utilized. That is why your bill \n     is so important. The debate over proper Federal legal \n     controls over the extent, form and utilization of voluntary \n     self audits and the use of the information obtained has been \n     a matter of controversy among regulators in Washington who \n     hold unchallenged power and control under the current command \n     and control system.\n       Stanley Legro, EPA's Chief Enforcement official from 1975-\n     77, wrote an interesting article entitled ``Self Audits and \n     EPA Enforcement'' in the Environmental Forum, December 1994. \n     The article follows this letter. To paraphrase Mr. Legro, he \n     says in order to reach the next plateau to improving the \n     quality of the environment there must be a shift from the \n     current enforcement mentality to providing incentives to \n     increase compliance. In moving to that next plateau Mr. Legro \n     says he ``favors maximizing incentives for voluntary self \n     audits.''\n       We believe that your bill as drafted embraces Mr. Legro's \n     thoughts by striking an appropriate and constructive balance \n     between many of the relevant competing interests involved. \n     The bill provides protection for responsible entities against \n     being punished for doing the right thing without impending \n     enforcement against those who flaunt environmental laws. It \n     is truly refreshing without impeding enforcement against \n     those who flaunt environmental laws. It is truly refreshing \n     to see legislation that benefits the environment, benefits \n     responsible industry, protects against abuses, imposes no \n     costly mandates and doesn't spend a dime of taxpayers' money. \n     Indeed, it may even reduce the need for, and expense of, \n     certain enforcement resources.\n       Coors looks forward to assisting you and Senator Brown to \n     secure early enactment of this legislation.\n           Respectfully yours,\n\n                                              Alan R. Timothy,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Federal Government Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Environmental Forum, December 1994]\n\n                    Self Audits and EPA Enforcement\n\n                         (By Stanley W. Legro)\n\n       The high degree of interest in the public meeting held by \n     EPA on auditing last summer is strong evidence of the \n     continuing importance of this vital subject. Indeed, it may \n     be fair to say that the subject of auditing necessarily \n     raises the most fundamental issue affecting the EPA: What is \n     the role of enforcement in achieving the agency's primary \n     purpose for being?\n       The debate about voluntary self-audits and the use of the \n     information obtained has been ongoing since the earliest days \n     of the EPA. It was a hotly debated subject during my tenure \n     as the agency's chief enforcement official from 1975-77. It \n     continues to be a hotly debated issue today. Its long tenure \n     and the agency's inability to come to closure on a decision \n     are to a large extent attributable to the difficult policy \n     choices involved.\n       The fundamental issue is whether the EPA's primary purpose \n     to improve the quality of the environment is best achieved by \n     providing positive incentives for voluntary compliance and \n     remediation or by punishing, for past actions or omissions, \n     those who have failed to meet their responsibilities to \n     preserve and maintain the quality of the environment. These \n     are not easily separable.\n       During the nascent stages of the agency, strong enforcement \n     actions and substantial punishments for violators were \n     necessary to convince both the public and those in regulated \n     industries that environmental laws were to be taken seriously \n     and that failure to comply could have serious consequences. \n     During my tenure, there was still a substantial questioning \n     among many in the regulated communities as to whether these \n     environmental requirements were a passing fad that might be \n     repealed by the next Congress and whether the EPA really \n     meant business. An emphasis on vigorous enforcement was vital \n     to send an unequivocal answer to those questions.\n       With the hindsight of time, I am convinced that the \n     decision made then was the right one, emphasis on vigorous \n     enforcement to send the clear message that or country had \n     made a decision to improve the quality of the environment, \n     and that those who tried to thwart the effort would face \n     severe consequences. While our country still has much left to \n     do, the progress to date is proof of the wisdom of choosing \n     robust enforcement.\n       Today, we are faced with a somewhat different situation \n     which, I believe, calls for a different emphasis. One should \n     not gainsay the vital continuing role of vigorous \n     enforcement. We must begin by leaving no doubt whatsoever \n     that anyone who intentionally or recklessly harms or \n     endangers the quality of our environment, no matter how long \n     after the fact the transgression is discovered, should--\n     indeed must--be subject to the full force of the law.\n       Nevertheless, now there is a high degree of awareness of \n     the existence of environmental laws and regulations in \n     general, as well as the specific requirements for compliance, \n     among the regulated communities as well as among the public. \n     There is relatively little incidence of knowing or \n     intentional actions or omissions which harm or degrade the \n     environment. From my present perspective, a much bigger \n     barrier to continuing substantial progress is awareness of \n     environmental problems on the ground so that appropriate \n     remedial actions can be promptly commenced and effectively \n     accomplished in a timely manner.\n       This brings us to environmental audits. What is the best \n     balance between the carrot and the stick to achieve the best \n     overall results? I recommend that today, while the stick \n     should always remain within easy reach, the emphasis must be \n     shifted to providing incentives for broad scale voluntary \n     compliance. In my opinion, the emphasis today should be on \n     those measures that will encourage environmental audits and \n     the benefits which they can produce in the real world.\n       [[Page S4271]] Accordingly, I suggest that the results of \n     environmental audits should not be used by the EPA (or state \n     or local) enforcement authorities to seek penalties for any \n     past acts or omissions unless it is shown that such acts or \n     omissions were intentional with knowledge that they would or \n     were likely to result in serious harm to the environment or \n     were reckless.\n       At the same time, I recommend that the results of \n     environmental audits be provided to the agency, and that they \n     serve as a benchmark for future remediation and correction of \n     practices, processes, and existing pollution which they have \n     revealed. In other words, prospectively the results of \n     environmental audits will be used to set a high standard, but \n     one that is fair because it offers an opportunity to take \n     those actions which would avoid or alleviate the \n     environmental harm.\n       If the EPA discovers a violation by its own inspection or \n     as a result of information received from a third party, I \n     believe that it should pursue vigorously all remedies \n     available. However, if the discovery is a result of a \n     voluntary audit and is timely reported first to the EPA by \n     the source, policy considerations weigh in favor of \n     encouraging voluntary self audits and prompt follow-up \n     corrective actions.\n       We also need to consider the nature and extent of \n     privilege, the right to confidentiality for the results of \n     environmental audits. Some jurisdictions have adopted this \n     approach. I have researched and considered the issue at \n     length. It is my conclusion that the use of a privilege \n     approach by the EPA is an unsatisfactory solution which does \n     not protect the environment nor provide maximum incentive to \n     initiate self audits. (However, it is vital to have a \n     privilege from disclosure to private parties and to any state \n     or local officials who refuse to join in the recommended EPA \n     approach.)\n       From the perspective of the EPA, the purpose of this, as \n     any other policy, is to improve the environment. The agency \n     seeks to provide incentives for self audits to discover and \n     to commence prompt and effective remedial measures. The self \n     audit is merely a means; without assuring that the audit \n     results are put to use, the policy fails. The remedial \n     measures are the end. A privilege approach gives no assurance \n     that problems discovered will result in remedial actions \n     taken. Indeed, the privilege approach may actually discourage \n     prompt remedial measures in many cases.\n       From the perspective of the corporate executive, the \n     privilege approach is also unsatisfactory for at least two \n     reasons. First, some information resulting from the audit is \n     likely to be subject to mandatory disclosure under certain \n     environmental laws and securities laws. Such partial \n     disclosure will often lead to investigations or audits that \n     independently uncover most, if not all, of the information \n     for which the privilege is claimed. Second, and even more \n     important from the point of view of a corporate official \n     deciding whether to undertake a voluntary self audit, a \n     privilege does nothing to eliminate liability for past \n     violations; a self audit increases the availability of \n     evidence to authorities to prove those violations. For these \n     reasons, a privilege approach would not be the best policy \n     for the EPA.\n       In sum, in order to maximize the incentives to conduct self \n     audits and to apply the information obtained to realize the \n     greatest environmental improvement, I recommend the following \n     commitment by the agency's enforcement authorities:\n       The EPA will continue to apply the full penalties for past \n     violations discovered by EPA inspections or by a means other \n     than as a result of a voluntary self audit and timely \n     reporting by the source. Penalties will not be assessed for \n     past violations discovered by a voluntary self audit and \n     voluntarily reported to EPA, unless the past violation was \n     intentional or resulted from reckless conduct. Last, once a \n     violation has been discovered and reported, the source will \n     be required promptly to take prospective actions necessary to \n     prevent a continuance or recurrence of the problem and to \n     commence appropriate remedial measures to protect and restore \n     the quality of the environment.\n       All policy choices must be measured against the standard of \n     achieving the greatest amount of improvement in our \n     environmental quality. Today, I believe the balance should \n     favor maximizing the incentives for voluntary self audits. \n     Voluntary environmental self audits, reporting past \n     violations and pollution which requires remedial actions \n     discovered by those audits to the EPA, and undertaking prompt \n     and effective remedial measures offer the best opportunity to \n     achieve our national policy objectives in the shortest period \n     of time. This is the right policy choice for the EPA today.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 American Forest &\n\n\n                                            Paper Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I want to express the support of the \n     American Forest & Paper Association (AF) for the efforts \n     you and Senator Brown have undertaken with regard to granting \n     a limited privilege to internal, voluntary environmental \n     audits.\n       AF is the major trade association representing the \n     forest products industry in this country. We account for 7 \n     percent of all U.S. manufacturing output and directly employ \n     1.6 million workers in the manufacture of forest and paper \n     products and the recovery and recycling of paper. We \n     contribute $49 billion in direct payrolls to local economies \n     and rank among the top ten employers in 46 of the 50 states.\n       AF member companies are regulated under a wide range of \n     environmental programs, including the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Resource Conservation \n     and Recovery Act. The Association strongly supports public \n     policies that will serve to increase compliance with \n     environmental laws by granting a limited protection for \n     information developed by companies through voluntary, \n     internal environmental audit programs. Some states, including \n     Oregon and Colorado, have already enacted statutes providing \n     such protections, and we believe the positive experience \n     gained in these instances bolsters the case for a similar \n     statute at the Federal level.\n       Accordingly, AF strongly supports the leadership you and \n     Senator Brown have shown in this field. Although we have not \n     had the opportunity to analyze your draft legislation in \n     detail, we believe that it will help to lay the foundation \n     for a necessary Federal debate. As a matter of policy, such \n     audits help to increase compliance with environmental \n     safeguards, and should be encouraged. When our analysis of \n     your proposal is completed, AF will share that review with \n     you and your staff. We look forward to working with you to \n     expedite consideration of this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            B.

Our company has developed a strong audit program which \n     will be further strengthened with passage of this proposed \n     legislation. The ability to move rapidly to fix problems and \n     share concerns throughout the company, without the legal \n     concerns that presently overshadow any audit program, will be \n     greatly enhanced.\n       We are aware of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \n     (EPA) effort to amend its current audit policy. However, in \n     our view EPA still takes the position that ``no good deed \n     goes unpunished,'' by providing for penalties when a company \n     voluntarily discloses violations that would not have been \n     found but for the use of good environmental management \n     through auditing.\n       For some time, our management has been actively involved in \n     the conceptual issues concerning auditing and environmental \n     management. Frank Friedman, Elf Atochem N.A. Senior Vice-\n     President for Health, Environment and Safety, is author of \n     the leading book on environmental management, ``A Practical \n     Guide to Environmental Management'' (Fifth Edition 1995) \n     published by the Environmental Law Institute. At EPA's \n     request, Mr. Friedman was the lead-off speaker at the \n     Agency's review of its audit policy in July 1994. In his \n     testimony, Mr. Friedman counseled, as did many others, on the \n     need ``for EPA to develop other indicators of enforcement \n     success rather than just on the basis of the number of cases \n     brought''.\n       There is no question that EPA should retain a strong \n     enforcement program, but it is equally important that \n     enforcement be put in context, namely, as a vehicle for \n     assuring environmental compliance. If compliance is achieved \n     voluntarily; if problems are disclosed and dealt with more \n     rapidly, and more companies develop in-depth audit programs, \n     then EPA's enforcement goals are readily achieved.\n       We also have, at this time, one important comment on the \n     proposed legislation. Proposed Section 3803(b) limits \n     voluntary disclosure if a company has ``committed repeated \n     violations''. We assume this language applies to companies \n     operating a single ``facility''. If not, such a provision \n     disadvantages companies operating multiple facilities with \n     respect to the audit disclosure protections provided in the \n     proposed bill. In such cases, if a violation has occurred at \n     one facility and a company wants to make certain that this \n     will not occur elsewhere it will be penalized. We are sure \n     this is not the intent of the bill and it should be \n     clarified.\n       Again, we wish to commend you and your staff for the \n     careful and thoughtful way in which this proposed legislation \n     was crafted. The proposed bill recognizes that if companies \n     have strong, voluntary auditing programs in place, compliance \n     will follow. Because this legislation represents sound public \n     policy that will advance protection of human health and the \n     environment, Elf Atochem (as will, we are certain, other \n     members of the regulated community) is committed to \n     supporting passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Charles A. Kitchen,\n     Director, Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [[Page S4272]] Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Joel Hefley,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Hefley: I am writing to express EPA's \n     opposition to the environmental audit privilege/penalty \n     immunity provisions currently contained in H.R. 1047. Our \n     concerns include the following:\n       1. Environmental damage or even disasters caused by \n     recklessness or gross negligence would go unpunished under \n     certain provisions. Specifically, regardless of the harm \n     inflicted on people or the environment, H.R. 1047 would \n     eliminate all punishment for certain criminal and other \n     violations if they are ``voluntarily'' disclosed. As we read \n     H.R. 1047, a ``voluntary disclosure,'' for which total \n     immunity from civil and criminal penalties is granted, \n     includes information that is required to be reported--\n     including notification of emergencies as well as routine \n     reports, such as Discharge Monitoring Reports under the Clean \n     Water Act. Truly ``voluntary'' disclosures should be \n     encouraged, but not by granting blanket immunity for criminal \n     and other harmful acts.\n       2. The bill encourages litigation that will further burden \n     our already taxed judicial system. Specifically, the bill \n     uses many vague terms for lawyers to argue over. For example, \n     H.R. 1047 would allow violators to argue that many routine \n     business activities are ``compliance evaluations'' simply to \n     evade disclosure. This kind of litigation will drain both \n     private and government resources and in some cases prevent \n     quick action to address environmental emergencies--despite \n     the exceptions in the bill.\n       3. The evidentiary privilege in this bill appears to go far \n     beyond the attorney-client and work product privileges by \n     potentially shielding from the government and the public \n     virtually all factual information about environmental \n     noncompliance--including facts underlying a self-evaluation \n     that might be crucial in holding violators accountable for \n     their actions. It appears that the privilege would apply to \n     much more than just audit reports and over documents related \n     to self-evaluations.\n       4. It makes sense to give substantial penalty reductions to \n     those who come forward, disclose their violations, and \n     promptly correct them. The penalty immunity provision in the \n     bill, however, gives violators an unfair economic advantage \n     over their law-abiding competitors because it does not allow \n     federal and state governments to recover from the violator \n     even the economic benefit they gained from their \n     noncompliance.\n       As you may know, Administrator Browner asked the Office of \n     Enforcement and Compliance Assurance last May to reassess \n     EPA's environmental auditing policy to see if we needed new \n     incentives to encourage voluntary disclosures and prompt \n     correction of violations uncovered in environmental audits. \n     Our review has been open and inclusive. In July 1994, and \n     again in January 1995, we held public meetings, and an Agency \n     auditing workgroup has met and continues to work with key \n     stakeholders. We have involved industry, trade groups, state \n     environmental commissions and attorneys general's offices, \n     district attorneys' offices, and environmental groups. We \n     have identified approaches that seem to have broad support \n     among these groups.\n       Consistent with prior correspondence between several House \n     members and Administrator Browner, we expect to announce the \n     results of our reassessment process shortly. The issues \n     surrounding environmental auditing, voluntary self-\n     evaluations and voluntary disclosure are complex, and we are \n     eager to share what we have learned with the Congress in \n     hearings. We think it is crucial that the House take the time \n     to hold appropriate hearings on the full range of views on \n     these issues, and to consider alternative approaches that \n     would have the support of a wide range of stakeholders. \n     Unfortunately, H.R. 1047 falls far short of that mark.\n       I look forward to working with you and other members on \n     these very important and complex issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Steven A. Herman,\n     Assistant Administrator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1995.\n     Mr. Steven A. Herman,\n     Assistant Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection \n         Agency, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Herman: I am writing in response to your letter of \n     March 1, 1995. While I appreciate the Office of Enforcement \n     and Compliance Assurance taking the time to comment on H.R. \n     1047, I am disappointed that your letter merely recasts the \n     unsubstantiated objections that the Environmental Protection \n     Agency routinely has made for many years.\n       Let me respond to each of your specific concerns and take \n     the opportunity to explain why protections for legitimate \n     environmental audits and voluntary disclosures are critical \n     for the public health and the environment.\n       1. You argue that the voluntary disclosure provisions would \n     grant blanket immunity from criminal penalties and would \n     include information that is required to be reported under \n     environmental laws, such as Discharge Monitoring Reports, \n     etc.\n       H.R. 1047 does not grant blanket immunity from prosecution. \n     In fact, there is no immunity from prosecution, but simply \n     immunity from administrative, civil and criminal penalties. \n     Further, the immunity is not a ``blanket'' immunity; there \n     are two important limitations. First, the presumption against \n     imposition of penalties is a rebuttable presumption. If the \n     presumption can be rebutted by the EPA (i.e., notice was not \n     given promptly, the information was not learned as a result \n     of an environmental audit or the problem is not corrected) \n     then penalties can be assessed. Second, if a regulated entity \n     has demonstrated a pattern of disregard for environmental \n     laws, they are not eligible for penalty immunity for \n     voluntary disclosures. In addition, information that is \n     voluntarily disclosed that may be required to be reported \n     under an environmental law would only be subject to the \n     immunity if it was learned as a result of performing the \n     environmental audit. This is a significant limitation.\n       2. Your letter states that the legislation will encourage \n     litigation because it is vague and would allow violators to \n     argue that many routine business activities are compliance \n     evaluations to evade disclosure. You do not believe that the \n     exceptions in the bill will prevent such evasion and, \n     consequently, such litigation.\n       H.R. 1047 does not privilege any reports or data that are \n     already required to be compiled or reported. Nor does it \n     restrict EPA's ability to request additional data. The \n     definition of a voluntary environmental self-evaluation is \n     clear in the bill. To qualify, the evaluation must be \n     initiated and carried out by the person for the purpose of \n     determining compliance with environmental laws. The EPA \n     itself has defined environmental auditing in its 1986 policy \n     statement in broader terms. Thus, in this legislation, there \n     are no vague terms behind which persons can hide to evade \n     disclosure of anything that is already required to be \n     reported. It is disingenuous for the EPA to suggest increased \n     litigation as a reason to oppose this bill, when many EPA \n     programs have just that effect.\n       3. You argue that the evidentiary privilege goes beyond the \n     common law attorney-client and work product privileges.\n       While H.R. 1047 does provide a more expanded privilege than \n     the attorney-client privilege, it does not protect the facts \n     that are required to be provided to the EPA. The EPA still \n     has complete access to the date and reports as it had before. \n     Moreover, the EPA can still obtain additional information \n     through investigations, information requests, sampling and \n     monitoring, etc. Facts available to the EPA in documents \n     required to be maintained by entities, reports that must be \n     provided to the EPA and information obtained from independent \n     sources are all still available to the EPA under H.R. 1047. \n     Presumably, these are the facts the EPA believes are \n     necessary to ensure compliance with environmental laws.\n       4. Finally, you argue that the penalty immunity in the \n     legislation gives violators an unfair economic advantage over \n     their law-abiding competitors because it does not allow \n     federal and state regulators to recover the economic benefit \n     gained from noncompliance. Your concern that a violator will \n     derive an economic benefit is misplaced.\n       Under H.R. 1047, as soon as a person voluntarily discloses \n     a violation, that person must promptly achieve compliance in \n     order to receive penalty immunity. These steps include \n     installing whatever equipment may be required. In cases where \n     there are environmentally irresponsible companies that have \n     avoided installing the requisite equipment, any economic \n     benefit that they may have derived will surely be cancelled \n     out--and then some--by having to quickly retrofit their \n     plants to come into compliance. It will likely cost them \n     significantly more to come into compliance at a later date \n     than it did for their competitors who designed compliant \n     systems from the outset. Further, how would the EPA propose \n     to determine any such economic benefit while assuring the \n     certainty required for companies to utilize\n      the voluntary disclosure provisions? I believe this would be \n     terribly difficult to predict with certainty.\n       In addition to the specific responses above, several other \n     points must be considered regarding H.R. 1047. Administrator \n     Browner has emphasized that ``enforcement is not an end in \n     itself.'' She has noted that the EPA must change its ways; \n     that the agency must do everything it can to focus on \n     compliance, and that obstacles to compliance must be \n     eliminated. H.R. 1047 does just that.\n       As the EPA recognizes, an environmental enforcement policy \n     should not discourage compliance. Unfortunately, current EPA \n     and Department of Justice policies do precisely that. Under \n     the current enforcement scheme, responsible entities that \n     work to achieve environmental goals find themselves exposed \n     to greater liability than those in the regulated community \n     who do less or do nothing at all.\n       The result of all this is that responsible members of the \n     regulated community are discouraged from conducting self-\n     evaluations and from voluntarily disclosing violations \n     because of the tremendous risk of civil and criminal \n     enforcement. This negatively impacts compliance which, in \n     turn, negatively impacts public health and the environment. \n     In the end, the environment is the loser.\n       Since the EPA's goal is compliance, not punishment, as \n     stated by the president last Thursday in announcing his \n     regulatory reform package, then surely it makes sense to \n[[Page S4273]] encourage compliance. This view is not without precedent \nat the federal level. Other federal agencies have recognized the need \nto encourage compliance, and have done so by implementing protections \nsimilar to those in H.R. 1047. The Federal Aviation Administration's \npolicy serves as a perfect example that compliance should come first.\n       The FAA policy is designed to provide incentives for \n     deficiencies to be identified and corrected by the companies \n     themselves, rather than risk air safety by awaiting the \n     results of an FAA inspection. In implementing the FAA policy, \n     agency officials emphasized that ``aviation safety is best \n     preserved by incentives . . . to identify and correct their \n     own instances of noncompliance and invest more resources in \n     efforts to preclude recurrence, rather than paying \n     penalties''. Surely, environmental protection is at least as \n     important as aviation safety and, therefore, deserves the \n     same incentives to enhance compliance.\n       H.R. 1047 is critical because it provides incentives to \n     maximize environmental compliance and allocates resources to \n     compliance, not enforcement. I reiterate that intentional \n     violators cannot benefit from the legislation. And while \n     responsible members of the regulated community will indeed \n     benefit in terms of receiving much needed protections and \n     certainty, the real beneficiary of H.R. 1047 is the \n     environment.\n       I look forward to your participation in this debate as the \n     legislative process moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Joel Hefley,\n                                       Member of Congress.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 583.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nprovide certificates of documentation for the vessels Resolution and \nPerserverance.\n  The hovercraft Resolution, Serial Number 77NS8701, and Perserverance, \nSerial Number 77NS8901, were built in 1983 and 1985, respectively, by \nBritish Hovercraft Corp. Limited in East Cowes, Isle of Wight, England.\n  They are 70 feet in length, and have a maximum operating weight of 32 \ntons.\n  The craft were sold to Hovertravel, a United Kingdom company, which \noperated the craft in a passenger ferry operation from the Isle of \nWight, England.\n  The two hovercraft were sold by Hovertravel to the U.S. Navy in 1986 \nResolution, and 1989 Perserverance.\n  They were modified by Textron in Panama City, FL to be used as \ntraining craft for U.S. Navy personnel to learn to operate hovercraft.\n  After being declared surplus by the U.S. Navy, ownership of the \nvessels now resides with Champion Constructors, Inc., a subsidiary of \nCook Inlet Region, Inc. of Anchorage, AK.\n  Because the vessels were built in England, they are undocumented, and \nrequire a waiver of the Jones Act to be operated in the U.S. coastwise \ntrade.\n  Champion Constructors, Inc. intends for the vessels to be used \nbetween points in Alaska transporting cargo and passengers.\n  It is my understanding that no other hovercraft of this type and size \nexist.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding sections 12106, 12107, and 12108 of title 46, \n     United States Code, and section 27 of the Merchant Marine \n     Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     issue a certificate of documentation with a coastwise \n     endorsement for each of the vessels RESOLUTION (Serial Number \n     77NS8701) and PERSERVERANCE (Serial Number 77NS8901).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Lugar, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cochran, \n        Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Ford, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 584. A bill to authorize the award of the Purple Heart to persons \nwho were prisoners of war on or before April 25, 1962; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n\n\n                        PURPLE HEART LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Madame President, I introduce legislation which \nwill correct an inequity that unfairly denies due recognition to some \nof America's worthiest veterans.\n  Specifically, this bill would entitle prisoners of war from War World \nI, World War II, and Korea to receive the Purple Heart Medal for wounds \nwhich were sustained while being captured or while in captivity. \nCurrently, only those veterans who suffer wounds while being captured \nor in captivity after April 25, 1962, are eligible for the Purple Heart \nMedal.\n  While we might debate how best to recognize their sacrifice and \nhardship, one thing is abundantly clear; we should not differentiate \nbetween prisoners of war based solely on the date of the war in which \nthey were captured.\n  Madam President, as a Vietnam veteran who has had the privilege of \nleading marines in combat, and as a member of the Senate's Select \nCommittee on POW/MIA Affairs, I am acutely aware of the hardships \nendured by service personnel who have been captured by hostile military \nforces. All of these servicemen have suffered mental and physical \nabuse, and many were tortured, beaten and starved while in confinement.\n  Our prisoners of war from World War I, World War II, and Korea \nsuffered various wounds and innumerable atrocities at the hands of \ntheir captors. Many continue to suffer from physical difficulties \nassociated with their capture and confinement. The Purple Heart Medal \nwould serve to put their service and sacrifice on par with the veterans \nof other wars, and will remind Americans of their sacrifices. It seems \na fitting and overdue recognition.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, \nthe supporting resolutions of the Military Order of the Purple Heart \nand the Disabled American Veterans, and the letters of support from the \nDAV, American Legion, AMVETS, and the Jewish War Veterans of the United \nStates, be printed in the Record.

You have satisfied the \n     concerns we outlined in our March 31, 1994 letter and we have \n     no objection to the proposed bill as it now reads. The \n     Legion, however, still has no resolution recognized by the \n     membership on this subject and therefore, cannot specifically \n     and formally endorse the bill at this time.\n       In most cases dealing with presentation of military awards \n     and decorations, we defer to the Department of Defense and \n     their appropriate directives. If your proposed bill \n     complements a service regulation you should encounter few \n     objections.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Gerald M.

While we in no way minimize anyone's \n     suffering, there is a fundamental difference between the \n     responsibilities incumbent upon each service member and their \n     civilian counterparts. That alone justifies the limitation on \n     the eligibility for the award.\n       Thank you again for working for America's veterans, and we \n     look forward to working with you in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald M.

A bill to eliminate the Department of Agriculture and certain \nagricultural programs, to transfer other agricultural programs to an \nagribusiness block grant program and other Federal agencies, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                   the agriculture modernization act\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Agriculture \nModernization Act. It would eliminate the Department of Agriculture, \nspinning off some programs to other parts of the Federal Government, \nand sell the two USDA buildings on the Mall.\n  This legislation acknowledges what we all know: the Great Depression \nended 50 years ago and it's 1995. Many USDA activities should go the \nway of the WPA and other programs which, like the USDA's commodity \nprice programs, were set up to deal with the devastation caused by the \nDepression. With recovery, they were disbanded.\n  House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich and Senate Majority \nLeader Bob Dole have proposed eliminating four departments of \ngovernment as part of their deficit reduction plan: Committee, \nEducation, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.\n  If we want to scale back government, and eliminate wasteful \nbureaucracies, the USDA is an excellent place to start. It is the most \nobsolete and bloated of all Cabinet departments. The USDA tops the list \nfor personnel, budget, and subsidies to those who need them least.\n  In scaling back Government, let's start with a department that \nprovides pork for agribusinesses that don't need it before we eliminate \none that helps our children get an education and start on life.\n  In evaluating the Kasich-Dole proposal, it is important to understand \nthat the USDA has 109,000 employees, more than the other four \ndepartments combined. Furthermore, USDA's $62 billion budget dwarfs the \nbudgets of Commerce, Energy, Education and HUD. Indeed, it is almost as \nlarge as these four departments combined.\n  The Agriculture Modernization Act will eliminate wasteful programs in \nUSDA. It will transfer important programs to agencies better suited to \nadminister them, like HHS taking over the Food Stamp Program.\n  And it will put all the money spent on commodity programs into a \nblock grant which will be phased out completely over 5 years. This will \npermit the States to help recipients of agricultural entitlement \nprograms adjust to a scaling back, and then loss, of benefits.\n   [[Page S4275]] This bill will reduce the deficit by approximately \n$25 billion over 5 years. The Republican leaders\n have laid out ambitious deficit reduction goals to slice $500 billion \noff the Federal budget in the next 5 years. They propose to accomplish \nthis without touching Social Security.\n\n  That's going to mean very deep cuts. I'd like to see us start on \nsubsidies to agribusiness and waste at USDA before we cut the safety \nnet out from under our Nation's families and children.\n  The Department of Agriculture's time has come and gone. It began \nunder President Abraham Lincoln. In the 1860's, 60 percent of Americans \nwere farmers and the USDA had 9 employees. Now only 2 percent of \nAmericans are farmers and USDA has 109,000 employees worldwide.\n  That's one bureaucrat for every five farmers.\n  The commodity programs began in the Great Depression, when we did not \nknow if America could feed itself. When we didn't know if grocery \nstores would have food on their shelves.\n  But American agriculture is much different today. Our stores are \nstocked with inexpensive foods. And our most competitive commodities \nare fruits, vegetables, meats, and poultry that don't receive any price \nsubsidies.\n  It's time to extend free market principles to agriculture.\n  There are 75,000 farmers with incomes over $250,000 per year who get \nan average of $26,000 in agricultural subsidies. My small \nbusinesspeople in New Jersey making a lot less don't get subsidies. \nAnd, the Republicans want to reduce the school lunch program, nutrition \nprograms, take away summer jobs from kids, cut assistance to seniors \nand others for heating bills, and cut housing aid to AIDS patients, \namong others.\n  I say we should start with USDA. No more aid for dependent \nagribusinesses.\n  I support entitlement programs for kids and other groups in need. I \nthink we should have a social safety net. But, agribusiness is not on \nmy list of deserving beneficiaries.\n  This bill sets priorities for deficit reduction. We should start by \ncutting obsolete programs and programs that benefit those who don't \nneed Government assistance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an accompanying factsheet \nbe inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n               The Agriculture Modernization Act of 1995\n\n       This bill will eliminate the USDA in 1996. This will be \n     accomplished by eliminating some programs, phasing out the \n     commodity programs over five years and by transferring some \n     agencies and functions to other departments.\n\n\n                       Programs to be Eliminated\n\n       Market Promotion Program.\n       Export Enhancement Program.\n       Rural Telephone Program.\n       Rural Electricity Program.\n       Animal Damage Control Program.\n       Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\n\n  Block Grant--Administered by the Department of Commerce (Phased out \n                            over five years)\n\n       All commodity programs including: Feed grains, wheat, rice, \n     cotton, tobacco, dairy, soybeans, peanuts, sugar, honey, and \n     wool.\n\n\n                           Deficit Reduction\n\n  This legislation will save approximately $25 billion over five years, \nnot including administrative savings resulting from transferring \nduplicative functions to other departments and agencies.

Res. 31. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to grant Congress and the States the \npower to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \nStates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               flag desecration constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, throughout our history, the American people \nhave revered the flag of the United States as the symbol of our Nation. \nThe American flag represents in a way nothing else can, the common bond \nshared by a very diverse people. Yet whatever our differences of party, \npolitics, philosophy, race, religion, ethnic background, economic \nstatus, social status, or geographic region, we are united as \nAmericans. That unity is symbolized by a unique emblem, the American \nflag.\n  As Supreme Court Justice, John Paul Stevens said in his dissent in \nthe 1989 Texas flag-burning case:\n\n       A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and \n     national unity. It also signifies the ideas that characterize \n     the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the \n     special history that has animated the growth and power of \n     those ideas. . . . So it is with the American flag. It is \n     more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, \n     and the gifts of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling \n     colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of \n     equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill \n     for other peoples who share our aspirations.\n\n  For over 200 years, this proud banner has symbolized hope, \nopportunity, justice and, most of all, freedom, not just to the people \nof this Nation, but to people all over the world. I believe that the \nAmerican flag is equally worthy of protection as the ideals for which \nit stands.\n  This February 23 marked the 50th anniversary of one of the most \ndramatic moments in our Nation's history; the raising of the American \nflag on the Island of Iwo Jima by U.S. marines during World War II. \nThat heroic image instantly came to symbolize the determination and \ncourage of all of the brave Americans fighting in that great struggle \nfor the very survival of\n America as a free nation. Fifty years later, it remains one of our \nNation's most powerful images, reminding us that throughout our \nhistory, through the generations, from the Battle of Bunker Hill to \nOperation Desert Storm, on every continent and ocean, in every corner \nof the world, Americans have fought, and in many cases given their \nlives, fighting under this flag and for the Nation and the ideals it \nrepresents. By protecting that flag against acts of physical \ndesecration, we honor their memory and their sacrifice.\n\n  I am proud to rise today to introduce a constitutional amendment that \nwould restore to Congress and to the 50 States the right to protect our \nunique national symbol, the American flag, from acts of physical \ndesecration.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag is not a partisan \nissue. Forty-three Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, have \njoined with Senator Heflin and myself as original cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag would not overturn \nthe first amendment. Rather, it would overturn an interpretation of \nthat amendment by the Supreme Court, in which the Court, by the \nnarrowest of margins, five to four, held that flag burning was a form \nof protected free speech. Distinguished jurists regarded as great \nchampions of the first amendment agreed that physical desecration of \nthe American flag does not fall within the ambit of the first \namendment. In the case of Street versus New York, then Chief Justice \nEarl Warren wrote: \n[[Page S4276]] ``I believe that the States and the Federal Government \nhave the power to protect the flag from acts of physical desecration \nand disgrace.'' Justice Abe Fortas wrote: ``The States and the Federal \nGovernment have the power to protect the flag from acts of desecration \ncommitted in public.'' Justice Hugo Black, generally regarded as a \nfirst amendment absolutist, stated: ``It passes my belief that anything \nin the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate \nburning of the American flag an offense.'' I believe the Court majority \nin the Texas versus Johnson case had it wrong; burning the flag is \nconduct and may be prohibited. This amendment would correct that error \nand restore to Congress and the State the power they historically had \nto protect the American flag from acts of physical desecration.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag would not place us on \na slippery slope precisely because the flag is so unique as our \nnational symbol. There is no other symbol, no other object, which \nrepresents our Nation as does the flag. Accordingly, there is \nabsolutely no basis for concern that the protection we seek for the \nAmerican flag could be extended to cover any other object of form of \npolitical expression.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag would not infringe on \nfree speech. Freedom of speech is not and has never been absolute. We \nhave laws against libel, against slander, and against obscenity. As a \nsociety, we can and do place limitations on both speech and conduct. \nThe classic example is, of course, the prohibition against shouting \nfire in a crowded theater. You can't hold a demonstration in a \ncourtroom. You can't make speeches using a bullhorn at 2 a.m. in a \nresidential neighborhood. You can't destroy Government property or \nbuildings as a means of protest. Right here in the U.S. Senate, we \nprohibit speeches or demonstrations of any kind, even the silent \ndisplay of signs or banners, in the public galleries. I believe flag \nburning is in the same category as obscenity--conduct which is beyond \nthe pale of acceptability even in a free society.\n  For many years, our flag was protected, by Federal law and laws in 48 \nStates, from acts of physical desecration. No one can seriously argue \nthat freedom of speech or freedom of expression was diminished or \ncurtailed during that period. Restoring the protection of law to our \nflag would not prevent the expression, in numerous ways safeguarded \nunder the Constitution, of a single idea or thought. It merely prevents \nconduct with respect to one unique, symbolic object, our Nation's flag.\n  The effort to restore legal protection to our national symbol is a \nmovement of the American people. It has been initiated by grassroots \nAmericans; 91 civic, veterans, and patriotic organizations, led by the \nAmerican Legion, joined together in the Citizens Flag Alliance, working \nto build support across this Nation for a constitutional amendment to \nrestore the historical protection of our flag. Forty-six States have \npassed resolutions urging Congress to send a flag protection amendment \nto the States for ratification.\n  Let this be clear: the Citizens Flag Alliance came to me, Senator \nHeflin, and other Members of Congress, before last November. We did not \ncome to them. This effort is not generated from Capitol Hill. The \nCitizens Flag Alliance presented us with a report on their effort. They \nasked us for our support for their cause. We were pleased to agree. It \nis now up to Congress to heed the voice of the American people and pass \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 31\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within seven years from \n     the date of its submission by the Congress:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``The Congress and the States shall have power to prohibit \n     the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a \nconstitutional amendment to prevent the desecration of the American \nflag. As an original cosponsor along with Senator Hatch and 42 of our \ncolleagues, I urge our colleagues to join in protecting the sanctity of \nthis symbol of our great Nation. As I have said before on the Senate \nfloor, I feel that the Supreme Court's decision in Texas versus \nJohnson, incorrectly places flag burning under the protection of the \nfirst amendment. In my judgement, it is our responsibility to change \nthat decision and return the flag to the position of respect it \ndeserves.\n  Few people would disagree with the argument that the American flag \nstands as one of the most powerful and meaningful symbols of freedom \never created. In the dissent in Texas versus Johnson, Chief Justice \nRehnquist states in his opening paragraph:\n\n       For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a \n     unique position as the symbol of our Nation, a uniqueness \n     that justifies a governmental prohibition against flag \n     burning in the way * * * Johnson did here.\n\n  Justice Stevens calls the flag a national asset much like the Lincoln \nMemorial. He states that:\n\n       Though the asset at stake in this case is intangible, given \n     its unique value, the same interest supports a prohibition on \n     the desecration of the American flag.\n\n  I must agree with Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Stevens in \ntheir belief that the flag should be protected from such desecration. \nHowever, I believe that the flag also has a tangible value. I feel that \nthe court could have expressed an opinion that would have allowed \nprotection to both values, for in that case, the flag was stolen.\n  The flag holds a mighty grip over many people in this country. Its \nmystical appeal is as unique to every person as a fingerprint. \nThousands of Americans have followed the flag into battle and thousands \nof these Americans have left these battles in coffins draped proudly by \nthe American flag. Nothing quite approaches the power of the flag as it \ndrapes those who died for it, or the power of the flag as it is handed \nto the widow of that fallen soldier. The meaning behind these flags \ngoes far beyond the cloth used to make the flag or the dyes used to \ncolor Old Glory red, white, and blue. The flag reaches to the very \nheart of what it means to be an American. It would be a tragedy for us \nto allow the power of the flag to be undermined through the legal \ndesecration of the flag. Allowing the legal burning of that flag \ncreates a mockery of the great respect so many patriotic Americans have \nfor the flag.\n\n\n                            judicially wrong\n\n  As I have stated before, I feel on many different levels that the \nSupreme Court's decision was wrong. I feel it was wrong for me \npersonally, it was wrong for patriotism, it was wrong for this country, \nbut perhaps most importantly, this decision was judicially wrong.\n  I want to emphasize that although I am a strong believer in first \namendment rights, I recognize that first amendment rights are not \nabsolute and unlimited. There have been numerous decisions of the \nSupreme Court that limit freedom of expression.\n  Some of history's great protectors of the freedom of speech have \nagreed that the first amendment is not absolute. Many of these \nprotectors have agreed that the flag is a symbol of such profound \nimportance that protecting it is permissible. Later in this speech I \nwill be quoting from some of the protectors of both the flag and the \nfirst amendment such as Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, \nJustice Hugo Black, Justice John Paul Stevens, and Justice Oliver \nWendell Holmes.\n  In a landmark case reflecting the Supreme Courts long held belief \nthat the freedom of expression is not absolute, the court in Shenk v. \nUnited States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919) stated that:\n\n       The most stringent protection of free speech would not \n     protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and \n     causing a panic.\n\n  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated that:\n\n       The question in every case is whether the words [actions] \n     used are used in such clear circumstances and are of such a \n     nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will \n     bring about the substantive evils that the Congress has a \n     right to prevent.\n\n  [[Page S4277]] Clearly the indignation caused by the Johnson decision \nand the fisticuffs which have broken out in flag burning attempts show \nthat flag burning should not be protected by the first amendment. What \nif the flag burning had occurred in wartime? Certainly, a clear and \npresent danger would be present.\n  Justice Stevens wrote in Los Angeles City Council v. Taxpayers for \nVincent 466 U.S. 789 (1984) that:\n\n       The first amendment does not guarantee the right to imply \n     every conceivable method of communication at all times and in \n     all places.\n\n  Arguments have been made that limitations on the freedom of \nexpression refer only to bodily harm,\n however, the Supreme Court has recognized the need for individuals to \nprotect their honor, integrity, and reputation when injured by libel or \nslander. See: New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) \n(providing standards regarding the libel of public figures); Time v. \nHill, 385 U.S. 374 (1967) (providing standards regarding libel of \nprivate individuals).\n\n  These holdings protect an individual's honor from defamation. I see \nno reason why the honor of our flag should not be protected.\n  Arguments have also been made that limitations on free speech involve \nonly civil suits. However, the Court has continually upheld criminal \nstatutes involving obscene language and pornography. There is: New York \nv. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (upholding a New York statute regarding \nchild pornography); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (this case \nprovides much of the current legal framework for the regulation of \nobscenity).\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has even upheld criminal statutes involving \ndraft card burning. In United States v. O'Brian, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), \nthe Court upheld the Federal statute which prohibited the destruction \nor mutilation of a draft card. In reaching this decision the Court \nexpressly stated:\n\n       [W]e cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless \n     variety of conduct can be labeled ``speech'' whenever the \n     person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an \n     idea.\n\n  Certainly the people of America have a right to expect that the \nhonor, integrity, and reputation of this Nation's flag should be \nprotected. If draft card burning can be prohibited, surely burning the \nAmerican flag can also be prohibited. Does a draft card have more honor \nthan the American flag? Certainly not.\n  In an earlier decision involving the desecration of the flag, Chief \nJustice Earl Warren wrote in dissent in Street v. New York, 394 U.S. \n577 (1969):\n\n       I believe that the States and the Federal Government do \n     have the power to protect the flag from acts of desecration \n     and disgrace * * * however, it is difficult for me to imagine \n     that, had the Court faced this issue, it would have concluded \n     otherwise.\n\n  In this same case, Justice Hugo Black dissented stating:\n\n       It passes my belief that anything in the Federal \n     Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning \n     of the American flag an offense.\n\n  I do not think that anyone can question that Hugo Black and Earl \nWarren were champions of the first amendment, but they recognized that \nthe flag was something different, something special. The Supreme Court \nsubstantiated this view in Smith v. Coguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974), when \nthe majority of the Court noted that:\n\n       [C]ertainly nothing prevents a legislature from defining \n     the substantial specificity what constitutes forbidden \n     treatment of the United States flags.\n\n  Finally I would like to quote from Justice Stevens in Texas v. \nJohnson, when he says about the flag:\n\n       It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of \n     religious tolerance, and of good will for other people who \n     share our aspirations. The symbol carries its message to \n     dissidents both home and abroad who may have no interest at \n     all in our national unity and survival.\n\n  I am a strong believer that the rights under the first amendment \nshould be fully protected and do not feel that an amendment changing \nthese rights should be adopted except in very rare instances. The \nFounding Fathers, in drafting article V of the Constitution, intended \nthat if it would be extremely difficult to amend the Constitution, \nrequiring a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress and a difficult \nratification process requiring the vote of three-fourths of the States. \nThe history of this country shows that only 27 amendments to the \nConstitution have been adopted and only 17 after the Bill of Rights--\ncontaining the first 10 amendments--were ratified.\n  Some may ask why have a constitutional amendment; why not try \nlegislation? To those I would say the Senate has passed statutes \nconcerning flag desecration. As a body we have tried to oppose the \nprotection of flag desecration, but statutory law has not worked. We \nhave a number of groups that have joined together to form the Citizen's \nFlag Alliance. There are about 90 organizations in this wide-ranging \ncoalition. In addition, 46 States' legislatures have passed \nmemorializing resolutions calling for the flag to be protected by the \nCongress.\n  In my judgment, we should heed this call and act decisively to ensure \nthat the American flag remains protected and continues to hold the high \nplace we have afforded it in both our hearts and history. The flag is \nindeed an important national asset which we must always support as we \nwould support the country herself. In closing, I want to share with you \nthe eloquent words of Henry Ward Beecher's work, ``The American Flag,'' \nwhich expresses this sentiment:\n\n       A thoughtful mind, when it sees a national's flag, sees not \n     the flag only, but the Nation itself; and whatever may be its \n     symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag the \n     government, the principles, the truths, the history which \n     belongs to the Nation that sets it forth.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague on the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senator from Alabama for his very \nthoughtful statement and constitutional amendment. I would very much \nappreciate being listed as a cosponsor of that amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for his words because I think they were cogent. I \nalso believe they reflect the views of the American people.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this past election demonstrated the desire \nof American citizens everywhere for change. People are frustrated with \nthe direction in which this country has been heading and the skewing of \npriorities and values. One example of how standards and basic values \nare slipping was the 1989 Supreme Court ruling which permitted the \ndesecration of our Nation's flag.\n  The American flag has always been a symbol of freedom and democracy \nthroughout the world. It has guided thousands upon thousands of \nAmerican service men and women as they have fought and died in defense \nof our basic freedoms.\n  The Court's decision struck at the heart of everything we hold dear \nin America. The flag is our most cherished symbol of liberty and is \nrecognized throughout the world as an emblem of hope for those \nstruggling for freedom. We should not condone its willful destruction.\n  Mr. President, I support the proposal for a constitutional amendment \nto protect the sanctity of the American flag. With this amendment, the \nfirst amendment can be upheld while we clearly declare our reverence \nfor and dedication to our most cherished symbol of freedom--the \nAmerican flag.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues in proposing a constitutional amendment to protect the flag \nof the United States.\n  We Americans are not one race, nor are we one creed. We are an \namalgam of the world's people come together to form a nation. And to \nsymbolize that union, we have chosen a fabric that weaves together our \nmany races, customs, and beliefs: the American flag.\n  No other emblem, token, or artifact of our Nation has been defended \nto the death by legions of patriots. No other has drawn multitudes from \nabroad with the promise of freedom. No other has inspired generations \nwith the belief that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are \nthe birthright of every human being.\n  Old Glory holds a unique place in the hearts of Americans, and that \nis why they have requested--indeed, demanded--unique protection for it.\n  Several years ago, Congress attempted to fashion legislation for this \npurpose, but it just did not work.\n  Some people probably thought that was the end of the story. They \nwere \n[[Page S4278]] wrong. The American people did not give up; they \ncontinued to debate and discuss this matter. And they succeeded in \npassing memorials in 43 States urging Congress to take action to \nprotect the flag from physical desecration. Some of my colleagues may \nrecall last year, on Flag Day, I placed those memorials in the \nCongressional Record for all to see.\n  Mr. President, the legislatures submitting those memorials represent \nnearly 229 million people--more than 90 percent of our country's \npopulation. They did not pass these memorials easily or swiftly. In \nlegislature after legislature, the record shows these memorials were \ngiven serious and thorough consideration.\n  Now it is time for the U.S. Congress to match that resolve. Today, in \nresponse to the demand of the American people, we are offering this \namendment. Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this necessary and appropriate measure to safeguard the flag \nof our Nation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nefforts to protect the flag of the United States. I am pleased to join \nmy colleagues in introducing a resolution proposing a constitutional \namendment to prohibit the desecration of the flag.\n  Mr. President, the support for this amendment is, quite simply, \noverwhelming; 46 State legislatures have already passed memorializing \nresolutions requesting the Congress to pass an amendment to protect the \nflag. I am pleased to note my home State, Idaho, passed just such a \nresolution 2 years ago. In asking the Congress to present an antiflag \ndesecration amendment to the States for ratification, the Idaho \nLegislature stated,\n\n       ... the American Flag to this day is a most honorable and \n     worthy banner of a nation which is thankful for its strengths \n     and committed to curing its faults, and a nation which \n     remains the destination of millions of immigrants attracted \n     by the universal power of the American ideal ....\n\n  Should not the symbol of this ideal be protected? Since 1777, when \nthe Second Continental Congress passed a resolution describing what the \nflag of the fledgling Nation should be, the Stars and Stripes has stood \nfor all that we hold dear. While great leaders of this Nation have come \nand gone, the flag has been an American constant. Through the Civil \nWar, two World Wars, the Depression, and times of domestic crisis, Old \nGlory has flown proudly, serving as a symbol to all the world that \nfreedom, justice, and liberty remain alive in the United States.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have had the \nopportunity to meet the men and women of our Armed Forces around the \nworld. These individuals put their lives on the line regularly, so that \nwe may live in peace and safety. And while they are serving us, the \nAmerican public, they do so under the Stars and Stripes. For those who \nare stationed overseas, the flag represents the rights and freedoms \nwhich they stand prepared to defend, even while on foreign ground. It \nalso stands for their home, the Nation which proudly awaits their \nreturn when their duties are done. For those who have finished their \nservice to their country, the flag is a constant reminder that the \nideals for which they fought still live, and that their sacrifices were \nnot in vain.\n  In 1867, Senator Charles Sumner expressed his sentiments about the \nflag. His words, I think, are most appropriate to be repeated at this \ntime. He said:\n\n       There is the national flag. He must be cold, indeed, who \n     can look upon its folds rippling in the breeze without pride \n     of country. If in a foreign land, the flag is companionship, \n     and country itself with all its endearments ... White is for \n     purity; red for valor; blue, for justice. And altogether, \n     bunting, stripes, stars, and colors, blazing in the sky, make \n     the flag of our country, to be cherished by all our hearts, \n     to be upheld by all our hands.\n\n  Mr. President, how can we continue to uphold the flag to the honor it \ndeserves if we allow it, the symbol for all for which this Nation \nstands, to be willfully desecrated and defiled? The courts have said we \ncan not protect the flag by statute; our only remedy is to amend the \nConstitution. So, I stand here today to express my wholehearted support \nfor the resolution which will be introduced today to propose just such \nan amendment. I hope my colleagues will join me in acting to protect \nour flag and all that it represents of our past, our present, and our \nfuture.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to announce my cosponsorship of a \njoint resolution to amend the U.S. Constitution to allow Congress and \nthe States to prohibit the desecration of the American flag.\n  Having served two tours in the Vietnam war as a second lieutenant in \nthe Army, our flag has a deep personal meaning for me. I experience a \nfeeling of pride when I see the Stars and Stripes flying in front of a \nmilitary base, on top of the U.S. Capitol Building here in Washington, \nor in a small town parade in South Dakota. I feel sick to my stomach \nwhen I think of its desecration by my fellow Americans.\n  The American flag is a dramatic living symbol of the principles for \nwhich this great country stands--liberty, due process, justice for all. \nOur flag is an emblem of the ideals which set our Nation apart from all \nothers.\n  When someone willfully desecrates the flag, he or she is committing a \nmalicious act of violence that incites those Americans who have \ndedicated their lives to uphold the values we cherish. It tramples the \nhonor of millions of soldiers--men and women--who served, fought, and \ndied to preserve the values which the flag represents. It strikes at \nthe honor of the untold number of civilians who have worked in \nindustries behind the lines to support our military forces.\n  Mr. President, in Johnson versus Texas (1989), the Supreme Court \nruled that desecrating the flag is free speech protected by the first \namendment. In response, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Flag \nProtection Act of 1989. However, the following year, in United States \nversus Eichmann (1990), the Court struck down this statute as an \nimpermissible infringement on the first amendment.\n  I disagree with the Supreme Court's rulings. I believe it is entirely \nappropriate for Congress to enact legislation to protect from \ndesecration the primary symbol of our great Nation. However, unless the \nJohnson and Eichmann decisions are overturned by a subsequent Court, it \nis clear that only a constitutional amendment will ensure the validity \nof any State or Federal statute banning flag desecration.\n  Opponents of our effort to protect the flag argue that free speech is \namong the most sacred rights enjoyed by Americans. They believe that \nthis amendment limits their right to freedom of speech. I certainly \nagree with the need to vigilantly guard the first amendment. No other \nsociety on this planet is more tolerant of different viewpoints and \nopinions than America. But flag desecration is more than just speech. \nIt is among those acts of public behavior so offensive and harmful that \nthey fall outside of the protections of the first amendment.\n  For example, one of the famous limits of free speech is that one \ncannot shout ``fire!'' in a crowded move theater. Malicious and \ndefamatory speech, such as slander and libel, also are not protected by \nthe first amendment. Obscenity does not enjoy the protection of the \nfirst amendment. We do not permit people to freely deface a synagogue \nor church buildings in the name of free speech. Likewise, physical \ndesecration of the flag through burning, trampling, or any other method \nis not free speech protected by our Constitution. It is offensive \nconduct that does not deserve protection by the first amendment.\n  I am therefore proud to join with my colleagues in supporting a \nconstitutional amendment to protect the American flag. Since the \nJohnson ruling, 43 States have passed resolutions calling on Congress \nto pass a flag desecration amendment for consideration by the States. \nMr. President, I urge my colleagues to carry out the clear will of the \nAmerican people by supporting this resolution.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, generations of immigrants have surmounted \nincredible obstacles to reach our shores and experience true American \nfreedom. Our Nation's flag has welcomed these weary travelers for \nhundreds of years. For these people, the U.S. flag is more than just a \nsimple patchwork of cloth, it is the patchwork of our values, our \nbeliefs, and our freedoms. It is our history.\n  During this history, many brave Americans sacrificed their lives for \nthe flag. At Malmedy, Khe Sanh, Inchon, Iwo Jima, Kuwait City, and in \nnumerous other places, Americans fought and \n[[Page S4279]] died for democracy, freedom, and justice. Indeed, our \nflag represents these virtues. It would be an insult to their memory if \nwe allowed the continued desecretion of our flag. This practice must \nend, and end now.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Hatch, Heflin, \nand others in cosponsoring the proposed constitutional amendment to \ngrant to States and Congress the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag of the United States. Our flag occupies a truly \nunique place in the hearts of millions of citizens as a cherished \nsymbol of freedom and democracy. As a national emblem of the world's \ngreatest democracy, the American flag should be treated with respect \nand care. Our free speech rights do not entitle us to simply consider \nthe flag as personal property, which can be treated any way we see fit \nincluding physically desecrating it as a legitimate form of political \nprotest.\n  The flag is not just simply a visual symbol to us--it is a symbol \nwhose pattern and colors tell a story that rings true for each and \nevery American. The 50 stars and 13 stripes on the flag are a reminder \nthat our Nation is built on the unity and harmony of 50 States. And the \ncolors of our flag were not chosen randomly: red was selected because \nit represents courage, bravery, and the willingness of the American \npeople to give their life for their country and its principles of \nfreedom and democracy; white was selected because it represents \nintegrity and purity; and blue because it represents vigilance, \nperseverance, and justice. Thus, this flag has become a source of \ninspiration to every American wherever it is displayed.\n  For these reasons and many others, a great majority of Americans \nbelieve--as I strongly do--that the American flag should be treated \nwith dignity, respect, and care--and nothing less.\n  Unfortunately, not everyone shares this view. In June 1990, the \nSupreme Court ruled that the Flag Protection Act of 1989, legislation \nadopted by the Congress in 1989 generally prohibiting physical \ndefilement or desecration of the flag, was unconstitutional. This \ndecision, a 5-to-4 ruling in U.S. versus Eichman, held that burning the \nflag as a political protest was constitutionally protected free speech. \nThe Flag Protection Act had originally been adopted by the 101st \nCongress after the Supreme Court ruled in its Texas versus Johnson case \nthat existing Federal and State laws prohibiting flag burning were \nunconstitutional because they violated the first amendment's provisions \nregarding free speech.\n  I profoundly disagreed with both rulings the Supreme Court made on \nthis issue. In our modern society, there are still many different \nforums in our mass media, television, newspapers and radio and the \nlike, through which citizens can freely and fully exercise their \nlegitimate, constitutional right to free speech, even if what they have \nto say is overwhelmingly unpopular with a majority of American \ncitizens.\n  The constitutional amendment being introduced today has been \ncarefully drafted to simply allow the Congress and individual State \nlegislatures to enact laws prohibiting the physical desecration of the \nflag, if they so choose. It certainly does not stipulate or require \nthat such laws be enacted. When considering the issue, it is helpful to \nremember that prior to the Supreme Court's 1989 Texas versus Johnson \nruling, 48 States, including my own State of Maine, and the Federal \nGovernment had anti-flag-burning laws on their books for years.\n  Whether our flag is flying over a ball park, a military base, a \nschool, or on a flag pole on Main Street, our national standard has \nalways represented the ideals and values that are the foundation this \ngreat nation was built on. And our flag has come not only to represent \nthe glories of our Nation's past, but it has also come to stand as a \nsymbol for hope for our Nation's future. Mr. President, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, there are many reasons for protecting the \nunique symbol of the American flag, from the basic liberties it \nrepresents to the promise of a better future. But some of the greatest \nreasons for protecting the flag occurred thousands of miles away from \nour own shores.\n  For example, 50 years ago, just days after American troops had \nclaimed victory at Iwo Jima, six soldiers helped raise the American \nflag on the highest point of the island. You can see a soldier on the \nfar left with both arms reaching skyward. It's unclear whether he's \njust released the flag pole, or if he's trying to touch the flag he \nfought so hard for, one last time.\n  And perhaps it was the last time he touched the American flag, for 26 \ndays later, he died on the island he had helped claim.\n  The soldier was Pvt. Franklin Sousley of Kentucky, and his image in \nthis famous photograph not only has frozen in time his historic \nefforts, but tied them inextricably to the symbolism of the American \nflag.\n  The flag that flew at Iwo Jima serves as a reminder of how war \nchanges the course of a life, of a nation, of a world, so that even \nindividuals who were never there, recognize that those hours of \ndestruction and suffering have altered the future irrevocably.\n  But Private Sousley's outstretched arms also mirror the actions of \nthe millions who've reached out for all that our flag symbolizes, from \nthe basic liberties written into our Constitution to the dreams of a \nbetter future for their families.\n  That is why I believe so strongly that the physical integrity of the \nAmerican flag must be protected. Back in 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court \ndeclared unconstitutional a Texas flag desecration statute, ruling that \nflag desecration was free speech protected under the first amendment.\n  In response to that decision, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the \nFlag Protection Act, which was also declared unconstitutional. The \nSupreme Court's action made it clear that a constitutional amendment is \nnecessary for enactment of any binding protection of the flag.\n  Up to this point, neither House of Congress has been able to garner \nthe two-thirds supermajority necessary for passage of a constitutional \namendment. But because grassroots support for this amendment continues \nto grow, I have joined with Members on both sides of the aisle to again \ntry passing this amendment. I am hopeful that this time we'll get the \nnecessary votes.\n  Clearly no legitimate act of political protest should be suppressed. \nNor should we ever discourage debate and discussion about the Federal \nGovernment. The narrowly written amendment gives Congress and the \nStates the ``power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of \nthe United States,'' without jeopardizing those rights of free speech.\n  Fifty years ago, the American flag flying over Iwo Jima literally \nmeant life for the flyers of crippled B-29's who would have died at sea \nif they had not had the island to land on.\n  Today, the flag that hangs in schoolrooms, over courthouses, in \nsports stadiums, and off front porches all across America, has a bit of \nthe battle of Iwo Jima woven into its fabric.\n  Mr. President, I would say that's something worth protecting.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \na proposed constitutional amendment authorizing the Congress and the \nStates to prohibit the physical desecration of the American flag.\n  In June of 1989, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Texas versus \nJohnson which allows the contemptuous burning of the American flag. \nImmediately after that ruling, I drafted and introduced a proposed \nconstitutional amendment to overturn that unfortunate decision.\n  After bipartisan discussions with Members of the Senate and President \nBush, the Senate voted on a similar proposal which I cosponsored. \nDuring this time, the Supreme Court ruled in U.S. versus Eichman that a \nFederal statute designed to protect the flag from physical desecration \nwas unconstitutional. The Texas decision had involved a State statute \ndesigned to protect the flag.\n  On June 26, 1990, the Senate voted 58-42 for the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, 9 votes short of the two-thirds needed for \ncongressional approval.\n  Opponents of this proposed amendment claimed it was an infringement \non the free speech clause of the first amendment. However, the first \namendment has never been construed as protecting any and all means of \nexpressive \n[[Page S4280]] conduct. Just as we are not allowed to falsely shout \n``fire'' in a crowded theater or obscenities on a street corner as a \nmeans of expression, I firmly believe that physically desecrating the \nAmerican flag is highly offensive conduct and should not be allowed.\n  The opponents of our proposal to protect the American flag have \nmisinterpreted its application to the right of free speech. Former \nChief Justice Warren, Justices Black and Fortas are known for their \ntenacious defense of first amendment principles. Yet, they all \nunequivocally stated that the first amendment did not protect the \nphysical desecration of the American flag. In Street versus New York, \nChief Justice Warren stated, ``I believe that the States and the \nFederal Government do have the power to protect the flag from acts of \ndesecration and disgrace.''\n  In this same case, Justice Black, who described himself as a first \namendment ``absolutist'' stated, ``It passes my belief that anything in \nthe Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the \nAmerican flag an offense.''\n  Mr. President, the American people treasure the free speech \nprotections afforded under the first amendment and are very tolerant of \ndiffering opinions and expressions. Yet, there are certain acts of \npublic behavior which are so offensive that they fall outside the \nprotection of the first amendment. I firmly believe that flag burning \nfalls in this category and should not be protected as a form of speech. \nThe American people should be allowed to prohibit this objectionable \nand offensive conduct.\n  It is our intention with this proposed constitutional amendment to \nestablish a national policy to protect the American flag from \ncontemptuous desecration. The American people look upon the flag as our \nmost recognizable and revered symbol of democracy which has endured \nthroughout our history.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join the sponsors and \ncosponsors of this proposed constitutional amendment to protect our \nmost cherished symbol of democracy.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and my other distinguished \ncolleagues in cosponsoring this resolution to amend the Constitution of \nthe United States to grant Congress and the States the power to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\n  Let me state from the outset, as I have stated before, this amendment \nwill merely restore the power to Congress and the States to prohibit \nflag desecration--a power that we believe they have always had.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court incorrectly interpreted the \nConstitution's first amendment. The Court failed to discern the \ndifference between protected speech, and an act--a type of hate crime \nof physical desecration of the flag.\n  Therefore, our amendment does not tamper or tinker with the \nConstitution's Bill of Rights that protects speech.\n  But, Mr. President, for argument's sake, assume this amendment does \ntamper with the speech clause.\n  Let us ask ourselves a question. If we had to choose, should we amend \nthe speech clause to: protect the American flag from acts of \ndesecration; or protect our reelection to office by restricting the \nright of voters to hear words of opposition and opponents to speak \nagainst us--the incumbents?\n  I regret, Mr. President, that too many Senators have sided with \nincumbent protection instead of flag protection.\n  Remember, the Senate in 1990 fell 9 votes short of the 67 needed to \npass a flag protection amendment to the Constitution because, by and \nlarge, it was argued that there is something very special, and \nuntouchable about the speech clause.\n  Mr. President, you may be astonished to learn that 28 of the 42 \nSenators who voted against amending the speech clause to protect the \nAmerican flag, had either sponsored, cosponsored, or voted to \nfacilitate the passage of a constitutional amendment pegged the \n``incumbent protection bill.''\n  This speech clause amendment was aimed at overturning the Supreme \nCourt's Buckley versus Valeo decision. The Court said the first \namendment speech clause is violated by restrictions on money used on \npolitical communication during campaigns.\n  So while these Senators supported incumbent protection, they strongly \nopposed flag protection.\n  Had only 9 of these 28 Senators had their priorities straight, the \nSenate would have passed the flag protection amendment 5 years ago.\n  And let us keep in mind, during the 200 years following 1789, over \n10,000 constitutional amendments were introduced to the various \nCongresses.\n  In fact, in 1990, 525 out of 535 U.S. Representatives and Senators \nhad sponsored or cosponsored amendments to the Constitution for \neverything under the Sun--from ERA to D.C. statehood.\n  So, the fact is, a vast majority of Congressmen and Senators do \nsupport amending the Constitution.\n  And more to the point at hand, many of those 28 Senators--who were \nhappy to amend the speech clause to protect their incumbency, but \njoined in killing an amendment to protect the American flag--are still \nserving in the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, in fact, enough are still serving, that if they would \nchange their priorities and their votes, this time our efforts to pass \nan amendment to protect the American flag will succeed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today, as I have done each \nweek of the 104th Congress, to announce to the Senate that during the \npast week, 10 people were murdered by gunshot in New York City, \nbringing this year's total to 130.\n  Three weeks ago, I shared with the Senate a letter from Sarah Brady, \nchairman of Handgun Control, Inc., and wife of James Brady, the former \nWhite House Press Secretary who was critically wounded in the \nassassination attempt against President Reagan. The letter contained \nthe results of a joint study by the International Association of Chiefs \nof Police and Handgun Control, Inc., providing convincing evidence that \nthe Brady law, which went into effect just over 1 year ago, is doing \nexactly what its proponents had anticipated: keeping guns out of the \nhands of criminals.\n  Today I would like to add to this the results of two other studies \nwhich further attest to the effectiveness of the Brady law. These \nstudies, one conducted by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms, and the other by CBS News, found that background checks \nmandated by the law have prevented as many as 45,000 people from \nillegally purchasing firearms.\n  This is no mean achievement. And it is only one of the benefits the \nBrady law has brought us. By substantially raising the fee for a \nFederal Firearms License, the law has also caused a significant decline \nin the number of licensed firearms dealers, which by 1993 had reached \nan astounding 284,000. Few are aware that prior to the Brady law, one \ncould obtain a 3-year Federal Firearms License for just $30. Thanks to \nthe Brady law, which raised that fee to $200, the number of federally \nlicensed dealers has decreased by some 60,000 in just 1 year.\n  Mr. President, the Brady law will not in itself cure the problem of \ngun violence. But it is an important step in the right direction and it \nproves that we can make a difference in this fight.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/21/senate-section/article/S4292-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4292-S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          BETHEL COLLEGE WINS NATIONAL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, while the U.S. Senate discusses the \nmost important issues facing our Nation, I rise today to talk about \nanother issue that is near and dear to the hearts of the people in my \nState of Indiana. The Hoosier love for basketball has been captured on \nfilm and in folklore, and another chapter has been added to this rich \nHoosier basketball history.\n  Bethel College, located in Mishawaka, IN, captured the NAIA Division \nII Men's Basketball National Championship. And this was no ordinary \ntitle game. The Pilots truly have added another thrilling page to the \nState of Indiana's basketball tradition.\n  The Bethel College Pilots played the championship game on the home \ncourt of their worthy opponent, Northwest Nazarene College. Just when \nit looked like the game was lost, Bethel senior Mark Galloway drilled a \n3-point shot at the buzzer, sending the contest into overtime. Bethel \nthen controlled the overtime, winning the national championship by a \nscore of 103-95.\n  Along with his exciting game-saving shot, Mark Galloway finished as \nBethel College's all-time leading scorer with 2,622 points.\n  Mr. President, the Bethel College Pilots, coached by Mike Lightfoot, \nfinished the season with a 16-game winning streak and a record of 38-2, \nthe best in school history. I know I speak for all basketball fans in \nIndiana when I salute the Pilots, and congratulate \n[[Page S4293]] Bethel College for their exciting championship \nseason.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/21/senate-section/article/S4292-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Res. 79) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n                               S. Res. 79\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was invested \n     in the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States of \n     America drew heavily upon the political experience and \n     philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our representative \n     democracy;\n       Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our two nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 1995, marks the 174th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people, and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our two great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That March 25, 1995, is designated as ``Greek \n     Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and \n     American Democracy''.
