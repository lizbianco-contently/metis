Mr. President, the American people elected the \nRepublican Congress with the expectation that we show leadership and a \nwillingness to make difficult decisions. In my view, the public shares \nthe point of view that Government has grown too expensive. It has \nbecome bloated and ponderous. I believe that the programs of the New \nDeal and the Great Society put safety nets in place for those who are \nin greatest need, but those nets now strangle the Federal Government by \ntying up precious funding in a knot of regulations and poor management.\n  As I explain my thoughts on the balanced budget amendment, I want to \nmake it very clear that I believe the deficit must be reduced and that \na balanced budget is worth achieving. It is possible that I will be the \nlone Republican to vote against the balanced budget amendment, but I \nsay now to my colleagues that I share my party's goals, but happen to \ndisagree on the means.\n  The debate on the balanced budget amendment is not about reducing the \nbudget deficit, it is about amending the Constitution of the United \nStates with a procedural gimmick. This amendment that is before Members \nnow puts new Senate and House rules regarding voting procedures into \nthe Constitution. It does not balance the budget and gives no \nindication of how this might be done. Furthermore, it will not force \nCongress to budget responsibly. If indeed this is an amendment \nrequiring a balanced budget, then how can we allow Congress to \nessentially suspend the Constitution with a three-fifths vote? This was \na dangerous idea last year, and it is a dangerous idea this year as \nwell. What other constitutional requirements would we like to waive \nwith a three-fifths vote? Freedom of religion? Free speech? What other \ncivil liberties shall we waive? A balanced budget amendment would allow \nthe Congress to ignore the requirement for a balanced budget and to \nignore the Constitution. This idea of Congress suspending a \nconstitutional requirement cuts against the separation of powers \nprinciple so crucial to the foundation of the Constitution.\n  Given the make-up of the 104th Congress, passage of the balanced \nbudget amendment may seem inevitable to some. Many people attribute \nthis increased likelihood to the elections which occurred in November \nof last year. The election has been interpreted by some as proving that \nthe American people are demanding that Congress balance our Federal \nbudget. Or it may be interpreted by some who say that the Congress now \nhas the political will to make the hard choices to make Federal \nrevenues match Federal outlays. This is an important point, because \n     [[Page S2346]]  Congress does not have the political will to \n     tackle the budget deficit, a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution is nothing more than an empty promise.\n  As optimistic as I am about the opportunities this Republican \nCongress has before it, I am sobered by a recent event. I want to \nunderscore this because I believe many have lost sight of it; that is, \nthe demise of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform. \nThe Commission set out to tackle an enormous task. That task was to \naddress the Federal Government's long-term spending commitments and to \ndetermine what the fiscal impact would be if this spending were left \nunchecked.\n  According to the Commission's report, the Commission was created,\n\n       * * * to frame the long-term issue, educate the American \n     people and policy leaders about the problem and potential \n     choices, and to make specific recommendations on how to bring \n     our future entitlement commitments and revenues into balance.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, the Commission, despite the dedication of all of \nits participants, was unable to agree on a specific set of \nrecommendations on how to address these issues. In explaining the \ninability of the Commission to come to a consensus on this issue, a \nletter signed by the chairman, Senator Kerrey, and the vice-chairman, \nSenator Danforth, states,\n\n       * * * this result should not be surprising in an \n     environment where political leaders in both parties are \n     focusing more on short-term initiatives than on long-term, \n     politically sensitive economic and social issues that sit on \n     the horizon.\n\n  I submit that the inability of the Commission to reach a consensus on \nthese very important issues is proof that the Congress still does not \nyet have the political will to tackle the tough issues which it will \nneed to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, that statement attributed to the Commission was made \nafter the November elections.\n  It is also important to note some statistics which are contained in \nthe budget just submitted by the President which relate to the proposal \nto exempt certain Federal programs from being covered by this \namendment. According to the President's budget, interest on the debt, \ndefense, and mandatory spending combined make up 82 percent of the \nFederal budget in 1995, and this percentage will grow to 85 percent of \nthe budget by the year 2000. Unless reform of all aspects of Federal \nexpenditures occurs, projected outlays for entitlements and interest on \nthe debt will consume all\n revenues of the Federal Government by the year 2012. That is only 17 \nyears away. With those facts looming before us, how can the Congress \ndecide today what should and should not be taken off the table during \nthe debate on balancing the budget. The Congress must look at every \naspect of the budget, politically sensitive items included.\n\n  A balanced budget can come only through leadership and compromise. \nThis compromise must come from each one of us. But, more importantly, \nit must come from those we represent--those who do not want their taxes \nraised any more than we want to raise them--those who do not want their \nbenefits cut any more than we want to cut them. In the end there is no \neasy answer, and there never will be. Regardless of the procedural \nrestraint in place, where there is political will to create a balanced \nbudget we will create one, where there is will to avoid one, we will \navoid it. The finding of the Bipartisan Commission I mentioned earlier \nindicates that the Congress still does not have the will to address the \ntough issues. As I stated during the debate on a balanced budget \namendment last year, a vote for this balanced budget constitutional \namendment is not a vote for a balanced budget, it is a vote for a fig \nleaf.\n  If I am skeptical about the ability of a gimmick to fix our budget, I \nam not skeptical about the ability of the people to demand and keep \ndemanding that we respond to the budget challenge with real action. \nReal action is not a vote for an amendment to the Constitution which \ncalls for a balanced budget by the year 2002. Real action is rolling up \nour sleeves and getting our fiscal house in order. Real action is \nworking together, in a bipartisan fashion, to create a balanced budget, \nnot to simply promise one. Real action means ending some programs--\nprograms with popular appeal and vocal constituencies. Balancing the \nbudget will result in an impact on each and every one of us--do we have \nthe will to do that?\n  Bipartisan negotiation, leadership, and compromise have been the \ncornerstones upon which we have built all effective decisions on tough \nissues since the formation of our Government. Compromises are difficult \nto reach, but they are not impossible to reach. We have all just \nreceived the President's budget. The ensuing debate on the budget will \nprovide the chance for the Congress to work together to balance the \nFederal programs of this budget. I hope the Congress does not miss this \nopportunity to debate the real issue of balancing the budget. Voting \nfor a balanced budget amendment is easy, working to balance the budget \nwill not be.\n  Although I will not support the legislation put before the Senate \npromoting a balanced budget amendment, I stand ready to get to the \nnecessary work of crafting a long-term, sound fiscal policy which \naddresses the need to balance the budget. As chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee I am committed to a thorough review of Federal \nprograms to determine if they are wisely spending the taxpayers' money \nand whether or not programs have outlived their usefulness. Some \nprograms are undoubtedly in need of reduction, and a few should be \nabolished.\n  But successful, long-term fiscal responsibility will not only depend \nupon program cuts. It demands a radical transformation in the way we do \nbusiness as a government. My home State of Oregon has embarked upon a \ntruly exciting effort to end the obsession with program compliance--and \nall the paperwork and bureaucracy which comes with that obsession--and \ninstead making success government's goal. Success in training workers \nfor new jobs. Success in getting families off public assistance. \nSuccess in reducing teen pregnancies. Government can and should do more \nwith less. It is my hope that Congress will lead the way in making this \na reality.\n  The Congress should not promise to the people that it will balance \nthe Federal budget through a procedural gimmick. If the Congress has \nthe political will to balance the budget, it should simply use the \npower that it already has and do so. There is no substitute for \npolitical will and there never will be. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2345-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2346-S2348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO J. WILLIAM FULBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair for recognizing me this morning.\n  Mr. President, we, in the U.S. Senate, are often very fortunate to be \nwitnesses to history as it is being made, and we often talk of the need \nto have a vision for America, for the country, for our Government, for \nour world and for our people. But very few of us ever, in and among \nourselves, make history--very few of us. We often fall short of \narticulating a true vision, settling instead to seize upon symbols as a \nsubstitute.\n  With that in mind, Mr. President, this morning I rise to pay tribute \ntoday to a former Member of this body who has repeatedly made history \nin his lifetime and who dare to articulate a vision throughout his \nlifetime. That man is J. William Fulbright, a native son of Arkansas, \nwho served with the with distinction in the Congress for 32 years, 30 \nof those years as a Member of this body, the U.S. Senate.\n  He loved this body. Senator Fulbright died early this morning, and I \nwould like to take a few moments of the Senate's time to remind the \npeople of this body and the people of this Capitol and certainly the \npeople of this land of the significant impact this remarkable human \nbeing had on the lives of Americans.\n  J. William Fulbright was born in the year 1905 to a family that \nbecame quite prominent in northwestern Arkansas. His father was a \nbanker, a successful businessman, while his mother ran the Northwest \nArkansas Times, the newspaper in Fayetteville. In fact, Mr. President, \nthe public library in Fayetteville, AR, bears the name of Roberta \nFulbright Library.\n   [[Page S2347]] After graduating from the University of Arkansas at \nFayetteville, Bill Fulbright attended Oxford University on a Rhodes \nscholarship, an experience that we will see later having a profound \neffect upon his life and his philosophy and, yes, upon his vision.\n  After earning his law degree from George Washington University, he \njoined the antitrust division in the Justice Department where Senator \nFulbright, or Bill Fulbright at that time, helped to prosecute the \nlandmark Schechter case, the ``chicken case,'' as we call it, which \nhelped establish the boundaries of Federal authority to regulate \ninterstate versus intrastate commerce. It was a landmark case.\n  In 1936, Bill Fulbright returned to his native State of Arkansas to \nteach law at Fayetteville and there, 3 years later, he was appointed \npresident of the University of Arkansas. At age 34, he was the youngest \nuniversity president in America, and he gained national attention at \nthat time for his efforts to raise the educational standards of not \nonly the University of Arkansas but all educational institutions in \nAmerica.\n  In 1943, Bill Fulbright won a seat in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and he was appointed to the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. He wasted little time making history.\n  In the spring of that year, he introduced a resolution that, even by \ntoday's standards, was remarkable for its brevity and its directness. \nYet, it was powerful as a vision of young Bill Fulbright. The \nresolution read as follows, and it is one sentence:\n\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives expresses \n     itself as favoring the creation of an appropriate machinery \n     with power adequate to prevent future aggression and to \n     maintain lasting peace, and as favoring participation of the \n     United States therein.\n\n  Mr. President, this was the Fulbright resolution. It became known as \nthat and soon it passed overwhelmingly by both Houses of the Congress.\n  This Fulbright resolution is credited as being one of the very major \nstepping stones that led to the creation of the United Nations. And \nwith this resolution, a very young Bill Fulbright brought an official \nend to longstanding American policies of isolationism and made our \ncountry formally commit to becoming a willing, ongoing partner in \nglobal affairs.\n  Bill Fulbright did not stop there. The very next year, he served as a \ndelegate to an international conference, at which officials from 17 \nnations sought to find a way to reconstruct the educational \ninstitutions of the world in the wake of the ravages of World War II. \nCongressman Fulbright then was unanimously named as chairman of this \nCongress, and he presented a four-point proposal that became the \nfoundations for the U.N. Economic and Social Council.\n  In April 1945, Mr. President, delegates of 50 nations gathered in San \nFrancisco to draft a charter of the United Nations Approval by the U.S. \nSenate became critical at that point, so critical that President Harry \nTruman came to this body and stood in the well of the U.S. Senate and \npled with his former colleagues in the Senate on July 2, 1945, to \npersuade this body to adopt this charter. President Truman briefly \nsketched the history of the U.N. effort, and he mentioned the passage \nof the Fulbright resolution.\n  President Truman said that this resolution had played a major part in \nshaping certain proposals, and the Senate approved the charter by an 89 \nto 2 vote. It took effect October 24, 1945.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that this year in June in San Francisco, \n50 years later, there will be a commemoration, or a birthday, an \nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\n  By this time, Congressman Fulbright had become Senator Fulbright, \nafter winning a Senate seat in the 1944 elections. He did not rest upon \nhis laurels, and despite being named to the Banking and Currency \nCommittee instead of the Foreign Relations Committee, he did not \nabandon his interest in global relations.\n  During his very first year in the Senate, Senator Fulbright sponsored \nlegislation that became one of the major accomplishments of his \ndistinguished legislative career. This bill established a program that \nexchanged scholars, students, and educators between the United States \nand other countries, and the program eventually was called the \nFulbright Scholarship Program. It drew heavily from Senator Fulbright's \nexperiences as a Rhodes scholar and from his belief and deep feeling \nthat academic exchange would contribute to better understanding among \nall countries.\n  Foreign students coming to the United States received money for \ntravel and sometimes received an allowance, modest as it might be, \nwhile tuition and books were provided through scholarships from \nAmerican colleges and universities.\n  While he fervently believed in the value of such exchange programs, \nSenator Fulbright also knew full well that his plan had a number of \nhurdles to overcome--financial, governmental, partisan. The U.S. \nTreasury was not in a position to directly finance such a venture at a \ntime of massive war debts.\n  Meanwhile, the State Department voiced its reservations, as had \nSenate Republicans. But Senator Fulbright was undaunted, and he \npersevered. He came up with a very novel way of financing this venture \nby combining the need to fund it with the problem of disposing of \nsurplus U.S. equipment overseas that had been left behind.\n  Under Senator Fulbright's plan, any country that purchased part of \nthe U.S. surplus would then be eligible to participate in the exchange \nprogram. He won the support of the State Department by giving the State \nDepartment greater control over the program disbursements. He won the \nsupport of the Congress by getting an endorsement from former President \nHerbert Hoover. President Truman signed the Fulbright Scholarship \nProgram into being August 1, 1946. It was another tribute to the vision \nand to the brilliance and to the perseverance of J. William Fulbright \nand his fervent belief that education and communication hold the power \nto save man from himself.\n  Bill Fulbright's career was not without controversy, Mr. President. \nHe certainly did not shrink from it. He once suggested that President \nTruman resign from office, but soon he suggested that President Truman \nwas absolutely correct, even a year later, and he defended Harry Truman \nin the wake of President Truman's firing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur and \nbringing him back from the Far East. He sparred repeatedly with Joseph \nMcCarthy, a former Member of this body, defending against McCarthy's \nattacks on the Fulbright Scholarship Program and then defending himself \nfrom McCarthy's attacks and charges that he, Senator Fulbright, might \nbe subversive because Senator Fulbright's first wife belonged to and \nwas active in, of all things, the Red Cross.\n  Ultimately, Senator Fulbright led the way in getting the Senate to \ncondemn Senator McCarthy in 1954 for his red-baiting tactics. In doing \nso, he helped deliver this body out of one of its sadder chapters in \nhistory.\n  In 1959, Mr. President, Senator Fulbright became chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, and by the time he left the Senate \nin 1974, he had held the title of chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee longer than any previous Senator.\n  Yes, he was controversial. He was a controversial chairman, and he \ndared to insist that cold war relations should not be dictated solely \nby militarism. He warned all of us in 1961 that our efforts in Vietnam \nwere doomed to failure as long as we placed our stress on military \nrather than long-term economic and educational assistance, a warning \nthat now seems prophetic. He placed his reservations aside to support \nthe Gulf of Tonkin resolution when he felt that American soldiers were \nthreatened and then had the courage to publicly call that action his \nmost humiliating experience. He became one of the country's most vocal \ncritics of that war even though it cost him his long-time friendship \nwith Lyndon B. Johnson, and many believe it ultimately might have cost \nhim his seat in the Senate.\n  J. William Fulbright did not believe that his return to private life \nmeant the end of his need to articulate a vision for his beloved \nAmerica. He continued to write books and to give lectures about how he \nfelt government could be run more effectively, how countries could \nbetter deal with one another, and about the arrogance of power.\n  Those of us who were fortunate to know him and even to be close to \nhim \n[[Page S2348]]  during some of his life during those years knew him as \na man of continued brilliance, of foresight and wisdom, and he \ncontinued to command our respect.\n  Mr. President, when the Fulbright Program was threatened, when it was \nendangered by cuts, he took to the phones in recent years to galvanize \nsupport. He roamed the Halls of the House of Representatives and the \nSenate for his beloved Fulbright Program. After all, all over the \nworld, many leaders of the free world had been called Fulbright \nscholars.\n  We will miss this great man, Mr. President. I first met him when he \nwas speaking at the Ouachita County Courthouse in Camden, AR. The year \nwas 1944, and he was seeking his seat in the Senate. I was 10 years old \nat that time, but I could still take you to that corner in Camden, AR, \nwhere I first had the opportunity and the privilege of meeting J. \nWilliam Fulbright. I just knew that I had met a great person. And \nthrough these many years, I was never quite able to ever bring myself \nto call him ``Bill.'' To me, he was and he will always be Senator Bill \nFulbright.\n  He spent his life attempting to end the obsession with war. He spent \nhis life attempting to educate us that using war as the solution for \nour conflicts was a course of action that would bring us nothing in the \nend but sorrow. We will miss this great man, this great Senator, and \nthis great person who has contributed so much to peace in the world and \nunderstanding among all men.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware, under the previous \norder, is recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Before I begin what I wish to speak to, let me compliment my friend \nfrom Arkansas. I had the great privilege of being a young Senator \nserving with Chairman Fulbright. I did not know him nearly as well, nor \nwas I as close to him, by any stretch of the imagination, as my friend \nfrom Arkansas, but it was a real honor and privilege and, let me say, \nsomething that I tell my children and will tell my grandchildren and I \nam sure they will tell their children, that their father and \ngrandfather had a chance to serve with such a great man.\n  I will tell you one anecdote in my relationship with him. I remember \nhim as a young man. I had just been elected. I was 29 years old. I had \nnot turned 30 yet. I came down here to meet with what was then referred \nto as the old bulls of the Senate. I went around and made my obligatory \nstops at the offices. Senator Fulbright asked me what I wanted to do, \nand I said how very much I would like to be on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  I say to my friend from Arkansas, back in those days I do not think \nthere was anybody on the committee under the age of 55 and it was only \nsenior Senators, very senior Senators who were on the committee, made \nup of great men like Jack Javits and Mike Mansfield, Bill Fulbright, \nStuart Symington, Hubert Humphrey, et cetera. And I realized it was a \nreach, and I did not expect to get on as soon as I did. But I just \nwanted to let him know.\n  He said, ``Why do you want to be on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee?'' I said, ``Mr. Chairman, one of the great concerns I have \nis our foreign policy, American foreign policy. It is my avocation, my \ninterest. Quite frankly,'' I said, ``Mr. Chairman, if as a Senator I \nwould not be able to deal with foreign policy, there would be no reason \nto run for the U.S. Senate; I might as well run for Governor. But the \nreason I am here is because I care about that.''\n  He looked at me, and he said, ``Well, I understand your sincerity. \nLet me think about it.'' So I saw him coming over on the subway a \nlittle while later, a week later, and he said, ``I thought about it.'' \nHe said, ``You really want to affect foreign policy?'' I said, ``Yes, I \nwould like to eventually, Mr. Chairman.'' He said, ``Why don't you go \nsee my colleague, Senator McClellan.'' I said, ``I beg your pardon, Mr. \nChairman. He is the No. 2 man''--then was about to be the chairman--\n``of the Appropriations Committee.'' And I said, ``That's \nappropriations.'' He said, ``Yes, but that's where foreign policy is \nmade.''\n  I will never forget that.\n  Mr. PRYOR. A good story.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And he did support me, I might add, to go on Foreign \nRelations. But he told me if I really wanted to affect foreign policy, \nI should go with the other Senator from Arkansas, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n                    TRIBUTE TO J. WILLIAM FULBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I come this morning sadly to eulogize one \nof the truly great political and intellectual giants of my home State \nof Arkansas. In a way, it is especially difficult for me because in \n1974 I ran against him for the Senate.\n  J.W. ``Bill'' Fulbright had been a Congressman, president of the \nUniversity of Arkansas, U.S. Senator, chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and an icon to millions of people, not just in Arkansas, but \nall over the world.\n  In 1974 Senator Fulbright had served in the Senate for 30 years and \nwas prepared to run for his sixth term. I was Governor of my State, \ncompleting my second term, and I can tell my colleagues that being a \nSenator is infinitely more enjoyable and less stressful than being \nGovernor. I was not interested in running for the House of \nRepresentatives, nor was I particularly interested in returning to the \npractice of law.\n  While I had been a great fan of Bill Fulbright's, I was late in \nopposing the war in Vietnam, long after he opposed it. I had admired \nhis courage in speaking out against that war almost from its inception. \nI suppose now would be a good time to say that he once told me that his \nvote on the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was the worst vote he ever cast, \nand that he regretted it.\n  But I had to make a decision about the Senate race, and I had to make \nit by March 1974. So I made what was one of the most difficult \ndecisions of my life--to run against him in the Democratic primary. \nThere are people, needless to say, who never forgave me for it, and I \nunderstand that.\n  I do not mean this to sound self-serving, but it is not terribly \nuncommon for people to come up to me and say, ``How does Arkansas elect \nthe quality of people that it does?'' And they always include Bill \nFulbright's name. We have a saying in Arkansas that we defeat better \nmen than most States have a chance to vote for.\n  So while our relationship was not close even before that primary \nelection, it was certainly not close afterward. Happily, about 5 years \nago, we had a 2-hour luncheon, which I would have to say was one of the \nhighlights of my life. It was not spectacular from a content \nstandpoint, but we obviously liked each other and regretted that we had \nnot been closer the first 15 years I was here.\n  Out of that luncheon grew a very, very warm friendship, not only with \nhim, but with his beloved wife Harriet, who is one of the truly \nsuperior people I have ever known.\n  I might say at this point that Harriet has been as loyal, faithful, \ncaring, and compassionate during Senator Fulbright's illness as anybody \ncould possibly be.\n  Mr. President, I will introduce more formal remarks into the Record \nsometime in the near future, but I hastened here this morning after his \ndeath last night to say that I know I speak for all of the people of my \nState in expressing our genuine sadness at the loss of this truly great \nman.\n  Bill Fulbright believed in public service. I was just a youngster \nwhen he was first elected to the Senate, but in the time I did know \nhim, while I was Governor and in the past few years, I never heard him \nexpress any idea that was not noble, an idea that was not motivated by \nhis commitment to his country, or an idea that would not inspire our \nyoung people to choose politics as a career. Though he did not suffer \nfools gladly, he was not a cynical man.\n  I came here to say he was a great icon, a great public servant, and a \nbrilliant man who loved his country beyond the love of anything else. I \nwill personally miss him and the warm relationship we had been \nenjoying.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2346-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2348-S2350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      CRIME AND JUSTICE IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to begin speaking on \nthe issue of crime and justice in America and the Democratic crime \nbill, the Clinton \n[[Page S2349]]  crime bill that was passed last year, and the proposals \nto change that crime bill. I realize there is sort of a frenzy underway \nhere where, to use the old expression, the freight train is rolling \ndown the tracks, the contract is underway, and we are in a great hurry \nto change everything here.\n  I am going to spend a half hour or so this morning, and then future \nmornings, as we approach the debate on the Senate floor on the changes \nin the Biden crime--in the crime bill, and try to lay out some of at \nleast what I see to be the facts.\n  Last year, Congress completed a 6-year effort and enacted a major \nanticrime law in which the Federal Government launched a bold and \nmultifaceted attack on violent crime and its roots back in our \ncommunities, not here at the national level. For the first time, the \nFederal Government made major commitments to help States and \nlocalities, the places where 95 percent of all the crimes are committed \nand all the crimes are prosecuted. We got involved, to help them \nredress the greatest shortcomings in our system. And after years of \nstudy and overwhelming consensus, it was agreed what those shortcomings \nin our criminal justice system were and are.\n  No. 1, first and foremost, there is a shortage of police out on the \nstreets of our communities. That is number one.\n  No. 2, the shortage of prison space and the need for sentencing \nreform at the State level.\n  No. 3, the shortage of effective responses to drug offenders.\n  No. 4, the lack of serious response to rape and family violence.\n  No. 5, the lack of safe places and positive activities for those \nchildren referred to as at-risk children, who grow up surrounded by \nillegal drugs, crime, and violence.\n  Everybody I am aware of agrees these were the problems we had to \nspeak to. I might point out we pretty well have taken care of--which is \na much easier problem to take care--the Federal side of that equation. \nWe have enough Federal prison space in the Federal prison system. When \nyou get sentenced, you go to jail for the totality of that term. I was \nthe coauthor of that bill. In the Federal courts, if a judge says you \nare going to go to prison for 10 years, you know you are going to go to \nprison for at least 85 percent of that time--8.5 years, which is what \nthe law mandates. You can get up to 1.5 years in good time credits, but \nthat is all. And we abolished parole. So you know you'll be in prison \nfor at least 8.5 years.\n  But in the States, the average amount of time people serve once \nsentenced in the State court is 43 percent of the time. So on average, \nin the States--my State being one of the exceptions, the State of \nDelaware, which essentially has the same records as the Federal \nGovernment; they keep people, on average, 85 percent of the time--but \nmost States keep people in jail, if they get sentenced to 10 years in \nthe State court, they only serve 4 years 2 months in a State prison.\n  So we fixed it at the Federal level. This was to help begin to not \nsend rules or regulations or mandates to the States, but to send them \nmoney to fix the problems. It was to help them fix the problems I have \nstated, which everyone agreed on: Lack of police, lack of serious \nresponse to rape, et cetera.\n  Now, in its breadth, the crime bill we passed reflects the lessons \nlearned over the past decade as we studied crime and law enforcement \nand worked on passing this law; namely, that all of the shortcomings \nhave to be addressed at one time. Correcting one without the other is \nfutile because crime knows no easy single answer. What we found out in \nthe States and what we found out in our earlier experience in the \nFederal Government is when you increase penalties and you do not \nincrease the number of prison spaces, you do not do much. If you put \nmore cops on the street, they make more arrests, you increase the \npenalties, and you do not have places to put the felons, then the \npeople just walk. So now you have convicted felons who are out on the \nstreet, not having served their time. So we learned we cannot just deal \nwith one piece of it.\n  The anticrime law we passed last year addressed each of these \nshortcomings, as I will detail in a moment. In its approach, as well as \nin many specifics, the law was a result of bipartisan efforts--at least \nat the outset.\n  The law is already at work; $1 billion has already been awarded to \nthe States and localities to put almost 15,000 new police officers on \nthe streets in the community policing program. That is already done. \nThe law only passed last fall and already almost 15,000 cops, new cops, \nbrand new--not supplanting cops that were on local forces, almost \n15,000 new local cops that were not there before--within the next \nseveral months, after they finish their training, are going to be on \nthe streets in the United States of America because of this crime bill. \nDollars, under the drug court program, the Violence Against Women Act, \nare going to be awarded over the next few months.\n  I hoped I could spend the next several months watching over the \nsmooth and speedy implementation of this law, as well as turning my \nfocus to the substantial issues that still lie before us. Just to name \ntwo priorities, we must turn all our talk about our war on drugs into a \nreal battle, and we have to reform our juvenile justice system as it \nstruggles to deal with violent, youthful offenders unlike any the \ncurrent system was designed to handle.\n  That is work still to be done. I thought we would be on the floor \nhere this next year and the following year, dealing with finally doing \nsomething real about the drug problem and doing something more about \njuvenile justice because when I wrote the crime bill, I never \nadvertised it as--as my grandfather would say, this is not a horse to \ncarry the sleigh. The whole sleigh on crime is more than what the crime \nbill was about, and we have said that, frankly, from the beginning. \nWhat we did, we thought we were going to have in place; we thought we \nwere going to be just implementing.\n  Very soon, the Senate will embark on a debate, not about new \nchallenges, but of the anticrime law we just enacted last fall. The \nHouse is already taking apart this law piecemeal.\n  What is motivating a retreat on the bill that contained so many \nprovisions drafted and once supported by Republicans, as well as \nDemocrats, quite frankly, escapes me. I will let you draw your own \nconclusions. But I ask you walk with me through the changes the \nRepublican leadership seeks to make in the anticrime law. I suspect the \nmerits will speak for themselves.\n  At the same time, I want to make clear what I will fight for and what \nI will fight against, as we revisit the issues debated in the crime \nbill last year so thoroughly. Let me turn first to the central \nprovision of the present new crime law, a program designed to address \nthe first major law enforcement shortcoming I mentioned, a program that \ndeserves, in my view, to be preserved and one I will fight to save from \nthe Republican chopping block. Let me speak first about that program.\n  That program puts 100,000 new police on the street. I do not know a \nresponsible police leader, an academic expert, a public official who \ndoes not agree that putting more police officers on our streets back \nhome and in our neighborhoods is a good idea, a good idea that goes by \nthe name of community policing. The true innovation of community \npolicing is that it enables police officers to pursue dual goals. They \nare better positioned to respond to and apprehend suspects when crime \noccurs. But they are also better positioned to keep crime from \noccurring in the first place.\n  Today, too many police officers are strangers in their own \ncommunities. From headquarters or cruisers, they respond to radio calls \nonly after crime has occurred, forever behind the curve. Police \nofficers are a part of their community. Community police officers will \nbe a part of their community. They know their community--the hot spots, \nthe troublemakers, the gang members--and they can work to prevent crime \nin the first place.\n  I do not want to go back to a nostalgic and romantic view of what \nused to be the case. But most of us who grew up in anything that \nremotely resembles a city or a town that had an identity when we were \nkids, those of us in this Chamber, when we were kids, we knew the local \ncop. He walked down the street. He knew everybody. He knew who owned \nwhat store. He knew the kids who were troublemakers and those who were \nnot. We knew if we got into trouble, he would call our mothers or call \nour fathers.\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\n  Things have not been working too well is for a whole range of \nreasons--mainly the shortage of bodies--but one of the reasons is that \nwe have moved away from community policing. In my own State, community \npolicing took the form of foot patrols with a particular focus on \nbreaking up street-level drug dealing that had turned one of \nWilmington's neighborhoods into a crime zone. These efforts \nsuccessfully suppressed drug activity without displacing it to another \npart of the city. The Wilmington example fits the shorthand description \noften used for community policing; that is, putting cops on the streets \nto walk the beat. But in practice, community policing takes on many \nforms, depending on the needs of any particular community.\n  The form of community policing takes various forms. From community to \ncommunity, the results coming in from the field are all the same. \nCommunity policing works. In New York City, a place where crime can \nseem insurmountable, the police commissioner began an aggressive \ncommunity policing program that contributed to a significant decrease \nin serious offenses last year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2348-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2350-S2351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The time for morning business has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I do not want to ask unanimous consent to \ncontinue morning business if my friends are ready to go on the bill. I \ndo not want to do that. But, if they are in no hurry, I would ask \nunanimous consent to continue for another 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there others who are seeking time for \nmorning business, including myself.\n  How much more time does the Senator feel he needs?\n  Mr. BIDEN. About 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All right. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we \nbe in morning business until 10:45 with 15 minutes allotted to the \nSenator from Delaware and 15 minutes allotted to the Senator from North \nDakota, and the balance of the time for this side, until the hour of \n10:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, with the New York City community policing, since they \ninstituted community policing, murders have dropped 19 percent, \nrobberies have dropped 16 percent, burglaries went down 11 percent, and \nauto thefts were reduced to 15 percent.\n  In Tampa, FL, police committed themselves to moving crack dealers off \nthe street corners and forged an unprecedented alliance with the \ncitizens of the community to achieve that. Through a combination of \nstandard buy-bust operations, new outreach to the community involvement \nof other city agencies and local media, the dealers have been driven \noff within a year and the streets within the targeted area returned to \nnormal.\n  In New Haven, CT, one of the most innovative police chiefs in the \nNation, Nick Pastore, with his aggressive community policing effort, \nled to a 10-percent drop in serious crime in the year 1992, the last \ntime we have the figures.\n  Policing community techniques were introduced in the New York subway \nsystem 4 years ago, and the results have been phenomenal. Robberies \nhave fallen by 52 percent. In the Inglewood section of Chicago, \ncommunity policing is credited with a 6-percent decrease in violent \ncrime last year.\n  The new anticrime law enacted last year targets $8.8 billion in funds \nto State and local law enforcement to be used specifically to train and \nhire 100,000 community police officers across the Nation. Like \ncommunity policing itself, this program works. Already, the Justice \nDepartment has awarded almost 15,000 new officers to State and local \ncommunities.\n  All of these are local officers with no Federal control, no Federal \nmandate. These are local cops for which the Federal Government is \nkicking in $70,000 per cop.\n  In short, in only the first 6 months following the passage of the new \ncrime law, almost 15,000 new police officers will be on the street. So \nmuch for the critics who claim that the new crime bill would fund only \n22,000 police officers in 6 years. We have almost 15,000 that will be \non the streets, new ones, in 6 months; not 22,000 in 6 years as our \ncritics say. In fact, the law will fund 15,000, as I said, in the first \n6 months alone, and we will be well on the way by the time the first \nyear is over to surpassing the 20,000 mark.\n  The effectiveness of the cops program derives from its design. The \ncops program is a result of setting a precise goal, and enacting in a \nresponsible program to achieve a precise goal. When he took office, \nPresident Clinton called on us to put 100,000 more police on the \nstreets over the next 6 years.\n  To put it another way, we have roughly 530,000 local police officers \nin all of America, State cops to town cops to county cops. At the end \nof the process, there will be 630,000 cops on the streets of America. \nAlready, that number will be up by 15,000 at the end of the first 6 \nmonths.\n  So he asked us to put 100,000 cops on the street. We then designed a \nprogram that funds that effort and that effort alone. The Federal \ndollars were awarded for the sole purpose of hiring new police officers \nso that in 6 year's time America will have 635,000 police doing \ncommunity policing.\n  The position of this program stands in stark contrast to the \nRepublicans' new law enforcement block grant which would spend roughly \nthe same amount of Federal funds--to be specific, $8.5 billion--without \nguaranteeing a single, solitary additional cop back home. Read their \nproposal. Money is sent, not like it is now directly to a police \ndepartment to hire a cop locally. Money will be sent to Governors back \nin our home States. With that money the Governor, out of that $8.5 \nbillion we are going to send to the Governors now--not to the police--\nthey will be able to hire or pay overtime to undefined law enforcement \nofficers, or to procure equipment, technology or other material that is \ndirectly related to basic law enforcement functions, such as the \ndetection or investigation of crime or the prosecution of criminals.\n  That may sound fine on the surface. But let us look at it a little \nbit closer. Let us call this what I call the first weakness of the \nRepublican change. I call it the officer loophole because the \nRepublicans do not define law enforcement officers as career officers \ndedicated to enforcing the criminal laws, as it is defined in the Biden \ncrime bill. Indeed, the Republicans do not define law enforcement \nofficer at all in their new crime bill.\n  Let us call the second weakness what I call the equipment loophole. \nThe Republican proposal would fund any equipment or technology related \nto law enforcement functions, and those functions are specifically \ndefined to include prosecution.\n  These two loopholes mean that the Governor of a State who will get \nthe money now--it will not go to your local police department. It is \nthe same old bureaucracy that is going to be set up. Right now all the \npolice department has to do, they do not have to go to get anybody's \npermission. They can make an application. Once they check with their \nlocal government, their local civilian officials and send an \napplication directly to the Attorney General of the United States, and \nthe Attorney General of the United States can send back directly the \nmoney to hire those new local cops. But now we are going back to the \nbad old days, which is the Governors sit there and say, This is what I \nwant to do with the money. Send me the money. I will take care of it. \nThe two loopholes I mentioned means that the State can spend all of \ntheir money to hire prosecutors,\n all their money to improve the court systems or anything related to \nlaw enforcement. Arguably, the money could even be used to hire \nofficers to enforce the civil laws as well as the criminal laws in the \nState. For example, the Governor could use the money to hire public \nhealth officers; they could use the money to hire the public health \nofficers to inspect restaurants and businesses.\n\n  Equipment as defined by the Republicans could include not merely \npolice equipment, which the new anticrime law already grants a portion \nof funds to provide for new equipment, but it could--in this case, they \ncould use this money, which was heretofore only to \n[[Page S2351]]  be used to hire a cop, to buy computers for prosecutors \nor judges or telephone booths or lighting or whatever the Governor \ndecided would relate to law enforcement functions. And 100 percent of \nthe Federal funds could be used for this equipment, or to fund \nprosecutors, or to pay judge's salaries, without one single penny \nhaving to go to hire an additional cop.\n  I support many of these functions. In the crime bill, for example, we \nprovide for a significant amount of money to the States to hire State \njudges. We put in money for new equipment. But we segregate, in the \npresent crime law, almost $9 billion. It says you must hire a sworn \nofficer, that is somebody who is a criminal law enforcement officer. \nThat is all you can do with the money now.\n  This new law proposed by the Republicans will, in fact, guarantee \nthat we will not get 100,000 cops on the street. I am opposed to \nreplacing the program that guarantees 100,000 new cops on our streets \nwith the proposal that could spend over $8 billion in Federal funds, \nwithout putting any new cops anywhere.\n  The Republican proposal suffers from an additional fatal flaw. It \nrequires no fiscal accountability or responsibility. I find this \nfascinating. They are talking about tightening the budget, tightening \nspending. Here they are going to take over $8 billion, with no \naccountability, and send it back to the States. Why do we not just have \nplain old revenue sharing? Why call this a crime bill? The bill uses a \nformula to simply hand out Federal funds to officials, with no strings \nattached and no accountability. That sounds great, does it not?\n  Well, the anticrime law requires that States and localities match \nFederal grants with their own money. And this match requirement is not \nborn out of a lack of generosity on the part of the author of the bill, \nme or anybody else who voted for it. The offer of $8.8 billion in \nFederal funds to assist what is purely a State and local function can \nhardly be characterized as not being generous. No, the reason I wrote \nin a match was to require accountability, a match required born out of \nexperience.\n  I started my career as a county councilman, and I know how local \nofficials work. God bless them, they have a tough job. We would sit \nthere in budget meetings when I was a county official, councilperson, \nand somebody would say, well we are going to buy a new park, or do this \nin the park, or we are going to add two more police, and I or somebody \nelse would say, how much is that going to cost? I am not exaggerating \nwhen I say the answer would come back that it will not cost anything. \nWait a minute, you just said we are going to hire two new cops. They \nsaid, that is Federal money. That is Federal money, and it is not going \nto cost anything. Well, it is my tax dollars.\n  So I found when a county or city has to put up some money for a \nprogram, they think twice about whether or not they really want it. \nRemember the allegations in the old LEAA Program, where police \ndepartments are out buying Dick Tracy wristwatches, purchasing riot \ncontrol gear in small towns that never even thought about a riot? In \nthe LEAA Program, we went a long way to begin to work toward using our \nmoney wisely. We built in three key concepts. We targeted law \nenforcement to aid specific programs; required a match of one State or \nlocal dollar for every three Federal dollars that we spend, and \nrequired extensive State plans to explain what they are going to use \nthe Federal dollars for. We do not demand that they do anything, except \ntell us what they are going to use them for.\n  The resulting law was what we called the Byrne Grant Program, which \nis a predecessor to this crime bill, a fiscally responsible, well-run \nprogram that continues today. The same concept marks the essential \nelements of the anticrime law for 100,000 cops. In fact, we even \nimprove the Byrne concept in one respect. We permit localities, not \njust Governors, to apply directly for the funds to ensure that the \nmoney gets where it is most needed.\n  I think my Republican colleagues should go back and look at the \nexperience of LEAA before they pursue their proposal of block grants \nfor police and any other purpose. Their proposal is an $8.5 billion \ngiveaway of Federal dollars with no specific goals, with loopholes, and \nloose language that would permit every cent to be spent without any \nincrease in police on the streets to show for our investment at the end \nof the 5 years.\n  In contrast, the anti-crime law enacted last year, which was \nbipartisanly constructed in the first instance, builds on the LEAA \nlessons. It sets specific goals, provides a simplified application, \nrequires accountability for evaluation and matching requirements. In \naddition, the matching requirement is set up so the local share \nincreases from year to year. In this way, we ensure that local dollars \nare to be used responsibly.\n  I see my time is coming to a close. Those who say, wait a minute now, \nBiden, under your bill that is now law, you required the States to kick \nin money. I say, yes, that is right. They say, well, in our bill we do \nnot. Well, I ask a rhetorical question. This bill they are going to \noffer is a block grant for 5 years. Say they go out and hire cops for \nthe local communities with block grant money and we pay for all of it \nfor 5 years; what happens at the end of 5 years? The Federal Government \nis guaranteeing that we are going to take over local law enforcement \ncosts for the rest of eternity? Is that what we are saying? No. In 5 \nyears, the mayor has to go back to the taxpayers and say, hey, now we \nhave 50 cops on the street, 10 are being paid for by Federal dollars. \nWe no longer have those Federal dollars. Now I have to raise your taxes \nor cut the 10 cops.\n  Is it not wiser to make that decision at the front end, where you \nhave to go to the voters or your community and ask, do we want more \ncops? The Federal Government will give us $70,000 to start off here, to \nkeep this cop for 5 years, and we are going to have to kick in probably \n$50,000 over that 5-year period. At the end of the process, we have to \npick it up. What do you want to do? I think it is time we asked \ncitizens to be as responsible as legislators should be and are not. \nThat is, if you want to have more cops, it costs money, flat out. It \ncosts money.\n  The local officials should have the guts to go to their constituency \nand stop talking about how tough they are.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, along with Senators Heflin, Murkowski, \nGorton, Domenici, Burns, Packwood, Kempthorne, and a statement of \nsupport from the minority leader, Senator Daschle, I will, in the near \nfuture, introduce the Federal Lands Act Forest Health Amendments of \n1995.\n  Mr. President, for some time I have attempted, along with others, to \nbring to the attention of this Senate the serious deterioration of this \ncountry's forest lands from a variety of ills, including drought, \ninsect and disease attacks, and natural wildfires. We have come to \nunderstand that these problems, in combination, affect millions of \nacres of Federal, State, and private forest lands, and they have \nadvanced to a point that they simply demand the attention of this \nCongress.\n  It should be no surprise to any of us. Numerous recent reports from \nthe scientific community, one of them called ``Assessing Forest \nEcosystem Health in the Inland West'' and the ``Report of the National \nCommission on Wildfires,'' predicted intense wildfire events as a \nconsequence of the forest health problems that this legislation will \nspeak to. Many believe these costly fires will continue, unless there \nis an aggressive action by man to work with Mother Nature in attempting \nto deal with this situation. Scientists and forest managers met in Sun \nValley in my State in 1993, and warned us with a very terse message, \nthat we had ``A brief window of opportunity, perhaps 15-30 years in \nlength''--and in the life of a forest, that is but the blink of an \neye--to reverse this very unnatural cycle of fire that we were moving \ninto.\n  And, of course, last summer, it was so vividly dramatized in the \ninland West, as 4 million acres of unhealthy timber burst into fire, \nkilling people, destroying homes, destroying ecosystems and wildlife \nand damaging riparian areas, and at a cost of $1 billion to the Federal \nGovernment in its attempt to suppress these fires, when, \n[[Page S2352]]  in many instances, they simply had to back away and \nwatch the violence of the fires and the destruction that occurred.\n  Do not be misled by those who proclaim that wildfire is beneficial to \nthe environment because of a natural mosaic of vegetation that would be \ncreated. The 1994 fires were way outside the normal and the historic \nrange. Damage to every component of the environment was so extensive \nthat it will really cost us hundreds of years to begin to repair that \nkind of damage. A draft environmental impact statement just released by \nthe Boise National Forest in my State documents long-term, severe \ndamages to watersheds, soils, fisheries, and wildlife from last \nsummer's fires that will be, as I mentioned, decades and decades and \ndecades in repair.\n  The only way we can deal with this serious problem is to develop and \nimplement equally serious management strategies and allow our national \nforests our foresters in the scientific community to break the cycle of \nthe forests that are in decline with this kind of mortality as a result \nof the disease, the insects, and the drought.\n  My bill, titled the ``Federal Lands Act Forest Health Amendments of \n1995,'' is an attempt to do just that. It is now gaining bipartisan \nsupport. We will want to move it very rapidly through the two \ncommittees of jurisdiction and bring it to the floor of this Senate for \ndebate, while a similar bill will move in the House.\n  This bill will set the management procedures in place to identify the \nhighest priority forest health problem areas on the national forests, \nthe public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the \npublic domain wildlife refuges. Once the areas are identified, this \nbill requires the agencies to take aggressive action to restore forest \nhealth. Most notably, the legislation would relieve some of the \nprocedural impediments which have tied the agencies' hands. Our aim \nwill be to alter unhealthy forest vegetation through thinnings and \nother cultural practices so the forest more nearly conforms to the \nhistoric patterns which once prevailed. Once there, the forest \necosystem can be maintained through scientific management.\n  I see this forest health legislation as a long-term solution to the \nproblem at hand. Years of concentrated effort will be needed to treat \nmillions of acres now in trouble and restore them to conditions which \nare within the expected natural patterns and cycles. Though our western \nforests are in particular crisis now, forest health problems have \nsurfaced in southern forests as well as in the northeastern and Lakes \nStates, and this legislation would be very useful in those \ncircumstances.\n  As with most difficult situations, there is an opportunity here. As \nforest health activities are implemented, benefits will be gained for \nfish and wildlife habitat, water quality, scenic values and for all \ncomponents of the ecosystem. That is the end result we want. At the \nsame time, the activities needed to accomplish that end will generate \nforest products, jobs, and economic returns to the local economies \nwhich have been badly hurt by the shrunken timber supply.\n  We do not need to be risking lives and property fighting these \nunnatural wildfires. We don't need to be spending a billion dollars on \nfire suppression when we could be taking effective preventive action to \nreduce risk. We do not need to watch our natural resources go up in \nsmoke when there is a critical need for wood fiber to sustain our \nindustry and communities. Forest health crises are preventable, and I \nam committed to bringing solutions before the Congress. That is why I \nwill introduce this legislation.\n  Our time, our window of opportunity, as I mentioned, is very narrow. \nI hope that my colleagues will join with me in a serious effort at \nworking with the Forest Service to resolve the crisis that our forests \nare now in.\n  Yes, for the time being, we are receiving abnormally high moisture \nlevels in the inland West. But still, over the long period of drought, \nthe accumulated moisture continues to decline, and along with that is \nthe direct decline of the forests' health. Clearly next year, we would \nset ourselves up for another summer of fire and destruction and, \ntragically, the possibility of life lost, the kind that we saw in \nColorado, in my State of Idaho, in Oregon, in Montana, and certainly in \nWashington and California this past year.\n  Something has to be done. I believe my legislation will start us in \nthat direction. And it would be foolish for this Senate, this Congress, \nthis administration to simply set idly by and say, ``Oh, but it is \nMother Nature at her finest.'' It is Mother Nature at her worst, \nbecause part of the problem that we are dealing with is the result of \nour inability to manage fires over the years and our failure to \nrecognize that there was a national ebb and flow of the ecosystem that \nwe have severely damaged and it will take our work, our efforts, and \nour cooperation with Mother Nature to begin to right this process.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join with me in this effort and become \ncosponsors of the legislation that we will be introducing.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, legislation will be introduced soon that \ntakes our Nation an important step closer to avoiding devastating \nwildfires in our national forests. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the legislation to be introduced by the senior Senator \nfrom Idaho--the Forest Health Amendments of 1995.\n  Last year, wildfires raged across the Western United States. The fire \nseason started in early summer and by the time the smoke had cleared \nnearly 3 million acres of land in the Western United States had \nburned--double the amount of 1993. In the States of Washington and \nOregon alone, nearly 1.4 billion board feet of Federal timber burned.\n  Last summer, after listening closely to the concerns of Washington \nState residents, I offered an amendment during the House-Senate \nInterior Appropriations conference to provide the Forest Service with \nthe authority to expedite these salvage sales. Unfortunately, I could \nnot convince the members of the conference committee to include my \namendment in the report. And, unfortunately, the burned timber is still \nsitting on the ground.\n  Today, most, if not all, of the 1.4 billion board feet remains on the \nground in Oregon and Washington. Obviously not all of the 1.4 billion \nboard feet of timber that burned last summer would be eligible for \nharvest. According to the Forest Service calculations, usually 50 \npercent of the total volume burned in a wildfire can be salvaged. \nConsequently, roughly 700 million board feet is eligible for some type \nof salvaging activity. But, once again, the Forest Service has made \nonly token efforts to prepare the sales necessary to get in and get up \nthis valuable timber. The urgency is based upon the fact that burnt, \ndead, or dying timber loses its value rapidly.\n  The ramifications of inaction by the Forest Service in preparing \nthese sales is twofold: These sales will provide small sawmills and \nlogging companies in the Northwest--literally on verge of going out of \nbusiness--some much needed wood supply. Beyond this, it is critical to \nremember that if the timber is left to rot on the forest floor it will \nbe setting the stage for yet another devastating fire season this \ncoming summer. Mr. President, inaction on the part of the Forest \nService not only hurts working people, but it also hurts the \nenvironment.\n  Regrettably, inaction is exactly what we are getting from the\n   Forest Service. In response to the wildfires from last summer the \nForest Service began to study the forest health issue. Last December \nthe Service issued a report on its study entitled the ``Western Forest \nHealth Initiative.'' The report highlighted 330 forest health-related \nprojects in the Western United States. The majority of these projects, \nhowever, were not developed in response to the wildfires of the summer. \nFor instance, in Washington and Oregon, only 40 projects were \nidentified in response to the summer fires. Of the 40 projects, only a \nfew were actual salvaging operations.\n\n  Mr. President, the people in my State are asking themselves ``why?'' \nWhy isn't the Forest Service going into the burned out areas and \ngetting up the timber? Why isn't the Forest Service restoring the \nhealth of our forests, and putting people back to work? The answer is, \nof course, in large part driven by the fact that the Forest Service \nwill most likely go to court if it begins \n[[Page S2353]]  even a modest effort to conduct salvage operations.\n  Mr. President, the people in my State are frustrated. They are \nfrustrated with a Federal Government that is so petrified by the \npotential filing of law suits that it will not undertake even the most \nlimited of management activities in our Nation's forests.\n  The legislation to be introduced by the Senator from Idaho would ease \nsome of this frustration. The Forest Health Amendments of 1995 would \nrequire the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to conduct a yearly \nreview on the status of the health of our Nation's forests. The bill \nwould continue to grant the right to appeal a project, but would limit \nthe timeframe for such an appeal. The bill grants the authority to \nallow for an environmental assessment on an individual project versus \nthe more costly and time consuming environmental impact statement. The \nbill would also allow for the Forest Service to prioritize forest \nhealth needs as an emergency or high-risk area.\n  The legislation to be introduced will not be enacted soon enough to \nconduct salvage operations in response to last year's wildfires. This \nSenator has already begun to work with his colleagues in the Northwest \ncongressional delegation to put together an amendment that will address \nthe salvage sitting on the ground from last year's fires, and other \nshort-term timber supply issues for the region.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will provide the Forest Service with \nsome much needed direction. We cannot, and should not, stop managing \nour forests because of the obstructionists tactics of a few groups and \nindividuals. If we do, we will be confronted with devastating \nwildfires--like last year--on an annual basis. I encourage my \ncolleagues to work with this Senator and the Senator from Idaho to \nenact this legislation, and bring some common sense back to the \nmanagement of our Nation's forests.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my colleagues should be well aware of my \nsentiments toward a runaway train, known as the Federal bureaucracy, \nand its effect on individuals and small businesses in this country \nthrough the regulatory process. I have spoken of this situation, here \non the floor of the Senate, in the past. My colleagues should also be \nwell aware of my commitment to the principle of multiple-use regarding \nFederal lands. This principle was established in the Federal Lands \nPolicy and Management Act of 1976, known as FLPMA.\n  Today, I am here to support an effort to streamline a part of the \nregulatory and decisionmaking process regarding the management of \nfederally controlled forest lands. In the course of this section, I am \nalso hopeful that we will aid individuals and small businesses whose \nlivelihoods depend on the sustainable development of our forest \nresources.\n  Mr. President, I am here today as a cosponsor of the Federal Lands \nAct Forest Health Amendments of 1995, to be introduced by Senator \nCraig. These amendments are, indeed, needed, as we all witnessed the \ntragic losses of life and property to fires that devastated many areas \nin the Western United States this last year, including parts of New \nMexico.\n  In regard to the issue of forest health addressed by these \namendments, I have read report after report, each describing how the \nstate of affairs in the forests administered by the U.S. Forest Service \nand the Bureau of Land Management are in decline. At the same time, I \nhave heard over and over how every step that he professional land \nmanagers we have entrusted with the care of these treasured lands is \nchallenged through either administrative appeals or in the courts. \nThese endless challenges, no matter how well intentioned, have tied the \nhands of the land management agencies to the point that almost every \nactivity related to scientifically supported treatment of even the most \ndevastated areas is effectively halted.\n  Mr. President, this must stop. I believe that this legislation will \nbe a significant benefit to our forests, and the people who live and \nwork in and around them. It will establish criteria that will allow the \nresponsible agencies to place areas most in need of corrective \nmanagement in a high priority designation of either emergency or high-\nrisk forest health areas. Further, when we say emergency, we mean \nemergency. One of the criteria for designation as an emergency area is \nthat 50 percent of the trees are either dead or will likely die within \n2 years. Let me repeat that standard for emergency designation: half of \nthe trees are either dead or will soon die.\n  Included in the decision to designate an area as a forest health \nemergency or high-risk area will be a listing of the authorized \ncorrective activities that will be undertaken to improve conditions in \nthe affected areas. None of these management activities will be beyond \nthe scope of actions already approved in the appropriate land \nmanagement plan.\n  This is an innovative approach to expedite the bureaucratic process, \nand one that will create a finite time from proposal to actual on-the-\nground activities. This should, by no means, indicate that we here in \nCongress are trying to keep the public from participating in the \nprocess. We provide for a public comment period following the \npublication of the proposal in the Federal Register. We are also not \nattempting to cut off the opportunity for appeals. A period during \nwhich appeals can be filed is also required. We are quite simply \nproviding a process by which constructive and corrective actions can be \napplied in the most dire of circumstances, where the continued inaction \nthat occurs under the current system can only result in further \ndegradation of our treasured forest resources.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation will require the Secretaries \nof Agriculture and the Interior to report annually to the Congress on \nactivities carried out under this provision. In this report, the \nSecretaries will also inform the Congress of the current status of \nforest health on Federal lands, describe problems that have been \nencountered over the previous year, and indicate initiatives expected \nfor the next year.\n  In closing, I want to commend Senator Craig for his commitment to \nresolving the problems faced by the Federal land management agencies, \nand for his leadership in bringing the issue of forest health to the \nforefront here in the Senate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, first, I would like to commend my \ncolleague, Senator Craig, for bringing this issue to the floor of the \nSenate for debate.\n  As some of you will remember, last summer catastrophic forest fires \nswept across the west. Governors were forced to declare states of \nemergency. We saw devastating loss of life--and I ask you to recall for \na moment the 14 firefighters who lost their lives in Colorado, there \nwere other as well--of property, of habitat, and of economic resources \nthat rural communities in States like Idaho depend on.\n  Some of these fires burned so wild and so hot that we could only wait \nfor winter snows to put them out. But when the final fires were \ncontrolled, and the tallies taken, the numbers showed that my State of \nIdaho suffered the most timber lost of any State--over 1.5 billion \nboard feet--enough timber to build over 137,000 homes, and to provide \njobs for up to 35,000 people.\n  Idaho was not alone. Our neighboring States suffered as well. The \nForest Service alone spent $757 million fighting fires across the west. \nThat does not include the expenses by BLM, the States, and other \nagencies.\n  I would like to be able to tell you that this past summer was a fluke \nand that it hadn't happened before, and won't happen again. But that is \nnot the case. These forest fires will come again. High fuel loads, \nlong-term drought that made our forests susceptible to disease and \ninsect infestations are all still threatening our forests. Huge stands \nof dead and dying timber are ready and waiting to go up like a \ntinderbox again next summer or the summer after that.\n  We cannot bring the rain to end the drought--that talent is in higher \nhands than ours. But we can take action with the tools that were given \nto us. We can manage those forests so that they provide the timber, the \nhabitat, and the recreation opportunities that we depend on. This bill \nwill give the Forest Service the flexibility to manage forests in a \ntimely manner to get salvage sales out within the window of \nopportunity.\n   [[Page S2354]] Keep in mind that not all of that 1.5 billion board \nfeet of timber damaged in the fires had been approved for timber \nharvest. Far from it. The local forest supervisors have taken into \nconsideration habitat and other environmental requirements, and have \nset aside possibly as much as 90 percent of the timber that was burned \nto meet other needs besides economic ones. But the remaining timber is \nharvestable, and if we do not expedite the handling of that timber, and \nharvest it within the limited 2-year window of opportunity, then the \nvalue of that wood is lost.\n  Rural communities of Idaho and other western States depend on the \nincome from these Federal sales, for direct revenue and income for \nschools and county roads. This letter from the Cambridge School \nDistrict explains the need of Idaho schools for a dependable, steady \ntimber supply. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be made part of \nthe Record.\n  It is Congress' responsibility to ensure that Federal agencies are \nserving the public efficiently and effectively. The timeclock is \nticking. Let's serve the public we were sent here to work for, and pass \nthis bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Cambridge School District #432-J,\n\n                                                November 15, 1994.\n     Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Kempthorne: The summer of 1994 saw catastrophic \n     fires in many of our forests and a great deal of salvageable \n     timber remains in areas burnt over. That salvage timber \n     deteriorates rapidly if not recovered and it is in the best \n     interests of our society to avoid waste of natural resources. \n     Many of Idaho School Districts receive significant revenues \n     from the sale of timber resources from the federal forests in \n     Idaho to fund educational programs.\n       The Cambridge School Board would like to join and support a \n     position calling for the salvage of recoverable timber in a \n     manner consistent with sound environmental practice and to \n     encourage the Forest Service and the Idaho Department of \n     Lands to expedite that salvage to maximize local government \n     revenues and to provide citizens of Idaho with expanded job \n     opportunities.\n       Education funding in Idaho is greatly influenced by the use \n     of natural resources in our state.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cynthia K. Jones,\n       Chairman.\n     Sharon M. Stippich,\n       Vice Chairman.\n     Kathryn Wert,\n       Trustee.\n     Douglas Hansen,\n       Trustee.\n     Ellis E. Pearson,\n       Trustee.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very \nimportant issue in the Pacific Northwest: inland forest health. Earlier \ntoday, my colleague form Idaho, Senator Craig, spoke about legislation \nto address a serious forest health problem plaguing forests throughout \nthe inland west. He very accurately described the problems of disease, \ninsect infestations, and drought that are prevalent in many such \nforests, and which can lead to serious forest fires.\n  I commend Senator Craig for his work on this issue. He is correct \nthat serious forest health problems exist in many areas, and he is \ncorrect that we should try to do something about it. The reasons are \nvery simple. Healthy forests are essential to ensuring long-term \neconomic sustainability in rural communities; they are essential to our \nstandard of living; and they are essential to maintaining a healthy \nenvironment.\n  Growing trees provide many benefits. They shade spawning streams, \nthey stabilize soil and prevent erosion, they provide wildlife habitat, \nthey consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. They also provide wood \nfor our home, paper for our schools, shelter for our communities, and \nrecreation for the people. In short, they are many things to many \npeople. If we strengthen our forests, we strengthen our communities. Of \ncourse, the reverse is also true. If we weaken our forests, we weaken \nour society in many ways.\n  So it is important that we do what we can to keep our forests as \nhealthy as possible.\n  I would like to support a forest health bill. Given the passions \ninflamed when Congress starts legislating forest policy, I believe it \nis incumbent on us to proceed cautiously if we hope to achieve any \nresults. Above all, we must not go too far. We need a forest health \nbill that addresses legitimate problems and reflects the public's view \nregarding management of our public lands.\n  I have already talked about some of these problems. What about the \npublic view? We know the public enjoys its parks and wilderness areas. \nWe know the public appreciates aesthetic, wildlife, roadless, and old \ngrowth values. But we also know the public has a voracious appetite for \nwood products. So, as is so often the case, our challenge and our \nresponsibility as legislators is to strike the right balance.\n  I have a few concerns I hope can be addressed as we enter the forest \nhealth debate. I have touched on a few already: We need to make sure we \nare taking steps to address legitimate, serious problems. We need to \navoid costly, catastrophic fires. The fires we saw last summer ravaged \nthousands of acres, cost a billion dollars to fight, and did no one any \ngood. We need to avoid diseases and inspect problems as well.\n  We also need to keep in mind what's going on downstream. People in \nthe Pacific Northwest have spent the last few years trying to refine \nthe concept of watershed-based management. In Tacoma last year, \nRepresentative Norm Dicks any myself convened a conference of nearly a \nthousand people to discuss watershed issue. Agency managers, fishers, \nprivate land owners, wildlife specialists, water users, \nconservationists, and citizens of all types came together to recognize \nthe importance of watersheds as a resource management unit.\n  We are finding more often than not many land-use questions are \nbecoming aquatic questions. In other words, what happens downstream is \nquite often affected by what happens upstream. Our entire resource-\nbased economy is connected one way or another by the streams and rivers \nthat criss-cross the region.\n  I believe there is ample room for proactive management of forest \nhealth problems and consideration of aquatic issues. The connection \nbetween these two issue sets is a concept I would like to introduce in \nthe debate over Senator Craig's upcoming legislation.\n  We also need to make sure management actions are science-based. The \ngood news is that very few people in the scientific community disagree \nover management prescriptions that can help improve forest health. Just \nthe same, I think it is important to make it clear that the goal of \nachieving good forest health, and the steps taken to reach it, are \nbased in sound science.\n  Finally, I want to say a few words about the broader issue of \necosystem management. This is a concept that has been very popular in \nrecent years. It suggests that active resource management and usage can \nbe reconciled with strong conservation goals. It suggests we can make \ndecisions on a broad basis so we can avoid stumbling into problems on a \ncase-by-case basis. These are goals that I strongly support.\n  But the problem remains that ecosystem management is still just \nloosely defined. And of course, the devil is always in the detail. Last \nyear, Senator Hatfield introduced legislation that I cosponsored to \ndefine the concept of ecosystem management more clearly. The goal is to \narrive at a set of principles or standards that can guide long-term \nresource management decisions.\n  I believe this is still the proper course of action. Until we have a \nclear goal in sight, it is not necessarily wise to proceed quickly with \nrifle-shot solutions to short- or intermediate-term problems that may \nnot repeat themselves. So I encourage my colleagues, and people from \nthe region, to consider some of the threshold questions that remain \nunanswered.\n  Mr. President, there are other issues that I have not touched on but \nwhich I hope can be discussed in the context of forest health. Again, I \ncommend the Senator from Idaho for his work. I hope to work with him \nand other Senators from the region in a bipartisan way to come up with \nsolutions that work for the people.\n           federal lands act forest health amendments of 1995\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Americans rely on the national forests \nfor a wide variety of activities, ranging from timber harvesting to \nrecreation and \n[[Page S2355]]  the conservation of wildlife. It is incumbent upon us \nto maintain those forests in the healthiest condition possible.\n  Unfortunately, throughout the country, and particularly in the inter-\nmountain west, forests are in poor shape. Persistent drought, disease, \nand insect infestation have created stands of dead and dying trees that \npose a serious risk of fire. The forest fires that last summer burned \nthousands of acres of forest throughout the West and claimed the lives \nof men and women of the Forest Service provide bleak evidence of the \nproblem. If we are to manage national forest ecosystems in ways that \nprovide the services that Americans have come to expect, supply them in \na sustainable manner and support the diversity of habitat needed to \nmaintain fish and wildlife, then we must confront the forest health \nissue squarely.\n  Senator Craig will soon introduce the Federal Lands Act Health \nAmendments of 1995, which is intended to establish a more deliberate \nand timely process for dealing with forest health problems. I commend \nSenator Craig for focusing attention on forest health and look forward \nto continuing our collaborative effort on this issue and on the broader \nissue of ecosystem management. As a result of the Craig bill and the \nforthcoming discussions that it will generate, I expect Congress to \ndevelop a reasonable and effective response to this problem.\n  Over the last 2 years, as chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Agricultural Research, Conservation, Forestry, and \nGeneral Legislation, Senator Craig and I held hearings on the \nmanagement of the Federal lands. The subcommittee held two hearings on \necosystem management, a third on the new appeal process, and a fourth \non the issue of forest health.\n  From those hearings, and through my experiences in working with \nwildlife managers, members of the timber industry and \nenvironmentalists, it has become clear that federally managed forests \nin some areas of the country suffer from problems related to drought, \npast mismanagement, and insect infestation and disease. The high \nincidence of tree mortality and fires in some national forests suggest \nthat we still have much to learn about the causes of these problems and \nhow to manage these complex systems.\n  The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management should place a \nhigher priority on dealing with forest health problems before they \nbecome worse. To do so effectively, several important steps should be \nundertaken.\n  First, forest health problems need to be better defined. We must \ndevelop a shared vocabulary so that all those interested in maintaining \nhealthy forests can work together in common cause.\n  Second, scientific research should be conducted to identify problems \nand evaluate options. Only by relying on sound scientific data can we \nhope to proceed in an effective and defensible manner.\n  Third, and perhaps most importantly, we must set priorities. We must \nfocus our attention on areas of greatest need, while ensuring that \nother issues are managed to prevent future problems.\n  And fourth, solutions must be developed and implemented in a timely \nmanner.\n  Again, I appreciate Senator Craig's foresight and diligence in \nbringing to the attention of Congress the issue of forest health. This \nis a complicated issue that involves important objectives such as \nmaintaining species habitat, ensuring that insect infestations and \ndiseases are within a natural and healthy range, preventing soil \nerosion, and safeguarding the overall long-term sustainability of \nforest ecosystems.\n  The bill to be introduced by Senator Craig provides a valuable \nframework for addressing these critical issues. It will force Federal \nagencies to identify lands at risk and take concrete steps to improve \nforest health on those lands. In the long-run, the public should \nbenefit by management activities taken as a result of this bill.\n  Senator Craig has expressed a desire to move this legislation through \nthe necessary committees as expeditiously as possible. I support this \ngoal, and look forward to participating in Agriculture Committee \nhearings on the bill. Concern has been raised that the legislation as \ncurrently written may provide overly broad discretion to the Federal \nagencies and that it may in some cases overburden those agencies with \nnew responsibilities at a time when budget cuts hinder their ability to \naccomplish existing responsibilities. These issues merit further \nattention. Also, it is my hope that the Senate will examine the \nquestion of whether the bill assures sufficient opportunity for \ndeliberation and analysis by the agencies and input by the public.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Craig to examine these \nquestions and to move this bill through the appropriate committees and \nto the floor this year, so that we can begin to address forest health \nin a systematic, deliberate, thorough, and effective manner.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2351-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2355-S2357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REID AMENDMENT TO THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment to the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that has \nbeen offered by the senior Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, and \nothers of us. The purpose of the amendment is to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund from being looted as part of an effort to balance \nthe budget.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important for people to ask when we are \nconsidering a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution: What \nbudget is being balanced? That is what this first chart asks. What \nbudget is being balanced?\n  In order to answer that question, I think it is helpful to go to the \nactual language of the balanced budget amendment that is before us. And \nif you look at the language, it says very clearly:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United \n     States Government except those derived from borrowing. Total \n     outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n\n  So, Mr. President, it is very clear that what we are dealing with \nwith respect to the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is \nthat all of the moneys coming into Federal coffers are being \njackpotted. They are all being put in the same pot. Whether they are \ntrust funds or not trust funds, it is all being put in the same pot. \nAnd then we are going to look at those total receipts and compare it to \ntotal outlays.\n  I prepared this chart. This is kind of the teapot of the Federal \nGovernment budget. It shows the revenue that goes into the pot, and the \nrevenues are the individual income taxes that are raised. That provides \nabout 45 percent of the revenue of the Federal Government. All social \ninsurance taxes go into this pot, including the revenue that is taken \nout of people's paychecks every month that is supposed to be for Social \nSecurity. All of that money is going into the pot. Social insurance \ntaxes are about 37 percent of the revenue of the Federal Government. \nCorporate income taxes go into the pot. That is about 10 percent of the \nrevenue of our Government. All other taxes are 8 percent.\n  And then we look on the other end of the ledger. We look at what \ncomes out of the spending spout of the Federal Government. And here is \nthe spending breakdown. About 22 percent of the outlays of the Federal \nGovernment go for Social Security, 16 percent is interest on the debt, \n16 percent for defense, 14 percent for Medicare, 7 percent for \nMedicaid, and other, 25 percent.\n  So one can see in the balanced budget amendment that is before us \nwhat goes into the pot is all of the revenue and what goes out the \nspending spout are all of the outlays.\n  The problem with this balanced budget amendment is that in using all \nof the Social Security income in counting whether or not you are \nbalancing the budget, Social Security is not contributing to the \ndeficit. Social Security is in surplus. And Social Security is in \nsurplus for a reason. The reason is to prepare for the time when the \nbaby boom generation retires. Because then these Social Security \nsurpluses are going to turn to massive deficits. And \n[[Page S2356]]  so the reason for accumulating surpluses is to prepare \nfor the time when the baby boomers retire.\n  The problem is, the money is not being saved. The problem is, under \nthe balanced budget amendment that is before us, we are going to put \ninto the Constitution of the United States that those Social Security \nsurpluses, instead of being saved, will be looted in order to give us a \nbalanced budget or contribute to balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows, just over the 7 years that the \nbalanced budget amendment is to lead us to a balanced budget, how much \nof the Social Security surplus will be taken each and every year.\n  This is the amount of Social Security trust fund money that will be \nlooted in order to balance the budget.\n  In 1996, $73 billion of Social Security surplus will be taken. We can \nsee each and every year those surpluses are mounting. They are \nincreasing. Under the terms of the balanced budget amendment that is \nbefore this body today, unless it is altered by the Reid amendment, \nevery one of these dollars is going to be taken. Every one of these \ndollars will be looted in order to contribute to balancing the budget. \nThat is profoundly wrong, Mr. President.\n  We can see, as I said, $73 billion of surplus from Social Security in \n1996, $78 billion in 1997, $84 billion in 1998, $90 billion in 1999, \n$96 billion surplus in the year 2000, $104 billion of Social Security \nsurplus in the year 2001, and $111 billion of surplus in the year 2002.\n  Every nickel of that surplus taken, not to have a fund that is \navailable when the baby boomers retire; but no, every penny taken in \norder to contribute to balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that if any chief executive in this \ncountry stood up before his board of directors and announced that in \norder to balance the operating budget of the company, he was intending \nto loot the retirement funds that were held in trust for his employees, \nhe would be headed for a Federal facility, and it would not be the \nCongress of the United States.\n  I said the other day that this amendment, as drafted, the balanced \nbudget amendment before Members, as drafted, would make the Rev. Jim \nBakker proud. Remember Rev. Jim Bakker? He went to a Federal facility, \nthe Federal prison. He went to Federal prison for fraud. The fraud he \nwas conducting was to raise money for one purpose and to use it for \nanother. That is precisely what is being contemplated in the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution that is before Members today. That \nis fraud. It is fraudulent to tell people you are raising money for one \nreason, namely, to build a trust fund surplus that is available for \nthem when they retire, but on the other hand not to create the surplus \nat all but to loot the fund and to use it for other spending.\n  We would be putting in the Constitution of the United States that \nthat is what would be done. Mr. President, that is so profoundly wrong \nI cannot even fathom how those who have written this amendment think it \nought to be included.\n  There is not any financial institution in this country that would \naccept for one moment the notion that we should take trust fund moneys \nand use them to balance an operating budget.\n  Mr. President, I showed the surpluses, $636 billion, that are \ncontemplated under the balanced budget amendment that is before Members \ntoday to be used to help balance the budget over the next 7 years. That \nis a small part of the story. That is just the next 7 years. The real \nlarceny, the real theft, the real fraud, is far in excess of $636 \nbillion. That is just what will be taken in the next 7 years.\n  We know Social Security is going to be running surpluses for much \nlonger than the next 7 years. In fact, it will be running surpluses out \npast the year 2020. When we look at the projected size of the Social \nSecurity trust funds out until the time the baby boomers have retired \nand start to draw down those surpluses, what one sees is simply \nstaggering.\n  These bars on this chart show the Social Security surplus as it \naccumulates. It shows by the year 2000, there will be almost $1 \ntrillion of surplus. By the year 2010, $2.1 trillion--not million, not \nbillion--trillion. This is real money, 2.1 trillion of surplus; $2.8 \ntrillion by 2015; $3 trillion of surplus by the year 2020.\n  Mr. President, when the baby boomers go to the cupboard to get their \nsurplus, their retirement, they will find the money is all gone. It has \nall been used. It has all been looted to help balance the rest of the \nbudget of the United States.\n  This will create a financial catastrophe for the future. That \nfinancial catastrophe will be when the baby boomers retire. Having been \nmade a promise, they will find no one can keep the promise, because in \norder to pay back this money, the tax increases would have to be so \ndraconian, or the cuts in benefits so draconian, that the people of the \nUnited States would simply revolt.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows what has happened in terms of the \ngrowth of payroll taxes both for Social Security and Medicare from 1940 \nout until the present. What one can see is that these regressive taxes \nhave been increased very dramatically over this period of time in order \nto make these funds supposedly add up.\n  The problem again, of course, is that these increases, these \nincreased taxes that have been levied on the American people, have been \nused. And they have been used to balance other parts of the Federal \nbudget. Or at least to reduce the deficit of other parts of the Federal \nbudget.\n  One reason that this is profoundly unfair is because, in essence, \nwhat has happened is people are being taxed on their payroll, on the \namount of their wage earnings, and they are having an increasing amount \ntaken out. They are being told, ``We are taking this increasing amount \nbecause we have to run a surplus; we have to get ready for the time \nwhen those of you who are in the baby boom generation retire.'' That \nmakes sense.\n  Unfortunately, what we say and what we do are two completely \ndifferent things. We are not running surpluses in order to prepare for \nthe time when the baby boomers retire. Instead, we are taking that \nmoney, we are taking those surpluses, and we are using it to offset \nother spending. So, in effect, what we are doing is levying a \nregressive payroll tax and using part of it, the part that makes up the \nsurplus, to fund the other operations of Government.\n  In fact, 73 percent of all taxpayers today are paying more in payroll \ntaxes than they are paying in income taxes. I think this may come as a \nshock to many people. It is true: 73 percent of all taxpayers are \npaying more Social Security payroll taxes than they are paying in \nincome taxes. They are doing it because we have told them the money is \nneeded to create surpluses to prepare for the time when the baby \nboomers retire. The fact is that that is not what we are doing. We are \ntaking the Social Security surpluses, we are looting them, in order to \nreduce the deficit.\n  Now we have a proposal before Members in the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution of the United States, the organic law of \nthis country, that would take this practice and enshrine it in the \nConstitution of our country. I cannot think of anything more \ninappropriate than to put into the Constitution of the United States \nthat we are going to take trust fund surpluses and use them to help \nbalance the operating budget of this country.\n  Mr. President, I come from a financial background. If anyone, as I \nwas being schooled and taught how to properly manage finances, had told \nme, ``You take trust fund money and you use that to balance other parts \nof a budget,'' that person would have been run out of the financial \ninstitution because everyone understands that that is absolutely \ninappropriate.\n  For Members to put into the Constitution of the United States that we \nwill take trust fund surpluses and use them to balance the other parts \nof the budget is profoundly wrong. That is the reason the Reid \namendment is so important, because it gives Members the chance to \nprotect Social Security trust funds from being looted for other \npurposes.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of anything more basic than this \nconcept. I do not know of anything that is more important when we are \nconsidering a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution than to \nmake certain the trust fund moneys, Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses, are not looted in \n[[Page S2357]]  order to balance other parts of the budget.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just conclude by thanking my colleague, \nSenator Reid from Nevada, for offering this amendment. There are others \nof us who have joined with him in offering this amendment, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for yielding \nthis time. What is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business under the current order is \nuntil 10:45.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2355-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              FOREST HEALTH PROTECTION AND RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Forest \nHealth Protection and Restoration Act, to be introduced by Senator \nCraig, myself, and others. This is a bill that is very important to my \nState of Montana and whose time has come. Forest health and management \nis paramount to the economic stability and future of Montana and, of \ncourse, our neighbors who depend on these renewable resources which \nsupport our smaller communities in Idaho and Montana.\n  For too long, the various land managing agencies in the Federal \nGovernment have been telling us that there is not a problem with the \nhealth and vitality of our national forests and Federal lands. On \nJanuary 20, I had a report placed in the Congressional Record regarding \nthis very topic. It appears that the Forest Service had requested a \nreport on the state of the health of western forests, and after review \ndecided that the report did not meet the standards that they had \ndesired, changing the report before its publication could reach \nCongress and the public. It is the intent of this legislation to make \nthe Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and all \norganizations more responsive to the oversight of Congress. I do not \nthink that was the intent of the legislation. I am sure it was not.\n  This act, the Forest Health Protection and Restoration Act, \nrecognizes the removal of the problems that crept into our forests as \nessential to the future of our Federal lands. This act acknowledges the \nplain and simple truth that overgrowth in our forests is a problem that \nmust be faced in our lifetime. The removal of old and heavy undergrowth \nis essential to sustaining and developing a healthy forest for the \nfuture. The purpose of this legislation is to provide for the future \nthrough proper management and the authority to adapt a flexible \ndecisionmaking process to our Federal lands for forest health.\n  We looked at our forests in the northern part of Idaho and the \nnorthwestern corner of Montana and advised the Forest Service and land \nmanagers years ago that if we did not do something with the biomass \nthat was created by some dead and dying trees--we had a moth up there \nthat killed a lot of trees--if those diseased trees could not be \nremoved from our Federal lands, all we need is a dry year and a high \nlighting year, and we are going to experience the biggest fire season \nthat we have ever had.\n  I am here to tell the American people, last summer we had that fire \nseason. There were millions and millions of dollars in fire suppression \nspent, lives were lost and there was an estimate that there was enough \ntimber lost to build thousands and thousands of homes in this great \ncountry, of which we still have a housing shortage.\n  I joined in sponsorship of this measure so that the citizens of \nMontana can have an opportunity to address their future. This bill when \nenacted will provide this chance. No longer will Montanans be at the \nmercy of the actions and whims of people many miles away, with no \nvested interest in the forests, lands that they tie up with numerous \nnuisance lawsuits. Under the powers granted within this measure, we \nwill provide safety to those people under emergency designations that \nwill allow forest management the ability to open, for health reasons,\n forests to treatments. This legislation will expedite the manner in \nwhich resource managers will be allowed to assist in therapy for the \nforests, which for years, have been left to their own devices, namely \nfire and disease, for treatment.\n\n  Last summer I saw in Montana the results laying in waste and ash, of \nthe disregard that many have for proper forest health. Earlier in the \nyear, during an Appropriations Committee hearing, I warned the \nleadership of the National Forest Service of the pending disaster \nwaiting to occur in the forests of northwestern Montana. A disaster, \nwhich highlighted the occurrences if proper forest health issues were \nnot addressed immediately. During one of the most costly fire seasons \nin history millions of dollars of taxpayer money was expended, and \nmillions of feet of timber, to were lost to the fires that ravaged our \nnational forests last summer. Lives were lost, private property \ndestroyed or damaged; all because we did not address the need to \nmaintain the health of our national forests.\n  We cannot return the forests to what they once were, hundreds of \nyears ago before man set foot among the trees. The time has come when \nwe can no longer allow fires to cure the needs of the forests of this \ncountry. There are many ills that can attack and destroy the trees and \nthe beauty and health of our publicly owned lands. Nature can and will \nwork to care and clean up the messes that we create, either through our \nown ignorance or neglect. The implementation of this legislation will \nprovide us the working tools to begin to look after the future health \nand welfare of our public lands. The work we are seeking to develop \nhere is not to promote the wholesale depletion of the land, but to \nallow the country to use and develop a healthy forest using the \nrenewable resources that are at hand.\n  This piece of legislation is very important to Montana, to the West \nand the Nation. For under this act we can, and will provide for the \nfuture of our national forests and Federal lands. By opening our eyes \nto the problems that lay among our forests we will see a cleaner, more \nvibrant and stable forest than we have for years. I ask my fellow \nSenators to act quickly on this measure and let us repair and \nrehabilitate the great forests of our country.\n  I congratulate my friend from Idaho for his work in drafting this \npiece of legislation because the time has come when we have to look at \nthe way Mother Nature takes care of our forest and the way the forest \nhas to be managed so that those resources can be enjoyed by all of \nAmerica. We cannot afford another 1988, nor can we afford another 1994 \nwhen it comes to saving that great renewable resource that it takes to \nsupply the vast majority of shelter in this country.\n  So I congratulate my friend from Idaho who has introduced this \nlegislation. I hope that it will be considered in the committee very \nquickly and brought to this floor and passed out of the Senate for \nHouse consideration.\n  I would like to see this legislation become law this year because we \nstill have diseased forests that are in danger to, yes, yet another \nyear of drought and maybe disease that should be worked on right now. \nThis is a renewable resource. It is a resource that is America's, and \nwe cannot let it just to be wasted away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2357-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

There is no time controlled.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer words \nof support for the Reid amendment. I intend to vote for it, and I hope \nthe Senate will vote for it in sufficient numbers to add this to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me this morning begin by talking about a woman who \nmany of you know; the story, of course, is legend. On December 1, 1955, \nin an Alabama city, a woman had just finished her work for the day. She \nwas a seamstress. She was about 40 years old. She was tired, her feet \nhurt; she had worked a long day, and she was on the way home.\n  She went back and forth to her job by bus. And on this day, at the \nend of the workday, with tired feet, this woman boarded a bus and took \nthe first available seat. And as the bus traveled down the avenue, the \nbus began to fill up. And on this day, December 1, 1955, as the last \nseat was taken on the bus, a white male passenger boarded the bus and \nlooked at this woman, Rosa Parks, and said, ``You must leave your seat \nand move to the back.''\n  She refused to do so. At that point in the life of this country, she \nwas required to ride in the back of the bus. Her dignity that day, as \nwell as the fact that she had worked a long day and was tired, but her \ndignity especially, persuaded her to say, ``I'm not moving,'' and she \nremained in her seat. Others around her began to curse her, as the \nstory is told. The bus driver stopped and refused to move the bus \nbecause this woman would not move to the back of the bus and give her \nseat to a white passenger.\n  The police were called, and Rosa Parks was arrested and thrown in \njail. Her indiscretion? She refused to give up her seat and refused to \nmove to the back of the bus.\n  Well, it is some 40 years later now, and I guess all of us would say \nwe are proud to understand that the quiet dignity and strength of Rosa \nParks lit a fuse that caused an explosion of understanding and, yes, \ntension--but most especially understanding--that has changed things in \nthis country for the better. The avenue where that bus traveled on that \nDecember day in 1955, and where that arrest was made, is now named Rosa \nParks Avenue.\n  Sometimes one can force change by simply refusing to move. Some say, \n``Well, don't just sit there.'' Rosa Parks just sat there because she \nfelt she was entitled to do that, and that single act by that \ncourageous woman, who will live in our history, has caused substantial \nchange in our country.\n  So when they say, ``Don't just sit there,'' I think sometimes on some \nissues some of us say, ``Well, wait a second; where we sit is \nimportant.''\n  On this issue today of Social Security, some of us believe that where \nwe are in this country, with a program that is, I think, the most \nsignificant and the most remarkable program of its kind anywhere in the \nworld, it is one that ought not be trifled with. It ought not be \nthreatened. It ought not, in our judgment, be in any way changed so \nthat the American people will not have confidence that Social Security \nwill be there when they need it.\n  That is why many of us feel at this point in this debate on the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget we ought not move \nforward on this issue without the Reid amendment. We should add the \nReid amendment to the constitutional balanced budget amendment so that \nwe do not jeopardize the Social Security trust fund.\n  Why is it important to us? Too many Americans do not even understand \nthe consequences of the Social Security system or what makes it unique. \nWe just take it for granted.\n  I told my colleagues before about an experience I had one day that I \nshall never forget. Some years ago, I ran out of gas in a helicopter. I \nquickly learned one of the immutable laws of flying: If you are in the \nair and you run out of fuel, you will land very quickly.\n  I, with a colleague of mine, landed in a helicopter in the jungle \nterrain between Nicaragua and Honduras. Congressman Gejdenson, from \nConnecticut, and I were actually down in a Contra camp, and touring \nrefugee camps in Central America.\n  We were traveling by helicopter one day. It was in August, and there \nwere big thunderstorms. We were over mountains and jungles, and we were \ngoing down mountain passes, and then a big thunderstorm cell would loom \nup in front of us and we would backtrack and go down another valley, \nand we would backtrack again. We had been flying a long while, and the \npilot had some lights go on and some bells go off and we were running \nout of fuel. They had to put the helicopter down, right now. There we \nwere, out of radio contact, somewhere in the mountains and jungles of \nHonduras, right by the Nicaraguan border.\n  We were unhurt, but for a number of hours we did not know where we \nwere. Nor did anyone else. Other Army helicopters eventually searched \nfor us and found us. We were pulled out of there by other helicopters.\n  The point of the story is this. As we sat there on the ground, some \nof the campesino families and others began walking toward us. A group \ngathered to try to figure out who on Earth had come down here in this \nrural stretch, in the mountains of Honduras. We had an interpreter with \nus who spoke fluent Spanish. And as we were there--because no one knew \nwhere we were, we were going to be there for awhile, and we did not \nknow exactly what was going to happen--we began, through the \ninterpreter, to talk with these people who came around to figure out \nwho had come down there. People I talked to--and this is something I \ndiscussed with the interpreter during this conversation--told me \nsomething I had never even thought about before.\n  I was visiting with a young woman, I guess probably 23 or 24 years \nold, who had come walking through the underbrush there with some \nchildren with her. We were just talking through an interpreter. There \nwas kind of a little crowd, maybe six or eight people.\n  I said, ``How many children do you have?''\n  And this very young woman said, I believe, ``Only three. Only \nthree.''\n  I said to the interpreter, ``Gee, she sounds disappointed. Lord, she \ncannot be over 22 or 23 years old, and she sounds disappointed she has \nonly three children.''\n  The interpreter said, ``You do not understand. You come from a \ncountry that has all these things--Social Security. Down here, there is \nnone of that. Down here there is no Social Security program. If you \ngrow old in some of these countries, you want to have had as many \nchildren as you could have, so maybe enough of them will live so when \nyou become old, if you are lucky enough to grow old, you will have some \nchildren surviving you who can help you in your old age. That is Social \nSecurity.''\n  It was the first time I had ever thought about it. I never thought \nabout that before because I grew up in a country where Social Security \nwas just there. It was a part of our lives. We understood: When you \nwork, you pay in. The person who employs you pays in. And when you \nretire, it is \n[[Page S2359]]  there. It is just taken for granted. We do not even \nthink much about the connection. Who made it, who created it, who \ncaused it, how it works--we do not think much about that. It is just \npart of American life.\n  I mention the story today simply because there are other parts of the \nworld where this is a totally foreign notion. That you would have some \nbasic device at the end of your working life that allows you to have a \ndecent retirement is a novel idea in some places. That is what Social \nSecurity is. The Social Security system is the fabric of that \nguarantee.\n  How did we get it? How did we create it? Through a massive public \ndebate, during which many people said: This is socialism, this is pure \nsocialism. This is the worst instincts of the Democratic Party, this \nSocial Security nonsense.\n  Of course, it was not. And it has always been there. It was a useful, \nnecessary, important program for America's elderly that has, I think, \ngrown in the right way. It is now a compact between those who work and \nthose who retire, and it has made life in this country better for tens \nof millions of Americans, year in and year out. We ought to be proud of \nthis program. This program works. This program worked in the past, and \nit will work in the future for this country. We always ought to \nunderstand that.\n  We come to this point in America's history after a couple of hundred \nyears of self-government--and incidentally, a couple of hundred of the \nmost successful years of any similar attempt at government known to \nhumankind. There is no other reasonably similar approach to government \nthat has been tried as successfully as this anywhere in human history.\n  In a couple of hundred years, we have had fights about public policy \nback and forth, and during this time we created some things, one of \nwhich was Social Security. During the last 15 or 20 years or so, this \ncountry's fiscal policy, that is the spending and taxing decisions and \nthe system by which we decide how much to spend and how much to tax, \nhas gotten off track and out of balance. And this country has begun to \nrun up very large budget deficits. The budget deficits are not \naccidental. They are a function of the Congress and the President \nproposing to spend what the people largely want spent, and the Congress \nand the President being reluctant to tax what the people largely don't \nwant taxed. So what has been the result?\n  The result has been that the Congress and the Presidents in about the \nfirst 200 years or so, up until 1980, had spent $900 billion more, over \nall of the years in this country's existence, $900 billion more than it \nhad taken in. In other words, it charged to a charge account $900 \nbillion, because it spent money that it did not have, starting with the \nbeginning of the United States of America to the year 1980.\n  From the year 1980 to the year 1995, in the month of February, this \ncountry added to that charge account. It is not any longer $900 \nbillion. It is now nearly $4.8 trillion. So in nearly 200 years, the \ncountry spent $900 billion it did not have and charged it to future \ngenerations. And then, in 15 years, it added somewhere around $3.9 \ntrillion and said: By the way, charge this, too. Put it on the same \naccount.\n  What do we face in the future? If you look at what the Government \ndoes--Medicare, Medicaid, and a whole series of spending decisions and \nrevenues--and take a look at what the Congressional Budget Office says \nwill be the consequence of the current system and the current spending \nlevels, you will find that we will add, if nothing is done, about $4.4 \ntrillion to the same charge account in the next 10 years. Except it \nwill be more than $4.4 trillion, because we have some in this Chamber \nwho say let us do two additional things. Let us increase defense \nspending and build star wars--which is one of the goofiest ideas I have \never heard in my entire life; that is now resurrected--let us resurrect \nthe strategic defense initiative or star wars at a time when there is \nno Soviet Union. But leaving that aside, increase spending or cut \nrevenue.\n  So it will not be $4.4 trillion added to this charge account, added \nto the already $4.8 or $4.9 trillion, so you are talking close to $10 \ntrillion. It will be more than that. Does anybody think that represents \nthe right future for this country? I do not. Most of the constituents I \nknow do not believe it does.\n  So the question is, What will intervene to change it? Will it be six \npeople of good will finding a vacant room back here with a clean sheet \nof paper and making plans, scurrying around making little plans on how \nto balance the budget? I do not think so. It has not happened in the \npast.\n  It will be people representing what their constituents are saying: \nMake sure you keep these programs, now. We do not want to lose \nprograms. But we do not want to pay taxes, either. We do not want you \nto increase them. In fact, we would like you to cut taxes.\n  So we have the Republican Contract With America saying let us cut \ntaxes. In fact, let us do it a little better; let us cut taxes mostly \nfor the well-to-do. Then we have some Democrats saying, let us also \nhave a middle-income tax cut, slightly less and differently targeted, \nbut the same approach, basically.\n It is the same approach basically.\n\n  In the midst of all of this comes the notion that we should amend the \nU.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget. I did not come here \nthinking that was the necessary thing to do. I think it is pretty hard \nfor us to improve on the work of Washington, Mason, Franklin, \nJefferson, and others. So I did not think we should amend the \nConstitution for the first few years I came to Washington. But I have \nchanged my mind about that. I do not think for a moment that it will \ncause one penny's difference in our future budgets by itself. It is a \nbunch of words that someone is going to write into the Constitution. \nEverybody here who will vote for this understands it will not cause one \npenny's difference in the budget deficit. It may ratchet up slightly \nmore pressure for decision making in both the House and the Senate that \nwill lead we hope toward a balanced budget. That may be what happens. \nIf that happens, then I am for anything that turns up the heat, \nanything that ratchets up the pressure, because frankly, we cannot \ncontinue going down this road.\n  There must be a reconciliation in this country between what we spend \nand who we spend it for, and what this country is willing to pay for. \nYou just cannot keep having Government that we are not willing to \nfinance.\n  I know polls show the American people think half of the money spent \nby the Federal Government is wasted. It is not. This is not money \nsomeone buries in their backyard or puts in a sock under a mattress. \nMost of this money goes out in the form of entitlement programs one way \nor the other or goes to pay for defense. If you take Medicaid, \nMedicare, interest on the national debt, defense, and Social Security, \nyou have three-fourths of every dollar the Federal Government spends. \nSo we have to force a reconciliation of what we spend and what kind of \nresources we have so that we get back some notion of fiscal policy \nbalance to assure this country's economic future.\n  Why is it important to put an amendment in this that says let us not \nraid the Social Security trust funds as we do that? For this simple \nreason: Not one penny of the Federal deficit has been caused by the \nSocial Security system; not one. This year the Federal budget is going \nto have a significant deficit but the Social Security system is going \nto collect nearly $70 billion more than it spends. Why?\n  I was a part of the group that in 1983 wrote the plan that required \nthis surplus. I helped write the Social Security reform plan. We wanted \nto enforce national savings so that when the baby boomers retire after \nthe turn of the century we would have savings accumulated to deal with \nthat. After the folks came home in the Second World War, not \nsurprisingly, I guess, we had the biggest baby crop in the history of \nthis country called the war babies. When that generation begins to \nretire, we will have maximum strain on the Social Security system.\n  The point of the 1983 reform bill was to force some national savings \nto be available for the baby boomers' retirement. If we do not put the \nReid amendment in this constitutional amendment, the potential will \nexist that those who want to balance the budget by using the Social \nSecurity trust fund will simply raid the fund to balance the budget.\n   [[Page S2360]] The problem about that is it breaks the fundamental \npromise, that we take the money from paychecks of the people who work, \nwe put it in a trust fund dedicated for only one purpose. The tax is \ndedicated. The trust fund is dedicated, and that is to pay for the \nSocial Security system. If we have to at some point adjust the Social \nSecurity system, it ought to be adjusted based on the internal \nmechanics of the system. Is it well financed or not? If not, let us \ndeal with it based on the actuarial notion of the system. But let us \nnot decide to raid this enormously successful program, which needs all \nthese savings for the time when the baby boomers retire, and decide to \nuse that money to balance the budget. That breaks the promise it seems \nto me that we have with the American people.\n  Let me mention one other thing because we talk about this always in \nsuch an antiseptic way. It is always policy and numbers. I mean, it \nsounds like it is all sterilized. This is about people. It is about how \npeople live. Every single one of us have constituents who tell us \nstories that bring tears to our eyes as we leave a meeting or leave a \ndiscussion with someone.\n  I once spoke with a woman who is 82 years old, who has diabetes and \nheart trouble, and whose only revenue and only resource in life is the \nSocial Security check she gets. The Social Security check is somewhere \naround $380, I think she told me. Then she has to buy a medicine to \ndeal with her heart problem and her diabetes, pay rent, and buy \ngroceries. She said to me, ``I cannot afford to buy the medicine for my \ndiabetes and the heart trouble.'' So the doctor prescribed it. And she \nsaid, ``I have to take it. So I buy the medicine. Then I cut the pills \nin half and take half as much as he recommends so the medicine will \nlast twice as long. It is the only way I can afford my medicine. \nOtherwise, I cannot eat.''\n  Your heart bleeds for someone who is 82 and finds herself in that \ncircumstance. Think of how important that Social Security check is. It \nis her lifeline. It is the only thing she has. Before Social Security, \npeople like her were just desperately poor, consigned to poorhouses or \nconsigned to begging for food or shelter.\n  The Social Security system, as inadequate as it might be to deal with \nall the problems, is something that is enormously important in this \ncountry. And we must, all of us, make certain that system is protected \nand available with its resources for the future. I have heard dozens of \ntimes people say, ``The Social Security system will not be there when I \nretire.'' They have said that every decade since the 1930's. It has \nbeen there in every decade, and it will be there in every decade in the \nfuture. That is a plain fact.\n  I hope that, as we consider this amendment, we will have an up-or-\ndown vote on the merits of this amendment. I am not asking for five \nreasons someone would want to vote against it. Just give me one good \nreason. There could only be one good reason that one would not want to \nsupport the Reid amendment, and that is because someone does not want \nto use those massive amounts of dollars we are accumulating to be \navailable for the baby boomers. They want to use them for some other \npurpose. That is the reason this is a critically important amendment.\n  I know others want to speak. I have gone on at some length. I hope \nthat we will have an up-or-down vote on this amendment, and I hope \nMembers of the Senate will come to this Chamber and register yes or no. \nThis is not rocket science. This question does not require a great deal \nof understanding to understand the implications.\n  Do you want to use the revenue that is in the Social Security trust \nfunds to balance the budget? Do you want to break the promise? Do you \nwant to raid the trust funds, or do you not? If you do not, then vote \nfor the Reid amendment. If you do, then find devices to try to defeat \nthis thing. But then understand what the purpose of trying to defeat it \nreally is.\n  If you decide you want to keep a promise--and we should in this \ncountry--then let us pass the Reid amendment. Then let us pass this \nConstitutional amendment to balance the budget. I know it is not going \nto balance the budget. It will require more than that. But it if turns \nup the pressure some, I am for it. But let us do it the right way, and \nlet us do it soon.\n  I hope when the vote is complete we will find in a bipartisan way \nMembers who will answer this simple question with a simple answer. No. \nWe do not intend to raid the Social Security trust funds to deal with \nthis budget deficit because it will not be fair, and it will not be the \nright thing to do for this country's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am moved by the eloquence of our colleague from \nNorth Dakota. He is talking about the way in which our elderly were \ntreated prior to the establishment of programs such as Social Security \nand Medicare, programs that gave the elderly dignity and respect.\n  I was born in November 1936. My father was elected to the Florida \nState Senate in November 1936. The reason that he ran in that year was \nin large part because he had the occasion to visit some of the Florida \nState mental hospitals. The term mental hospital was a misnomer for \nthose Florida institutions in the mid-1930's. They were really places \nwhere people put their aged, those who they could not afford to \nmaintain, those who needed special help more than mental health \nconcerns. They were warehoused in our State's mental institutions. The \nwords ``snake pit'' were appropriately applied to those institutions.\n  One of his goals in running for the State Senate was to bring some \ngreater degree of dignity to indigent older Floridians by providing \nthem a somewhat adequate monthly stipend in their old age.\n  That limited effort was then subsumed in the national effort to \ncreate social security, which has, in a period of now almost three \ngenerations, given what had been the poorest group of Americans, older \nAmericans, the ability to live the balance of their lives with some \ndegree of dignity and respect.\n  We should be proud with what we have accomplished since 1935 in terms \nof making that kind of opportunity available for millions of Americans, \nand the prospect of it being available for millions of Americans in the \nfuture.\n  But before turning to the specific issues that I think are raised in \nthis constitutional amendment as it relates to Social Security, I would \nlike to make a few comments on the underlying amendment itself. I have \nin the past spoken and voted in favor of propositions which would \nprovide for a constitutional requirement that there be a balanced \nFederal budget. I shall do so again with the same degree of \ndisappointment that I have done in the past.\n  Passing a constitutional amendment to require us to balance the \nFederal budget is a blatant statement of failure. We are admitting our \ninability, without this type of discipline, without this constitutional \nshackle, to do what we should have done and what, frankly, most \ngenerations of Americans have done, and that is, to exercise fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Up until 1980, the U.S. Government had accumulated a national debt of \nslightly over $900 billion. We fought World War II, World War I, we \nlived through the Great Depression, just to mention three events of \nthis century. We lived through all of these events and accumulated a \nnational debt of $900 billion. Since 1980, we have added to the \nnational debt approximately $4 trillion. We will soon be asked to vote \non a national debt limit that would allow us to exceed the $5 trillion \nlevel in terms of national indebtedness. We have had a free-fall of \nexcess in terms of our national fiscal policy. I wish I could say that \nI saw something on the horizon that indicated we were about to reverse \nthat pattern, and that we would not need a constitutional amendment to \nrequire us to do what our forefathers had been able to do without a \nconstitutional amendment. I am afraid, however, Mr. President, that I \ndo not see any indication that we are about to reverse this policy of \nthe last 15 years.\n  In fact, to the contrary, I see new evidences of irresponsibility. To \nmention one, the Contract With America contains provisions for a series \nof tax \n[[Page S2361]]  reductions; each one of which is popular. Everyone \nwould like to pay less toward the cost of Government. It has, however, \nbeen a pleasant period in the United States, in which Americans have \nexperienced high levels of services, relatively moderate levels of \ntaxation, and a series of tax cuts over the past 15 years, all while \nletting our grandchildren pay the bills. The Contract With America \nwould continue that. It calls for over $700 billion of additional tax \ncuts in the next 10 years; $700 billion would be added to our already \nstaggering estimated deficits for the next 10 years. To me, that is \njust one indication of the fact that we do not have any reason to \nbelieve that we are about to exercise voluntary discipline. Therefore, \nit will be necessary for us to impose upon ourselves and the future of \nAmerica a constitutional requirement to do what we ought to be doing. \nIt is a matter of our generation's responsibility.\n  I believe that there are several important objectives to be \naccomplished by this constitutional amendment. One of those is to \nreestablish the principle of generational responsibility. When I was \nborn, we were not leaving to our future generations massive debts. Our \nparents and grandparents and great-grandparents had paid their own \nbills. They believed in the principle of generational responsibility. \nThat will be reestablished with this constitutional amendment. We will \nalso heighten our sense of accountability, that it is our \nresponsibility to be accountable for how we handle the Nation's fiscal \naffairs.\n  How do these principles, these goals, relate to the issue of how \nSocial Security should be treated in a balanced budget amendment? As \nprevious speakers have so appropriately and eloquently stated, Social \nSecurity is a contract, a contract between the Government of the United \nStates and the people of the United States. It is a very solemn trust \nthat we hold. The lives of millions of Americans are affected very \ndirectly by their belief in our trusteeship and how, in fact, we carry \nout that trusteeship.\n  Giving Social Security special treatment within this constitutional \namendment would be a statement to the American people of our \nunderstanding of that trusteeship.\n  Mr. President, there is also another factor--I apologize if what I am \nabout to say is a little bit tedious and technical, but I think it \nbears repeating--and that is the special financial structure that we \nhave created for Social Security and how that financial structure \nrelates to the issue of the appropriateness of having Social Security \nexcluded, treated separately, for the purposes of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Prior to 1983, Social Security was like most other trust funds in the \nUnited States. It was a pay-as-you-go system. As, for example, with the \nhighway trust fund, dollars are collected each year based on the amount \nthat is paid in gasoline tax. That money goes into a trust fund. Those \ntrust funds are then appropriated to States or to specific \ntransportation projects. There is an in-go and out-go that is balanced \nalmost on an annual basis. That was the way Social Security was treated \nup until 1983.\n  In the years prior to 1983, there was a recognition that Social \nSecurity was facing some very serious financial problems. One of those \nproblems was that the Social Security system was very much the captive \nof the change in the U.S. birthrate. I happen to have been born in \n1936, a period of relatively low births in the United States. Not very \nmany babies were born proportionately during the Depression. Therefore, \nas my generation enters the time when it will become eligible for \nSocial Security benefits, we are not going to impose a very heavy \nburden on the Social Security system. Conversely, when my children, who \nwere born in the 1960's, a time with a relatively high birthrate, enter \nSocial Security, there will be a very heavy demand imposed on the \nsystem. And so the fundamental change made in 1983 was to move Social \nSecurity from a pay-as-you-go system to what is referred to as a \nsurplus system, much like other forms of life insurance or annuities. \nThat is, dollars were to be built up during the period of low demand on \nSocial Security, so that when we reach the point that there would be \nheavy demand, there would be the resources available to pay those \nbenefits.\n  This chart, Mr. President, illustrates how that Social Security \nsurplus system is intended to work. Beginning with this year, 1995, we \nwill have a surplus of something in the range of $70 to $80 billion. We \nhave had a surplus built up since 1983 of approximately $400 billion. \nWe are going to be adding substantially to that amount over the next 20 \nor so years, reaching a peak of having a surplus of approximately $3 \ntrillion.\n  Then, in about the year 2019, we will start a rapid draw-down. In a \nperiod of a decade, we will deplete that $3 trillion of surplus and \nzero out the account to meet the demands of that large group of \nAmericans who will reach retirement age in approximately 2019 forward.\n  Now what is the significance of this structure of Social Security \nfinancing, which represents approximately 25 percent of the \nexpenditures of the Federal Government? What are the implications of \nthis financing structure to the balanced budget amendment?\n  I describe the implication as being the mask and then the hammer. \nFrom now until the year 2019, because the way our deficit is reported, \nwhere annual surpluses constitute a subtraction from our stated \ndeficit, the surpluses will mask the Federal deficit.\n  We talk about the deficit in the current budget as submitted by the \nPresident as being approximately $190 billion. That is not totally \ncorrect. Actually, the deficit for the Federal Government in 1995-96 \nwill be $190 billion plus $80 billion, the Social Security surplus. \nBecause the way we report under our accounting system, that $80 billion \nof surplus in the Social Security trust fund is subtracted from the \noverall deficit.\n  It would be somewhat like a family which had an income of, let us say \n$40,000, but had expenditures of $50,000. It would appear as if they \nwere running every year $10,000 in the red. But they had a rich uncle \nwho had died and left them a trust fund which each year gave them for \nthe next 10 years $20,000 out of that trust. If they reported in their \naccounting that they made $40,000, spent $50,000, but had $20,000 in \nthe trust fund, it would appear as if they actually had a $10,000 \npositive each year. Of course, the problem is, when the trust fund runs \nout in 10 years, they are going to be back to where they were \ninitially, except probably worse off because they had become accustomed \nto having this $20,000 trust fund.\n  We are somewhat in that same situation. We are masking the real \nextent of our fiscal problem by every year pumping in the novocaine of \na substantial Social Security surplus.\n  And what is the hammer? The hammer is what happens after the year \n2019 when every year we are going to start our Federal accounts with a \ndeficit of, in some years, in the range of $350 to $400 billion.\n  How would you like to be sitting here in the year 2023 with a \nconstitutional amendment that says you have to balance your books every \nyear and you begin the process with a deficit of $350 to $400 billion \nbecause of the enormous outflows from the Social Security trust fund?\n  I believe, Mr. President, that if we write into the Constitution that \nwe must have a budget system that consolidates Social Security, \nrepresenting 25 percent of our expenditures, into all the rest of the \nfinancial activities of the Federal Government, that under this \nstructure, we are going to be leaving our future generations with an \nenormous, impossible task, particularly in these outyears.\n  And let me point out, this is not an aberration. This outline of \nsurpluses and then deficits of Social Security is not a mistake. This \nis the way the system was planned to operate. It mirrors the \ndemographics of the country--relatively low numbers of persons in \nretirement age at the beginning of the 21st century and large numbers \nof persons in retirement age in the second quarter of the 21st century. \nThis is the way the system is supposed to work.\n  When you apply that against the mandate of a balanced budget, if \nSocial Security is consolidated into every other account in the Federal \nGovernment, you will create a fiscal impossibility.\n  Next, if Social Security is on budget, it is going to create a \ntemptation to \n[[Page S2362]]  manipulate Social Security for the purpose of further \nmasking the extent of our financial problems.\n  To use one example. It was only a couple of years ago that there was \nserious discussion in this Chamber of eliminating the cost-of-living \nadjustment for Social Security beneficiaries. I think, wisely, that \nproposal was rejected. But why was it being proposed? It was being \nproposed because, if you eliminated the cost-of-living adjustment, \nwhich amounts to approximately $20 to $30 billion a year in terms of \nSocial Security expenditures, if you eliminated that cost-of-living \nadjustment, you would have artificially made the surplus appear that \nmuch larger.\n  If we did not pay a COLA out in 1995, we would not be talking about a \nsurplus of $80 billion. We would be talking about a surplus of close to \n$100 billion. That would mean that our stated deficit would be $20 \nbillion less.\n  So with that one action, we would have cut the reported Federal \ndeficit, the deficit for purposes of meeting this constitutional \nrequirement, by $20 billion.\n  That is the temptation that we are going to have because it is will \nbe such an easy, disguised way, in which to meet the standard that we \nare setting for ourselves of a balanced Federal budget.\n  Next, I think that the consequence of what I just described--the \ntemptation to use Social Security with this kind of a financing system \nto artificially reduce the stated Federal deficits--the consequence of \nthat is to increasingly shift the cost of other areas of Federal \nresponsibility to the Social Security financing system, which means \nshifting it to one of the most regressive sources of Federal revenue--\nthe payroll tax.\n  The payroll tax is a straight tax on the payroll of most Americans, \nwithout regard to their ability to pay or other considerations. There \nare no deductions, there are no credits, there are no other recognition \nof special circumstances with the payroll tax. And as we give into the \ntemptation to use Social Security as a means of meeting our other \nresponsibilities, we continue to add to the extent by which Government \nis being financed by its most regressive form of revenue.\n  Next, I believe that one of the positive benefits of taking Social \nSecurity out of the general revenue budget of the United States--doing \nas Senator Reid proposes--is that we will have the happy prospect of \nactually running a surplus in terms of our overall Federal condition \nonce we are able to balance our general revenue books. Once we are able \nto get the rest of the Federal Government into a balance situation, \nwith Social Security operating at a surplus, then we will be able to \nbegin to reduce the amount of the national debt which is held by the \ngeneral public.\n  We will begin to get some of those benefits that a positive surplus \nin our fiscal accounts will bring, such as lower interest rates, or \nstable interest rates, the benefits that will come in terms of stronger \neconomic growth.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I believe it is important that we separate \nSocial Security from the general revenue because we have a lot of work \nto do on Social Security. I have outlined briefly what the structure \nis.\n  There is an implicit assumption in that structure; that is, that the \nsurplus funds that we are accumulating, what will eventually amount to \n$3 trillion of surplus, is being invested in an area that will be \navailable for liquidation and used to pay these benefits that are going \nto be due after the year 2019, just as a private pension fund takes the \nmoney that it collects every year from employers and employees, however \nit is structured, and invests it in stocks, bonds, public instruments, \nor private funds so that when people retire there will be some real \nmoney there to pay their pension. The assumption is that something like \nthat has happened with Social Security. Wrong. What is happening with \nthe Social Security surplus is it is being used to finance the very \ndeficits that we are trying to eliminate.\n  One of the benefits of having Social Security and the rest of the \nFederal Government's financial problems separated is it allows the \nSenate to focus attention on dealing with Social Security, making it \nthe kind of solid, predictable, reliable, sustainable source of \neconomic security for older Americans that we have represented it to \nbe.\n  As long as the two are melded together, I think we will be constantly \nunder the microscope of suspicion that we are doing it not to help \nSocial Security but to raid Social Security.\n  We, as good physicians who need to make accurate diagnoses and \nprescriptions for Social Security, need to be in a surgery ward where \nwe are not subject to the attack or criticism or suspicion that we are \nnot doing this out of the desire to raid Social Security, that we \nclearly are doing it for only the purpose of making Social Security \nstrong, healthy, vigorous, and able to carry out its contractual \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is an extremely important issue that we \nare discussing and that it is imperative that we adopt the amendment as \noffered by the Senator from Nevada if we are to carry out our \nresponsibilities not just for today, but particularly for the long \nfuture.\n  We have only amended the U.S. Constitution a few times in our 200-\nplus year history. It is interesting that only one of those amendments, \nonce adopted, was repealed. That was the amendment on prohibition. \nEvery other amendment, once adopted, has stayed in the Constitution and \nstayed in the original form. We are not doing this just for 1996 or \n1997; we are doing this for the years 2096, 2097.\n  What is in the best interest of Americans over that long, indefinite \nfuture? I believe it is in the best interest of Americans to adopt the \ndiscipline of a balanced budget amendment, but to exclude the one-\nfourth of our Federal expenditures that represent Social Security, for \nthe reasons that I have outlined, but particularly for the mask and the \nhammer we are about to leave for future generations if we require, \nconstitutionally, that Social Security be consolidated with the rest of \nthe Federal Government.\n  Let me conclude with a few recommendations. One, if we exclude Social \nSecurity from the consolidated budget, I think that we need to look at \nthe question of whether the year 2002 is still an appropriate year for \na mandated balanced budget. I believe that we should stretch that \nperiod out probably an additional 2 to 4 years, recognizing the fact \nthat we are not going to have the Social Security surpluses as a means \nof offsetting deficits, and that we do not want to create an undue \nshock to our economic system and create the possibility of \nunintentionally putting the United States into a recessionary period.\n  If we do not adopt Senator Reid's amendment, I think we will need to \nthink seriously about going back to the pay-as-you-go approach to \nSocial Security that we had prior to 1983. I do not believe that the \ncurrent system is sustainable within a consolidated Federal budget and \na constitutional mandate that budget be balanced beginning in the year \n2002.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to make these remarks. I \ncommend the Senator from Nevada and also the Senator from California \nand others who have brought this matter so appropriately and so \nvigorously to our attention. It is an extremely important matter. It is \nnot one that needs to be treated as if it can be dealt with by a \ncosmetic or other surface resolution.\n  This is a fundamental issue of our future ability to treat Americans \nwho have relied upon the ``contract with America''--that is, Social \nSecurity--and to be able to give to our future generations a financial \nplan for which they will be able to achieve the objectives, including \nbalancing the general revenue budget of the Federal Government, the \nbenefits of having the surplus from the Social Security fund to be used \nto invigorate our economy rather than to mask our profligate spending, \nand to give Members an environment in which we can do those things \nwhich will be necessary to assure the long-term strength of Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this constitutional balanced budget \namendment is a very big issue. Its impacts are enormous. Its results, \nif passed and enacted, will be large and long remembered.\n         [[Page S2363]] Support for a Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  There are two reasons I want to vote for a balanced budget amendment. \nThe first is my own life experience. I shared this once before and I \nwill do it once again. The year I was born, 61 years ago, the entire \nFederal debt amounted to just $25 billion. When my daughter was born, \nthe entire Federal debt amounted to $225 billion. And 2 years ago, when \nmy granddaughter, Eileen, was born, the entire Federal debt was 150 \ntimes greater than when I was born. It was nearly $4 trillion at that \ntime.\n  So my life experience shows me that with business as usual, the \nCongress is not going to be able to deal with the deficit unless it is \nforced to.\n  The second reason is my Senate experience. In 2 years in the Senate, \nthrough my observation of the budget's authorization and appropriation \nprocesses, I have become convinced that a balanced budget amendment is \nin order. In short, current operating procedures will not, in my view, \nproduce a balanced budget. The amendment, therefore, is necessary to \nface reality and make the difficult decisions.\n  In a nutshell, those are the reasons I want to support a strong \nbalanced budget amendment. But I want to support the right balanced \nbudget amendment. And I have a hard time agreeing with those who have \ndeemed it must have exactly only certain words in it; and only those \nwords.\n  Last year, I supported the Reid balanced budget amendment on Social \nSecurity, as I am today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from California yield for a \nbrief question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure that the Record is \ncomplete and my words are on the Record while the Senator from \nCalifornia is speaking.\n  The Senator has done a remarkably good job keeping this issue before \nthe public. The Senator, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, \nsinglehandedly brought this to the Senate a few weeks ago, where it was \nfully debated in the Judiciary Committee.\n  As a result of the work the Senator has done, my work here, and that \nof those other cosponsors, including the Senator from California, has \nbeen made a lot easier.\n  I wanted to publicly commend and applaud the Senator from California \nfor her yeoman's work in regard to excluding Social Security from the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for those very \ngenerous words. I appreciate them very much.\n  Mr. President, last year I supported both these amendments. In the \nensuing year, I have come to think a lot about it. It is a long time \nbefore ratification, even if a balanced budget amendment is passed. And \nwhen people, beginning with 40 million and then 60 million, then 70 \nmillion, then 80 million Americans on Social Security understand what \nthe impact of this amendment is, it is my very deep belief that it will \nnot be ratified. I view the use of Social Security surplus revenues as \na major flaw in the balanced budget amendment, but it is a flaw that \ncan be corrected by this amendment.\n  In 1990, this very body, by a vote of 98-2, voted to take it off \nbudget. They said:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts \n     and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund shall not be counted as new budget authority, \n     outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of\n       (1) the budget of the United States,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or,\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n\n  This body voted for it 98-2. And in the ensuing days, this body is \ngoing to reverse their opinion. One must ask why? Why are we doing \nthis?\n\n\n                               FICA Taxes\n\n  Let me talk for a moment about FICA taxes and what they are.\n  By the year 2017, $3 trillion of FICA tax reserves meant to pay for \nthe retirements of American workers will be used instead to balance the \nbudget. This is unconscionable.\n  If Congress is going to use FICA taxes that are meant for retirements \nfor another purpose other than retirements, we should cut the FICA tax \nto eliminate the surplus so people do not see their FICA taxes misused.\n  FICA taxes were raised in 1977 and 1983 so the Social Security system \nwould run surpluses. It was changed at that point from a pay-as-you-go \nsystem to a system that would bank surpluses for the future.\n  Why was that done? It was done because the actuarial tables showed \nthere was going to be a major baby boomer generation retiring in the \nnot to distant future and the revenues, as projected, would not be \nadequate to meet their retirements. Therefore, it was thought by this \nesteemed body that we should increase retirement taxes so that moneys \ncould accrue and there would, therefore, be enough money to meet the \nretirement needs of the baby boomer generation.\n  What has changed is we found that even without this amendment, \ndownstream, after the year 2018, the Social Security system will run \ninto trouble. There still will not be enough money. But, if these \ndollars are used to balance the budget, the system is going to run into \ntrouble much more rapidly. By 2002 nearly $1 trillion will be used and \nby 2017, nearly $3 trillion if we don't start saving these Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n  There are those who say, ``That's OK, we'll use the revenues. It will \nforce us to make necessary changes in the system.'' I agree we have to \nmake some changes in the system. If you raise FICA tax, if you means \ntest it, whatever you do with it, some changes are going to happen.\n  But to use the reserves to fund health, to use FICA taxes to fund the \nInterior Department, the Agriculture Department, defense, and interest \non the debt and other Government programs, is just plain wrong.\n  Over 58 percent of working Americans today pay more in FICA taxes if \nyou put in the employer share than they do in Federal taxes. This is \nnot a small amount. This tax is not adjusted by salary. Everyone pays a \nflat tax of 6.2 percent up to $61,200 of income and the employer \nmatches it with 6.2 percent. For a worker who makes $25,000, his share \nis $1,550. Combined with the employer tax, it is $3,100. For a worker \nwho makes $35,000, when you combine it with the employer's share, it is \n$4,340. Go up another $10,000 to $45,000 and combine it, it is $5,580. \nGo up another $10,000 to $55,000 and combine it and it begins to grow, \nit is $6,000 a year. And for every worker who makes more than $61,200, \ncombined it is $7,588.\n  That is a lot of money at any income level. If it is being saved for \nretirement, then it is like an annuity: That's fine. You pay in funds \nand you get them out when you retire. But if it is being spent on \nGovernment, then it is just another expensive tax on working Americans, \nand then we ought to do the right thing and reduce the FICA tax if we \nare going to do this.\n\n\n                       Social Security Amendment\n\n  The debate over this amendment to exclude Social Security from the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment is not complicated. It is very \nsimple. The issue is: Does Congress want to take the funds generated by \nthe FICA tax for Social Security, meant for a worker's future \nretirement, and use it to balance the budget? Or does Congress want to \nbalance the budget honestly?\n  I hope that whatever else our disagreements are, we can all agree \nthat Social Security revenues from the FICA tax should not be misused \nto balance the budget.\n  My problem with this constitutional amendment is that by including \nSocial Security in the amendment, it does not only permit the use of \nthe Social Security trust funds to balance the budget, but it mandates \nit by including those funds in the budget calculations. The amendment \nbefore us, in effect, enshrines the use of Social Security to balance \nthe budget in the Constitution of the United States. Do we really want \nto do that? I think not.\n  So the debate really is not over who wants to protect Social Security \nand who does not. It is about who wants to be honest with the American \npeople in our budgeting and our fiscal policy and who does not. Because \nto be honest, Social Security should remain off budget.\n  Ninety-eight Members of this very body voted to do that in 1990. \nIncluding it in the budget would be an enormous loophole. It is not the \nFederal Government's money, and it should not be used as if it were.\n                        [[Page S2364]] Rebuttals\n\n  Let me respond to four arguments raised against this Social Security \namendment.\n\n\n                               Charge One\n\n  Excluding Social Security would make it harder to balance the budget.\n  That is true. Taking Social Security off budget does require more \nspending cuts, about $3 trillion of them by the year 2017, because all \nof this money will be used to balance the budget. But the alternative \nof leaving it on budget is basically stealing from Social Security to \navoid spending cuts.\n  There is nothing magical, as the distinguished Senator from Florida \npointed out, about the year 2002. Somebody just sat down and decided we \nhave to do this by the year 2002. The Sun is not going to refuse to \ncome up in the year 2003 or 2004 or 2005 or 2006 or 2007. If people are \nreally concerned that we need to use Social Security revenues or you \ncannot balance the budget, then it is simple: Extend the time line out \nto 2005 or 2007 rather than loot Social Security.\n  If a man runs short on money one month, the law does not allow him to \nsteal from his neighbor to make ends meet. But this amendment allows \nthe Federal Government to steal from Social Security to meet its \nobligations. How is that right?\n\n\n                               Charge Two\n\n  It is unprecedented to put a statute in the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  I have heard that mentioned time and time again on this very floor.\n  Now, of course, it is true, it is unprecedented. It is also true that \nit is unprecedented to put the Nation's fiscal policy into the \nConstitution. And if we decide that this Nation needs the strong \nmedicine of a balanced budget amendment, then we better be sure that \nthe amendment is drawn deeply enough and widely enough to represent \nsome of these concerns.\n  The legislation before you is narrowly drawn, and it specifies that \nonly those funds used to provide old age and survivors and disabilities \nbenefits are involved. So it is not a loophole.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, whom I deeply \nrespect, has said, well, a game will be played if we put the words \nSocial Security in the Constitution. Education moneys will be called \nSocial Security moneys. The amendment is drafted to be specific, to \nprevent this from happening, and it does.\n  Now, Chairman Hatch has also said that no one wants to use Social \nSecurity revenues to balance the budget, and we could protect them in \nimplementation legislation or by some other resolution.\n  I initially thought, well, maybe that is a great idea. If we can do \nit that way, why not do it. And so we asked the Congressional Research \nService, if that could be done.\n  I wish to read the reply I received. This is what it says:\n\n       If the proposed amendment was ratified, then Congress would \n     appear to be without the authority to exclude the Social \n     Security trust funds from the calculations of total receipts \n     and outlays under section 1 of the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the communication from \nthe American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service be \nprinted in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.\n     To: Senator Dianne Feinstein (Attention: Mark Kadesh).\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Whether the Social Security trust funds can be \n         excluded from the calculations required by the proposed \n         balanced budget amendment.\n\n       This is to respond to your request to evaluate whether \n     Congress could by statute or resolution provide that certain \n     outlays or receipts would not be included within the term \n     ``total outlays and receipts'' as used in the proposed \n     Balance Budget Amendment. Specifically, you requested an \n     analysis as to whether the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund could be exempted from the calculation necessary \n     to determine compliance with the constitutional amendment \n     proposed in H.J. Res. 1, which provides that total \n     expenditures will not exceed total outlays.\\1\\\n       Section 1 of H.J. Res. 1, as placed on the Senate Calendar, \n     provides that total outlays for any fiscal year will not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless authorized \n     by three-fifths of the whole number of each House of \n     Congress. The resolution also states that total receipts \n     shall include all receipts of the United States Government \n     except those derived from borrowing, and that total outlays \n     shall include all outlays of the United States Government \n     except for those used for repayment of debt principal. These \n     requirements can be waived during periods of war or serious \n     threats to national security.\n       Under the proposed language, it would appear that the \n     receipts received by the United States which go to the \n     Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the \n     Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund would be included in \n     the calculations of total receipts, and that payments from \n     those funds would similarly be considered in the calculation \n     of total outlays. This is confirmed by the House Report \n     issued with H.J. Res. 1.\\2\\ Thus, if the proposed amendment \n     was ratified, then Congress would appear to be without the \n     authority to exclude the Social Security Trust Funds from the \n     calculations of total receipts and outlays under section 1 of \n     the amendment.\\3\\\n    \n    \n                                                Kenneth R.

The limit on the debt of the United States held by \n     the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n     Section 3.

Although Social Security \n     accounts are running a surplus at this time, the situation is \n     expected to change in the future with a Social Security \n     related deficit developing. If we exclude Social Security \n     from balanced budget computations, Congress will not have to \n     make adjustments elsewhere in the budget to compensate for \n     this projected deficit * * *. Id. at 11.\n     It should also be noted that an amendment by Representative \n     Frank to exempt the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     from total receipts and total outlays was defeated in \n     committee by a 16-19 rollcall vote. Id. at 14. A similar \n     amendment by Representative Conyers was defeated in the \n     House, 141 Cong. Rec. H741 (daily ed. January 23, 1995), as \n     was an amendment by Representative Wise. Id. at H731.\n     \\3\\Although the Congress is given the authority to implement \n     this article by appropriate legislation, there is no \n     indication that the Congress would have the authority to pass \n     legislation which conflicts with the provisions of the \n     amendment.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This means then that Congress does not have the \noption of later excluding Social Security in implementation language. \nWe simply do not have it. Therefore, unless Congress enacts this \namendment, Social Security funds will be used to balance the budget.\n  No other way around it. No talk is going to change it. No pounding \nthe breast is going to change it. No vows taken with blood or wine or \nanything else is going to change it. It will be enshrined in the \nConstitution of the United States and $3 trillion of money paid in FICA \ntaxes by young people in this country, working men and women, will be \nused to pay for agriculture, to pay for HUD, to pay for education, to \npay for this highway project or that highway project.\n  I believe that is violative of a public trust, and I believe that \nwhat this amendment is all about should not be to gut Social Security, \nand that is exactly what we would be doing, if we don't exclude Social \nSecurity.\n  So we have taken care of that argument. Congress does not have the \noption of later excluding Social Security in implementation language.\n  It is very clear. A vote for a balanced budget amendment that does \nnot have this amendment in it is clearly a vote that puts Social \nSecurity on budget and takes its surplus. Let there be no doubt about \nit.\n                      [[Page S2365]] Charge Three\n\n  Exempting Social Security could create a Social Security deficit.\n  Actually, the exact opposite is true. Excluding Social Security from \nthe balanced budget amendment protects it while including it in the \nbalanced budget amendment guts it. If you put Social Security in the \nbudget, it is not to protect it. It is to use its revenues and thus \nincrease its insolvency.\n  In 60 years of Social Security history, the trust funds have never \nrun a deficit. They cannot. If trust funds run out of money, benefits \ncannot be paid. It is that simple and straightforward.\n\n\n                              Charge Four\n\n  Excluding Social Security would allow the Government to gamble with \nSocial Security funds.\n  According to the Republican policy committee report, and I quote,\n\n       Congress might stop using Social Security surpluses to buy \n     Government securities and let the Social Security trustees \n     try their hand in the private market. They could start \n     gambling with trust fund reserves by acquiring industries, \n     buying up real estate, taking a chance on cattle futures or \n     speculating on foreign currencies.\n\n  Mr. President, to that I say nonsense. To that I say baloney. That is \npure flimflam. Social Security is off budget today, and the trust funds \nare not allowed to be invested anywhere except U.S. Treasury bonds. And \nthey are the safest investment in the world. If they go, our Government \ngoes.\n  Social Security has never been allowed, nor will it ever be allowed \nunder this amendment, to use trust fund reserves to buy up real estate \nor cattle futures or to speculate on foreign currencies. This charge is \npure obfuscation. It is pure fantasy.\n  Under this amendment, Social Security would still be required to \ninvest in U.S. Treasury bonds, and there is nearly $5 trillion today of \nFederal governmental debt. The U.S. Treasury will continue to issue \nbonds and Social Security will continue to purchase those bonds.\n  The biggest difference between the practice today and the practice if \nthe balanced budget amendment excluding Social Security is adopted is \nthat when the constitutional amendment takes effect, the U.S. deficit \nwill actually shrink--shrink--for nearly the next two decades, not \ngrow.\n  And to my mind that is fiscally prudent. As the debt shrinks, \ninterest rates drop. This means businesses can expand and hire new \nworkers, Americans can afford new homes and pay for college for their \nchildren. Shrinking the debt is the right objective, and that will \nhappen under this amendment for the next two decades.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion. I have listened to all the arguments \nabout what is wrong with our amendment to exclude Social Security, but \nthey all boil down to one thing: Members of Congress simply want to use \nthe money to balance the budget.\n  That is not a real argument. That is a failure to deal truthfully \nwith the American people. To loot Social Security is morally wrong and \nI cannot support it.\n  I want to support, as I said before, a balanced budget amendment and \nI am prepared to do so if Social Security is excluded. Rather than \nargue about this amendment, my colleagues who support a constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment as I do, why not do the right thing and \naccept this amendment to exclude Social Security? Then we can move \nforward in a bipartisan way and get this country back on the right \ntrack again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as I have heard my friend from Florida and \nthe Senator from California make their arguments on this balanced \nbudget amendment, if there is ever an argument that they have made that \nhas been powerful it is this one, but it is an argument why we should \nhave a balanced budget amendment so these trust funds can stay viable, \nso we can live up to our obligations. It was a wonderful argument for \nthem. And I do not think we should lose the spirit of just exactly why \nwe have to have it.\n  If we go far back in our history to the ratifying of our Constitution \nand read the argument that was made then, when we formed this country, \nthere was a very deep concern from the Framers of this Constitution \nabout our ability to create national debt. I think it was Thomas \nJefferson himself who made the statement that still was one of his \nconcerns when the Constitution was ratified. I know it was a concern of \nthe first President of this United States, George Washington.\n  If we read our history, those concerns have lasted as long as our \nConstitution has lasted. So the argument they make is a very persuasive \none for, and a good reason why we need, a balanced budget amendment at \nthis time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, opponents of House Joint Resolution 1, the \nbalanced budget amendment, are expected to support an amendment \nunsuccessfully offered in the Judiciary Committee by Senator Dianne \nFeinstein to specifically exclude Social Security from the calculations \nused to determine if the Federal Government's budget is in balance. A \nslightly modified version of this amendment has been introduced on the \nfloor by Senator Harry Reid.\n  The consequence of its passage would be cataclysmic for millions of \nmiddle-class Americans who are counting on Social Security to \nsupplement their retirement income in the future. At best, the Reid \namendment is a jobs program for constitutional lawyers who would keep \nthe matter tied up in the courts for years, if not decades.\n  The Reid amendment is just the sort of protection today's senior and \ntomorrow's retirees don't need. By requiring the Government to ignore \nSocial Security receipts and expenditures in balancing its books, the \nReid amendment would threaten the future of a program on which tens of \nmillions of Americans rely.\n\n\n                       how social security works\n\n  Consider how the Government collects payroll or Federal Insurance \nContribution Act [FICA] taxes and pays Social Security benefits. Social \nSecurity payroll taxes--like Federal income, corporate, and excise \ntaxes--are collected by the U.S. Treasury. Unlike other Treasury \nreceipts, however, FICA revenues are used to back monthly Social \nSecurity checks. The House Ways and Means Committee's Overview of \nEntitlement Programs [the ``Green Book''] describes the transaction \nthis way:\n\n       The trust funds are given IOUs when [FICA] taxes are \n     received by the Treasury, and those IOUs are taken back when \n     the Treasury makes expenditures on the program's behalf. This \n     handling of [Social Security] finances goes back to the \n     inception of the program and has not been altered by the \n     inclusion or exclusion of the [Social Security] trust funds \n     in or from the federal budget. [1994 Overview of Entitlement \n     Programs, p. 91]\n\n  Throughout most of the program's history, the Treasury has collected \nmore in FICA taxes than it has needed to pay Social Security benefits. \nThe trust funds are thus stockpiling IOU's from the Treasury and are \nexpected to do so for nearly two more decades. This year, for example, \nthe Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimates that Social Security \nreceipts will exceed outlays by $69 billion. Over the 5-year period \nfrom 1996-2000, CBO projects that Social Security will take in $421 \nbillion more than it will spend.\n  The Reid amendment would require Congress, when it hammers out annual \nGovernment budgets, to pretend that these billions of dollars simply do \nnot exist. The Treasury would continue to collect hefty payroll taxes \nfrom working Americans, but these revenues could not be counted when \ndetermining whether the Federal budget was in balance.\n\n\n                    what the reid amendment would do\n\n  The Reid amendment, as it was offered in--and tabled by--the \nJudiciary Committee, would add a new sentence at the end of section 7 \nof House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. The Nevada \nSenator's amendment reads:\n\n       The receipts (including attributable interest) and outlays \n     of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and \n     the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund used to provide \n     old age, survivors, and disability benefits shall not be \n     counted as receipts or outlays for purposes of this article.\n\n  In order to bring revenues into line with expenditures under the \nbizarre accounting system necessitated by this amendment, Congress \nwould have to \n[[Page S2366]]  choose from at least four major options, each of which \nwould hurt the economy and imperil the Social Security system.\n\n\n                reid option 1: run government surpluses\n\n  The first option would be for the Federal Government to run annual \nsurpluses--collecting more in taxes than it spends--equal to the value \nof Government securities purchased by the trust funds.\n  This year, for example, the Social Security trust funds will buy $69 \nbillion in Government securities from the Treasury. If a balanced \nbudget amendment with the Reid provision were in effect, the Treasury \nwould have to make believe that it never received this $69 billion. \nThus, Congress would have to raise taxes or cut spending by $69 billion \njust to keep the deficit at its current level--$176 billion, according \nto CBO's most recent estimate. In order to balance the fiscal year 1995 \nbudget under the Reid amendment, the Government would have to eliminate \nthe $176 billion deficit and then come up with an additional $69 \nbillion.\n  The Reid amendment thus would make it harder to achieve a balanced \nFederal budget, unless Congress resorted to one of the other options \ndescribed in this paper. Ironically, many advocates of the Reid \namendment oppose the balanced budget amendment because they believe \nthat it would require tough decisions on cutting Federal\n spending. The balanced budget amendment with the Reid provision could \nactually make these decisions tougher than would an amendment without \nthat provision.\n\n\n      reid option 2: expand the definition of ``social security''\n\n  While Congress is unaccustomed to passing balanced budgets, much less \nrunning surpluses, the Reid amendment would present lawmakers with \nanother option, one with which it is more familiar--spending taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  The Reid amendment would effectively create two Federal budgets: One \nbound by rules of sound fiscal discipline and another in which Congress \ncould spend as it pleased. The former budget would include all non-\nSocial Security programs; the latter, all programs defined as ``Social \nSecurity.''\n  It wouldn't take long before Congress started to redefine its \nfavorite programs as ``Social Security.'' For example, the Supplemental \nSecurity Income Program [SSI], a welfare program for indigent aged, \nblind, and disabled people, is administered by the Social Security \nAdministration, though it is financed by general revenues rather than \nthrough the payroll tax.\n  Spending on SSI has grown rapidly in recent years, and the program \nhas been plagued by scandal. There has been a sizable increase in the \nnumber of alcoholics and drug addicts who qualify for benefits on the \nbasis of their addiction. Critics also say that the steep rise in the \nnumber of children on the SSI rolls is due in large part to the \nmischaracterization of behavioral problems as disabilities. And many \nlegal aliens have begun to collect monthly SSI checks when their \nsponsors--usually family members--withdraw financial support.\n  A balanced budget amendment would force Congress to take a hard look \nat the SSI Program and institute reforms to control costs. But if the \nReid provision were added to the amendment, Congress could take the \neasy way out by using the FICA tax to pay SSI benefits. Other welfare \nprograms--like Medicaid, food stamps, and scores of others--also could \nescape reform by being reclassified as ``Social Security.'' This would \ndrain resources intended for seniors and impair Government's ability to \npay retiree benefits.\n\n\n            reid option 3: create a social security deficit\n\n  The Reid amendment would require only part of the budget to be in \nbalance--non-Social Security spending would have to equal non-Social \nSecurity revenues. But the Reid amendment would permit part of the \nbudget to be wildly out of balance--the part that seniors rely on for \ntheir monthly Social Security checks.\n  Because Congress would be prohibited from counting revenues from FICA \ntaxes as Government receipts in determining whether the budget is \nbalanced, lawmakers could drastically reduce these taxes without \nincreasing the deficit. Increases in income taxes, however, would \nreduce the deficit. Thus, even if revenues from Federal income taxes \nwere\n increased by the same amount that revenues from FICA taxes were \ndecreased, the deficit actually would be reduced under the Reid \namendment's twilight zone accounting.\n\n  The Reid amendment thus would create a perverse incentive for \nCongress to create huge Social Security deficits in order to balance \nthe Federal budget. Replacing FICA revenues with other Federal tax \nrevenues would be an easy means of helping to balance the non-Social \nSecurity portion of the budget, which is all the amendment would \nrequire.\n  Of course, the FICA taxes would no longer fully fund Social Security \nbenefits, threatening the program with bankruptcy. The Social Security \ntrustees could borrow money from the public in order to cover monthly \nchecks to retirees, a step unprecedented in the program's history. But \nthese Social Security deficits wouldn't matter under the Reid \namendment. In the twisted logic of the amendment, the Federal budget \nwould be considered balanced as a matter of constitutional law, even as \nthe Federal Government plunged deeper into debt, a debt that would fall \non future generations.\n\n\n            reid option 4: gamble with social security funds\n\n  Congress could avoid these problems by changing the way that proceeds \nfrom the FICA tax are spent. Current law permits these funds to be used \nonly to pay benefits and to purchase government securities. It also \naccounts for these intergovernmental transactions in a commonsense way: \nThe Treasury is credited with the revenues not needed to pay benefits, \nand the trust funds receive an equal amount in Government securities. \nSince the Government is borrowing money from itself, this transaction \nhas no net effect on the deficit.\n  The Reid amendment would change the way these transactions are \naccounted for. While the trust funds would continue to count their \nGovernment securities as assets, the Treasury would have to pretend \nthat it received nothing of value in return. Thus, in the bizarre world \ncreated by the Reid amendment, every time the Treasury issued a \nGovernment security to the trust fund, the deficit would increase, just \nas the Government's debt increases when it sells bonds to the general \npublic.\n  Since the Reid amendment would treat these intergovernmental \ntransactions as it would public bond issues, Congress might stop using \nSocial Security surpluses to buy Government securities, and let the \nSocial Security trustees try their hand in the private market. They \ncould start gambling with trust fund reserves by acquiring industries, \nbuying up real estate, taking a chance on cattle futures, or \nspeculating on foreign currencies.\n\n\n                      how to save social security\n\n  Far from saving Social Security, the Reid amendment would threaten \nthe program, driving Congress to pursue policies that would bleed the \nsystem and damage the economy in the process.\n  It also would tie the hands of lawmakers who want to restore the \nFederal Government to fiscal soundness. Congressional Budget Office \nDirector Robert Reischauer, during his January 26 appearance before the \nSenate Finance Committee, was asked by Senator Don Nickles whether he \nthought a balanced budget amendment should include exceptions for \nSocial Security or other Federal programs. Dr. Reischauer replied:\n\n       I would say the most comprehensive treatment of the budget \n     would be the most desirable. And what you want is a situation \n     where all activities of the Federal Government are on the \n     table to increase or decrease all of the time in the future. \n     We do not know how this country is going to evolve. * * * In \n     1920, there was no such thing as Social Security. Now there \n     is. Who knows what the world will look like in 2020?\n       If you are going to lock something into the Constitution, \n     you want to do what our founding fathers did, which was \n     provide guidance, general guidance, not nitty gritty \n     specificity, so that the amendment will have enduring value.\n\n  The best way to assure that the Social Security system will have \nenduring value is for Government to get its own financial house in \norder. Rising Federal debt, and the interest payments it entails, \nthreaten Social Security and stunt economic growth. Robert Myers, \nSocial Security's former \n[[Page S2367]]  chief actuary and deputy commissioner, has stated:\n\n       If we continue to run federal deficits year after year, and \n     if interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we \n     will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid \n     the trust funds to pay for our current profligacy, or we will \n     print money, dishonestly inflating our way out of \n     indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the real value of \n     the Social Security trust funds.\n\n  A government crippled by debt can't keep its promises. The balanced \nbudget amendment--without the Reid provision--will help Congress make \ngood on its pledge to seniors and to millions of working Americans to \npreserve Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I referred yesterday to a thoughtful article on this \nsubject by Mr. David Keating, published in the Washington Times. I \nwould ask that this be included in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 8, 1995]\n\n                Social Security and the Balanced Budget\n\n                           (By David Keating)\n\n       During the Vietnam war, an American officer was quoted \n     saying we had to destroy the village in order to save it. Now \n     the U.S. Senate may apply similar logic when it votes on a \n     proposal to add a huge loophole to the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, supposedly to save Social Security.\n       Although the Social Security system currently collects more \n     in taxes than it spends in benefits, this will change early \n     in the next century. If Social Security is exempt, the \n     balanced-budget rule would quickly become worthless. Consider \n     this: In the year 2050, this exemption would legalize an \n     annual total budget deficit of over $2 trillion. That $2 \n     trillion annual deficit will occur under current Social \n     Security policies as today's children retire. This loophole \n     would give Congress yet another excuse to stall any action to \n     address these huge Social Security deficits.\n       The balanced-budget amendment simply requires that Congress \n     take a three-fifths vote in order to pass a bill to borrow \n     more money. Excluding Social Security sounds nice. but it \n     would actually create a huge flaw in the amendment. As \n     Congress chafes under the balanced-budget rule, it would \n     likely use the Social Security loophole to fund other \n     programs, leading in turn to the destruction of Social \n     Security as it works today.\n       Congress would probably first add other programs that aid \n     the elderly into Social Security. Obviously candidates \n     include veterans' benefits and pensions, which total more \n     than $20 billion a year. Supplemental Security Income, which \n     is used to aid the elderly poor and costs over $25 billion a \n     year, is another likely candidate. Then there is the \n     approximately $175 billion in Medicare and Medicaid spending \n     that benefits the aged. A portion of funds spent on the \n     retired poor by Food Stamps, low-income home energy \n     assistance, housing subsidy and other social service programs \n     might be transferred to newly exempt Social Security trust \n     funds. Some or all of federal employee or military retirement \n     programs may also become part of Social Security.\n       A future Congress that wished to bypass the balanced-budget \n     amendment could also, by a simple majority vote, authorize \n     deficits as large as current Social Security spending. How? \n     By reducing Social Security trust-fund taxes and revenues and \n     increasing ``operating'' fund taxes and revenues by an equal \n     amount. This has the potential to be as much as a $330 \n     billion loophole, the current cost of the Social Security \n     program.\n       It also increases the danger of granting further \n     ``exemptions'' to the provisions of a balanced budget \n     amendment. If Social Security is declared exempt, advocates \n     of other causes--from highway builders to teachers--would \n     demand their own exemptions. Or, Congress could simply begin \n     funding everyday programs under the guise of ``Social \n     Security.'' Sound implausible? Who ever thought the \n     Disability Insurance part of the Social Security System would \n     pay benefits, as it does now, to young drug addicts and \n     alcoholics who then use the money to sustain their habits?\n       There is nothing in the proposed exemption that would \n     prohibit spending money from the Social Security trust funds \n     for non-retirement programs. A future Congress and president \n     that wished to circumvent the balanced-budget rule could do \n     so simply by funding non-Social Security programs from trust \n     fund accounts. A simple majority of Congress could thus \n     effectively get around the balanced budget amendment and its \n     limit on new debt.\n       In 1974, the federal debt was $483.9 billion. Today it's \n     over $4.8 trillion, thanks to federal spending growth of \n     twice the rate of inflation. Fifty-two cents of every \n     personal federal income tax dollar now goes to pay interest \n     on the national debt. Not only will interest begin to crowd \n     out Social Security, but the continued buildup of debt will \n     impair the ability of future taxpayers to refund moneys \n     borrowed from the trust fund. Only an all-inclusive Balanced-\n     Budget Amendment will force Congress to balance the budget \n     and create a sound environment for the future of Social \n     Security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Reid-\nFeinstein amendment to exempt Social Security in any balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution of the United States. I want to be \nabsolutely clear. I will not vote for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution that does not exempt Social Security. I will defend \nthat principle in the Constitution. I will defend it on the Senate \nfloor. And I will make sure to do all I can to exempt it in the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Social Security is our primary contract with America. Social Security \nis a sacred and legal trust between the people and the U.S. Government. \nIt is a social contract that was established more than 60 years ago and \nI believe promises made should be promises kept. We said to the \nAmerican people if you practice self-help, if you contribute to a \nSocial Security trust fund, we will make available to you a safety net \nand a floor on which you can build your retirement.\n  I believe this is a promise that needs to be kept. It was made in the \nNew Deal. It was made in the Fair Deal. It was made in the New \nFrontier. It was made in the Great Society. It was reaffirmed by Ronald \nReagan and George Bush and we should reaffirm it here. Social Security \nshould be a sacred trust among the American people and should not be \nsubjected to the vagaries of the U.S. Congress.\n  Republican colleagues say, ``Do not worry. We all like Social \nSecurity. It is probably the one thing the Democrats did that we really \ndo like. We do not want to touch Social Security and we can balance the \nbudget without it.''\n  That is like hearing somebody say, ``Do not worry, Honey, I will take \ncare of you.'' But then we all know that does not happen.\n  If in fact my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that \nSocial Security should not be touched, let us not wait, then, for some \nmysterious enabling legislation. Let us put it in writing now and then \nlet us put it in the constitutional amendment.\n  We talk a lot about the Contract With America and there is much about \nit that I support: the Congressional Accountability Act, the unfunded \nmandate legislation, the fact that we need to reform welfare to make \nsure we reward work, support families, and move people to self-\nsufficiency.\n  I also want to go back to the original contract, which is the Social \nSecurity contract. We need to honor work. We need to honor sweat \nequity. We need to continue to give help to those who practice self-\nhelp, those people who put money into the Social Security trust fund, \nbelieving it would be there for them and not be subject to whatever the \nCongress wants to do on any given year with the budget.\n  My contract with the American people and the people of the State of \nMaryland is I will not vote to cut Social Security and I will not vote \nfor a balanced budget amendment that does not exempt Social Security. I \nwill not vote to balance the budget on the backs of the generation that \nsaved Western civilization.\n  Right now we have wonderful, ordinary men and women who did \nextraordinary things during World War II who are now in their seventies \nand eighties, who absolutely rely on Social Security. Eleanor Roosevelt \ncalled that generation who mobilized for the war, for World War II, she \ncalled them to something, and said it was no ordinary time and no \nordinary solutions would be sufficient to defeat those enemies of \nAmerica and Western civilization.\n  Not only was it no ordinary time, they were no ordinary generation. \nNow we cannot make them pay for the red ink that has been run up in the \nFederal deficit.\n  Social Security is not the cause of the Federal deficit. It is an \nindependent, self-financed and a dedicated fund. In the early 1980's we \nall took tough medicine in order to make the Social Security trust fund \nsolvent. Today the Social Security has a reserve, it has a surplus \nbecause we anticipate the needs of an aging generation. Older Americans \nwho survive on Social Security plus a small pension are not responsible \nfor this Federal budget deficit and should not pay the price for the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  [[Page S2368]] This is not just a senior citizen issue. This is a \nfamily issue. Right now there are many families in my age group who are \ncalled the sandwich generation. They are helping support their mother \nand father--or in many instances their family is self-sufficient \nbecause of Social Security combined with a private pension plan--but \nthis sandwich generation is helping mom and dad and paying for the kids \nin college. They deserve the fact that their mother and father should \nget the Social Security check that they planned for and that they \nthought would be there for them.\n  I will not let those families down. I am on their side, standing up \nfor the principles of family responsibility, self-help and believing \nwhen your U.S. Government makes a contract with you it will not change \nthe rules of the game in the midst of debates on the budget.\n  Let us be clear. Social Security is not welfare. It is not a line \nitem in the appropriations process. It is not something we decide on \nevery year. It is an independent self-financed solvent trust--underline \nthe word ``trust''--fund. It is the foundation of retirement security \nand family security.\n  If we do not exempt it from the balanced budget amendment I predict \nit will be cut. I predict it will be cut severely. This will mean that \nmillions of families could see their incomes sink, and older Americans \nand disabled Americans will be placed at risk.\n  We hear a lot about angry taxpayers, but they are not angry at Social \nSecurity. Americans know that Social Security works, and 79 percent of \nthe American people want to see Social Security exempted from the \nbalanced budget amendment. I stand with those Americans. Count me as \npart of the 79 percent.\n  Count me as being 100 percent with that percentage of the American \npeople who want Social Security exempted in the balanced budget \namendment. Let us protect and preserve and defend that social contract \nwith them and let us protect, preserve, and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think this has been a reasonable debate. \nIt has been civil. The debate has been so for both sides of this issue, \nand both sides have been well-represented. Naturally I feel our side is \ncorrect. I would not be here if I did not, working day in and day out. \nBut the American people voted for change. They thought they were going \nto get it when they voted for President Clinton. And to a degree they \nhave gotten change, but not the change they thought they were going to \nget. They thought he would lead the fight for a balanced budget. In a \nsense, with increasing taxes and doing some budgetary cuts in the last \nyear, I guess you could give him some credit for that, except that \nunder that budget that he passed with 100 percent Democrats and no \nRepublicans, the Vice President having to break the tie, that budget \nhas deficits shooting up in 1996 to as high as $400 billion-plus \nshortly after the turn of the century.\n  This year the President has brought his budget forward, and I really \nbelieve he has just thrown in the sponge because this year's budget has \n$200 billion deficits ad infinitum just on and on well into the next \ncentury, certainly for the next 12 years. And those are based on his \nrosiest assumptions. He just plain did not do anything about persistent \nyearly deficits. That is not change. That is business as usual. And \n$200 billion deficits are very, very high.\n  The American people voted for change, and the balanced budget is part \nof that change. I think we have to overcome this deficit problem.\n  This chart here shows the President's projections. Calculating the \ndeficit under President Clinton, we started with a $4.8 trillion \nnational debt, and between 1994 and the year 2000, 5 years, he will \nspend $1.39 trillion more than we are currently spending.\n  The deficits will be $103.2 billion for 1994; $129.5 billion in 1995. \nThen they go up from there. But they average well over $190 billion a \nyear. This chart only shows projections to the year 2000. They have \nprojected up to the year 2007. Every one of those years has $190 \nbillion-plus deficits. That is assuming that the optimistic economic \nassumptions of the President will be valid, even though we may have \nsome downturns and upturns and everything else during that time. I do \nnot think that these optimistic assumptions will hold, especially if \nyou do not have a balanced budget amendment to get the Government to \nlive within its means.\n  The American people want change. They are not going to be satisfied \nwith business as usual. What I hear from the opponents, sincere as they \nmay be, is that we are going to have business as usual. They know full \nwell the American people support a balanced budget amendment--and the \nother body passed this amendment overwhelmingly. It was kind of a \nmiracle really because we have been fighting for the balanced budget \namendment ever since I came here. We passed the balanced budget \namendment in 1982 by the requisite 67 votes plus 2. We had 69 votes. It \nwent to the House, and we got 60 percent of the House to vote for it \nbut it was not the two-thirds. Tip O'Neill beat us over there. Then we \nwere beaten again over there. But this year, in a vote of 300 to 132, I \nbelieve, they overwhelmingly passed the balanced budget amendment.\n  So for the first time in history, the Senate, which has a history of \npreviously having passed the balanced budget amendment, has a chance to \npass it on to the States and make this a very pivotal year in U.S. \nhistory by putting the discipline in the Constitution that will help us \nto get spending under control.\n  I think the people out there know full well that since the other body \npassed this amendment overwhelmingly with strong bipartisan support \ndespite the President's opposition--I have to say that I do not think \nthe President is opposing this very strongly. Sure, he does not want it \nto pass. His budget makes that clear. But I think deep down he probably \nwishes it would pass because then it would provide the fiscal \ndiscipline that his party and our party need in order to get spending \nunder control.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to define some of the reasons the \nAmerican people need a balanced budget amendment. The Tax Foundation, \nin its April 1994 special report, calculated that an American worker \nworked 125 days last year just to pay taxes. That means from January 1 \nto May 5, working Americans earned absolutely nothing for themselves. \nEvery dime they earned--working Americans between January 1 and May 5--\nwent to taxes for the Federal Government. Put another way, in an 8-hour \nday, a working American spends the first 2 hours and 45 minutes working \nfor the Government. That is wrong. The hard-working Americans who grant \nus the privilege of serving them deserve better than this. The American \npeople have earned this amendment. It would be a shame for us, after \nthe House bit the bullet and passed this amendment and after they have \ntaken the lead, to deprive our citizens any longer.\n  By the way, it was a bipartisan vote in the House, as it has to be in \neither body. It was not a Republican victory. This is not a Republican \namendment. This is a bipartisan, consensus amendment. I know. I have \nworked on it and have helped write it now for all of these last 19 \nyears, and certainly since 1982. And we have worked with our Democratic \ncounterparts year in and year out, and 72 terrific, courageous \nDemocrats voted for this over in the House of Representatives. It would \nnot have passed without them. We all know that. So there is no reason \nfor either side to claim victory here, if this passes, as I think it \nwill. There is every reason for us to continue to work together.\n  Hard-working Americans who grant us the privilege of serving them \ndeserve a better break than they are getting. The American people have \nearned this amendment. It would be a shame for us to deprive them of \nthis.\n  Those of my colleagues who believe Americans are getting their \nmoney's worth for their tax dollars should oppose the balanced budget \namendment. But if any of them believe that, I would be surprised. Those \nSenators who believe otherwise should support it.\n  Mr. President, the size of our bureaucracy is out of control, and \nwasteful spending continues. We are actually paying Federal bureaucrats \nto frustrate private initiative. Let me get into that in a minute. But \nbefore I do, let me go back to our balanced budget \n[[Page S2369]]  debt tracker and the growth of the national debate as \nwe debate.\n  Mr. President, when we started the debate on day one, the national \ndebt was $4.8 trillion, and is represented by this red line. We are now \nin the 11th day. We are now up to $9,123,840,000 in increased debt just \nin the 11 days since we started this debate.\n  It is going up every day that we debate. We are standing here seeing \nthe sinking of the Titanic, and just whittling--I guess fiddling would \nbe a better word--while Washington is sinking American taxpayers deeper \nday in and day out. Just look at how the debt grows. That is going to \ngo up every day this debate continues. It is time for us to do \nsomething about it. The bureaucracy is out of control. Wasteful \nspending continues. We are actually paying Federal bureaucrats to \nfrustrate private initiative.\n  Let me mention some of the details of our current plight.\n  I am grateful for the National Taxpayers Union for compiling some of \nthese points. No. 1, the fiscal year Federal budget deficit was $203.4 \nbillion. No. 2, the Federal Government has run deficits in 33 of the \nlast 34 years and has run a deficit every single year for the past 25 \nyears. No. 4, last year, gross interest payments alone on the national \ndebt were just under $300 billion. These gross interest payments were \nthe second largest item in the Federal budget, and they were more than \nthe total revenues of the Federal Government in 1975. In other words, \nwhat we are paying for interest, which just goes down the drain, \ntotaled nearly $300 billion, and that figure is more than the total \nFederal budget was in 1975, just 20 years ago.\n  It took our Nation 205 years, from 1776 to 1981, to reach $1 trillion \nin national debt. It took only 11 years to reach $4 trillion. On the \nlast day of 1994, the total Federal debt had reached $4.8 trillion. \nThat means that I was a little wrong here when I started my chart \nbehind me as having a $4.8 trillion national debt the day we began the \ndebate. That was the debt January 1. So we were actually higher than \nthat when we began the debate. But, having used that as a rounded \nbaseline figure, we are now another $9 billion, going on $10 billion, \nin debt just in the 11 days this debate has been going on.\n  The country is suffering. I have to say that despite claims of \ndrastic deficit reduction with the 1993 passage of one of the largest \ntax increases in American history, the Congressional Budget Office \npredicted deficits will exceed $300 billion in less than 10 years from \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin \nwants to speak. If I could take maybe a couple of more minutes, I will \nbe glad to yield.\n  Even the President's budget, as I mentioned, just sent to Congress, \nas optimistic as it is, predicts about $200 billion in deficits every \nyear through the year 2002 when our amendment will go into effect. This \nis another $1.4 trillion in debt over those 7 years. That is almost \ncertainly a vast understatement. Think of the increase in yearly \ninterest payments that will add to the Federal budget every year just \nfrom that.\n  The Washington Post headline on Saturday said a great deal about the \nPresident's budget proposal: ``New Budget to Continue U.S. Deficits; \nClinton Proposal Due Monday Produced Amid Staff Doubts.'' The article \nreports that the President's budget ``left some administration \nofficials doubting the President's commitment to his campaign vow to \nhalve the deficit by 1996.'' The headline over the continuation of the \nPost story on page 4 aptly reads: ``Clinton's Proposed Budget Continues \nDeficits He Pledged to Cut.''\n  Some who are cynical believe he has done that so that the Republican \nCongress will have to make the cuts, and then they can criticize the \nRepublican Congress for having done so. I hope that is not the case. \nNevertheless, it is apparent that he has not been doing what he \npromised to try to do. Is there any doubt that we cannot keep spending \nthis way and racking up these huge deficits? Is there any doubt that \nthe politics as usual, represented by the President and his budget \nproposals, do not serve the best interest of our hardworking taxpayers? \nFederal spending and debt crowds out free enterprise. When the Federal \nGovernment spends and borrows, it soaks up resources that private \nbusiness might otherwise use to build or expand factories, showrooms, \nand stores, and the ability to employ many Americans at better wages.\n  Deficit financing is hurting the chances that our children and \ngrandchildren will have financial security. Each one of them owes \n$18,500 in national debt as of right now--in fact, each American \ncitizen, man, woman and child. Each year we are going to add, under the \nPresident's budget, $200 billion to the national debt, from here on in, \nad infinitum. Each year we do that, we cost the average child just over \n$5,000 in extra taxes over his or her working lifetime, just to pay \ninterest costs.\n  The President is proposing to do just that, year after year. I know \nit is tough to be President and I know it is tough to make these \ndecisions. But future generations are going to face higher interest \nrates, less affordable homes, fewer consumer conveniences, fewer jobs, \nlower wages, and a loss of economic sovereignty, unless our fiscal \nhouse is brought into order. So it is time we face these facts, Mr. \nPresident. It is time to make the commitment to balance the Federal \nbudget, and we need this constitutional mandate.\n  So I urge my colleagues in the Senate to please consider this and \nplease support us in fighting for and voting for the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I have more to say, but I will say it at another time, because the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin desires to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we are doing something very unusual \nhere. We are working on a constitutional amendment. We know that has \nnot happened many times in our history, and so when you deal with a \nconstitutional amendment, you have to take an even tougher attitude \nabout what you are doing. I think you have to consider that two \ndifferent things can happen, obviously. One is that the amendment may \nbe defeated which, in this case, I happen to prefer. As we go through \nthe amendments, we also have to be responsible about the amendments we \nput on, because whether I like it or not, this may become the law of \nthe land, part of the Constitution.\n  So the amendments that are offered become particularly important. \nWhat we are doing here is to decide whether or not this balanced budget \namendment should become the law of the land and possibly a straitjacket \nand a problem for a Federal Government from which it will be very \ndifficult to extricate ourselves. So it is in that spirit that I \naddress the amendment of the Senator from Nevada.\n  I want to take this opportunity to commend the Senator from Nevada \nfor his eloquent leadership on this issue of the Social Security aspect \nof the balanced budget amendment--his leadership last session and his \nleadership now. I also commend the senior Senator from California, who \ntook the lead in the Judiciary Committee on which I serve in trying to \nprovide at least this exemption for Social Security from the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  The Senator from California did such a good job, and I was happy to \nbe able to help her. We had a very close vote; we were only one vote \noff in the Judiciary Committee from defeating a motion to table the \namendment.\n  I see this amendment both in the committee and here on the floor as \nnot only serious, but as a sincere and constructive amendment, even \nthough I have reservations about the balanced budget amendment itself. \nI especially speak at this time because even though I think there is a \nchance the balanced budget amendment will not pass this body, and even \nthough I think there is a possibility that even if it goes through the \nCongress it will not be approved by the States, the fact is that it may \nwell do that.\n  We may well be faced with the possibility that the U.S. Constitution \nwill have a balanced budget amendment that provides no protection for \nthe Social Security program. Listening to the debate in committee and \nin listening to the debate yesterday on the floor, I realized again \nthat when you look at the Social Security amendment, it really depends \non how you look at the Social Security fund itself. How one \n[[Page S2370]]  comes down on this amendment depends on how you look at \nthe contributions people make to the Social Security system.\n  One group of people see the Social Security fund as a distinct and \nseparate fund, based on a contract. They think they paid in the money, \nthat a deal was made, that they are entitled to their Social Security \nbenefits, and that it is not subject to congressional whim.\n  There is another group that sees this as just another program, albeit \na worthy program. I know of no Member of the Senate or any Member of \nthe other body who does not think Social Security is a worthy program. \nBut this other group just sees it as a program, something that may make \nsense, something that is expensive, something that we may have to move \naround and take some money from, but something that is worthy \nnonetheless. Those are really the two different ways to look at Social \nSecurity. It is because of this distinction--the differences between \nthe way people look at Social Security--that people come down on \ndifferent sides on what the chairman of the Judiciary Committee called \nin the committee the loophole.\n  The chairman, the Senator from Utah, said that putting this amendment \ninto the balanced budget amendment and into the Constitution would \ncreate a loophole; that the Members of Congress could take basically \nanything they wanted and label it Social Security and use it as a way \nto get out from under the amendment. That was the chairman's view of \nhow this would create a loophole.\n  But I think I look at the Social Security fund a little differently \nthan the chairman--and I acknowledge that a lot of people support him \nin his view. But I look at the Social Security system as a contract. \nAnd so for me, the loophole is not the amendment that the Senator from \nNevada is proposing; the loophole is the past and inappropriate use of \nthe Social Security fund to mask the deficit and the debt. That has \nbeen the loophole that has been used in the Congress.\n  We should not suggest even for a minute--and apparently it went a lot \nlonger than that--that somehow the Social Security fund is part of that \nmoney that comes into the Federal Government and that we can use it in \nour budget calculations, as, in fact, it has been used in the past to \nmask just how big the deficit really is. I know that the Congress in \nrecent years has recognized that this is inappropriate, but it was \ndone--that is the dangerous loophole; that the Social Security fund can \nbe regarded as a cookie jar, a slush fund, whatever you want to call \nit, to solve our problems that we have failed to solve. In my mind, \nthat is the loophole, not the risk that the Constitution would say do \nnot touch Social Security.\n  I think the amendment of the Senator from Nevada and the amendment in \ncommittee of the Senator from California are critical because they \npermanently close the loophole as we move in the balanced budget era.\n  In fact, I would say, based on a few years of listening to folks all \nover my State, that the use of the Social Security fund to mask the \ndeficit and the debt is one of the really strong reasons people \nmistrust the Federal Government. They are troubled by their belief that \nwe are willing to engage in gridlock and avoid solving our Nation's \nproblems. But, they are also angry that we can be so arrogant as to \nconsider Social Security system funds not to be part of a contract with \nthe people who have paid into the system, but money that we can use to \nsolve problems that we have not been willing to solve in the past.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Nevada is responsible as to the \nfuture, as well. It is highly responsible, because what it does is \naddress the future solvency of the Social Security fund.\n  Just as the Social Security fund is not the reason we have a deficit \ntoday--we know that the fund is solvent--it is still the case that the \nSocial Security fund faces an extremely likely, if not certain, strain \nin the future. It must remain intact as a separate system with a \nseparate, credible, long-term financing plan so that Social Security \nwill be there for those of us who come along in the future. Without the \namendment of the Senator from Nevada, the balanced budget amendment \nbecomes not a friend to the future, but a continuing threat to the \nintegrity of the Social Security system.\n  Now, that is not to say--and I think this is important--that there \ncannot be changes on the table for Social Security. I think there \nshould be. Everything needs to be improved over time and, especially \nwhen you are facing future insolvency, we have to consider some \nchanges.\n  In fact, maybe we should look at some of the changes proposed by the \nso-called Entitlements Commission, the Kerrey-Danforth Commission. They \nput some ideas on the table that had to do with Social Security, such \nas whether or not we should raise the retirement age, whether or not \nthere should be some different assumptions made in terms of how the \nConsumer Price Index is calculated as it relates to the cost-of-living \nincreases.\n  I am willing to consider those changes, but only if those changes are \nused to make sure that the money goes into the Social Security fund to \nmake sure it is solvent for the future. Without the amendment of the \nSenator from Nevada, these tough changes, which are going to be \ncontroversial no matter what, will be changes that the American people \nmay see as ways not to make the fund solvent for the future, but to \ntake care of pork projects somewhere else out of their State so that \nMembers of Congress do not have to balance the budget directly. I think \nthat is a valid fear, not only for seniors, but for all the people who \ncome after them and who hope that they have not paid into the Social \nSecurity system in vain.\n  Mr. President, in this context, I am troubled not only by the notion \nthat somehow we are creating a loophole in the Constitution, but I am \nespecially troubled by the notion that I have heard expressed in \ncommittee and on the floor--I do not know whether it is a notion or a \nreassurance or a wish--which is this: The statement that somehow Social \nSecurity will compete well. It is going to do really well, we are told. \nIt has a lot of support. There is nothing to worry about. Nobody is \ngoing to hurt Social Security.\n  That is what the proponents of the balanced budget amendment tell us. \nThat is what people say when they say we do not need the amendment of \nthe Senator from Nevada.\n  But I think that is troubling. I am afraid that the Social Security \nsystem may not fare so well in the brave new world of the balanced \nbudget amendment or in this new marketplace of budgetary suitors. I \nthink that the language of the marketplace in saying that Social \nSecurity will compete well is a direct breach of the whole concept of \nSocial Security and the promise that was made to all those hardworking \nAmericans who paid into the system over the years, understanding and \nbelieving in their Government that nobody would monkey around with \ntheir retirement money.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking here about just another kind of tax \nrevenue. Nobody likes taxes. Nobody likes April 15. But the \nunderstanding is, when you send in that money on April 15, or you have \nto send in a little extra amount because your withholding was not quite \nright, that it goes into a big pot out here and these Members of \nCongress get to decide, along with the President, what is done with it. \nPeople do not like it, but they understand that is our system.\n  But that is not their understanding when it comes to Social Security. \nFor 50 years, that is not what the American people have been told \nSocial Security is all about.\n  To put it another way, I do not think the American people think they \nshould be part of, in effect, a large block grant that the Federal \nGovernment has where they have to compete against other programs, and \nthat they hope they do well in this new block grant after the balanced \nbudget amendment, and they hope there will be enough money there so \nthey can get their Social Security benefits. That is not the \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. President, words of ``competition'' and ``free market'' are \nalmost always appropriate. That is what our system is based on. The \nwords of ``free market'' and ``faring well'' and ``competing'' with \nother worthy programs are not appropriate when it comes to Social \nSecurity.\n   [[Page S2371]] The final point I would like to make, because I think \nthis is often overlooked in attempts to minimize the importance of this \namendment, is that there is an implication that this is just about \nsenior citizens. Somehow, this is pandering to older Americans who want \ntheir Social Security benefits, as if there was something wrong with \nthat. There are constant references to the power of the senior lobby, \nhow we are pandering to older people. This is what we hear all the \ntime.\n  But I will say that I agree with the sentiments of the proponents of \nthe balanced budget amendment who say that nobody is going to mess \naround with the seniors today. That is politically explosive. That is \nnot going to happen. We are not going to take away from the benefits of \nsenior citizens today. They are not, if you will, the at-risk \npopulation when it comes to the balanced budget amendment.\n  I would like to identify three generations that are far more at risk \nbecause of this constitutional amendment than the seniors of today.\n  The first generation is my generation, the baby boomers.\n  Do not accuse me of pandering to seniors. Accuse me, if you will, of \nworrying about my own Social Security benefits. I am concerned. I am \nconcerned that, if this institution has the right to mess around with \nSocial Security funds, when my wife and I get up to be that age, there \nis not going to be anything there. And there are a lot of us in our \ngeneration. You bet, we have a lot of votes. But we also have a right \nto the benefits that we paid for and we were told we were going to get \nby participating in this system.\n Clearly, my generation is concerned.\n\n  There is another generation that I know is concerned and they have \nbecome very vocal. They are called generation X, kids in their late \ntwenties or early thirties. They actually have articulated a philosophy \nfor which I do not pretend to be the spokesman. Obviously, I am too \nold. I have read the articles and heard the statements and seen them on \nTV. What they are saying is, we are not sure that the older folks--and \nnow I am in that group--who are running the show in Washington care at \nall if Social Security is solvent when we get there.\n  They know there are seniors today. There is a huge group of baby \nboomers that will eat up all kinds of benefits when they get there. \nThey, I think, kind of smell a rat. When they get there, they are very \nconcerned that this system that they are now paying into in their \nyounger years, when they would probably like to get a house, buy \nanother car, they are worried we are spending.\n  There is a third generation, the age of my kids. People who are 14, \n11, 9. People that do not understand this. Yet some are figuring out \nthat we have an awful big Federal deficit here, and they will realize \nshortly as they graduate from high school and go into the work force, \nif we do not protect Social Security, they will be the ultimate victims \nof our fiscal irresponsibility of recent years.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, noting that the people that we are always \ntalking about with regard to the deficit and the balanced budget \namendment are the children and the grandchildren. Would it not be \nironic if, in the name of helping the children and the grandchildren, \nwe take away forever the possibility that those same people would have \nthe opportunity to have Social Security? That is ultimately what is \ngoing on here. We are taking away potentially, without this protection, \nthe same rights and privileges that so many of us hope to enjoy, \nbecause there just will not be any money left in the fund.\n  Mr. President, this is a sincere amendment. Whether the balanced \nbudget amendment passes or not, it is absolutely essential that we keep \nit separate, that we keep our promise not only to those who have worked \nand paid in, but that we keep our promise to those who come after.\n  I urge my colleagues to regard this as an important amendment. I \nstrongly urge support for the motion of the Senator from Nevada. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I take the floor to join my colleague from \nWisconsin and my other colleagues in support of their attempt to ease \nour seniors' fears and to help set some parameters for the debate on \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  The fact is, the Social Security system is not causing the deficit. \nIts revenues and surpluses should not be used to mask the deficit nor \nshould its outlays be counted as part of expenditures. Because of these \nvery compelling facts, it is clear to me that Social Security should be \nexempted from the balanced budget amendment.\n  Unfortunately, as has been pointed out by various Senators, there is \na great deal of confusion in the country over what the balanced budget \namendment will mean. The Members on the other side of the aisle have \nrecently voted down the right-to-know amendment that would have gone a \nlong way to answer these difficult and important questions that are \nconfusing the American people. I think this is unfortunate. Throughout \nthe debate in the House and here in the Senate, Members from the other \nside of the aisle have continued to say ``everything is on the table.'' \nAsked if that included Social Security, most have tried to be \nreassuring. Well, when someone tells me that everything is under \nconsideration and then adds that we'll protect Social Security only \nafter being prompted, forgive me for not being too heartened by their \nwords.\n  I say as my father used to say, put it in writing. Put your money \nwhere your mouth is and continue to keep the Social Security system in \nits protected position as a trust fund, separate and distinct from the \nrest of the Federal budget.\n  The many proposals to balance the budget being circulated are scaring \npeople living on Social Security and scaring those who expect the U.S. \nCongress, to abide by our contract, our promise, that the funds will be \nthere when they need them. The conflicting statements in the press and \nthe speculation on the political talk shows is feeding the confusion \nabout what will happen to Social Security. So, Mr. President, I believe \nit is high time that Senators go on record stating flatly where we \nstand with respect to Social Security.\n  Oh, no, do not come up with this ``We will take care of it in the \nimplementing language.'' That does not buy it. Trust, but verify. We \nheard that. I trust, but I want to verify it in writing.\n  I am not afraid to say where I stand. I think those who are \nsupporting the balanced budget amendment are scared to death over this \none. We have not had to have a caucus on what to do about the vote on \nSocial Security. We have not had to have a caucus saying we want to \ndevelop a second-degree amendment or a substitute that puts Members in \na position that when we get to the implementing language we cannot \ntouch Social Security.\n  I have an answer for that one, I think. Many years ago our Nation \nmade a pact with its people that their payroll contributions--and we \nmake them pay--would be available when needed, whether in old age or \nbecause of disability.\n  When I say ``protect'' I mean protect, without a doubt. Some have \nadvocated dealing with Social Security issues, as I say, in the \nimplementing language of the balanced budget amendment. I say to my \ncolleagues and the Nation that that will not cut it. Legislation can be \nchanged at the whim of this Congress or the next Congress.\n  Our amendment is different. By actually writing the protection into \nthe Constitution it truly protects the Social Security contract. We \nhave heard a lot about contracts in the last 35 to 40 days. We had \nheard a lot of it last year. Now we have a contract we want to break.\n  ``Oh, we are not going to break it. We are going to take care of it \nin implementing language.'' Well, how are we going to take care of it? \nWe can change it any week we want to, any month we want to, any year we \nwant to, any Congress we want to. So we do not take care of it. We can \nchange it.\n  In fact, this amendment reinforces our position, makes it stronger, \nmakes Social Security safer and more secure. Neither receipts nor \noutlays will be counted as part of the budget under this provision.\n  The facts in this case bear repeating, I think. The Social Security \nsystem is not causing the deficit. Our proposal \n[[Page S2372]]  protects the sanctity of this most vital program.\n  I hope and trust that most of our colleagues will join in protecting \nSocial Security. We need to go on record--not some vague time in the \nfuture--to put our seniors' fears to rest.\n  If we say we want to safeguard Social Security, remember that actions \nspeak louder than words. Support the Reid-Feinstein amendment to the \nbalanced budget amendment. Support this measure. Support for this \nmeasure is the only way to truly guard the trust fund. I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  Opponents argue on this issue that statutes never have been \nincorporated in the Constitution and this would be an unprecedented \nconstitutionalizing of a statute.\n  The response to that is, this is the first time that we have ever \ntried to do an amendment to the Constitution fixing fiscal policy. So \nif this is the first time we have done that, we can do something else \nfor the first time.\n  So if we are talking about fiscal policy, should we not be concerned \nabout one of the largest fiscal elements of our society; namely, Social \nSecurity?\n  I know there are a lot of people here just as sincere about \nsupporting the constitutional amendment as they can be. I support it. I \nvoted for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. You are \ngoing to need my vote, but you know, they say, whichever way it goes, \nDemocrats lose on this. If you pass a balanced budget amendment, the \nRepublicans win. If they lose, they beat the heck out of us for the \nnext 2 years politically, and there will be fewer Democrats here 2 \nyears from now than there are now. I see the President smiling. He \nwould like that. That is all right. I am going to do what I think is \nbest whether I get to come back or not, and I will defend my position \nwith anyone on the other side any time you want to have that debate.\n  But there are some people around this Chamber I respect. I respect \nthem personally and for their judgment and experience and knowledge. \nOne of those is the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin. \nI do not think anybody in this Chamber disputes his legal and \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  So let us just look at this for just a moment, where he is coming \nfrom. Opponents of this amendment argue that we will use implementing \nlegislation to exempt Social Security from the Balanced Budget Act \ncalculations. That is what we hear. We hear it every day from my \nlearned friend from Utah--I heard it, he just keeps repeating it, and I \nalmost believe it he has repeated it so much. But let us listen to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama. This refutes the ability to do \nsomething about Social Security in the implementing language that we \nhear about.\n  Here is what Senator Heflin says:\n\n       Attempts to protect Social Security through implementing \n     language would be futile.\n\n  Futile, and I underscore that.\n\n       Once the Constitution is amended to require that total \n     outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts \n     for that fiscal year, Social Security is in danger.\n\n  That is what Senator Heflin says. And he goes further to say:\n\n       This means that there will be a constitutional requirement \n     that Social Security funds be considered on budget, because \n     the language says all receipts, all revenues.\n\n  All receipts, all revenues. So when that balanced budget amendment is \npassed, that includes Social Security, and this is by a man I believe \nhas as good a knowledge of the Constitution as anyone in this Chamber.\n  He goes on further to say:\n\n       If the balanced budget amendment is adopted as presently \n     worded, it would prohibit--\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       it would prohibit Congress from legislatively taking Social \n     Security funds off budget\n\n  Because you have included them--\n\n       and would nullify the provisions of the 1990 Budget \n     Enforcement Act which requires Social Security funds to be \n     considered off budget.\n\n  That balanced budget amendment says it is all receipts, all revenues, \nand here is a fellow I think you have to respect, a Senator, I better \nbe careful. Senator Byrd will be up here in a minute if I call him \n``fellow.'' He is a Senator. So I want to be sure I say it right.\n  Here is a Senator we all respect. He thought about this for weeks, \nand he would not have made that statement publicly if he did not \nbelieve he was legally and constitutionally correct. When he makes that \nstatement, after thoughtful consideration, I have to believe it.\n  We have others from the American Law Division who agree with Senator \nHeflin. They put out their statements. Once you put ``all receipts'' in \nthat amendment to the Constitution, you eliminate the ability under the \nlegislative implementation of that budget of trying to exclude Social \nSecurity.\n  If you are willing to take that chance, and if you are willing to \ntake that chance, go ahead and vote against it. But I will tell the \nSenate and the American people, here is one Senator who is not going to \nvote to include Social Security. I have too many in my State, and you \nhave too many in your State and there are too many across this country \nwho have a contract with us.\n  ``Oh, it's all right, old Ford is down there flapping his lips. It's \nnot going to make any difference, they already have the votes.'' They \nat least start out with 53--maybe 52. You did lose one. One on that \nside is all right, up until now.\n  But when it comes to the point of whether you want to believe the \nconstitutional scholars that once you pass this balanced budget \namendment Social Security is excluded from the implementation of that \nbudget by this body, then you have said one thing and you are unable to \ndo it.\n  I do not want the courts to start telling me to cut the budget, to \nraise the taxes, you cannot do this and you cannot do that. And we are \ngetting very close to saying to the courts, ``You are going to run this \ncountry.'' I am not ready for the courts to tell me how to vote in the \nlegislature, in the Congress, and I do not think you want to vote to \ngive that much power to the courts.\n  We are on the verge of saying that the courts will be all powerful \nover our fiscal policy. Line-item veto--we are going to give that to \nthe Executive. We can just get us a plastic card and vote from home, \nand a lot of people would probably like for us to do that. But we are \nslowly but surely saying to our forefathers that you made the best \njudgment of any country in the world when you put together the \nConstitution, but we are saying now we are going to give a piece of the \nlegislative prerogative to the courts, we are going to give another \npiece of legislative prerogative to the President.\n  I believe Senator Heflin when he says that if you say ``all \nreceipts'' and the constitutional amendment passes, you will not be \nable to get Social Security and those people out there now drawing \nSocial Security will be in deep trouble. A $702 billion surplus in 2002 \nin Social Security. A $780 billion surplus in Social Security in 2002 \nand you want to take that and reduce the deficit.\n  Now, if I did not have to pay it, it might be a different deal, but I \nhave to pay it. I look forward to it because it is a contract. How many \npeople get out of paying Social Security? I do not know. Unless you do \nnot make anything, you pay Social Security. It is planned to go up and \nhave a surplus. That is the plan. We do not even have a means test. I \nhave not even heard it suggested.\n  I see a lot of people taking notes while I am talking. Maybe they \nwant to think about this constitutional question a little bit.\n  But I just say to my colleagues and to those who may be watching--\nonce they started listening to me talk, they probably turned on the \nlocal news or something--but you better be careful about allowing the \nSocial Security amendment to fail because if that balanced budget \namendment passes--and I suspect it will and the States will ratify it--\nthen Social Security is part of the deficit reduction, regardless of \nour implementing language.\n  Oh, I will hear good legal words. I am not a lawyer. Therefore, I am \nnot a word merchant, and I cannot take my words and make it sound good. \nYou have both sides. You have both sides. And it is good to argue that \nway.\n  But the only thing I know is I listen to people I trust, people I \nthink are intelligent, people I think thought this part of the \namendment through thoroughly and have now made their judgment. That \njudgment has been supported by the American Law Division of the \nCongressional Research Service. They all concur with Senator Heflin's \nstatement. If that is true, all of us in \n[[Page S2373]]  this Chamber better take a step back and look at where \nthis has taken us, particularly as it relates to Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues I hope that the 17,000 calls \nper minute being made around this country as it relates to Social \nSecurity begin to burn between now and the time that they have this \nvote, and that we can at least save Social Security in our haste to \nhave a drag race and accomplish things and put it on the 30-second \nsound bite.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I agree with three-fourths of what Senator \nFeingold said before and what Senator Ford has said. I believe we do \nhave a contract with people who have signed up for Social Security. As \na matter of fact, I do not remember when it was, but about 10 years \nago, when I introduced a balanced budget amendment, I had an exemption \nfor Social Security.\n  I finally withdrew that for two reasons. First, I believed that we \nbetter protect Social Security by not having it in, and I will explain \nthat in a few moments. Second, we have a contract with a lot of other \npeople, too. And if you put in this exemption for those on Social \nSecurity, what about Federal employees? What about veterans? What about \nrailroad employees? What about other trust funds we have set up where \nwe have a contract--for aviation, for highways, for other things?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand what the Senator is saying about these other \ncontracts. But in the military, we appropriate funds every year for the \nretirement of the military. The airport improvement trust fund, if you \nfly an airplane, you pay the tax. If you do not fly, you do not. Then \nyou are going to see that we can reduce those taxes. Therefore, you \nwill not have a trust fund. Under the highway trust fund, you have \ngasoline taxes. If you reduce those taxes, you do not have a trust \nfund. Here it is mandatory that you pay under Social Security, and that \nis a trust fund with a contract. Will the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. SIMON. I agree they are different. But what about railroad \nemployees, if I may ask?\n  Mr. FORD. Railroad employees are under Social Security. They have \nbeen transferred to the Social Security. The railroad retirement system \nhas been merged with Social Security, and Social Security is the \nrailroad retirement fund.\n  Mr. SIMON. I differ with my colleague on that.\n  Mr. FORD. My father-in-law is a railroad retiree, and he gets his \ncheck from Social Security. Now, Mr. President, I do not know what it \nis, what kind of fund he has, but they did not have enough funds to \ntake care of it and they turned it over to Social Security, and Social \nSecurity is now taking care of those retired railroad people.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator is partially correct in that.\n  Mr. FORD. At least that is better than being all wrong.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me just add, we have a contract not \nonly with people who are on Social Security today. We have a contract \nwith those three groups that Senator Feingold mentioned in the future. \nAnd how is the Social Security trust fund protected? It is protected by \nU.S. bonds.\n  If you take a look at the history of nations, when nations get around \n9, 10, or 11 percent of deficit versus national income, with the \nexception when you are in a war, then nations start printing money. \nWhat the economists say is they monetize the debt. The latest CBO \nprojection is we are going to end up, in the year 2030, with 18 \npercent. That suggests that the only way we can protect Social Security \nis to make sure that debt does not rise, and that we do not monetize \nthe debt, because if the dollar is only worth 25 cents, those bonds are \nonly worth 25 cents on the dollar.\n  Senator Ford is correct. Social Security is not causing the deficit. \nI have voted for statutory provisions, and I will again as we move \nahead. But we also have to recognize that if we separate Social \nSecurity and say this is not our direct responsibility, starting in the \nyear 2012 or 2013, Social Security starts to go into a deficit \nsituation.\n  What we ought to be doing, if this passes, is sitting down with \nsenior groups right now and saying how do we plan for this? Do we have \nto have a half-percent increase in Social Security in the FICA tax to \npay for it? Should we, over a period of 12 years, each month increase \nthe retirement that you need to have?\n  I do not know what the answers are, but I know that if we just put \nthis off and say this is not our direct responsibility, we are asking \nfor trouble.\n  Here let me just add, we ought to be listening to Bob Myers, for 21 \nyears the chief actuary of the Social Security System. He says it is \nabsolutely essential for the future of our system that we pass the \nbalanced budget amendment. I hope we do that.\n  Let me just add one other point. There are those who philosophically \njust are opposed to a balanced budget amendment, period. My friend, \nSenator Byrd, is one of those. Senator Feingold is one of those. But \nlet no one use the defeat--and I think this amendment will be \ndefeated--let no one use that as political cover and say, well, I \ncannot do this because I want to protect Social Security recipients. \nThe only sure way to protect Social Security recipients is, as Bob \nMyers has pointed out, to pass the balanced budget amendment. And that \nis what I hope we will do and do in a responsible way.\n  The Reid amendment, in my opinion, should be defeated. Then we should \ndo the right thing by those who are on Social Security now and will be \non Social Security in decades to come by adopting the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Illinois has \nreferred to Mr. Bob Myers on two or three occasions. On another day I \nwill take the time to read into the Record what Mr. Robert Ball had to \nsay about Mr. Myers' statement and had to say about Social Security and \nhad to say about the balanced budget amendment, so that the record will \nbe balanced.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, when former President John F. Kennedy wrote ``Profiles \nin Courage,'' I believe he wrote about Edmund G. Ross, of Kansas, \nduring the debate in 1868 on the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. At the \nconclusion of the trial when the vote was taken, the first vote was on \narticle 11. That was a test vote. The House managers felt that was kind \nof a catch-all provision on which the guilty verdict would most likely \nbe rendered--would have its best chance. But on that vote, 7 \nRepublicans voted with 12 Democrats to acquit President Andrew Johnson. \nThirty-six votes were needed for a guilty verdict, for a conviction; 36 \nvotes. The vote was 35 to 19. And so those who sought to convict \nPresident Johnson failed by one vote, and President Kennedy mentions \nthe name, I believe, of Edmund G. Ross, of Kansas, who was one of the \nRepublicans who cast a vote for acquittal and thus, apparently, sealed \nhis political doom in so doing.\n  But there was another Senator who cast such a vote and that was Peter \nG. Van Winkel, of West Virginia. Peter G. Van Winkel was from \nParkersburg, and he voted to acquit President Johnson. In so doing, \nPeter G. Van Winkel closed the escape door and sealed his doom \npolitically. The West Virginia Senate, in that year of 1868, passed a \nresolution condemning--I believe the vote was 18 to 3--condemning \nJohnson. So the pressure was on because most of the West Virginians \nwere Unionists. The pressure was on Peter G. Van Winkel to vote guilty. \nWaitman T. Willey, the other West Virginia Senator, voted guilty. But \nPeter G. Van Winkel voted not guilty.\n  Edmund G. Ross went on to switch from the Republican Party to the \nDemocratic Party in later years. He, I believe, was Democratic \ncandidate for Governor of his State later. He had a continuing \npolitical career as a Democrat.\n  But not so with Van Winkel. He was finished. He looked down into the \nopen political grave and knew that was where he was going to his final \nrest.\n  So there were two profiles in courage.\n  I was visiting with Senator Pell recently and I saw on his office \nwall a \n[[Page S2374]]  framed article, I believe it is from the New York \nTribune. The headline was as follows.\n\n       Pell Will Vote Against Bonus; Means His End.\n       New York Representative Says Act Will Be Political Suicide \n     But He Can See No 0ther Course.\n\n  And reading from that May 1 story of 1919 or 1920, I forget which it \nwas, dateline Washington, May 1.\n\n       Representative Herbert C. Pell, Jr., Democrat, who was \n     elected to the House from the Fifth Avenue District, (17th of \n     New York), announced today in a speech on the floor that he \n     would vote against the soldier's bonus bill despite his \n     belief that to follow such a course would be political \n     suicide.\n       Explaining his conviction later, Mr. Pell said that \n     although most of his constituents might mildly approve his \n     stand he believed several hundred returned soldiers of \n     Democratic sympathies would cross the party line and assure \n     his defeat in a district which was normally Republican.\n       ``I intend to vote against the bonus,'' Mr. Pell said in \n     his speech. ``I am doing this in the full realization that it \n     means the end of my political career, and I can tell you \n     frankly that it is a painful thing to commit suicide, but I \n     do not think that honor will permit me to follow any other \n     course.''\n\n  I will not read the rest of the article. But here was a profile in \ncourage, Herbert C. Pell, Jr., father of our own illustrious colleague, \nClaiborne Pell, who knew that he was closing the door forever to any \nfuture in politics but who stood upon principle. He put principle above \nparty; principle ahead of expediency, and cast that vote. So I asked \nSenator Pell to give me a copy of that newspaper story.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the New York Tribune]\n\n              Pell Will Vote Against Bonus; Means His End\n\n\nNew York Representative Says Act Will Be Political Suicide, but He Can \n                          See No Other Course\n\n                          Tax Methods Assailed\n\n  would paralyze industries and create the worst panic in history; is \n                                 belief\n\n                 (From The Tribune's Washington Bureau)\n\n       Washington, May 1.--Representative Herbert C. Pell Jr., \n     Democrat, who was elected to the House from the ``Fifth \n     Avenue District'' (17th, of New York), announced to-day in a \n     speech on the floor that he would vote against the soldiers' \n     bonus bill despite his belief that to follow such a course \n     would be political suicide.\n       Explaining his conviction later, Mr. Pell said that \n     although most of his constituents might mildly approve his \n     stand, he believed several hundred returned soldiers of \n     Democratic sympathies would cross the party line and assure \n     his defeat in a district which was normally Republican.\n       ``I intend to vote against the bonus,'' Mr. Pell said in \n     his speech. ``I am doing this in the full realization that it \n     means the end of my political career, and I can tell you \n     frankly that it is a painful thing to commit suicide, but I \n     do not think that honor will permit me to follow any other \n     course.\n\n\n                  thinks industries would be paralyzed\n\n       ``Of course I shall vote for the most generous treatment \n     possible for men that have been injured in the service of the \n     United States, and also for proper care of the dependents of \n     those men who have been killed, but I cannot bring myself, \n     merely for consideration of political advantage, to vote for \n     a bill which would impose a tax of $20 a head on every man, \n     woman and child in the country. There is no conceivable way, \n     or at least no way has been suggested, by which such an \n     amount of money could be raised which would not paralyze the \n     industries of the United States and precipitate such a crisis \n     as we have never seen in our history.\n       ``Hard times unquestionably are coming, whatever we may do, \n     but while we cannot avert difficulties we can tremendously \n     aggravate them. So far there have been three plans suggested \n     for raising the money.\n       ``First, by the issue of $2,000,000,000 of bonds which, \n     obviously could not possibly be marketed at a rate very much \n     under 8 per cent, which would promptly knock twenty points \n     off the price of Liberty bonds and make any private borrowing \n     by business men practically impossible.\n\n\n                        tax methods are assailed\n\n       ``Second, a retroactive tax on incomes for at least three \n     or four years. Ordinary common sense will show any man that \n     this money has not been kept by the individuals who acquired \n     it, in the form of cash in their stockings, but has been \n     spent or invested, and to raise the tax money every business \n     man in the country would be obliged to go into the money \n     market and borrow on his own credit. This also would run the \n     price of money up to such an extent that the permanent \n     investment rate in the United States would remain somewhere \n     around 8 per cent for a great many years. Of course, I mean \n     non-speculative investments--the class of thing that before \n     the war paid from 3\\1/2\\ to 4\\1/2\\ per cent.\n       ``The third plan is a general sales tax of one-half of 1 \n     per cent on all sales made in the country. The argument for \n     this is that it would take the money from the people in such \n     small installments that they would not notice it, but it \n     would be impossible to take such an enormous sum from the \n     community without very seriously affecting all business \n     throughout the country, and, of course, it would wreck the \n     financial district of New York, and with it the hope of \n     commercial preeminence of the world.\n\n\n                      money would drift to london\n\n       ``An American stock exchange would probably be opened in \n     London, on which all stocks listed on New York would be dealt \n     in. This would mean that London would become the great market \n     of the world for call money, and would end any hope that we \n     may have held in the past of New York becoming the financial \n     capital of the world.\n       ``Considering the low purchasing power of money to-day and \n     also the general tendency of all classes toward extravagance, \n     $500 means about as much to a man to-day as $75 or $100 used \n     to mean to us, and we may rest assured that nine-tenths of \n     the men receiving this money will spend it on a good time and \n     not work until it is all gone. After that they will try to \n     get back the jobs they held and find that they no longer \n     exist, so that their last state will be worse than the \n     first.''\n       Representative Johnson, of South Dakota, insisting that the \n     bonus bill ``must pass,'' proposed in the House to-day the \n     elimination of the tax on sales, which was criticized \n     severely by Republican members in conference last night, and \n     the substitution of a tax on war profits.\n       Chairman Fordney of the House Ways and Means Committee, \n     announced that sessions of the committee would be held late \n     next week, at which the elimination of the sales tax \n     provision would be considered.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier we witnessed here in the Senate one \nof those vital moments of historic drama for which the U.S. Senate was \ncreated, that moment during which our friend and colleague, Senator \nMark Hatfield from Oregon rose and announced his opposition to the \nproposed balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. When he did \nthat he wrote on this very day his own profile in courage.\n  Senator Hatfield and I are both standing in this debate on principles \nthat transcend both party allegiances and personal quirks. Our position \nis against vilifying the sacred document on which this Republic is \nbased with parochial conceits and economic policies that will surely be \nviewed in the future as an anachronism--if this amendment is ever \nadopted in the country.\n  Our position on this matter reflects a conservative stance on the \nConstitution, based on the ``strict constructionism.''\n  Where are all these conservatives we hear about? Like Disraeli, I am \na conservative: To retain all that is good in the Constitution. And the \nradicals remove all that is bad. This position of strict construction \nis rooted in American history and in constitutional traditions.\n  But one thing highlights Senator Hatfield's position and \ndifferentiates that position from my own position. Senator Hatfield is \nswimming against the inclinations of the majority of his caucus. It may \nvery well turn out to be almost a unanimous caucus except for his vote. \nSenator Hatfield is swimming against the inclinations of the majority \nof his caucus and against the directives of the so-called Contract With \nAmerica, of which the House Members of Senator Hatfield's own party are \nso enamored.\n  Senator Hatfield's stand on the issue of the balanced budget \namendment is a stand which should make every Senator proud, even those \nwho differ with Senator Hatfield and with me on this issue. Senator \nHatfield's position on this matter suggests those instances --and I \nhave referred to a few earlier--those instances of character and \ndistinction cited in ``Profiles in Courage,'' one of those defining \nmoments for which the Founding Fathers created the Senate as ``the \nplace to send legislation so that it might cool down.''\n  Mr. President, I again commend my friend and colleague Senator \nHatfield for his courage and his demonstrated leadership on this issue, \nand in this body. He has stood on the unfailing foundation of \nprinciple.\n  He has lived up to his oath to support and to defend the Constitution \nof the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. He has \nput his vote behind reserving that grand document --and here it is, the \nConstitution of the \n[[Page S2375]]  United States--for future generations. He has stood \nagainst the political winds of expediency, and the people of Oregon \nshould be proud of him, and the American people should be proud of him. \nRegardless of their viewpoint on this particular issue, they should be \nproud of him.\n  Mr. President, it seems that we live in an age of little reverence \nand less patience. It is an era of fast food and slick advertising \nslogans, of instant analysis and rapid information. In politics, it is \na time of sound bites and media men.\n  The practical application of democracy as it has evolved, with its \ncondensed messages and its blow-dried candidates, stands in stark \ncontrast to the carefully crafted, intricate, thoughtful system \nenvisioned by the Framers and given form by the written document known \nas the Constitution of the United States of America.\n  Representative democracy is a slow, complex, and cumbersome way of \ngoverning. Its strong point is not speed, and not efficiency but \nstability. In a world enamored of instant gratification, 30-second \npolitical ads, 30-minute press conferences, rapid transit, fax \nmachines, satellite communications, and a whole host of lifestyle \nsubtleties that peddle speed and simplicity as invaluable commodities, \nI sometimes wonder if, as a people, we have somewhere lost the patience \nfor representative democracy.\n  It is as if the perseverance to examine issues with meticulous care, \nconsidering and publicly debating all aspects until a solid consensus \nemerges, has gone out of style. Perhaps our ability to concentrate--the \nAmerican attention span, if you will--has been shortened, rather like a \nchild who has watched too much bad television. And there is all too \nmuch of that to watch.\n  Given our national fascination with time-saving devices that simplify \nour lives, it becomes easy to understand why intractable problems, \nwithout quick or obvious solutions, are especially frustrating to the \nAmerican people. In many American families, both parents have to work \njust to make ends meet, and then struggle to parcel out any leftover \ntime, if there is any left over, to raise their children. The American \npeople, frankly, are distracted by their own overly busy, fractured \nlifestyles, and the simple, quick solution is currently at a premium \nvalue. The simple, quick solution is at a premium value.\n  Some in the political sphere have seized upon that distraction and \nhave made hay out of offering one-liner solutions to the Nation's most \ncomplex problems. Some have discovered that the simple, the catchy, the \nobvious, the easy will sell like hot cakes to an American public \nfrustrated by the demands of making a living and disappointed by a \npolitical system that no longer seems to matter in their own daily \nlives.\n  Is the American public weary of budget deficits? You bet they are. \nWell, then, pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget; it \nis just that simple.\n  Our forefathers did not intend that the Constitution never be amended \nfor all time. They provided an article, Article V, which provides for \nthe amending of that document if two-thirds of both Houses and three-\nfourths of the States give their approval to amending the Constitution. \nIt can be done; it has been done. We have 27 amendments, 17 since the \noriginal 10 that we refer to as the Bill of Rights. I, myself, voted \nfor five of those amendments here in this body.\n  But here, we are talking about an amendment that would burst at their \nseams the very pillars on which this constitutional system rests: The \nseparation of powers and checks and balances. That is what it amounts \nto. I will go into that with greater particularity on another day. But \nthe Framers in writing the Constitution intended that it endure for \nages to come, and that, consequently, it be adapted to the ``various \ncrises of human affairs.'' Those of the words of John Marshall. So in \nthe midst of all of this hustle and bustle, and the search for \nexpediencies, easy answers, why do we not just throw out the \nConstitution and start all over? Or perhaps we should do it by \nstealth--do it by stealth--under the cloak of a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, that is why the American people have a right to know \nwhat this amendment will do. Let us take a close look at House Joint \nResolution 1.\n  I want to appeal to that jury out there, that jury which during this \ndebate is viewing the electronic eye. And among that jury, I am \nappealing to Senators, Senators\n perhaps in particular at this moment. I want to make my case before \nthat jury, and I hope that with a little patience, because talk becomes \ntedious at times, especially on this occasion when I will be explaining \nthe flaws in this amendment--it may become a little tedious. May I say \nto the men and women of the jury, please be patient, because I am going \nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget is filled with flaws, that it will not work, that \nit cannot work and that the committee in its committee report admitted \nessentially that there were problems with it and sought to provide the \nescape doors through which we might run from that problem.\n\n  I am going to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt, for all those who \nwill take the patience to listen. Bring on your ready response team. I \nsaw on television one evening on the evening news that my friend, Mr. \nDole, had brought out, I believe, 9 or 10 Senators from the other side \nof the aisle--and maybe 1 from this side, I am not sure--and it was a \nready response team. They were going to ``wear him out,'' talking about \nRobert Byrd. They were going to wear him out. Well, bring on your ready \nresponse team now, while I am speaking. Bring them on. I will yield for \nquestions. I will yield for statements by unanimous consent. But do it \nnow. You remember the little ad on TV, ``Do it here, do it now.'' Well, \ndo it here, do it now. All right. To the ready response team I say, \n``come on, do it here, do it now, while I am on the floor. Bring out \nyour 9 or 10.\n  I want to focus on this measure, because just as Toto pulled back the \ncurtain to expose the not-so-mighty Wizard of Oz, the curtain must be \npulled back on this resolution so that the American people, too, can \nsee that it is political sorcery, political witchcraft, political black \nmagic.\n  Section 1 of the proposed constitutional amendment on this chart to \nmy left, so that the jurors can read it for themselves, reads:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law \n     for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall \n     vote.\n\n  I will speak at a later time about this clause which deals with the \nsupermajorities that are built into this amendment. There are 9 \nsupermajorities in the Constitution of the United States and the \namendments thereto. Six supermajorities are provided for in the \noriginal Constitution, one supermajority is provided for in the 12th \namendment, one in the 14th amendment, one in the 25th amendment, making \na total of 9 supermajorities built into the Constitution and amendments \nthereto. I will talk about that.\n  I will repeat this first quote from Section 1: ``Total outlays for \nany fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year * \n* *.'' That means that total Government spending for any fiscal year \nshall not exceed total receipts--``* * * shall not exceed * * *'' the \nmoney taken in by the Government.\n  That language probably sounds fairly straightforward. It should be \neasily understood: ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed \ntotal receipts for that fiscal year * * *.'' But if we accept that \nrequirement, if we rivet that quack nostrum into the Constitution of \nthe United States, then the obvious question is, can we ensure that, in \nfact, outlays do not exceed receipts? That is what the mandate says \nhere. How are we supposed to comply with that constitutional mandate? \nSimply stating that outlays shall not exceed receipts is nothing more \nthan an empty incantation; just to say it is more than an empty \nincantation. Stating it will not automatically make it happen, any more \nthan if we said there will be no more poverty, no more crime, or no \nmore pollution. There would still need to be some sort of mechanism to \ncarry out the goal. That, of course, is also true of balancing the \nbudget.\n   [[Page S2376]] Everyone should realize that there has to be a plan \nin order to actually get the budget into balance. That is what many of \nus have been trying to get the proponents of the amendment to tell us. \nShow us the plan. Let the American people see your plan for balancing \nthe budget. The people have a right to know.\n  But, Mr. President, proponents of the amendment tell us not to worry. \nThey say that a constitutional amendment is not the place to put the \nparticulars, or details, or how we achieve a balanced budget. They say \nthat section 6 of the proposed amendment requires Congress to develop \nits own enforcement mechanism by passing implementation legislation--by \npassing implementing legislation. Congress will enforce it, says \nsection 6 of this constitutional amendment. If that is the case, then \nthe American people have a right to know what that section says.\n  Section 6--here it is on the chart to my left--reads as follows: \n``The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate \nlegislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.''\n  For the public to understand what kind of wonder drug they are being \nasked to swallow, they need to fully understand that specific section \nof the resolution. And once they do understand it, Mr. President, I \nbelieve they will know that this amendment is nothing more than \npolitical witchcraft.\n  Section 6 of the resolution, of the balanced budget amendment, states \nthat ``The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \nappropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and \nreceipts.''\n  Again, Mr. President, such language would appear rather \nuncomplicated. But if we take a closer look, especially at the latter \nhalf of that sentence, we will see that the entire premise of this \namendment is as shaky as a house of cards. Indeed, in one single word--\nthe word ``estimates''--we find the Achilles heel of the whole balanced \nbudget amendment concept, be it House Joint Resolution 1 or some other \nversion. The Achilles heel is the word ``estimates.''\n  Following that, let us zero in on the word ``estimates.'' If we \nfollow the directive of section 6, then the central tenet of our \nenforcement mechanism, we would see, is to be based on ``estimates of \noutlays and receipts.'' Now get that. ``The Congress shall enforce and \nimplement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \nestimates of outlays and receipts.\n  What the public needs to know, but what they are not being told, is \nthat, unlike most individuals who will receive a set salary or wage for \nthe year and whose expenses are relatively stable, total outlays and \ntotal receipts of the Federal Government are never, never, never \nknown--and in fact they cannot be known--at the beginning of any given \nfiscal year. It is impossible for the total receipts and the total \nrevenues to be known at the beginning of any given fiscal year. All the \nPresident and Congress have to work with, when they begin to put the \nbudget together, are estimates provided to them by the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office--estimates, \nnothing more.\n  If we have learned nothing else over the past 15 years, it is that \nactual outlays and actual receipts in any given year can, and generally \ndo, vary from those estimates by billions of dollars--not millions, but \nbillions of dollars. In fact, in most years, actual outlays and actual \nreceipts do not even come close--do not even come close--to what the \nexperts projected at the beginning of the fiscal year.\n  Estimates are not accurate. They never are. And if they ever will be, \nit will be pure happenstance and it will not happen often.\n  As these charts to my left will show, outlays, receipts, and deficits \nhave consistently been misestimated in every one of the 15 years from \nfiscal year 1980 through fiscal year 1994, inclusive. No exception. In \nevery one of those 15 years--from fiscal year 1980 through fiscal year \n1994--the outlays, receipts and deficits have been misestimated.\n  Mr. President, before turning to the specifics of these charts, let \nme emphasize that the data presented here come from the independent and \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That office, created by the \n1974 Congressional Budget Act, is charged with the job of assisting \nCongress in the preparation and analysis of the budget by providing us \nwith the economic and budget data we need throughout the year. As part \nof those duties, they are responsible for closely monitoring the \nGovernment's deficits. But, as we shall see, despite all the expertise \nof the individuals who work in that office, they remain powerless--\nabsolutely powerless--to provide the accuracy that would be required \nunder this amendment. They are the best in the business, but they will \nnever, never be able to produce what this amendment calls for.\n  Let us look at the first chart. This first chart shows the difference \nbetween revenues, as estimated in the first budget resolution for each \nof fiscal years 1980 through 1994, versus what those revenues actually \nturned out to be.\n  The estimate of the revenues versus what the revenues actually turned \nout to be.\n  Starting on the left, the viewer's left, on your left out there \nlooking through that electronic eye, starting on your left with fiscal \nyear 1980, we can see that actual revenues collected by the Federal \nGovernment were $11.1 billion more than what had been forecast in the \nbudget resolution for that year. Eleven billion dollars, Mr. President. \nThen in fiscal year 1981, revenues fell short of the estimate by $11.3 \nbillion. In fiscal year 1982, revenues fell short of the estimate by \n$40 billion. For fiscal year 1983, revenues fell short of the \nestimate--in other words, the income of the Government, the actual \nincome of the Government for that fiscal year fell short of the \nestimate--by $65.3 billion.\n  Now I will not take each year, but the viewers can see that in only 1 \nyear were the estimates really close. In that year, they missed the \nestimate by $1.7 billion. But look at the other wide ranges--$55 \nbillion in 1991, $77.5 billion in 1992. The actual revenues missed \nestimated revenues by $77 billion in that year.\n  The point I am making here is that in no year, in no year, were the \nestimates accurate--not one year--and range as far off, as I say, as \n$65 billion in fiscal year 1983 and, in 1992, $77.5 million, the errors \nbetween the actual revenues and the estimates.\n  Now we are talking about the word ``estimates'' in this \nconstitutional amendment, in this balanced budget constitutional \namendment. I want to keep our attention on the word ``estimates'' and I \nam showing that the historical record here clearly, clearly, is \nconvincing that estimates are always wrong. They have always been \nwrong.\n  So all in all, those who have done the estimating have not produced a \nvery good record.\n  Now this next chart shows for the same 15 fiscal years the difference \nbetween estimated outlays--that is the money the Government spends \nout--the difference between the estimated outlays, as contained in the \nfirst budget resolution, and what those outlays actually were. In other \nwords, the difference in what the Government actually spent, as against \nthe estimates of what the Government would spend.\n  So what was estimated on the one hand and what the outlays were on \nthe other hand was a vast difference.\n  So, starting again on the viewer's left, with fiscal year 1980, we \ncan see that outlays were actually $47.6 billion more than what the \nbudget resolution had estimated. If we were to pass a budget \nresolution, we should pass it by May of each year for the following \nfiscal year. This year, 1995, we should expect to pass a budget \nresolution by May for the next fiscal year, which begins on October 1 \nthis year and goes through September 30 next year.\n  In fiscal year 1981, outlays were $47 billion greater; in fiscal year \n1982, the outlays were $33 billion greater;\n And so on and so on.\n\n  The point I am making here, and the viewers can see for themselves \nfrom the chart the errors between the actual outlays, the actual spend-\nout by the Government as against the estimated outlays, the estimated \nGovernment spending, and the viewers will see, again, that in no year \nwas there an accurate estimate.\n  The green line here, represented by ``0,'' represents a situation in \nwhich the estimates and the actual outlays would be right on, so that \nthe ``zero miss,'' a ``zero miss'' estimate--because the estimate would \nbe accurate--hit \n[[Page S2377]]  the nail right on the head. That is the green line.\n  Therefore, the bars represent in each year how much the estimates \nwere off, one way or the other. In some years, the actual outlays were \nmore than the estimated outlays represented by the red line. In a few \nyears, the actual outlays were less than the estimates; in one \ninstance, $91.9 billion less than the estimates. That was in 1993, when \nwe adopted the budget reduction package for which not a Member on that \nside, not one, not a Republican Senator, not a Republican House Member, \nvoted for that budget deficit reduction measure.\n  The point again, as I say, looking at the zero line, meaning absolute \naccuracy, one can see how much in each year the estimate missed the \npoint.\n  What I am showing here is, if we keep our eye on that word \n``Estimates,'' we will see that the estimates are always off, one way \nor the other.\n  Now, chart 3 gives the differences between the actual budget totals \nand the first budget resolution estimates for fiscal years 1980-94, the \nsame period that was addressed by the preceding two charts. The error \nbetween the actual and the estimated deficits in billions of dollars--\nagain, the source of the information is the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the office we depend upon here as we formulate our budget. \nSince the difference between the revenues and the outlays--one chart I \nhave already shown dealt with revenues, the money taken in; the other \nchart I have used dealt with outlays, the money that the Government \nspent.\n  This chart, then, combines the two, in essence, and gives us the \ndifference between the actual budget totals and the first budget \nestimated deficit for fiscal years 1980-1994--the actual deficits. \nSince the difference between the revenues and the outlays, the \ndifference between what the Government takes in on one hand and what \nthe Government has to spend on the other is what makes up the deficit, \nthis third chart shows the difference between what the deficit was \nestimated to be and what it actually turned out to be for those fiscal \nyears 1980-1994. Again, the green line represents ``zero miss,'' \nmeaning the estimate was right on target, the actual was right on \ntarget with the estimate. It was not missed.\n  For fiscal year 1980, the deficit was $36.5 billion--$36.5 billion. \nNow, I see the response team gathering. I am glad. For fiscal year \n1980, the deficit was $36.5 billion, greater than had been estimated. \nFor the next year, 1981, the deficit was $58.3 billion larger than had \nbeen estimated. For fiscal year 1982, $73 billion larger. For fiscal \nyear 1983, the deficit was $91.4 billion greater than had been \nestimated.\n  Keep your eye on the word ``Estimates.'' Skip over here to 1990; the \nbudget deficit was $119.1 billion greater than had been estimated, and \nso on. Those who are viewing the chart to my left can see for \nthemselves.\n  In 2 years, the deficit was less than the estimate. But the point is \nthat in no year was there accuracy. Almost accuracy, very close, in \n1984--missed by $3.7 billion. In 1987, it was missed by $6.2 billion. \nBut look at the range: From $36 billion to $91 billion to $119 billion \nto $71 billion--off. That is not an inconsequential error. That is not \nan inconsequential figure.\n  So the point is that in all of these years covered by the chart, the \nestimates were off. The point of these charts is to show that all \nefforts to estimate outlays and receipts accurately have repeatedly \nfailed--repeatedly failed. Every single year for the past 15 years, the \nestimators have failed to accurately estimate what the deficit would \nbe.\n  In addition, I would also make the point that we do not know if the \nCBO's estimate is off, or if it is, by how much. Get this: We do not \nknow if the CBO's estimate is off, or if it is, by how much until after \nthe fiscal year has been completed. There is no way in God's Heaven, \nwith all of His troops of angels that one--I should not say that about \nGod. I suspect He can foresee these things. But there is no way on \nEarth that we can know what the revenues will be, that we can know what \nthe outlays will be, until the fiscal year is over and gone, until \nafter September 30. We will not know how much the outlays are off, how \nmuch the receipts are off about this particular fiscal year we are in, \nuntil after next September 30 is gone, gone with the wind, and we will \nnot even know it then because the Treasury probably will not have its \nfinal receipts and outlays until October 15, or some such.\n  We simply cannot know with any exactitude what the deficit will be \nduring that fiscal year. By the time we do know, though, it will be too \nlate to correct the problem, at least under the balanced budget \namendment. It will be too late to correct the problem, because what was \nthe instruction in Section 1?\n  The instruction was, in section 1--the mandate:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year.\n\n  We will not know what the total outlays are. We will not know what \nthe total receipts are for this fiscal year until it is gone,\n until the fiscal year is gone, marked off the calendar. In other \nwords, using estimates of revenues and outlays--the money that comes in \nand the money that goes out--it is virtually impossible to determine \nwhether or not the budget will be in balance until after the fiscal \nyear is over, after the horse is out of the barn; the doors are open \nand out go the horses. Too late. In 11 of the past 15 years, revenues \nhave been lower than expected, and in 10 of the 15 years, outlays have \nbeen greater than expected.\n\n  Let me say that again. In 11 of the past 15 years, revenues have been \nlower than the estimates, and in 10 of the 15 years, outlays have been \nhigher than the estimates. And there is nothing in this resolution--\nnothing in this resolution--or in any other resolution or in any other \nversion of the balanced budget amendment that can correct that problem. \nNothing. There is not one among the 100 Senators who can come up with a \nversion that will correct it. Not one. Not 100 working together can \ncorrect, can find a way to accurately estimate what the revenues will \nbe, what the outlays will be, what the deficit will be in any fiscal \nyear. You cannot do it until the chapter is closed, the receipts and \nthe outlays are in and, by then, the door on the fiscal year is gone, \nclosed.\n  How then are we going to come forth with this mandate: ``Total \noutlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that \nfiscal year.* * *''?\n  Yet, Mr. President, despite knowing that the estimates we must work \nwith will inevitably be in error--inevitably--they are exactly what \nthis balanced budget amendment would have us rely on, the word \n``estimates.'' Remember, it says, right there in section 6, that we \n``may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.''\n\n       Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates.\n\n  That is weak, it has no foundation.\n\n     may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.\n\n  If you cannot rely on the estimates, then how can you help but \nviolate this mandate? If estimates cannot be relied upon, then how can \nwe avoid violating this section 1:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year.* * *\n\n  It does not say ``may not.'' It says ``shall not.''\n  So it says there in section 6 that Congress ``may rely on estimates \nof outlays and receipts.'' That is it.\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.\n\n  Now, what does that mean? What are we talking about? As I say, \nsection 1 states:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not--\n\n  Shall not, shall not, shall not--\n\n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.\n\n  No ifs, ands, buts or maybes--``shall not.''\n\n       Total outlays shall not exceed total receipts for that \n     fiscal year.* * *\n\n  Then how will it be done? How will it be done? The magic incantation \nin section 6 is that the ``Congress shall enforce and implement this \narticle by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \noutlays and receipts'' even though we know, by the record, that the \nestimates we must work with will inevitably be in error. They are \nexactly what this balanced budget amendment would have us rely on. It \nsays so. That is what it says. I did not say it. It says so. It says we \nmay rely \n[[Page S2378]]  on estimates of outlays and receipts in balancing that \nbudget. We already have a process for estimating revenues, outlays, and \ndeficits prior to each fiscal year, and as we have seen by the evidence \nthat I have shown, it is far from perfect.\n  So what is Congress to do? It is ludicrous to think that just because \nwe adopt this balanced budget amendment we will somehow come up with a \nnew system that will accurately predict balanced budgets in advance of \neach fiscal year. As I say, it cannot be done. Einstein could not do \nit. Worse than that, Mr. President, is that we will never know if our \nestimates are off or how much they are off until it is too late to \ncorrect that problem. We will not know it, at least not in time to fix \nthe imbalance. These revenue and outlay numbers cannot be calculated \nuntil after a fiscal year is over. Therefore, we have no way of knowing \nduring the fiscal year whether or not outlays are going to exceed \nreceipts until it is too late.\n  Yet, the clear language of the amendment states in no unmistakable \nterms, in simple, down-to-Earth English: Outlays ``shall not'' exceed \nreceipts. That is what the amendment says. I did not write it. I did \nnot write that amendment, but that is what it says: Outlays ``shall \nnot.'' No ifs, ands, buts, maybes--outlays ``shall not'' exceed \nreceipts.\n  Of course, it would be easy to say that all we needed to do to \ncorrect the dilemma is to find more competent budget analysts. Let us \nthrow the rascals out and hire a whole new batch of analysts. \nUnfortunately, it is not that simple. The plain truth is that the men \nand the women who helped put these figures together each year are not \nat fault. They are not at fault. They are as good as one could find \nanywhere in the four winds.\n  If not the analysts, then who is this culprit? In simple terms, the \nmiscalculations that we have seen displayed on these charts can be put \ninto three categories: Policy miscalculations, economic \nmiscalculations, and technical miscalculations. Those are the terms \nused by the Congressional Budget Office to explain the differences \nbetween the budget estimates and what actually occurred each year: \nPolicy, economic, and technical.\n  The first of these terms, policy, refers to any portions of these \ndifferences that can be attributed to the Congress' passing legislation \nthat was not accounted for in the estimates.\n  However, over the 15 fiscal years represented on these charts, policy \ndifferences accounted for the smallest amount of estimation error. In \nfact, enactment of legislation by the Congress since 1990 has been but \na very small portion of the deficit error. The reason for that, Mr. \nPresident, is the pay-as-you-go requirement and the spending caps that \nwere instituted with the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act--which I insisted \non in talking to Mr. Darman right down in my office--the pay-as-you-go \nrequirement, the spending caps that were instituted with the 1990 \nBudget Enforcement Act and extended in the summer of 1993 through the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. Those caps are tough new \nrequirements that have worked to restrain spending, because the only \nway around them is with the designation of an emergency.\n  The second reason for the difference between actual versus estimated \nrevenues, outlays and deficits, is attributed to the failure of budget \nanalysts to anticipate the actual performance of the economy.\n  I know that some Americans may not be aware of the fact that when the \nbudget is put together, it is based on certain economic assumptions. \nFactors such as the gross national product, the unemployment rate, the \ninflation rate, and interest rates must be assumed for the upcoming \nyear. They have to be assumed because they cannot be known.\n  Therefore, if more Americans are unemployed than had been \nanticipated, the Government will have larger outlays for unemployment \ninsurance benefits, food stamps, and so on, than originally thought. \nThis larger payout for these benefits would then be categorized as an \neconomic error. Likewise, if interest rates unexpectedly go up, then \nthe amount of interest we have to pay on the national debt would be \nhigher. This, too, would be considered as an economic error. Nobody can \nhelp it, and no one could foresee it. It just happens.\n  Mr. President, to illustrate the point, we can look to the recent \nrecession. Because that recession was deeper than expected, and the \nrecovery weaker, revenues unexpectedly fell in fiscal year 1992. As a \nconsequence, lower-than-projected revenues, due to the economy's \nfailure to perform as expected, caused the fiscal year 1992 budget \ndeficit to exceed the budget resolution's deficit estimate by $11.4 \nbillion.\n  Finally, the third reason why estimates are inaccurate is due to what \nCBO calls technical differences. This category contains a number of \nitems. Most notable among these are the miscalculations due to rising \nhealth care costs associated with the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n  Mr. President, I know all of these explanations and numbers must be \nmind-numbing to the American people, but they should not be mind-\nnumbing to Senators. The fact that this material may be dry does not \nmake it any less true or important. What is most critical, though, is \nthat the public understands that errors attributable to economic \nfactors--things like higher-than-expected interest rates, or higher-\nthan-expected unemployment--accounted for 64.2 percent of the $28 \nbillion average error in the deficit projection. What that means, \nsimply, is that of all of the factors that account for deficit \nestimates being out-of-sync with reality, nearly two-thirds of the \naverage error over the past 15 years was due to factors that we will \nnever be able to correct, unless, of course, someone has a crystal ball \nthat can accurately tell us at the beginning of each year what the \nunemployment rate, the interest rate, the inflation rate, and the gross \ndomestic product will be throughout that year. It cannot be done.\n  Mr. President, this is why I refer to the word ``estimates'' as being \nthe Achilles' heel of the balanced budget amendment. On the one hand, \nunder this resolution we would be constitutionally bound--bound--to \nbalance the Federal budget every year.\n  That is what it says. I did not write it. That is what the amendment \nsays. ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \nreceipts for that fiscal year.''\n  But while we struggle with that difficult task, the economic \ninformation we have at our disposal will inevitably be in error, and \ntwo-thirds of that error will be due to factors beyond anyone's \ncontrol.\n  Here comes the response team.\n  Is this the response team?\n  Here they are. All right, I am ready to yield any time any one of \nthem wants to ask me a question or make a correction if I am wrong.\n  What a balanced budget amendment amounts to, then, is like telling \nsomeone that they must drive their car 100 miles, but only giving them \n80 miles worth of gas. No matter how hard they try, or how well-\nintentioned they may be, there is just no way on God's green Earth that \nthey can make up that last 20 miles.\n  If we know, then, that we must balance the budget--and that is what \nthe balanced budget amendment says, we must balance it, no ifs, buts, \nwhereases or why, no excuses. If we know that we must balance the \nbudget, and we also know that it is impossible to know what it would \ntake to do that at the beginning of the year, it should be obvious to \neveryone that Congress will be forced to pull out its old bag of tricks \nand bring back the same old smoke and mirrors and rosy scenarios and \nhidden asterisks to make this amendment appear to work. In other words, \nwe will cook the numbers--cook the numbers--and massage the estimates \nin order to be able to try to live up to the new constitutional \nmandate. That will not make the new amendment work, but it may, for a \nlittle while, make it appear to work. Rather than rely on my own \nimagination, I would now like to read to the Senate and to the American \npeople a few suggestions for getting around this amendment that come \nfrom the Senate Judiciary Committee's own report that accompanies \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment.\n  So I have already shown beyond a reasonable doubt to those who have \npatiently listened that this constitutional amendment mandating a \nbalanced budget every year cannot work, and it will not work because it \nis based \n[[Page S2379]]  on an uncorrectable flaw, that flaw being the word \n``estimates.'' And Congress is to enforce this amendment by relying on \nthat Achilles' heel, that uncorrectable flaw, the word ``estimates.''\n  So beyond any reasonable doubt, to any reasonable man, it is obvious, \nit is plain as the nose on your face that it is flawed, that it cannot \nwork, because it is based on the word ``estimates.''\n  So then what are we going to do? I said I would also prove beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the committee report recognizes this is not going \nto work. The committee report recognizes that. How many of you have \nread that report? Here it is. This is the committee report by the \nCommittee on the Judiciary when it reported out Senate Joint Resolution \n1. This is the committee report that accompanied the resolution, when \nthe resolution was reported.\n  So the committee report itself comes up with some suggestions as to \nhow we might get around it. Why would the committee do that? Why would \nthe committee itself come up with some suggestions as to how we might \navoid the strict mandate, if the committee itself did not recognize \nthat there is an uncorrectable flaw? Why would the committee itself \nrecommend certain suggestions by which we may have escape hatches--the \ncommittee itself?\n  So, rather than rely on my imagination, I would now like to read to \nthe Senate and to the American people a few suggestions for getting \naround this amendment that come from the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nown report that accompanies Senate Joint Resolution 1--the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Before proceeding, Mr. President, I want to explain that I am reading \nfrom the Senate Judiciary Committee's report on the balanced budget \namendment. On page 19--I will even give you the page number, page 19. \nHear me now. The response team--sit up in your seats. Listen. I am \ngoing to expect you to tackle me while I am on the floor, now. Look on \npage 19 of the committee report.\n  On page 19 of the Senate's report--get it and read it--Senate report \n104-5, it is stated that this provision gives Congress--``this \nprovision'' meaning section 6.\n  What does section 6 mean? ``This provision''--meaning section 6--\n``gives Congress an appropriate degree of flexibility in fashioning \nnecessary implementing legislation.'' What is meant by ``flexibility?''\n  The report continues:\n\n       For example, Congress could use estimates of receipts or \n     outlays at the beginning of the fiscal year to determine \n     whether the balanced budget requirement of section 1 would be \n     satisfied, so long as the estimates were reasonable and made \n     in good faith.\n\n  Read that again. For example, Congress could use estimates.''\n  There is that Achilles heel.\n\n       . . . could use estimates of receipts or outlays at the \n     beginning of the fiscal year to determine whether the \n     balanced budget requirement of section 1 would be satisfied, \n     so long as the estimates were reasonable and made in good \n     faith.\n\n  Does this mean that, if we pass a budget that is balanced at the \nbeginning of the year, at least on paper, we need not worry if the \nbudget becomes unbalanced during the course of the year? Is that the \nideal we are supposed to include in our implementing legislation? Is \nthat what the sponsors of this amendment have in mind? I think that is \na very different approach than what the American people are expecting \nfrom a balanced budget amendment.\n  We have already seen that estimates of revenues and outlays are \ninvariably wrong, and that is understandable, as we have explained. But \nthe committee report says:\n\n       Congress could use estimates of receipts or outlays at the \n     beginning of the fiscal year to determine whether the \n     balanced budget requirement of section 1 would be satisfied, \n     so long as the estimates were reasonable and made in good \n     faith.\n\n  Who knows what reasonable is? Who will be the judge? As Alexander \nPope said, ``Who shall decide when doctors disagree?'' So, who shall \ndecide what ``reasonable'' is? What may appear to be reasonable in my \nthinking may not appear to be reasonable in the next person's thinking. \nWho decides what is reasonable? Who will make that decision?\n  It goes on to say: ``* * * so long as the estimates were reasonable \nand made in good faith.''\n  Who knows what ``good faith'' is? How do we know whether the \nestimates were made in good faith? How do we know? Who is to say? Who \nis to know whether they were made in good faith? Who is the judge? This \nis plainly an escape hatch and it is in the committee report by the \nJudiciary Committee. Did the Judiciary Committee not know about the \ninconsistencies in the estimates between outlays and receipts? Was \nthere not anyone on that committee who knew that estimates are \ninvariably wrong when produced by the CBO, estimates of the revenues \nand receipts and deficit? Did anyone ever think of it?\n  The next sentence states: In addition, Congress could decide that a \ndeficit caused by a temporary, self-correcting drop in receipts or \nincrease in outlays during the fiscal year would not violate the \narticle.\n  Congress could decide that. Mr. President, what that sentence says to \nme, is that, at the same time that the proponents of this amendment are \ntelling the American people that a constitutional amendment will bring \nabout balanced budgets, they are telling the Congress that they do not \nexpect us to practice what we preach. That is just incredible. If we \nfollowed this advice and the Congress codified a broad definition of \nthe words ``temporary'' and ``self-correcting,'' then we will have \nfound another escape hatch--aha, there it is, this is another escape \ndoor that we all know will be needed under this amendment. But will \nthat be what the American people expect from this amendment?\n  The proponents have trumpeted from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from \nthe Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico: This is the wonder cure. \nThis is the wonder drug, a prescription for budget deficits. A \npolitician appearing before an audience, can ask the question--I have \nbeen out there on those hustings a few times--``How many of you believe \nthat we ought to have a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution?'' All hands will go up. ``Well, I want to tell you, \nladies and gentlemen, you elect me, and I will vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.''\n  Get your applause meters going. That is a sure way to ring the bell. \nThis wonder drug is the way to get votes. It is not a sure cure--it may \nbe a cure that kills--but it is a sure way to get votes.\n  Reading again from the committee report--that the Judiciary Committee \nwrote for our edification when it reported the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget to the Senate floor--the next sentence states: \n``Similarly, Congress could state that very small or negligible \ndeviations from a balanced budget would not represent a violation of \nsection 1 .''\n  Now get that. Let us read that again.\n  ``Similarly, Congress could state that very small or negligible \ndeviations from a balanced budget would not represent a violation of \nsection 1''--which says total outlays, total Government spendout, shall \nnot exceed total Government income in any fiscal year.\n  How small is small? How small is a negligible deviation? Is the term \ndeficit now a variable which Congress can manipulate by saying that a \ndeficit is not a deficit is not a deficit?\n  It reminds me of Abraham when he intervened on behalf of the city of \nSodom. He asked God, if perchance there were 50 good men in Sodom, \nwould God destroy Sodom. God said no. Well, perchance there were five \nless than 50, perchance there were 45, would God destroy Sodom. God \nsaid no. Well, perchance there were 40 good men, would God destroy \nSodom. God said no. Perchance if there were 30? God said no. Well, even \nif there were just 20? God said no, he will not do it. Well, even if \nthere were just 10? God said no, if there were just 10, he would not \ndestroy Sodom. So God answered that if there were 10 righteous men in \nSodom, he would spare the city.\n  This is the same thing in a reverse sort of way.\n  If Congress could state that very small, or negligible, deviations \nfrom a balanced budget would not represent a violation of section 1, \nhow small is small? Is it $5 billion? Will you spare us if it is just \n$5 billion? Well, they will spare it. Well, what if it is $10 billion? \nWill you spare us? May we consider that we balanced the budget if we \nonly \n[[Page S2380]]  miss it by $10 billion? Well, we may. How about $20 \nbillion? How about $30 billion? How about $50 billion? What is wrong if \nit is $11 billion? How about $12 billion? If $12 billion is only a \n``negligible'' deviation, how about $20 billion, $30 billion, $50 \nbillion? Is $75 billion a negligible deviation? How about $175 billion?\n  So here, Mr. President, one has to ask the question. Where do we \nstop? What is ``negligible?'' What is ``small?''\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I will be glad to.\n  Is the Senator from one of the renowned ``special response'' teams?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am not sure. I asked to come to the floor--\n  Mr. BYRD. Now is a good time to find out.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To listen and to learn. I was just questioning--\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder if the Senator would wait until I finish, if we \ncould.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You said ``interrupt me'' any time for questions. So I \nthought I was free to do so.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is really one of the ``ready response'' teams.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was just questioning. Are you suggesting that \nnegligible amounts could mean rather extraordinary amounts? You are not \nsuggesting that a Member of the Senate would violate his constitutional \noath of office to uphold the Constitution which requires a balanced \nbudget? You would not be suggesting that someone would deliberately \nviolate their oath of office by allowing a large deficit to occur when \nthe Constitution says that cannot occur?\n  Mr. BYRD. It depends on what the Senator means. When he said would a \nSenator ``deliberately violate his oath of office,'' I am looking at \nwhat the amendment says. I did not write it, Senator. I did not sign \nonto that Contract With America. I have not gone around the country \nsaying that the answer to our deficit problem is a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. You perhaps did. I did not.\n  I am pointing out that that constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, which you swore to vote for, probably has flaws. Unless you \nrewrite that language that is in that constitutional amendment, which I \ndid not write, you are not going to correct that flaw, and it is going \nto be based on estimates which I have already said are invariably \nwrong. It is not whether a Senator would knowingly violate his oath. It \nis what the amendment says, that your party for the most part wrote. I \ndid not write it. I am looking at the language. It is plain, \nunmistakable, clear English language.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield for an additional question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, does the plain, unmistakable, clear \nlanguage say the budget ``shall'' not? I mean, is not that very clear \nfrom the language, that it ``shall'' not be?\n  Mr. BYRD. Read it, in case the Senator has not read it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have read it on many occasions, just here today.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has not read it all. It says ``shall not exceed \ntotal outlays for any fiscal year--``shall not.'' It does not say ``may \nnot.''\n  Let me respond. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed \ntotal receipts for that fiscal year. That leaves no wiggle room. You \nought to read that. You and your colleagues who are proponents of this \nlanguage ought to take a microscope and look at that language.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator from West Virginia will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is plain, it is simple.\n  Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is exactly my point. It is very clear that it says \nit ``shall not exceed'' and the suggestion that you have made is that a \n$75 billion deficit would be permitted under the Constitution, it seems \nto me.\n  Mr. BYRD. No. No. I did not say it would be permitted. I did not say \nit would be permitted. I said under the Constitution no missed \nestimates would be permitted. It says what it says. The total outlays \nfor any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal \nyear. I did not say we would permit $5 billion, permit $10 billion or \n$75 billion. The Senator was not listening to me. I was talking about \nAbraham, and how he approached God, and said, well, if there are 50 \nmen, righteous men, in Sodom, would you spare them? God said yes. What \nabout 45? Yes. What about 50? Yes. What about 35, 30, 20, 10?\n  So where do we stop here? That is what I am saying. If you are going \nto say in this section 6, the Congress shall enforce and implement this \narticle by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \noutlays and receipts, and if you are going to say in the committee \nreport, the Congress could state that very small or negligible \ndeviations from a balanced budget would not represent a violation, what \nis ``small?'' What is ``very small?'' I was saying is 75 very small? Is \nthat negligible? Is 50 small? So you tell me. What is small in that \ncontext? What is small?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if the Senator from West Virginia will \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My question to you, Senator, is the language from the \nconstitutional amendment is very clear, that at the end of the fiscal \nyear revenues will not exceed--excuse me. Expenditures will not exceed \nrevenues. That is very clear.\n  Mr. BYRD. It does not say ``at the end.'' You might want to read what \nthe constitutional amendment says. ``Total outlays for any fiscal year \nshall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.'' How are you \ngoing to know until the fiscal year is behind you?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is exactly right. That was my point. You will not \nknow whether you have met the charge of the constitutional amendment \nuntil the end of the year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Until the end of the year.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct. At that point we will have to have \nsatisfied that condition. Correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. The year is gone.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct. I am sure the Senator knows that does \nnot mean that all expenditures or outlays have been in fact expended. \nSo we could rescind. We could, as has been done here, retroactively \ntax. There are all sorts of options available to satisfy that amendment \nafter the fact.\n  Is not that the case?\n  Mr. BYRD. No. Let me finish, will you?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You asked me. You permitted me to ask questions. So I \nwas complying.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to answer your question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. You stay around.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am not moving.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have the suggestion that the Congress \ncould just stand up and declare that certain amounts of the deficit, as \nlong as we determined them to be ``negligible,'' they are not in \nviolation of the amendment.\n  A $25 billion deviation--Congress could say it is OK.\n   It is small. It is small in comparison to what? When considered in \nthe context of a budget that is $1.5 trillion, it is negligible. But if \nwe were to constitutionalize the mandate that outlays must not exceed \nreceipts--outlays must not exceed receipts, let me say that to my \nfriend--if we were to constitutionalize the mandate that outlays must \nnot exceed receipts, a congressional attempt to deviate from that \nrequirement would bring the moral authority of the entire Constitution \ninto question. I will say that again. If we were to constitutionalize a \nmandate that outlays shall not exceed receipts--that is what the \namendment says. I did not write it. I do not subscribe to it.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. It does not say ``may not.'' The amendment mandates that \noutlays ``shall not exceed receipts.'' If we were to constitutionalize \nthe mandate, any attempt to deviate from that requirement would bring \nthe moral authority of the entire Constitution into question. If the \nCongress can violate this amendment with impunity, then what other \nprovisions of the Constitution might be in peril?\n  Finally--and then I will be glad to yield; we now have two members of \nthe response team here, and I see another one on the far side of the \nenemy territory--if Congress can violate this amendment with impunity, \nthen what other provisions of the Constitution \n[[Page S2381]]  might be in peril? Finally, the last sentence in this \nparagraph states, ``If an excess of outlays over receipts''--I think \nthis gets to the question of the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. \nSantorum]--``were to occur, Congress can require that any shortfall \nmust be made up during the following fiscal year.''\n  So there you have it. Now I will take the question of the Senator. \nBut, you see, this is the final escape hatch that I will mention today:\n\n       If an excess of outlays over receipts were to occur, \n     Congress can require that any shortfall must be made up \n     during the following fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, in the last sentence, the \noperative underlined that I see is the word ``can'' require. They do \nnot have to do so. But they can. They also have the option, if I \nunderstand, to rescind, retroactively tax, or ``by a three-fifths \nvote''--and you did not read the rest of that, but ``by a three-fifths \nvote impose a balanced budget.''\n  So there are options available, are there not, to the Congress and to \nthe President under the balanced budget amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. There we have it. A member of the response team is saying, \n``There are options, are there not?'' Let us read this first paragraph \nof the balanced budget amendment:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year . . .\n\n  It does not give you any option. It does not give me any option. The \nAmerican people out there can read and they can understand.\n  Senator, you can say all you want to, and you can weasel around the \nword ``can.''\n\n       If an excess of outlays over receipts were to occur, \n     Congress can require . . .\n\n  Well, that is an escape hatch. It can require----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator, but I do not \nwant to be interrupted in the middle of a sentence. I will read it \nagain:\n\n       If an excess of outlays over receipts were to occur, \n     Congress can require that any shortfall must be made up \n     during the following fiscal year.\n\n  That is an ``option,'' the Senator says. The American people out \nthere who are reading do not see that option. In the plain, simple \nEnglish words of the constitutional amendment to balance the budget:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year . . .\n\n  It does not say anything about an option.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There is a dependent clause after ``Total outlays for \nany fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year . \n. .''\n  It then says `` . . . unless three-fifths of the whole number of each \nHouse of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays \nover receipts by a rollcall vote.''\n  So there is an option clearly stated in the constitutional amendment; \nis there not?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator was not here when I said earlier that at a \nlater date, I will talk about the supermajorities. I read it when I \nfirst brought the chart out. The Senator was not here. I first brought \nthis out, and I read the entire thing, laid it all out. Every time I \nraised it to the public view, they could all see the remaining clause. \nI said that I will only deal with this first clause.\n  Yes, it provides for an additional supermajority in the Constitution, \nwhich will raise to 10 the total number of supermajorities that are in \nthe original Constitution and the amendments thereto. It will be raised \nto a new level when we get down to the raising of the statutory debt \nlimit. So much for supermajorities today. The Senator may say what he \nwishes about the supermajority.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would like to refer to your charts talking about the \ndeficit estimates and that they are unreliable. You say they are \nestimates at the beginning of the fiscal year. By the Congressional \nBudget Office?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. When you say at the beginning--my understanding is that \nthe Congressional Budget Office issues two reports, one in August and \none in January. Which one does that refer to?\n  Mr. BYRD. You are talking about the midsession review, the one in \nAugust. But, Senator----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is this the January report you are referring to?\n  Mr. BYRD. It has to be, which you will learn after a while. I welcome \nthis exchange. I think that is what has been missing in so much of \nthis. We all get on the floor and make our speeches, but we do not \ndebate. So I welcome this exchange and I congratulate the Senator and \ncommend him. But I happen to be on the Appropriations Committee, so I \nknow a little about what I am saying. I helped to write the 1974 Budget \nAct.\n  The resolution on the budget should be enacted by May of each year. \nAnd it is only after that budget resolution is enacted that the \nchairmen of the Appropriations Committees of the two Houses allocate \nthose funds to their subcommittees. And it is only after that that the \nappropriations bills start coming through.\n  But prior to the budget resolution in May, the Congressional Budget \nOffice prepares its estimates of revenues and receipts and deficits for \nthe forthcoming fiscal year and projects those 5 years down the road.\n  What I have been saying is that, in addition to the flaw, the word \n``estimates,'' which by these charts--and which you are going to ask me \nabout in a moment--have been shown to be invariably wrong. The \nCongress, the House, and the Senate have to depend on those CBO \nestimates in enacting the budget resolution, after which, as I say, the \nallocations of funds and then the appropriations of moneys come to \npass. But all that is in advance of the fiscal year. It is in advance \nof the beginning of the next fiscal year. And we have shown by the \ncharts that those estimates are invariably wrong.\n  Now the question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I may, my question is--and I think you have answered \nit in part--that these estimates on your chart reflect an estimate that \nwas done some 6 months prior to the fiscal year; is that correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Are there not subsequent updates by the Congressional \nBudget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and reports from \nthe Treasury as to actual receipts and revenues that one could, if one \nwere in Congress or the Senate, adjust to meet the updated projections \nso we would have a better idea where we were going to be by the time we \nreach the end of the year?\n  Mr. BYRD. There is the midsession review. But, I say to the Senator, \nthat midsession review still is going to be based on estimates. It \ncannot actually foresee what the revenues will be for the remaining \nmonths, or what the outlays will be.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Besides, the nearer we get to the end of that fiscal year, \nthe greater is the pain if one tries to make a correction in the \nremaining 6 months, 5 months, 4 months, 3 months, 2 months, 1 month.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator continue to yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is it not possible, under implementing legislation, for \nus to require the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of \nManagement and Budget to put forth a monthly calculation of what the \ndeficit will be so we have our finger on the pulse of what the revenues \nand outlays will be so that, in fact, farther out from that final end \nof fiscal year, we might be able to adjust if we see from those \nestimates that we are going to run into trouble? In fact, is that not \none of the problems now that we do not do that; we do not react based \non what we know from continuing estimates?\n  Mr. BYRD. I have two or three things I would like to say in response \nto that question. Is the Senator suggesting monthly budget resolutions?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, I am not. I am suggesting that the Congressional \nBudget Office could do monthly estimates as to what the deficit will be \nfor that fiscal year so we might have a better understanding of what we \nare going \n[[Page S2382]]  to be faced with at the end of that fiscal year.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is going to be pretty difficult for the Congressional \nBudget Office to anticipate what interest rates may be a month from \nnow, 2 months from now. We do not know what Mr. Greenspan is going to \nsay. The Senator knows that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if the Senator from West Virginia would \nyield, they do that now as part of the estimate process.\n  All I am suggesting is they do it every month as opposed to twice a \nyear so we have a better idea what we will be facing at the end of that \nyear.\n  Mr. BYRD. Once the Senator has been here to see and hear the \nprolonged and sometimes bitter debate on the budget resolution--I hope \nhe would not be suggesting that we are going to have subsequent budget \nresolutions every month or so. There can be a substitute one under law. \nBut here he comes talking about implementing legislation. Who is going \nto pass the implementing legislation? Congress, right?\n  Now, how can the Senator say that 10 years out implementing \nlegislation will do thus or so, or it will not do thus and so? He may \nbe here. I doubt that I will be.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I hope so.\n  Mr. BYRD. But nobody can promise what implementing legislation will \ndo or what it will not do. Nobody can say ``Well, this is not the \nintention.'' ``This is not the intention.'' ``That is not the \nintention.''\n  Those are the words of a Senator at a given time here during this \ndebate. That is not his intention, but nobody can say what the \nintention of Senators will be 10 years from now. We are talking about \nimplementing legislation.\n  Here we are talking about a Constitution that does not change from \nmonth to month or year to year. It may be here for decades or centuries \nif it is not repealed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is it not customary that constitutional amendments, \nafter the passage of that amendment, there is usually some legislation \nenacted to implement that legislation? Is that normally the course?\n  Mr. BYRD. Some constitutional amendments state that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is not unprecedented that we would have an \nimplementing piece of legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is not. Some amendments, especially those that were \npassed during the Civil War and the Reconstruction era, specifically \nprovide for implementing legislation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In fact, would you not suggest that with this \nconstitutional amendment it would be incumbent upon us to pass some \nsort of implementing legislation?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, it says that Congress shall enforce the act in \nsection 6, Congress shall enforce it by appropriate legislation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So would you suggest that requires us to pass an \nimplementing piece of legislation?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am suggesting that that legislation may rely on estimates \nof outlays and receipts, and I am saying that the estimates are \ninvariably wrong. Consequently, it is an uncorrectable flaw in the \namendment. Consequently, the American people cannot depend upon this \namendment to balance the budget.\n  And I am saying also that the Judiciary Committee must have known \nthat when they wrote the committee report to give us several \nscapegoats.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I could reiterate my question, does section 6, in \nyour opinion, require us to pass some sort of implementing legislation?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will read you what it says. ``Congress shall''--not \nmaybe, but shall--``enforce and implement this article by appropriate \nlegislation which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.''\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield for a further question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The next chart that you brought up after those was the \ncommittee report which talked about implementing legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And from what you read in the plain language of the \nconstitutional amendment, we are under some obligation to implement \nthis act by some form of implementing legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. We are under an obligation to make that amendment work. And \nI am saying we cannot, do not have any intention of making it work, \nbecause the committee is giving us a way out when it says we can rely \non estimates.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Would we not have the opportunity to require the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, whatever, to come up with more current monthly, \nmaybe even more often, deficit projections to guide the hand of the \nCongress in trying to meet the stated purpose of the constitutional \namendment, which is that expenditures do not exceed revenues? Could we \nnot do that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I hope we would. I hope we would.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Would that not at least ameliorate the problem of an \nestimate 6 months prior to the fiscal year, fully 18 months before the \nend of that fiscal year, which arguably is not going to be exactly \naccurate? But, as we all know, as we get closer to the fiscal year and \nin the fiscal year, we would have a much better idea of what the final \noutcome of that year would be. So we would be able to react.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, it will not work.\n  Suppose you have a disaster in June, July, August, September, a \ndisaster that costs $10 billion? You cannot foresee that. You cannot \ndepend on estimates, if you want to be accurate. And the first section, \nsection 1, does not give you any room to be inaccurate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I go back to this clause, ``unless three-fifths of the \nwhole number.''\n  I was looking the other day at the emergency supplemental \nappropriations that we have passed in this Congress that violate the \ncaps, and I noticed an amazing thing. That almost all of them passed by \nmore than three-fifths of the whole number of the House and Senate. So \nwe seem to be able to, when faced with some structure of the budget, to \ncome to a consensus and pass it, in very large numbers, with very large \npluralities, to respond to a national emergency.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, we do. Sometimes we do not.\n  But you still add to the deficit, no matter whether you call it an \nemergency or not.\n  I am glad the Senator raised that point, because it does raise some \nquestions in my mind as to whether that is actually going to be the \ncase.\n  Let me read a letter to the President, dated February 7, signed by \nthe leadership of the other body, Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House; \nRichard Armey, majority leader of the House; John Kasich, chairman of \nthe Committee on the Budget; and Bob Livingston, chairman of the House \nCommittee on Appropriations. Here is what it says:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: The fiscal year 1996 budget which you \n     transmitted to Congress contains an additional $10.4 billion \n     in supplemental budget requests for fiscal year 1995. Your \n     budget submission further reflects only $2.4 billion in \n     rescissions and savings for FY 1995. Most of these requests \n     are for emergencies.\n       The House Appropriations Committee will proceed to review \n     and act on these requests but highest priority will be given \n     to replenishing the accounts in the Department of Defense \n     badly depleted by contingencies in the Persian Gulf, Somalia, \n     Rwanda, Haiti and other activities. The committee and the \n     House, in turn, will act only after offsets for these \n     activities have been identified. However, we will not act on \n     the balance of the request until you [meaning the President] \n     have identified offsets and deductions to make up the balance \n     of the funding. Whether these activities are emergencies or \n     not [this is the House leadership writing to the President] \n     it will be our policy to pay for them rather than to add to \n     our already immense deficit problem.\n       We therefore ask you to identify additional rescissions as \n     soon as possible so we can move expeditiously on your \n     supplemental request.\n\n  Now, there is no guarantee there. There is no guarantee as I read \nthere from the letter written by the leadership of the other body, no \nguarantee that they will agree that such expenditures for disasters \nwill be considered as \n[[Page S2383]]  emergencies and, therefore, not charged against the \nbudget caps.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Senator from West Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been listening to the conversation \nbetween the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I would be interested in whether or not the statement \nI am making is true. It is my understanding that interest rates have \nbeen raised the past year six or eight times. Does the Senator from \nWest Virginia know that to be accurate?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, they have been raised several times.\n  Mr. REID. Would that have some bearing on making estimates?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is no question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in fact, as the Senator from Nevada, it is \nmy understanding, if we were going to make estimates a year ago not \nknowing if the interest rates would be raised, they would be totally \noff base as to the estimates because they have been raised a \nsignificant number of times this past year, is that not right?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Now, it is my understanding the interest on the debt yearly \npayment is over $300 billion a year; is that about right?\n  Mr. BYRD. About $235 billion.\n  Mr. REID. And going up as the Fed raises interest rates, so that \nwould affect your estimates, would it not?\n  Mr. BYRD. That would.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I, who hold the \nfloor, may ask the Senator a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, can the Senator--he was talking about \ndisasters and how normally there are the votes here in the House and \nSenate to respond to supplemental requests for disasters and thereby \nwaive this deficit requirement as it would appear in the new \nconstitutional amendment. Does he feel he can assure the Senate that \nthe House leadership will back off in this statement that they made to \nthe President in the letter which I read?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as the Senator from West Virginia knows \nand as we discussed, the three-fifths override provision in the \nconstitutional amendment is but an option available to this body to \nfund emergencies.\n  Another option that is available is the one that is detailed in that \nletter which is to rescind obligated moneys from the prior year.\n  So that is what they have suggested in that letter, which I think, \ngiven our deficit state at this point, is the most responsible way to \ndo it. I wholeheartedly support that effort, and I think it is the \nresponsible way to do it. It can clearly continue to be an option under \nthe constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator feel that with the House majority \nleadership taking a clear and strong position against supplemental \nappropriations for this purpose, is the Senator about to tell me that \nthree-fifths of the House would vote to waive it, with the Republican \nmajority over there against such a waiver?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest to the Senator from West \nVirginia that the majority of the Members of the House would vote for a \nrescission package to fund it, which would accomplish the same thing.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is not talking about a majority. He earlier was \ntalking about a supermajority.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was talking options available. One is a \nsupermajority, one is a simple majority of rescissions.\n  Mr. BYRD. I go back to this plain and simple language, Senator. You \ncan argue with me as long as you want to argue, until you are blue in \nthe face, but your argument does not, in plain, simple English \nlanguage--and that is your amendment; that is the amendment which you \ntold the voters of Pennsylvania you would support.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest that that is exactly what they are doing.\n  Mr. BYRD. Wait, just wait, Senator. I was not born yesterday.\n  I am directing your attention to this language. This is the language. \nThis is what we will vote on. Not what somebody is talking about in \nWest Virginia or Pennsylvania or anywhere else.\n  This is the language. ``Total outlays for fiscal year shall not''--\nshall not--``exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.'' There is no \noption mentioned in that amendment. The option is mentioned in the \ncommittee report.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Are we still under the unanimous consent which he has \nyielded to me so I can respond, or do I need to ask?\n  Mr. BYRD. You do not have to ask unanimous consent to ask me a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So we are past the point in which you asked me a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, yes, you are on the response team. I am just going to \ntry to answer your question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You held up the letter from the House Republican \nleadership talking about an emergency supplemental appropriation. That \nwould be an appropriation above what is normally budgeted for?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What the House leadership responded was, they would be \nhappy to comply with the request but we want to find other measures \nwithin that budget to offset those expenditures.\n  Mr. BYRD. As I read, they said they would be happy to comply with the \nrequest as it pertains to defense.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But they also said--did they not ask the President to \nfind rescissions to offset those expenditures?\n  Mr. BYRD. They did.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Which would then comply with the balanced budget \namendment, would it not?\n  Mr. BYRD. The balanced budget amendment does not say anything about \nthat.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, would it not be in keeping with the \nbalanced budget amendment that they would offset so that the deficit \nwould show zero based on that particular transaction?\n  Mr. BYRD. The balanced budget amendment requires a balanced budget, \nno matter how you reach it. Got to hit it on the head. There is no \nwiggle room, Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am not suggesting there is. I am suggesting what they \nare doing is the responsible thing.\n  Is it not your understanding that what they are saying is that they \nwant to offset new expenditures with spending cuts from someplace else \nin the budget?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is what they are saying with respect to the disaster \nor to those parts of the supplemental requests that do not deal with \ndefense.\n  I am not arguing whether they are reasonable or whether they are not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Are you arguing that is outside the purview of the \nbalanced budget amendment--what they are doing is outside? That would \nbe violative of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, I am not arguing that at all. This is my argument. I \nwant the Senator to keep in view in his mental vision what the \namendment says. ``Total outlays shall not exceed total receipts for any \nfiscal year.''\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator from West Virginia will yield for a \nquestion, Mr. President, does that letter that you read to me as an \nexample violate the constitutional amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, no, no.\n  Does the Senator think it does?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not either, but that is beside the point, as to \nwhether it violates the Constitution.\n  Does the Senator have any further questions?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am sure I will. Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for his question. I would much rather \nhave an exchange out here than just standing and reading a speech. I \nreally mean that. I would like to see more of an exchange rather than \njust written speeches. So I am not perturbed by it. I am encouraged by \nit. At least somebody is listening.\n  At least somebody is paying attention, and that somebody is giving me \na chance to answer some questions. I \n[[Page S2384]]  would be happy if the response team would continue to \ngather. Let us have more of an exchange. I apologize to other Senators \nwho may want to speak.\n  So there you have it. What a prescription for a balanced budget. That \nis a massive loophole. Let me read it again. ``If an excess of outlays \nover receipts were to occur, Congress can require that any shortfall \nmust be made up during the following fiscal year.''\n  Now, there is another scapegoat. That is a loophole that, if adopted \nby the Congress as part of its implementing legislation, would be big \nenough for Attila, the king of the Huns, and the scourge of God, to \ndrive his 700 Scythian horsemen through.\n  What the sponsors of the amendment are telling us is that, if \nCongress cannot figure out what to do, if Congress runs into options \ntoo difficult to swallow, Congress can just require that the shortfall \nbe made up the next year. Just put it off until the next year.\n  Now what kind of fiscal shenanigan is this? If you cannot balance one \nyear, just roll it over to the next? That is not what that \nconstitutional amendment mandates in the first section; that is not \nwhat the American people are being told. Just roll it over until the \nnext year. Mr. President, what kind of fiscal witchcraft is this?\n  Let me emphasize again, these suggestions for dealing with the \ndeficit under a balanced budget amendment come from the committee's \nreport. Every Senator, every Senator's office should get that report. \nRead the escape hatches for yourselves, and then ask yourself, am I \ngoing to vote for that kind of a sham? Am I going to fool the American \npeople when they can read, they can see, they can know that amendment \nhas uncorrectable flaws in it. And the Judiciary Committee must have \nunderstood that when it came through with its committee report \nproviding for some escape hatches.\n  As such, these suggestions in the committee report would not become \npart of the underlying resolution if it were to pass. They are not \ngoing to be incorporated into the constitutional amendment. They would \nnot have any force of law. But, nevertheless, they give the American \npeople some idea of the kinds of gimmicks and evasions the people can \nexpect to see if this constitutional amendment is adopted by the \nCongress and ratified by three-fourths of the States.\n  The American people are being sold a bag of budget tricks. Is this \nwhat the American people want? Is that what you want, Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica? Are the American people being told about the realities of what \nit would take to balance the budget each and every year? The people \nhave a right to know these things.\n  As I listen to those who speak in favor of a balanced budget \namendment, I do not hear them telling the public that we really intend \njust to carry the deficit over into the following year.\n  Let us take a look at that chart again. What this committee report is \ntelling us is that Congress may roll over this deficit from one year to \nthe next.\n\n       If an excess of outlays over receipts were to occur, \n     Congress can require that any shortfall must be made up \n     during the following fiscal year.\n\n  That means taking the year 1980, for example, when there was a \nshortfall between the actual and estimated deficit of $36 billion. So \nwhat this committee report is saying is, ``Senators, just vote it over \nto the next year, don't worry about it.''\n  The next year, we see that it misses by $58 billion and the next year \nby $73 billion and the next year over $91 billion.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator allow me to finish? I do not have much \nfurther to read, and I will be happy to yield.\n  So what they are saying is, ``Roll it over, roll it over to the next \nyear, that is OK.'' That is not what the American people out there are \nexpecting from those who are the proponents of this balanced budget \namendment.\n  The proponents are saying, ``Let's have a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. Let's do it like you do, Mr. and Mrs. America, you \nand your families, you do it every year. We ought to have to do it.''\n  That is saying we ought to do it like the States have to do it. They \nhave constitutional amendments to balance their budget. Well, I will \ntalk more about those pretenses at some other point. But this is what \nyou are being told; the American people are being told that if there is \nan excess in the deficit one year, it can be rolled over to the next.\n  Senators ought to read this constitutional amendment. They ought to \nread the committee report by the Judiciary Committee in the Senate \nwhich accompanied the resolution when it was reported to the floor. \nThey ought to read it. It will not work. The Judiciary Committee knows \nit will not work. One only needs to read the report to understand that \nthe Judiciary Committee saw there were going to be problems with it.\n  You will not hear the proponents telling the public that the Congress \nwill just stand up and declare the deficit ``negligible,'' and so we \nare not going to deal with it.\n  I do not hear them telling the American people that, if this measure \nis passed and ratified, the implementing legislation will only require \nthat the budget be balanced on paper at the beginning of the year. That \nis not what the American people are being told.\n  Tell them the truth. And Senators know they are not being told that. \nSenators know or ought to know what this amendment says, what the words \nplainly state.\n  Senators ought not be willing to hoodwink the American people into \nsupporting something that the American people can read and can \nunderstand. And it is not going to work. The committee report just as \nplainly states that.\n  Mr. President, if this matter were not so serious, if it were not so \ndangerous to the delicate separation and balance of powers that were \nput in place more than 200 years ago, and if it would not have such \ncataclysmic effects on the economic well-being of the American people, \nwhat we have seen today, with respect just to section 6 would be \nlaughable. It would be laughable. But it is really not laughable. And \nthe sooner the American people begin to understand that, and the sooner \nthe Members of this body understand that, the sooner we will realize \nthe serious policy choices that must be made if we are to put our \nfiscal house in order.\n  Mr. President, how much confidence do even the authors of this \namendment have, if right in the committee report, they start figuring \nout ways to get around this amendment? How much confidence do the \nproponents have--the sponsors of the amendment--if right in the \ncommittee report they start figuring out ways to get around the \namendment? No, Mr. President, this amendment is not worthy of being \nenshrined in our Constitution. It is little more than political catnip \noffered to disguise the real difficulty of getting our budgets in \nbalance. I do not think we should perpetrate this charade upon the \nAmerican people. That is what it is.\n  I want to see our deficits reduced as much as any Senator here wants \nto see them reduced. I voted for a package to reduce them in 1990. I \nvoted for a package to reduce the budget deficits in 1993. So I believe \nwe ought to get control of them. But not a single Republican Senator, \nnot one of those who are proponents of this constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget voted for that budget deficit reduction measure in \n1993. Not one Member of the House, not one Republican Member did that. \nAnd yet today they say we need a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  If it were simply a political sham, which it is, if it were just a \npolitical dodge, which it is, it would be regrettable and unwise to \nadopt. But it is much, much worse than those things.\n  This proposal is dangerous. Within its murky appeal and unsound \nformula for budget balance lie the seeds for the further diminishment \nof the trust of the people in their Government. They do not trust the \nGovernment much now. They do not trust politicians much now. They do \nnot trust Members of Congress much now. The legislative branch can ill-\nafford any more cynicism and loss of trust. And this Senator worries as \nmuch about the trust deficit as he does about the budget deficit.\n   [[Page S2385]] Often Members believe that doing what seems to be the \nsafe thing--in other words, the popular thing--will prove also to be \nthe right thing. Political correctness is supposed to be the order of \nthe day, I guess. I believe that endorsing this balanced budget \namendment has taken on the aura of a politically correct act. It has \nbecome a litmus test of sorts--the right choice to make the political \nproprietary meter register 100 percent in one's favor.\n  But whether or not we amend the Constitution in this damaging way is \nfar too important for us to take the temporarily easy way out. The \nAmerican people must be made to understand that once they take a closer \nlook at this amendment--and I believe that Senators, once they take a \ncloser look at the amendment and once Senators read the committee \nreport--they will find that this amendment is far from what it seems.\n  I hope each Senator will carefully study this amendment before voting \non it. I believe close and open-minded scrutiny of this proposal shreds \nit--cuts it to pieces; it will not work; it is quack medicine--reveals \nits many shortcomings and unmasks its benign countenance to reveal the \nsinister seeds of a constitutional crisis in the making.\n  Surely we will not travel this road if we are fully aware of where it \nmay lead. In the days ahead, let us be very sure of just what it is we \npropose to do to our country and to our Constitution before we act.\n  Now, I understand the Senator from North Carolina, my friend from the \nState in which I was born, wants to make a speech as soon as I finish. \nBut before he does, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. \nSantorum] had asked me to yield. I asked that he wait until I finish my \nspeech, and I thank him for that. I am glad to yield to him.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I wish to go back to that chart and again try to find out \nspecifically what data the Senator is referring to there. I just had \nsomeone look up the 1974 Budget Act and the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nBudget Enforcement Act to find out what the timeframe was for estimates \nto be given. And my understanding is that--I am sure the Senator knows \nthe 1974 Budget Act; he was one of the principal writers of it--the \nOffice of Management and Budget submits a beginning-of-the-year \nbudgetary assessment on February 1, which just occurred the other day. \nThey make a midseason review in July or August. That is under the \nBudget Act of 1974. The Congressional Budget Office makes a beginning-\nof-the-year--which is the end of January--assessment after OMB makes \nits assessment and then an end-of-July reassessment.\n  My question is, the Senator referred to this data being May, roughly \nMay, springtime, after all the budget resolutions were passed. I do not \nsee any requirement for a report here, and I am wondering if in fact \nthis data is not February data as opposed to May or June data.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is February.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is not May. What I said about May was that under the \n1974 act, Congress is supposed to pass a budget resolution which lays \nout the anticipated outlays, the anticipated receipts and the \nanticipated deficits, and then, only after then can the Appropriations \nCommittee of the Senate--the House committees can go before that, but \nonly after that budget resolution is passed and sent to conference and \nagreed upon can the Senate appropriations committees begin their work. \nSometimes, I guess, we complete the budget resolution perhaps before \nMay, sometimes we may not, but that was what I alluded to in the case \nof May.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if the Senator from West Virginia will \ncontinue to yield for a question, so the numbers that the Senator is \nsaying are in error, the inaccurate estimates, are estimates that were \nmade 21 months prior to the end of the fiscal year, correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. Whatever, 21 or 20 or 18 or 19. The point I am saying is \nthe estimates simply do not work out. They are always wrong. And in \nthis constitutional amendment here, that is the Achilles' heel. The \nword ``estimates'' is the Achilles' heel. They are always wrong. \nConsequently, we can never base our actions on those estimates and \nexpect to balance that budget.\n  Mr. SIMON. Would my colleague from West Virginia yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will be glad to.\n  Mr. SIMON. First of all, as he knows, I have great respect for him. \nHe is an extremely valuable Member of this body.\n  I will tell you what I think is the error of the Senator's assumption \nhere. First, we can build in, as has been recommended by former \nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury Fred Bergsten, among others, about \na 2-percent surplus. That on a $1.6 trillion budget would be about $32 \nbillion.\n  Second, because we do have to rely on estimates somewhat, we have \ntalked about having a 3-percent leeway so that you could go 3 percent \nbelow and then that would automatically transfer to the next fiscal \nyear. That would be $48 billion. Right now, the combination of those \ntwo things would be $80 billion. That would take care of all but two \nfiscal years the Senator has on the board there. In those two fiscal \nyears----\n  Mr. BYRD. What does the Senator mean by saying it would take care of \nall of them, all but two? What does the Senator mean?\n  Mr. SIMON. Every one of those except two is less than $80 billion.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the Senator saying?\n  Mr. SIMON. Let me go over this again. The recommendation of several \npeople, including Alan Greenspan and former Assistant Secretary of the \nTreasury Fred Bergsten, a recommendation that I concur in, is that we \nbuild in about a 2-percent surplus when we put together a budget. In \nterms of our $1.6 trillion budget, that would be about a $32 billion \nsurplus. Then because no one, as the Senator points out, can know for \nsure down to the dollar or even the $1 billion where we are going to \ncome out, we have made clear in committee that there can be up to a 3-\npercent deficit that would be transferred to the next fiscal year.\n That would be $48 billion. The $32 billion and the $48 billion combine \nto $80 billion. That, every one of those, is less than an $80 billion \ndifferential except for 2 years.\n\n  In those 2 years, the procedure would be for Congress to say we can \neither, with 60 votes, create a small deficit--but it would be small \nindeed, compared to the deficits today--or we could authorize putting \nit in the next fiscal year.\n  It is something that we would have to face. But it is a practical way \nof facing this problem.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator said ``something we would have to face?'' The \nSenator will not be around here after next year to face it. And I will \nnot be around here many more years to face it. How do we know what \nfuture Congresses will say? We say we will say that. We say it is not \nthe intention to do thus and so. How do we know what the intention of a \nfuture Congress will be?\n  Also, may I say this?\n  Mr. SIMON. You have the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Please take a look at the amendment which you are \nsupporting. It does not say anything about building up a surplus in 1 \nyear. It does not say anything about 3 percent or 2 percent or 10 \npercent or 20 percent. It says, ``Total outlays for any fiscal year \nshall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year * * *''\n  Napoleon said that on his council there were men who were far more \neloquent than he, but he always stopped them by saying 2 and 2 equals \n4.\n  So I am going to say to you, Senator--and I say this with great \nrespect, and the Senator from Pennsylvania, and any other Senators on \nthe response team--2 and 2 makes 4.\n  Read it. Read what your amendment is saying. ``Total outlays for any \nfiscal year shall not * * *.'' It does not say may not. ``* * * shall \nnot exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.''\n  Now, 2 and 2 makes 4. Do not come at me with all implementing \nlegislation, ``We might build up a surplus.''\n  We will not be around here. How do we know what a future Congress \nwill do?\n  ``We will do this and we will do that in implementing legislation. We \nwill build up a surplus. We can roll that over if we hit a year in \nwhich there is \n[[Page S2386]]  a deficit. We can just roll it over next year.''\n  Suppose there is a deficit next year?\n  ``Well, we can roll it over.''\n  Suppose there is a deficit next year?\n  ``Well, we can roll it over.''\n  That is not what those people over there are being told. And you know \nit. And you know it, Senator. We all know it. Read it for yourselves. I \ndid not write it. I am not going to support it.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I support getting to a balanced budget. But not this. Not \nthis way.\n  Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank him for yielding.\n  You have to put that together with the language about estimates, \ntogether.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is just what I did just earlier. I put them together \nand came out wrong every time.\n  Mr. SIMON. All right. And the reality is we do not know--when we come \nto September 30, we do not know what the deficit is, or what it is \nprecisely.\n  Mr. BYRD. We will not know it.\n  Mr. SIMON. We do not know that until sometime later. That is why we \nmake this adjustment. And that is when we will make the adjustment.\n  I think--and I respect----\n  Mr. BYRD. This does not say anything about an adjustment.\n  Mr. SIMON. Pardon?\n  Mr. BYRD. This amendment? What are we talking about here? I thought \nwe were debating a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It \ndoes not say anything about an adjustment.\n  Mr. SIMON. We are. Well, what I am simply saying is we have built \ninto this the flexibility to take care of the kind of unknown kind of \nsituations that you are talking about.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, you say ``we have built into this.'' Where does it \nsay that in the amendment? Where does it say it?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if the Senator from West Virginia will \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am yielding right now to the Senator. Then I will be glad \nto yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was going to answer his question.\n  Mr. SIMON. Just a response to this question, and then I will yield to \nmy friend from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know what the Senator from Pennsylvania is going to say. \nHe will say look at that supermajority we provide in there. That is \nwhat he was going to say? Was that not what you were going to say?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would suggest to the Senator from West Virginia he \nread section 2 of the article, which requires a three-fifths vote to \nincrease the debt limit.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, another supermajority. That is the 11th \none.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is the safeguard against deficits. We cannot just \nincur a deficit because we have to raise the debt limit. We cannot \nraise the debt limit without a three-fifths majority. Thereby we are \nbound to do something about the deficit. So we will be forced, as the \nSenator from Illinois was saying--here is the enforcement. Here is the \nteeth right within the constitutional amendment. Section 2 requires us \nto have a vote on debt limit increase, and when we get to zero we will \nhave the debt limit and we should not have to change it ever.\n  That is the enforcement mechanism. That makes us come here and do \nsomething about it to comply with section 1 of the constitutional \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is now talking about providing for a minority \nveto, a minority veto. The Framers provided for a majoritarian, \ndemocratic rule. The Senator is now talking about reverting to \nnondemocratic supermajority rule.\n  I was going to wait until another day to talk about these \nsupermajorities.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. And I will. But what he is saying here is that any Senator \ncan, as a ticket for his vote--as a ticket for his vote to raise the \ndebt limit, as a ticket for his vote to waive the deficit \nrequirements--may say to the majority, ``I want mine. I want my special \nproject. I want my special program. That is my ticket, Mr. Majority. I \nwill give you my vote and help you get that two-thirds, but I want \nmine.'' As a consequence, we will end up adding to the deficits rather \nthan reining them in.\n  Is it a little hard to understand? Maybe.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield on that question, on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh yes, yes.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me say just another word about these supermajorities.\n  Mr. SIMON. Is it not true that there are eight provisions in the \nConstitution right now requiring a supermajority?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, that is not true.\n  Mr. SIMON. I beg to differ with my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will show you the Constitution.\n  Mr. SIMON. On most things, he is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. In this, I am correct. In the original Constitution, there \nare six. In the 12th amendment, there is one dealing with the election \nof the Vice President by the Senate. In the 14th, there is one dealing \nwith the waiving--in the case of individuals who have taken oaths of \noffice and who participate in a rebellion against the country, two-\nthirds of the Congress may waive that and allow the person--two-thirds \nmay waive that disability. And in the 25th amendment, where it talks \nabout the disability of the President, there is a supermajority.\n  So, Senator, when you start talking about the Constitution, let us \nboth sit down and read it together. There are not eight, or whatever \nthe Senator said. There are six in the original, one in the 12th, one \nin the 14th, and one in the 25th amendments to the Constitution, making \na total of nine.\n  That is a minor matter.\n  Mr. SIMON. I will take your word it is nine rather than eight. But \nthe point is, this is not something startlingly new. Those provisions \nare in to prevent Government abuse. And I think we have had Government \nabuse.\n  The second point I ask----\n  Mr. BYRD. Wait just a minute. The Senator is not going to get off \nwith that. I am going to yield to him. I am not going to shut him off. \nHe is not going to get away with that.\n  Most supermajorities are in the Constitution to protect the structure \nof that Constitution. Let us talk about expulsion, the expulsion of a \nSenator, or the conviction of a President in an impeachment trial. They \nare there to protect individual rights. Those two supermajorities are \nthere to protect individual rights.\n  In the case of a veto, the exercise of a Presidential veto, that \nsupermajority is to protect one branch against another.\n  As a matter of fact, it was stated at the Constitutional Convention \nby one of the Framers that one of the reasons the President ought to \nhave a veto was to protect himself against the legislative branch. \nThere are various others that are claiming to protect individual \nrights. They are not supermajorities to nail down some fiscal policy. \nThe Constitution does not embrace somebody's fiscal policy. So there \nwere good reasons. Those are not the reasons these two new \nsupermajorities that we are about to inscribe in the Constitution are \nfor.\n  Mr. SIMON. But one of the things those who founded our Government \ntalked about is taxation without representation. And one of the reasons \nthat Thomas Jefferson favored a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution is he said one generation should no more be obligated to \npick up the debt of a previous generation than to pick up the debt of \nanother country.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thomas Jefferson was not at the Constitutional Convention, \nas the Senator knows. He was the President of the United States from \n1801 to 1809, and when he was President, why did not he ask the \nCongress to adopt a constitutional amendment to do that? Why did not \nhe? He did not do it. No constitutional amendment was ever sent. Why \ndid not Jefferson do that?\n  Mr. SIMON. I would be pleased to respond, because George Washington \noperated this country very frugally. Then, in his Farewell Address, \nGeorge Washington warned do not get the country into debt. We followed \nthat advice, really followed it up until not too many years ago. Then \nwe lost that sense of responsibility. But it is very interesting in \nThomas Jefferson's first term he reduced the small Federal debt we had \nin this country by 50 percent.\n   [[Page S2387]] Mr. BYRD. It was also interesting that Jefferson took \nadvantage of the opportunity--I am glad he did--to buy the Louisiana \nTerritory, 1,827,000 square miles for $15 million; less than 2\\1/2\\ \ncents per acre, extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian \nborder, from the Mississippi to the Rockies. I am glad he did. He went \ninto debt for it. Where did he get the money? He borrowed it from the \nbanks. That debt, $15 million in that day, was 1.9 times the total \nbudget for that year. If that were to happen in this year, when we have \na budget of $1.6 trillion, and if we bought the Louisiana Territory and \nit cost us 1.9 times the amount of the Federal budget, you could figure \nthat for yourselves. That has to be something like, about $3.1 \ntrillion. I am glad he did. I am glad he went into debt. When going \ninto debt, he benefited all of the ensuing generations from then until \nkingdom come.\n  Mr. SIMON. My colleague is absolutely correct. In fact, he \nillustrates the point that this constitutional amendment has that \nflexibility.\n  Mr. BYRD. Wait a minute. It also illustrates that Jefferson was \nembarrassed by what he had said, and later he said he was embarrassed \nby it. But he said because of the laws of necessity the means sometimes \nare worthy of the end.\n  Mr. SIMON. Let me add that the treaty was signed in Paris in May. In \nthose days you did not find out what had happened for a while. When \nword got to Washington, DC, in July--and I apologize to my colleague \nfrom North Carolina--when word got to Jefferson in July in Washington, \nDC, he was as startled as anyone else by the Louisiana Purchase.\n  Our Secretary of the Treasury at that point was a man named Albert \nGallatin, many States have Gallatin counties named for him. Most people \ndo not know for whom Gallatin is named. Albert Gallatin objected to the \nLouisiana Purchase, or part of it, because part of the agreement was \nthat the bonds were 5 percent. They could not pay back any of it for \nthe first 15 years. He wanted to pay it off very, very quickly. But the \nreally important point here is that there were two votes in the U.S. \nSenate on the Louisiana Purchase. There was one vote in the House of \nRepresentatives on the Louisiana Purchase. I do know the precise \ntotals. It was something like 26 to 3, or something like that, in the \nSenate, and all of them were far more than the 60 percent required by \nthis constitutional amendment.\n  So this amendment would not have blocked the Louisiana Purchase, I \nwant to assure my colleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did not say the amendment would have blocked the \nLouisiana Purchase. I am saying, like Napoleon did, that two plus two \nequals four. Read it.\n  Mr. SIMON. I do not disagree.\n  Mr. BYRD. ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \nreceipts for any fiscal year.'' You cannot get away from it. It has you \nby the neck.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator and I differ. But I thank him for yielding to \nme.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend from North \nCarolina. I thank the Senator from North Carolina. Let me thank the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. He made a good try.\n  I have not yielded yet. I have not yielded the floor yet.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will in just a moment.\n  I want to commend and compliment the Senator from Pennsylvania. He \ndid the right thing. He raised his questions. I learn when people ask \nme questions. And I hope that the listening audience learns. That is \nthe purpose of this, that others who may have a chance to listen, \nhopefully will listen, may learn something from the questions and from \nthe answers. I do not know all the answers. I do not claim to know \nthat. But I fervently believe the position I am taking, and I think \nthat a clear reading of the amendment supports me.\n  I thank my Senator from North Carolina for yielding. I beg his pardon \nfor delaying him.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I thought he \nhad yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask for 20 minutes to discuss the \nReid amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Carolina yield for \na parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield the floor for 1 minute to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. I did not hear. Is the Senator from North Carolina speaking \non the matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has been recognized to speak.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I will address the Reid amendment. But \nthere are other things I am going to say first with reference to it.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. Mr. President, quite simply, no other \nlegislative issue the Senate will consider is more important than this \none. I know this is a broad statement. But the economic future of the \nUnited States rests entirely with this amendment. The future of the \nUnited States, the well-being of our children, grandchildren and \nchildren yet unborn rests entirely of whether we pass this amendment or \nnot.\n  Mr. President, if we fail to enact this amendment, this country is \nheaded irrevocably toward an economic calamity. Our national debt will \nsoon consume us. We are taking the same path as Mexico, but unlike \nMexico, there will be no one that can bail us out.\n  Mr. President, I have heard a lot of talk on the Senate floor about \nhow we have to find a lot of cuts in order to balance the budget. \nSenator Daschle had a right-to-know amendment that we defeated \nyesterday. He wanted to know where the spending cuts will be made over \nthe next 7 years.\n  But the most important thing that we can do is declare that we will \nbalance the budget, show the fortitude to balance the budget, and then \nonce we are bound by the Constitution, we will find a way to keep the \nbudget in balance.\n  This brings me to the point I want to make and the point of the \nspeech. It will only take 50 votes plus 1 in this Senate to raise \ntaxes. Any Senator that cannot bring it upon himself to vote for cuts \ncan stand up and vote for a tax increase. Any Senator that wants to go \nback to his constituents and tell them that he is raising their taxes \nby another 15 percent or more, taking another 15 percent or more out of \nthe gross profits of the small businesses that are struggling already \nto keep buckle and tongue together, any Senator that wants this extra \nmoney to pay for more foreign aid, more welfare, a bigger Department of \nHUD, and more farm subsidies, he can do that. All he has to do is vote \nfor a tax increase. He can go back to his constituents and tell them \nthat he voted for a tax increase because he thinks these things are \nmore important than the taxpayers keeping more of their own money.\n  Senators are saying that we cannot deny money to the helpless in our \nsociety. I say that the most helpless in our society are our \ngrandchildren, our children, and the progeny not yet born, upon whom we \nare placing an enormous debt. If our generation wants greater \nGovernment, more giveaways, then it is the duty of this Congress to \nstep up to the plate and pay for it now, to face the voters and say: I \nincreased your taxes because I am for more giveaway programs and more \nspending.\n  I am tired of those that say they may not vote for the constitutional \namendment because they do not know where the cuts will come from. If \nthey have the courage, they simply can vote a tax increase and there \nwill not have to be any cuts. For me personally, I will not be telling \nanyone in North Carolina that I need 15 percent more of their income to \npay for more Government. I do not think we need more foreign aid, more \nwelfare, more money for HUD, or more money for farm subsidies. In fact, \nwhat I can tell them is if we simply stop spending more money each \nyear, \n[[Page S2388]]  we would have a balanced budget, with no cuts.\n  When I ran for the Senate, I said I would not vote for a tax \nincrease. I have not, nor will I ever. The Federal Government needs to \nchange its spending habits, not impose a burden of higher taxes upon \nthe working people and taxpayers of this country. If we froze Federal \nspending to the levels that are in the fiscal year 1994 budget, we \nwould not only have a balanced budget in 1997, but we would have a \nsurplus of $10 billion. Instead, we just pour more money into more \ngiveaway programs, with no end in sight.\n  Mr. President, the message the American people sent to us on November \n8 was that they want less Government, not more; less regulations, not \nmore; and more freedom to earn a living and generate a profit and spend \ntheir own money. I ran on that message in 1992, and I have not changed \nto this day.\n  Mr. President, finally, let me talk about the national debt that is \nconsuming us. It took this country nearly 200 years--from its founding \nuntil 1983--to accumulate a national debt of $1 trillion. But since \nthen, in just the last 12 years, we have added $2 trillion more to our \ndebt. Today, our national debt stands at $3.6 trillion.\n  Under the 1996 budget that the President just released, our national \ndebt will grow to $4.8 trillion by the year 2000. In other words, in \njust 4 years, our national debt will grow by another trillion dollars.\n  Every person who has ever gone into debt knows that interest is a \npiranha and it will eat you alive. The same thing is happening to the \nU.S. Government today. Interest is starting to destroy the Federal \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, all of this is taking its toll on our economy and the \nability of the U.S. Government to function. In the 1996 budget, 16 \ncents of every tax dollar will be spent just to pay the interest on the \ndebt. But to put it in real and, I think, more impressive terms, when \ntaxpayers file their income tax returns this year, they should know \nthat 41 percent--41 percent--of all the income taxes that they send to \nWashington will be used for the sole purpose of paying interest on the \nmoney we have already borrowed. In other words, 41 percent of all the \nindividual income taxes collected this year will go to pay interest on \nthe debt.\n  By the year 2000, our national debt will be equal to 52 percent of \nthe gross national product. In 1980, the figure was exactly half that. \nIn 1996, for the first time, we will spend more on interest on our debt \nthan we will on our military. And we are supposed to be the preeminent \nmilitary power in the world, and should remain so.\n  Not only is our debt burden hurting us at home, but it is hurting us \nabroad. The dollar has fallen against every major currency of the \nindustrialized nations of the world.\n  Mr. President, some might ask, how did we get ourselves into this \nmess? We got into this condition not because the working people are \ntaxed too little, but because the Congress spends too much. In 1996, \nAmericans will send $1.4 trillion to the Federal Government. \nRegrettably, this is not enough for Congress. There is never enough.\n  If we could just control Federal spending, we might not have to \nconsider this amendment. But for 35 years, this Congress has been \nunable to muster the fortitude to control Federal spending. It is \namazing to think that just since 1982, the Federal budget has doubled. \nAre we, as a country, better off today than we were in 1982 because we \nhave doubled Federal spending? The answer is simple: We are deeper in \ndebt and have little to show for it, but the interest will be with us \nto infinity.\n  Mr. President, we know what the problem is. The question is, what are \nwe going to do about it? The answer is that we must pass the balanced \nbudget amendment. We need to leave our children a clean balance sheet, \nnot a lifetime of debt, excessive taxes and a contingent liability of \n$7 trillion.\n  Mr. President, in speaking of the national debt, and its impact upon \nus, I ask your indulgence to tell a very quick story from my early \nbusiness career.\n  As a 21-year-old man, I was trying to buy some new trucks and \nequipment, and the banker would not consider the loan unless my mother \nendorsed the paper. Well, she was a very, very stingy Scottish lady and \nlooked things over well before she signed them. This had gone on for a \ncouple of weeks, and I went in the house for lunch one day and I asked \nher to talk about it. She had the liability and the debt service \nwritten on a handkerchief, and the proposed income that I said I was \ngoing to make on the same handkerchief on the other side, just a ledger \nsheet of income and debt service. And she asked me if her figures were \nright,\n and I told her they were. She picked it up, handed it to me and said, \n``Go and wash it.'' When I stuck it under the spigot and the water hit \nit, I saw what she had done. She had placed my debt, and had written \nthat in indelible ink. She had written my income in fruit dye. Her \nwords were--and I will never forget them, and the country needs to \nremember them, too--``When you make a debt, it will be with you always \nuntil you pay it, plus interest. Your income can go in a flash.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and the rest of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I made my comments this morning on the \nReid amendment. I very strongly support it and I pointed out my \nrationale for so doing.\n  Since then, we have been reading the committee report, Mr. President, \nand something has come to my attention. In the spirit of debate and \ndiscussion which was so prevalent on the floor between the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I would like to continue that spirit, and if the bill \nmanager, the Senator from Pennsylvania, would be prepared to answer a \nquestion on the majority report, I would appreciate it very much.\n  In this report, on page 19, it is pointed out that some programs are \nexempted from this resolution and some are not. Now, this is news to \nme, because, as a member of the Judiciary Committee that considered \nthis, that was not the case.\n  I would like to read the exact language. It reads:\n\n       Among the Federal programs that would not be covered by \n     S.J. Res. 1 is the electric power program of the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority. Since 1959, the financing of that program \n     has been the sole responsibility of its own electric \n     ratepayers--not the U.S. Treasury and the Nation's taxpayers. \n     Consequently, the receipts and outlays of that program are \n     not part of the problem S.J. Res. 1 is directed at solving.\n\n  Now, this is very strange to me. Social Security is put on budget and \nits receipts and outlays are subject to Senate Joint Resolution 1, but \nwe suddenly find that the Tennessee Valley Authority is not. And not \nonly is it not, but the words prefacing the statement say ``Among the \nFederal programs that would not be covered by Senate Joint Resolution 1 \n* * *''\n  My question to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is: A, are \nyou aware of this, that the TVA is being exempted; and, B, what other \nprograms are being exempted from Senate Joint Resolution 1?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am trying to find the page which the Senator is \nciting.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Page 19 of the committee report, about two-thirds of \nthe way down the page. It says ``Total outlays,'' and then the second \nparagraph there, which begins ``Among the Federal programs that would \nnot be covered by Senate Joint Resolution 1 * * *''\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator found and brought \nthat issue up, because it is critical only in the context of \nunderstanding how it fits. I say that as an individual who helped craft \nthis amendment and believes in the logic and in the appropriateness of \nthe words ``Everything that is in the general fund budget is on the \ntable,'' and everything that the general fund budget and the Senate or \nthe Congress of the United States have authority over in decisionmaking \nfor the purposes of appropriations, allocation of resources, or the \nestablishment of funding levels is on the table.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority, like other PMA's, or power management \nAuthorities, are not on the Federal budget. They have a Federal \nobligation \n[[Page S2389]]  and that is to return revenue to the Government for the \nmoney that was used to finance them.\n  But the Federal Government does not establish their budgets, nor does \nthe Congress of the United States. And that is what is directed in this \nprogram.\n  So it is not a loophole. Everything that is in the budget is on the \ntable. This is a revenue source. It is the board of this particular \nPMA, or power management authority, that establishes their own budgets \nand they look at their obligation to the Federal Government as a debt \npayment obligation. They are not a part of general fund budgeting, nor \ncan they either be called off budget, because they are a quasi-\nindependent Federal agency non-tied to the general fund budget.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Senator, this is exactly my point, because in 1990, \nthis body took Social Security off budget by a vote of 98 to 2. Social \nSecurity draws its revenues from its own specific FICA tax, not from \nthe income tax or any other tax of Government.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I agree the Congress did that. But you and I both know \nthat the Congress of the United States every year includes in the final \nbudget of this country and the budget that you and I will decide in the \ncoming months Social Security expenditures. We are allowed by the law \nand the Social Security law to make decisions on Social Security. The \nterm ``off budget'' for Social Security is an accounting terminology \nthat separates it from the general fund budget or, if you will, the \nall-inclusive Federal budget that we have been operating on since the \nJohnson years.\n  The power authority is not something on whose budget we decide. That \nis decided by a separate board. It is only the amount of obligation of \npayment that power authority is tied to.\n  So if I may politely say, you cannot compare an apple to an orange. \nAnd in this example, that is exactly what I believe you are attempting \nto do. They are uniquely different entities under the law and under the \nbudget process of our Government.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Senator.\n  If I may make another comparison. It is like Fannie Mae or Sallie \nMae. They are entities created by the Federal Government. Their boards \nare appointed by the President of the United States. But if Fannie Mae \ngets into some difficulty, they have to raise their own revenue. We are \nnot going to come along and help them.\n  I do not want Social Security to be in that situation. I want us to \nfeel an obligation to make sure that we fund Social Security.\n  So I think we are not just talking about something that is off budget \nwhere we have an obligation. In this case, we are talking about \nsomething that is a Federal Government-created entity, but they have to \ntake care of their own revenue. And if they run into some financial \ndifficulties, they have to raise power rates or, in the case of Fannie \nMae, may have to raise interest rates or something else. But we are not \ngoing to come along and bail them out.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from California allow the Senator to ask a \nquestion?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. REID. I would be interested if the Senator from California could \nanswer a question based on what the Senator from Illinois said.\n  Why, then, was not Sallie Mae and Fannie Mae excluded? Why is it only \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this has piqued my curiosity as to \nwhat is excluded because, if we just follow the logic of the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, I stretched my memory back to see \nif there was a time when the Federal Government ever bailed out Social \nSecurity. I do not believe there was. There were times when the Federal \nGovernment, the Congress, has raised the FICA tax, but the FICA tax is \na compulsory dedicated tax that goes for retirements.\n  I find it somewhat interesting that some programs--and it does refer \nto quasigovernmental programs in this as well--some programs are \nexempted under this bill and others are not.\n  Of course, the program which is most important to the American people \nis Social Security. It is not exempted. It is not exempted because \nthere will be 3 trillion dollars' worth of surplus revenues that are \ngoing to be taken from Social Security and used to balance the budget.\n  That is what Senator Reid and I do not think is right. I would just \nlike very much to obtain a full list from the committee and from the \nauthors of this as to precisely which programs are being exempted from \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, no program of the Federal Government is \nbeing exempted. These are not Federal programs. These are independent \nentities that are known as quasigovernmental because it took a Federal \nact to create them. They are not on budget. They have never been on \nbudget. This is the same report language that was filed a year ago and \n3 years ago as we worked this very issue.\n  So I appreciate your concern because I, too, strongly believe exactly \nthe way the Senator from California believes--that the trust fund of \nthe Social Security system should never be used to balance the budget.\n  I have one of these entities in my area known as the Bonneville Power \nAdministration. We do not establish their budget here. You have never \nvoted on it. Neither have I. They are a Federal power-marketing agency. \nThey establish their budget just exactly the way the Senator from \nIllinois said--by rates, and by rate increases if they need to increase \ntheir budgets. They have but one obligation to the Senate and to the \nGovernment of our country, and that is to return a revenue, based on \ntheir debt obligation.\n  That becomes part of this revenue flow that becomes part of the \nbudget. That is not even like Social Security. Social Security does not \nreturn a revenue to the Government following an expenditure. It is a \ntax flowing in to service the obligations of Social Security and Social \nSecurity recipients.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority does not flow money to the Government \nfor purposes of obligation other than debt structure, and they are not \na part of the unified Federal budget. Simply are not and never have \nbeen.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me make this point, if I may, \nbecause the Senator from Idaho has just said these are not Federal \nprograms.\n  The majority report says these are Federal programs. The majority \nreport says: ``Among the Federal programs that would not be covered by \nS.J. Res. 1 is the Electric Power Program of the TVA.'' Now you are \nsaying it is not only TVA, it is Bonneville as well.\n  Now, maybe to some the argument can be made that there is no Federal \nresponsibility for these. But if something happened with these \nprograms, I think we would bail them out very rapidly. I do not accept \nthe argument that they are not Federal programs, and the majority \nreport does not accept that argument.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator from California would look at page 19, \nthe paragraph that begins ``Total outlays,'' right above where the \nSenator has been reading, it stands on its head what my friend from \nIdaho said.\n  Listen: ``Total outlays is intended to include all disbursements from \nthe Treasury of the United States''--listen to this--``either directly \nor indirectly through Federal or''--listen to this--``quasi-Federal \nagencies created under the authority of the acts of Congress and either \non budget or off budget.''\n  So that, I say respectfully to my friend from Idaho through my friend \nfrom California, that is directly opposite what he said. Is that not \nwhat the English language says?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is exactly right, Mr. President. Something is \nwrong. Something is fishy, I think. And I think we ought to find out \nwhat it is, because what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the \ngander.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me just say if we were to rephrase \nthis, I would say the first paragraph we are talking about ``among the \nfederally created programs'' would have language that is more clear.\n   [[Page S2390]] If my colleague from California wants to vote against \nthe report for that reason, that is fine but just vote for the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Let me respond to my friend from Nevada, because the paragraph that \nhe quotes is correct.\n  The REA serves people in Nevada, California, Idaho, and Illinois. We \ndo permit Government-backed bonds.\n  Now, when we put out those REA bonds we put a little bit into the \nTreasury. Whatever CBO determines is a risk factor, that is put there.\n  Now, when my colleague from California says, well, if Bonneville went \ndown the tube, we probably would rescue then, I think that is correct. \nI would just remind the Senator that we also rescued Lockheed. We also \nrescued Chrysler. We will not put any more in here from Michigan for \nChrysler or Ford or General Motors, but we do put whatever risk factor \nwe have to when there are federally backed bonds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you.\n  We can play semantics with the report language if you wish and we can \nask a variety of questions of the report language. I do not dispute the \nlegitimacy of asking the questions.\n  The report language is not the amendment. What is in the amendment \nand which is key, and I think the Senator in searching for the \nGovernment programs that would meet the definition, needs to look at \nsection 1 of the amendment.\n  It says ``Total outlays for any fiscal year.'' That is the operative \nword, Senator. Now, the Senator used the example if my power authority, \nBonneville, got in trouble, would we bail them out. I do not know. We \nwould have to decide that at the time. That would become an outlay at \nthat moment in time.\n  We would have to fit that into the context of a balanced budget \nbecause we would decide collectively that maybe it was necessary to do \nit--it was going to damage the region. Your State of California buys a \nlot of power out of the Bonneville power grid. If the Bonneville power \ngrid was going down, we might become allies. We would want to save it \nso that my State would not go dark and your State would not go dark.\n  But the point is, does it become an outlay? That is all you and I for \nthe purpose of a balanced budget amendment have a responsibility for. \nIt is at this time not an outlay. TVA does not come to the Federal \nbudget. It is not an outlay of the Federal budget. If it got in \ntrouble--and I think your analogy is fair, as the Senator from Illinois \nmentioned the analogy of Chrysler and the New York City bailout. New \nYork City is not an outlay today and should never appear on the budget, \nshould not be considered.\n  But if New York came, like they did years ago and said, ``We are near \nbankruptcy. Help us,'' they become an outlay. They become a part of the \nunified budgets of the Federal Government, and it is at that time that \nwe would have to make a decision.\n  So, whether the report language is right or wrong, the ultimate test \nand a legitimate question to ask, I sincerely believe, is what segments \nof the Federal Government manifest an outlay to the unified budget of \nthe Federal Government? While we took Social Security off budget and \naway from the unified budget, which is merely an accounting word for \ntotal expenditure, total receipts, in the end we bring it back. We \nbring it back and we put it in to the total budget of the Federal \nGovernment, and you and I vote annually on the expenditures of Social \nSecurity.\n  We do not on TVA, we do not on Bonneville Power, we do not in this \noperative section--not operative, but descriptive section. Report \nlanguage is never operative. It is only descriptive. It expresses \ngeneral intent. It is only at that point that I think your concern \ndeserves an answer, and I would like to try to put a list together for \nyou.\n  But if you are basing it on your reason to vote because it is off, \nthe test is: Does it manifest by its presence an outlay to the unified \nbudget of the Federal Government? And the very simple answer to that is \nno, it does not.\n  I thank the Senator from California for yielding.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I appreciate that and I thank the \nSenator. It is just that I think I find a conflict in this because, \nafter all, Social Security, although there is an outlay every year, is \nrunning well in surplus. By the year 2002 when this is operative, there \nwill be $705 billion plus another $300 billion, it is my understanding, \nbecoming available for retirements. But because they are not needed, \nthis amendment would automatically use those revenues to balance the \nbudget. That is my problem with this.\n  The fact that--let us say it is Federal or quasi-Federal--this is \nstill an entity that is the product of the Federal Government whose \nfull faith and credit at one point built it, et cetera, and whose full \nfaith and credit would sustain it if it fell into tough years.\n  I look at Social Security as important as TVA, it is as important as \nBonneville if you are a senior who is depending on it or a working \nperson who is paying the FICA taxes with the expectation that the \nGovernment is going to make those revenues available. This amendment \ndoes not make those revenues available for retirements.\n  So all we are saying is, just as you have excepted Bonneville, TVA, \nand some other things yet unknown to some of us, we say exempt Social \nSecurity, and then we can all march forward together.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, only briefly to respond to the Senator from \nCalifornia. She and I are clearly on the same wave length. We do not \nwant to see the trust funds and the revenues that build up to support \nfuture generations Social Security checks used to balance the budget. \nThe tragedy is today they are. Today the surpluses are spent through \nthe general fund and notes are deposited in the trust funds, interest \nbearing notes. This is a requirement of the law, the law that created \nSocial Security. That is what goes on today.\n  So the Social Security stability, while there are revenues coming in \nin the form of taxes, has always been based on the willingness of the \nCongress of the United States, the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Idaho for assuring its stability because we, by voting \nevery year to pass a unified Federal budget, vote on the expenditure of \nmoneys from the trust fund to things other than Social Security because \nthe money is borrowed from the trust fund and expended out through the \ngeneral fund. That is part of the financing of our Government, whether \nyou and I disagree with that or not.\n  It is not a separate pool of money setting to the side bearing \ninterest. It is working money and, of course, it comes in the form of \nTreasury notes and interest bearing at the time. That is how it works. \nI think that is a reasonably good description of how it works and \ncertainly one that will not change.\n  I think the argument that all of us have had is, if you are going to \nbalance the budget, you look at all of the Federal budget, all of it \nthat is currently inside the unified Federal budget and in the \ncalculations that we make on an annual basis from a budgetary point of \nview.\n  While the Senator from California has expressed her concerns here, \nlet me close this thought by simply saying, what is now not currently \non budget or a requirement that the Senator from California or the \nSenator from Idaho deal with it at all, unless it got in trouble, as \nshe makes out, that would be then the point that we would be \nresponsible for it, and it would fit under the definition and the clear \nexamination of article I which says, ``total outlays.'' There is the \nkey, total outlays for any fiscal year. Right now TVA is not an outlay \nnor are those other entities.\n  Mr. President, one other item that I thought was interesting this \nafternoon in the debate and the discussion as it relates to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia when he was breaking out different portions of the \nbudget and he was dealing with sections that talked about revenues and \nhow we would handle them, it was interesting to me that he was only \nwilling to deal with pieces and not the whole.\n  It is most unfair, in my opinion, to examine the amendment in pieces \nand \n[[Page S2391]]  say, and, therefore, that piece is operative \nexclusively under a certain manner. Let me give an example of what I \nthink I am concerned about when he said, ``The limit on debt of the \nUnited States held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-\nfifths'' vote. He talked about revenues and the ability to evaluate \nthose and, again, it was an operative factor of three-fifths vote.\n  We understand that the art of projecting revenue in a gross domestic \nproduct as large as the United States is not a perfect art, and while \nour very best minds at the Office of Management and Budget, or the \nCongressional Budget Office, or Treasury might come up with a fixed \nrevenue for the year over which we budget, it would not be \nunreasonable, based on cyclical patterns, for that revenue to be off by \n$10, $12, $14, or $20 billion.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is absolutely right. We are never \naccurate to within the cent or the dollar or even the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  But what it then says is that, by a three-fifths vote, other things \nare allowed to happen and that remains the key operative. What the \nprocess does is that it causes us for the first time to try to live \nwithin the revenue projection. And certainly the Senator from West \nVirginia, who for years has been chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, knows that this Congress and probably few that he has ever \nbeen involved in ever consciously created a budget to live within the \nrevenue projections. It was always take that revenue and borrow a heck \nof a lot more.\n  Now what we are saying is that as we work over the next 7 years to \nbring this budget into balance, from that point forward we will live \nwithin the best guesstimates possible by the professionals, and we will \nproject spending levels on an annualized basis on those projections, on \nthose averages, on those summaries. And if we miss them, then through \nthe implementing language and a new budget process that would be \ncreated growing out of this, we would deal with them.\n  Would it be to lift the debt ceiling by three-fifths vote and move \nthem into debt? Yes, that could be done. That would then clear out the \nbudget for the year.\n  Would it be to raise revenue to offset it? Yes, that could be done.\n  Would it be possible to spin it into the next fiscal year as a debt \nto be paid immediately because of a projected surplus in the next year? \nYes, that, too, could be done.\n  This amendment does not restrict those kinds of actions. What it does \nsay and what is important to say is you look at the total of the \nargument, read the whole amendment, do not examine the pieces. Put it \nall together, make it a whole body, make it a whole document because \nthat is how we will all have to look at it and that is how we will have \nto operate as a Congress under the 28th amendment to the Constitution, \nthe one that we are now debating. We will not operate exclusively by \nthe pieces or the parts. It will be a whole document that will cause us \nto react that will create the implementing language which will be \nprobably a new Budget Act and a new process.\n  What it does disallow, and that is, of course, where this Congress \nhas found itself in real trouble over the years, it disallows the \nability to micromanage in a way that has created the kind of debt \nstructure that we have. It simply puts us within parameters, very \nstrict parameters, and it gives, I think, the American people for the \nfirst time a sense of confidence that we actually are trying to stay \nwithin our limits and balance the Federal budget.\n  I would like to try to do that. I think most Americans want us to do \nthat. I am privileged to be serving my 15th year in the U.S. Congress, \nand never in those 15 years has this Congress consciously tried to live \nwithin its revenue or live within a balanced budget. It always figures \nwe will take what we can get and we will borrow the rest to meet our \npolitical desires and not our fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask my friend to yield, if I could talk to either \nSenator Santorum or Senator Craig, whoever is managing the bill now?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is the Senator asking me to yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is late in the day, and I am wondering if at least for \nthe next hour or so we could get some idea if we have some speakers. I \nhave someone who is tentatively scheduled to come at 5 o'clock, the \nSenator from Alabama. It is just so people are not necessarily waiting \naround. I see the Senator from Michigan is here.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not think we have anyone lined up at this point to \nspeak. I was going to speak for about 5 minutes and then I am going to \nsit.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to finish up what little \ncolloquy and discussion we had just a short while ago with the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. I wanted to continue that \ndebate, but in deference to my colleague from North Carolina, I allowed \nhim to make his presentation. But there was a couple of things I just \nwanted to bring closure to before we move on to the next round.\n  The point the Senator from West Virginia was alluding to was section \n1 of the bill:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year * * *\n\n  It is unenforceable, unworkable; these estimates will throw you all \noff; the estimates do not work; they are not reliable. And as a result \nthis is an unenforceable constitutional amendment that is going to \ncause all sorts of unconstitutional activities in this Chamber.\n  I mentioned to him that we must look down to the next section, \nsection 2, which states:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for an \n     increase, for such an increase by rollcall vote.\n\n  There is the enforcement; that once we get to the balanced budget, or \nonce we get to where the debt limit is, that we cannot increase that \ndebt limit without a three-fifths vote. That means we cannot incur a \ndebt or a deficit from any year because if we incur a debt and do not \nraise the debt limit, then we cannot issue obligations to pay for that \ndeficit, which means that would be in a sense a default of certain \nobligations.\n  Now, that is the enforcement. That is the mechanism that drives \nsection 1, that makes us get better estimates.\n  I believe, as I am sure the Senator from West Virginia believes, that \nwe will get better estimates and they will be more ongoing, they will \nnot be every 6 months but will be on a more frequent basis so we can \ncalculate what the correct number will be at the end of the fiscal year \nso we can hit pretty close to zero and hopefully hit a surplus.\n  That is the enforcement. That is what makes all of this discussion \nabout estimates, frankly, irrelevant to the enforcement of this act \nbecause the enforcement is the debt limit provision. That is what \nforces us to come in with a balanced budget, irrespective of what the \nestimates say.\n  The response then was, well, you are creating a minority veto; that \nthe minority is going to have all this power because it is going to be \na supermajority that is going to be required to raise the debt limit.\n  I would just suggest I have the distinct feeling that we are here \nbecause we have a minority veto, that we have been talking about this \nbill for 2 weeks because of a minority veto; that we will be filing a \ncloture motion soon and we will find out whether there is a minority \nveto.\n  This place runs on minority veto. The minority veto is the hallmark--\nas the Senator from West Virginia said during his discussion, things \ncome over here to cool down a little bit, to cool down.\n  I saw a movie the other day, ``Encino Man,'' not exactly the greatest \nmovie that was ever made, but Encino Man was about a Cro-Magnon man and \nhis spouse who were hit by an avalanche. Now, that is cool down. And \nthey were encased in ice. And the Encino Man as a result of an \nearthquake was uncovered, and the ice block that he was encapsulated in \nthawed, and he came to life.\n   [[Page S2392]] My concern is that in this body we are getting \navalanched to the point where we are going to be encapsulated in ice \nand not be able to act and do anything on this balanced budget \namendment, and when we wake up it will not be as happy a world as what \nthe Encino Man faced. When we wake up, we may have desperation, \ndespair, and economic collapse in this country because we simply chose \nto cool things off.\n  We cannot afford to cool things off any more. The more we cool things \noff here, the hotter it gets out there. We have an obligation to act.\n  Do not talk about minority vetoes. We have seen plenty of that around \nhere on this issue. And I suspect the Senator from West Virginia likes \nthat fact, of having that minority veto. As the Senator from Kansas, \nMrs. Kassebaum, said, maybe it is a bad idea whose time has come, but \nit is a necessary evil that we have to put on to this country to get \nour financial act in order for the next generation of Americans.\n  I do not want to be the first generation of American leaders to leave \nthe next generation worse off than we are and worse off than my \ngrandparents were, and that is what we are standing on the precipice of \nif we do not act today.\n  I am hopeful we will. I am confident we will. I do trust the better \nangels of our nature in this place. I know there is a lot of activity \ngoing on that is trying to cloud this issue, but I fundamentally \nbelieve that people in this Chamber will do the right thing when called \nupon and they will stand up for the future of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for indulging me in \nthis matter and I will attempt to be as brief as I can.\n  Yesterday, at this time, the chairman of the Banking Committee, my \nfriend, Al D'Amato from New York, took the floor and made a strong \nstatement with respect to the peso situation in Mexico and the proposed \nsolution to that situation from our Government. I wish to take the \nfloor and respond and expand upon the statements made by my \ndistinguished chairman.\n  I agree basically with the position that he took. I do not share some \nof the outrage that he expressed with respect to the administration's \naction. I took the floor after the administration had announced their \naction and generally praised it because I do believe that if we had not \ntaken some kind of action the Mexican economy in an atmosphere of panic \nwould, indeed, have spun out of control and the Mexican Government \nwould have been in default on their bonds within some 48 hours of the \ntime the administration acted.\n  However, I do not want to leave the impression that with my support \nof the administration's actions I support the notion that the Mexican \nGovernment acted wisely when they devalued the peso in the first place. \nAnd the outrage suggested by the chairman of the Banking Committee was \nappropriately placed when it goes to the question of those who planned \nthis devaluation, those who approved of the devaluation, and those who \ntook the position that the devaluation was inevitable and that it was \nproper.\n  In the Wall Street Journal yesterday, Robert Bartley, the editor of \nthe Journal, wrote a somewhat lengthy but in my view very perceptive \nsummary of this situation called ``Mexico: Suffering the Conventional \nWisdom.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. The reason I praised the administration action when it \nwas announced was that unlike the original proposal, the administration \naction called for entry into the circumstance of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. I have enormous respect for Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board, who has an understanding of the evils of \ndevaluation that I think goes beyond that held by some policymakers at \nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n  Devaluations are not inevitable. Devaluations are not good policy. \nDevaluations are usually an attempt on the part of one government to, \nin the phrase that's become known, beggar thy neighbor--punish another \ngovernment on their borders, either physically or by trade.\n  We went through the circumstance of passing NAFTA in this body and in \nthe other body. I was a strong supporter of NAFTA for a variety of \nreasons that I will not review here.\n  One of the fundamental pillars of NAFTA was that we would establish \nfree trade between these nations, and the assumption was very specific \nthat this free trade would continue on a dependable exchange rate \nbetween countries. For Mexico, once the free trade zone was \nestablished, to violate that assumption and say, ``Well, now we have \nfree trade in our countries but we are going to try to make our goods \nmore attractive in your country by devaluing the peso and thereby \nmaking our exports cheaper,'' was a violation of that agreement, \ncertainly of its spirit if not its letter.\n  The fact that the markets reacted so violently to the devaluation, \ncatching the experts at the IMF by surprise with that violence, \ndemonstrates the fact that moving away from the 3.5 relationship \nbetween the dollar and the peso was, indeed, a violation of the whole \nspirit of the NAFTA debate and represented a betrayal of those who had \nsupported NAFTA.\n  Conventional wisdom, as Mr. Bartley points out, says ``No, no, you \ncan devaluate a little bit and everything will be fine.'' The reaction \nin this circumstance said you cannot devalue a little bit when the \ndevaluation is a betrayal. You have destroyed the whole relationship \nthat existed between the two countries. That, in my view, was what was \nwrong.\n  Now, in the package put together by the administration, there is the \nopportunity for Alan Greenspan and his opposite number in Mexico, \nMiguel Mancera, to get together and say we will use these funds that \nare now available to us by virtue of the decision of the President of \nthe United States, not to bail out investors in Mexico but to start to \nextinguish pesos. We can acquire pesos by virtue of the money that we \nhave and then extinguish them--tear them up, if you will--and reverse \nthe monetary policy that flooded the Mexican economy with too many \npesos, which is what led to the devaluation in the first place.\n  We can use this money, these two gentlemen can, because they have the \nexpertise, they have the ability, and if the Treasury Department will \nback them, they will have the support they need to say we can use this \nmoney over time to reverse the betrayal of the devaluation. And if that \nis the approach, I am convinced we will see the Mexican crisis resolve \nitself happily.\n  Unfortunately, if that is not the approach, if the money is used in \nthe conventional wisdom fashion of trying to see to it that all of the \ninvestors in Mexico are made whole, then I think the dire predictions \nthat we have heard on this floor will indeed come true.\n  So, I salute the chairman of the Banking Committee. I am a member of \nthat committee, and I look forward to the hearings that he has told us \nhe will schedule. I think it is very appropriate for him to take on \nthis watchdog role that he outlined for us in his floor statements \nyesterday.\n  But I hope the administration will recognize that those of us who \nsupported what they proposed are looking to them to try to move to undo \nthat which triggered the crisis in the first place, which was the act \nof betrayal, the devaluation.\n  It was not the trade deficit. This country had a trade deficit, the \nUnited States, until 1914. The part of the country from which I come, \nthe West, was built by trade deficits. The railroad that linked the \nWest to the East and created all of the economic opportunities that \ncame in its wake was built with British money, not American.\n  Trade deficits are normal and healthy in developing countries. No, \n[[Page S2393]]  this devaluation was caused by overprinting of pesos, \nand it can be solved by using the breathing time purchased for it by \nthe administration to extinguish those pesos and move back to the time \nwhere two trading partners who have joined hands in good faith under \nthe umbrella of NAFTA can once again say: We can trust each other. \nThere will be no future betrayal. We will stand as we have stood in the \npast.\n  It cannot be done overnight. But it can be done if it is announced as \na goal, if it is announced as an open target, and the two central \nbankers, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Mancera, then set about to find a \nprogram to have it come to pass in a legitimate, orderly and proper \nfashion.\n  This is the way to get the Mexicans back on their feet and this is \nthe way to protect the American taxpayer. I salute Chairman D'Amato in \nhis vigilance to hold hearings to see to it that this is carried out in \nthat fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 8, 1991]\n               Mexico: Suffering the Conventional Wisdom\n\n                         (By Robert L. Bartley)\n\n       Confusion number one is that the best exchange rate is one \n     that produces the ``right'' trade balance. With the collapse \n     of the Marxism now behind us, this has become the most \n     pernicious idea loose on the earth today.--``Dollar \n     Turmoil,'' Review & Outlook, The Wall Street Journal, May 23, \n     1989.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       So some 93 million Mexicans are learning to their sorrow. \n     But perhaps there is something to be redeemed from their \n     misery. Just possibly the debacle will spell the end of \n     devaluation as a policy instrument, not only in Mexico but \n     around the world.\n       The initial conventional wisdom is quite the opposite, of \n     course. With the peso devaluation providing an utter \n     calamity, financial sophisticates have decided the mistake \n     was not doing it sooner. To the untutored, this logic may not \n     be intuitively obvious. Indeed, taxpayers who've poined up \n     some $50 billion in guarantees may be relieved to discover \n     there is another view: that the Dec. 20-22 devaluation was a \n     dreadful mistake, though one in which the Mexicans merely \n     followed prevailing conventional wisdom.\n       That wisdom holds, for example, that Mexico was ``forced'' \n     to devalue, which is myth number one. A collapsing currency \n     is usually the sign of a economy with an inflationary spiral \n     and an uncontrolled fiscal deficit. But the Mexican budget \n     was nearly in balance, and the ratio of its debt to GDP was \n     below the OECD average. Inflation has subsided to single \n     digits. Exports were surging, up 35% to the U.S., scarcely \n     the sign of an ``overvalued'' currency. Growth, while not as \n     vigorous as some developing nations, was picking up in the \n     wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The real \n     sector of the economy was not sick but healthy.\n\n\n                        foreign exchange legacy\n\n       In the financial sector, the incoming Zedillo \n     administration did inherit a problem: Foreign exchange \n     reserves were declining. As recorded in the graphs Bank of \n     Mexico Governor Miguel Mancera published on this page Jan 31, \n     adapted alongside today, they'd fallen from a peak of nearly \n     $30 billion before the March assassination of Presidential \n     nominee Donaldo Colosio to about $12 billion at the Zedilo \n     inauguration Dec. 1.\n       In dealing with this problem, however, the incoming \n     administration had a choice. The road not taken was simply to \n     tighten monetary policy. In the conventional view, this means \n     raising interest rates to attract dollar inflows and thus \n     stabilize reserves. In the more modern and more helpful \n     monetary approach to the balance of payments, the same \n     actions would be viewed as reducing the supply of pesos. A \n     lower supply of pesos relative to the supply of dollars would \n     increase the value of the peso, and a higher exchange rate \n     would reduce the incentive to cash peso for dollars. Reducing \n     the supply of pesos would also be likely to boost short-term \n     interest rates, though this is a side-effect, and long-term \n     rates might actually benefit.\n    \n    \n       Instead the Mexicans chose to devalue, widening the bands \n     on the exchange rate on Dec. 20 and going to a freely \n     floating rate on Dec.22. The latter decision really was \n     forced because the earlier one collapsed investor confidence \n     in the peso. Widening the bands clearly presaged devaluation \n     and led to a massive flight from the peso, and the loss of \n     half of the remaining reserves in one day. Judging by their \n     public economic plans, the Mexican authorities had in mind an \n     exchange rate of 4.5 pesos to the dollar, a 22 percent \n     devaluation from the earlier 3.5 floor. But with confidence \n     imploding, the peso dropped immediately to 5.5 then as low as \n     6.33, a 45% devaluation. With more than $50 billion in \n     guarantees from the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund, \n     international financial institutions and commercial banks now \n     announced, the peso recovered to 5.335 yesterday, devalued \n     35%.\n    \n    \n       Meanwhile, interest rates surged. In the wake of \n     devaluation, the rate on 28-day cetes, peso-denominated \n     Treasury bills, reached 39%, up from 13.75% in the Dec. 14 \n     action. Even with the support package, the 28-day cetes rate \n     was 32.75% at the most recent auction Feb. 1. Foreign \n     exchange reserves were almost exhausted before the bailout \n     package, and the Mexican economy is visibly collapsing into \n     recession. The argument that Mexico was ``forced'' to devalue \n     rests on the notion that otherwise it would have vanished \n     foreign exchange reserves, a recession and soaring interest \n     rates. With devaluation more than doubling interest rates, \n     it' absurd to suggest that the same rates would not have been \n     enough to defend a 3.5 peso exchange rate when the former \n     level of confidence still prevailed.\n       What's more, in all likelihood the damage has only begun. \n     Mexican living standards already are plunging. The \n     devaluation will surely result in a major surge of inflation, \n     which will offset any imagined trade advantages to a lower \n     exchange rate. The combination of inflation and recession \n     will throw the government budget into chaos. The economic \n     turmoil, especially the devastation of the nascent middle \n     class, will in turn produce political turmoil. Much of the \n     hard-won progress of the last 12 years will be reversed.\n       The Mexican outcome provides a particularly clear empirical \n     test of a set of conventional wisdoms about economic policy, \n     trade and exchange rates. For this was not some backwater \n     decision. The key decision-makers in Los Pinos (the White \n     House) and Hacendia (the Treasury)\n      boasted Ph.D.s in economics from Yale and Stanford. \n     Devaluation has long been urged by important business \n     sectors in Mexico, and advocated/predicted by various \n     commentators on Mexico, in particular journalist \n     Christopher Whalen and MIT economist Rudiger Dornbush. \n     When the action was taken, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd \n     Bentsen immediately said it ``will support the healthy \n     development of the Mexican economy.''\n       The arguments of this illustrious group are familiar: \n     Exchange rate pressures are caused and cured by trade \n     deficits. Thus the Mexican authorities thought their \n     fundamental problem was not purely monetary, but rather a \n     high current account deficit. And further that the deficit \n     could be cured by devaluation; a lower exchange rate would \n     make Mexican goods cheaper north of the Rio Grande and U.S. \n     goods more expensive south of the border. So Mexicans would \n     sell more and buy less, and the trade account would come into \n     balance, or at least to a ``sustainable'' level. Many \n     economists and such institutions as the International \n     Monetary Fund have long given the same advice to every \n     troubled economy in the world. It was the conventional wisdom \n     preached even to the U.S. in the 1980s, the occasion of the \n     ``Dollar Turmoil'' editorial quoted above.\n       Yet in fact trade deficits are perfectly normal, if not \n     indeed a sign of health. The international balances are an \n     accounting identity, and trade deficits and investment \n     inflows are two sides of the same coin. So any developing \n     nation that succeeds in attracting capital must by definition \n     run a trade deficit. Or to put it another way, a rapidly \n     growing economy will attract more than its share of the \n     world's investment and require more than its share of the \n     world's goods.\n       The key, then, is not to balance the current account with \n     the rest of the world, but to balance trade deficits with \n     voluntary investment inflows. Mexico ran current account \n     deficits of $25 billion in 1992 and $23 billion in 1993, and \n     during this time not only maintained the peso at around 3.1, \n     but accumulated large foreign reserves. In 1994, the current \n     account deficit was only slightly higher--$27 billion after \n     11 months. The problem came with the inflows, as political \n     turmoil shook investor confidence.\n       The biggest shock was the Colosio assassination. The \n     Salinas administration responded by devaluing the peso to 3.4 \n     from 3.1, within the previously announced bands. It also used \n     some of its foreign exchange hoard to buy pesos and \n     engineered a sharp boost in interest rates, taking 28-day \n     cetes to around 18% from 9.6%. This mix succeeded in \n     stabilizing foreign reserves from April to November, with a \n     blip over the threatened but ultimately aborted resignation \n     of Jorge Carpizo McGregor, widely seen as the Mexican \n     government's badge of integrity. In November, reserves \n     resumed their fall with the angry resignation of Deputy \n     Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu, who had been \n     investigating the assassination of his brother, Jose \n     Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary general of the ruling \n     Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who had tried to \n     fight party corruption. The resigning official repeated his \n     suspicions that drug dealers were working with elements of \n     the PRI, and charged that high party officials had obstructed \n     his probe.\n       Clearly these political events were shocks to monetary \n     policy and the exchange rate, as Governor Mancera argued in \n     his article here. He added, however, that in line with \n     standard central bank practice around the world, the \n     resulting foreign exchange transactions had been \n     ``sterilized,'' or offset with domestic transactions. The \n     idea is to insulate domestic monetary policy from the impact \n     of international markets (though in fact both turn on the \n     same money supply). So the central bank would sell its dollar \n     reserves, thus withdrawing pesos from circulation, but then \n     would buy domestic notes and bonds, putting the same pesos \n     back in circulation.\n       So internal measures of ``the money supply,'' the monetary \n     base for example, displayed their usual growth path with \n     their usual seasonal variations. But the point was that the \n     political shocks changed the demand for money; the supply was \n     not allowed \n     [[Page S2394]]  to adjust. In effect, the central bank \n     created the pesos used to buy away its dollar reserves. With \n     a large stock of reserves and a store of credibility earned \n     with the Salinas reforms, the sterilized interventions did \n     buy time for a monetary correction, but instead the new \n     administration decided to devalue. The $50 billion support \n     package has restored some stability, but without policy \n     changes Mexico could sterilize its way through $50 billion as \n     it just sterilized its way through $30 billion.\n\n\n                          a contrary principle\n\n       It would be quite another matter if some of the $50 billion \n     were used for unsterilized intervention, buying pesos and \n     extinguishing them. And while sterilization is indeed \n     standard policy under the international conventional wisdom, \n     it is not the only possible one. Indeed, the currency board \n     policies adopted in Hong Kong, Argentina and Estonia operate \n     on a contrary principle. Local currency is issued only when \n     new foreign exchange reserves are earned, and is extinguished \n     when reserves fall. Interestingly, Argentina reacted to the \n     Mexican crisis by eliminating its remaining bands, not \n     widening them. Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo clearly has \n     not adopted the conventional wisdom; indeed, he consummated \n     his currency board by inviting IMF advisers out of his \n     nation.\n       The currency board arrangement is reminiscent of the \n     classical gold standard before World War I, when the domestic \n     monetary base automatically rose or fell with the gain or \n     loss of gold reserves. The currency boards use foreign \n     currency instead of gold, of course. This means that while \n     all nations could use the gold standard, with currency boards \n     one central bank, presumably the Federal Reserve, would have \n     to use some other outside signal in setting the pace of money \n     creation.\n       The new Republican Congress is gearing up for hearings \n     about what went wrong in Mexico, which promise to become a \n     reexamination of the prevailing conventional wisdom. Clearly \n     the Republicans recognize the devaluation as a mistake, as \n     Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has plainly stated. What \n     advice, Republican committees want to know, did the Mexicans \n     get from the IMF and U.S. Treasury? And what advice will they \n     give the future Mexicos?\n       When the GOP won in November, who would have guessed that \n     one of the first effects would be a far-reaching examination \n     of international monetary policy? Even for us who thought its \n     arcane mysteries were as dangerous as they've now proved in \n     Mexico, it seemed too much to hope.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2392-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2394-S2398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 236\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to the \nresolution offered by Senator Reid which would protect the Social \nSecurity system. I am a cosponsor of the amendment to balance the \nbudget and a strong believer in it. But I feel the Social Security \nprogram is such that it ought to be off budget and that we ought to \nhave truth in regard to budgeting.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Reid amendment, which is designed to ensure \nthat the budget is not balanced on the backs of hard-working Americans \nwho have contributed toward their retirement with a portion of each \npaycheck. This is not only a protection for retirees but also a \nprotection for all Americans who pay into the program.\n  The amendment is simple. It protects the Social Security system by \nexcluding the receipts and the outlays of the Social Security program \nfrom the budget. The present system of collecting FICA payments from \nemployees' paychecks, as well as a matching contribution from \nemployers, is used to fund a Social Security trust fund. Currently, the \npayments to the Social Security recipients out of this trust fund are \nless than the amount taken in through the FICA payments. This surplus \nin contributions to the fund was created by Congress in the early \n1980's to account for the increase in the payout which will occur in \nthe future as the baby boomers begin to retire and draw upon Social \nSecurity, and was also done for the purpose of making the Social \nSecurity system at that particular time stable, and to try to make it \nactuarially sound for a great number of years.\n  We can liken the Social Security trust fund to the traditional \nsavings account most Americans have in the bank. By putting a little \nmoney into a savings account each month, and forgetting it is there, it \nwill eventually build up and become substantial by the time it is \nneeded. We do not include the savings account in our monthly operating \nbudget in our checking account, which is used to pay monthly bills and \nexpenses. As I read it, under the language in the balanced budget \nresolution now pending here in the Senate, this Social Security savings \naccount would no longer be completely safe to build up the surplus \nwhich will be needed to pay retiring baby boomers in the 21st century.\n  Next, I will turn to what are potential problems, which may arise \nunder the current language of the balanced budget resolution.\n  If at some time the payments to Social Security beneficiaries should \nbe greater than the receipts from the FICA tax revenues, a deficit \nwould occur. According to figures supplied by the Social Security \nAdministration this should occur starting in the year 2013. At this \npoint it is not clear what effect this deficit would have on Social \nSecurity payments. As part of a unified budget, would the deficit which \nwould begin to occur with respect to Social Security tax funds require \na drastic cut in other non-Social Security programs to make up the \ntrust fund deficit? Or would Congress change the formula for benefits \nand thus reduce those benefits?\n  A scenario, which could occur under the balanced budget amendment as \ncurrently drafted, concerns the ability of the Government to repay to \nSocial Security trust fund the interest owed from its Government \ninvestments. It seems that the intent of section 7 of the amendment is \nto exempt from total outlays the repayment of debt principal.\n Those words seem to be carefully chosen of ``debt principal.'' The \nunintended consequence--I hope it is unintended; it may not be \nunintended--to Social Security may be that should outlays exceed \nreceipts from the general Treasury funds then, according to section 7, \nno interest payments would be made to the Social Security trust fund.\n\n  What happens is that under the Social Security trust fund, we invest \nin Government securities. Those Government securities are not \ntransferable. Those Government securities are particularly Social \nSecurity trust fund investments. They draw interest. That is part of \nthe effort that was made to make the Social Security fund actuarially \nsound. But pursuant to the definitions under section 7 of outlays and \nof receipts, the definition of receipts, includes all receipts except \nthose obtained from borrowing.\n  The Social Security funds are in effect invested in Government \nsecurities and, therefore, they are borrowed money.\n  Then we find that in the outlays, the definition is that it includes \nall outlays that the Government is obligated to pay with the exception \nof the payments to the debt principal. Therefore, it does not include \nthe payments which we classify as interest. Since interest payments \nwill be on budget, that causes a problem relative to whether or not \ninterest payments will be paid back.\n  The result of this nonpayment of interest due on principal debt could \nsubstantially affect the stability of the bonds, which secure the debt \nand the trust fund. If this should happen the bonds would probably go \ninto default and thus have little value. This would cause a \ndestabilization in the funds invested with Social Security trust fund \ndollars, and a loss of faith by the American people.\n  To show what could happen, we look ahead and see what is the amount \nof money we are referring to and what could possibly be involved with \nthis amendment. According to the Social Security Administration, they \nanticipate that by the year 2003 there will be $1,151,300,000,000 in \nassets of the Social Security fund. And, under the law, those assets, a \nsurplus, will be invested in Government securities. If the interest \ncould not be paid on those because of the operation of on-budget \nactivity, then you would have $1 trillion that is in some bonds in \nwhich the Government has invested with no interest paid, and therefore \ncausing serious problems, and certainly this would deprive the Social \nSecurity funds of the interest that has been accrued in the event that \nthe on-budget does not pay them back.\n  This could be averted through challenges in courts, but that raises \nquestions of interpretation under the principles of constitutional \nconstruction.\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\n  Generally, constitutional provisions have received a broader and more \nliberal construction than statutes. The Supreme Court in Kansas v. \nColorado, 206 U.S. 46, 88 (1906), upheld this general rule stating \n``the Constitution is not to be construed technically and narrowly, \nlike an indictment, * * *, but as [a document that creates] a system of \ngovernment whose provisions are designed to make effective and \noperative all the governmental powers granted.'' The balanced budget \namendment presently contains exceptions which raise issues as to how \nbroadly it should be interpreted.\n  Section 7 of the balanced budget resolution contains language which \ncreates exceptions to what shall be counted as receipts and outlays of \nthe U.S. Government. The provision which pertains to outlays, \nspecifically excepts from the calculation of outlays the repayment of \ndebt principal. How broadly this exception may be interpreted raises \ngreat concern. The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of statutory \nexceptions and has held that ``in construing provisions * * *, in which \na general statement of policy is qualified by an exception, we usually \nread the exception narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation \nof the provision.'' Commissioner v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (1989); \n``where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general \nprohibition, additional exceptions are not implied.''\n The Supreme Court in a 1991 case of United States versus Smith, and \nthen in the case of Citicorp Industrial Credit, Inc. versus Brock, a \n1987 case--held similarly to the previous courts, although this case \ndealt particularly with the Fair Labor Standards Act, it follows the \nstatutory interpretation principle for a narrow interpretation of \nstatutory exemptions. This textual principle of construction regarding \nthe narrow construction of exceptions is included in the Canons of \nConstruction, which are now followed by the U.S. Supreme Court, which \nwe generally refer to as the Rehnquist court.\n\n  We need to make sure that the scenarios that I have described do not \nhappen.\n To do so will require an amendment to the present balanced budget \nresolution being offered. We should keep in mind that Social Security \nis a program self-financed from contributions by employees and \nemployers, which does not contribute 1 penny to the deficit. In fact, \nCongress, realizing this fact, included in the 1990 Budget Enforcement \nAct, a provision that declared that the funds were off budget. \nUnfortunately, the current resolution would clearly put Social Security \non budget and thus overturn our recent decision to affirm the off-\nbudget status of Social Security.\n\n  I have supported a balanced budget amendment since my first days in \nthe Senate. There have been several times in the past where the passage \nof an amendment was close but failed for one reason or another. But now \nthat the amendment has passed the House, there is renewed momentum \nwhich I believe will carry the amendment successfully through the \nSenate. But as we debate and develop the balanced budget amendment, we \nneed to be sure that we also protect the integrity of the Social \nSecurity System and maintain truth in budgeting. The protection of the \nself-funded system can be maintained by keeping it off budget and out \nof the balanced budget process.\n  Mr. President, there has been raised the issue of whether or not the \nReid amendment is proper in that it contains language which, in effect, \nrefers to existing statutes. Some say this should not be included in \nthe Constitution. However, it has been done before, in the 21st \namendment. It was the 21st amendment that repealed the 18th amendment. \nThe 18th amendment, as you remember, dealt with intoxicating liquors, \nand the 21st amendment repealed it. But in section 2 of the 21st \namendment, it has this language:\n\n       The transportation or importation into any State, \n     territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or \n     use therein of intoxicating liquors in violation of the laws \n     thereof is hereby prohibited.\n\n  What we were stating in that amendment was a reference to laws of \nStates--not just the United States, but the laws of the States in its \nreference, and that, in my judgment, is a precedent for including the \nlanguage that is included in the Reid amendment.\n  Another source for precedent is in the 14th amendment--the 14th \namendment, of course, is one of the amendments that was adopted \nfollowing the War Between the States. In section 4 of that amendment, \nit makes reference to existing statutes. In that section it states:\n\n       The validity of the public debt of the United States \n     authorized by law, including debts incurred for the payment \n     of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing \n     insurrection or rebellion shall not be questioned.\n\n  Again, it is referring to existing debts that were created under laws \nof the United States for the payment of pensions and bounties for \nservices in suppressing insurrection or rebellion. And then it goes \nforward in that section,\n\n       * * * but neither the United States or any State shall \n     assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of \n     insurrection or rebellion against the United States or any \n     claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave, but all such \n     debts, obligations, and claims shall be held illegal and \n     void.\n\n  So we have seen reference to statutory language in the Constitution \non at least two occasions.\n  I think others are seeking the floor. I am glad to yield if the \nSenator from South Carolina wishes to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. It \nshould be noted that the law in the Constitution is being cited not \nonly by the distinguished Senator, but by a former Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the State of Alabama, Senator Heflin. He has studied \nthe law and legal precedence--particularly constitutional provisions. I \ncompliment him for speaking out on this particular occasion.\n  It is not my intent to belabor the point, but I certainly want to \nemphasize that there is no alternative other than including the Reid \namendment. Why do I say that? Section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement \nAct, says, thou shalt not use Social Security funds with respect to \nreceipts, outlays, or concerning the deficit.\n  That law passed this particular body on a vote of 98-2, in 1990, and \nwas signed into law by President George Walker Herbert Bush on November \n5, 1990. It is the law, and it has been reiterated again and again. On \nMonday of this week, Mr. President, it was cited by the distinguished \nmajority whip--the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. When asked \nabout specific cuts, he said:\n\n       Nobody--Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, \n     moderate--is even thinking about using Social Security to \n     balance the budget, to pass the joint resolution for the \n     balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\n  They are not thinking about it, they are doing it. You actually \nrepeal section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act that says: Thou \nshalt not use Social Security trust funds for deficit purposes.\n  Why is that, Mr. President? It clearly states in section 7 of the \nresolution:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United \n     States Government, except those derived from borrowing.\n\n  The Social Security receipts in the Social Security trust fund is \nincluded in deficit calculations under this definition. Some on the \nother side have said, ``Do not worry, we will legislate later.''\n  But I recall that none other than President George Washington, in his \nFarewell Address, said:\n\n       If in the opinion of the people the distribution or \n     modification of the Constitutional powers be in any \n     particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the \n     way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no \n     change by usurpation; for though this is one instance of \n     good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments \n     are destroyed.\n\n  The Father of this Country knew that you could not change the \nConstitution by statute.\n  I have been in favor of balancing the budget. I helped the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] in 1982 when the balanced \nbudget amendment received the two-thirds required, the 67 votes.\n  We tried again with my distinguished senior colleague, Senator \nThurmond, in 1986 but we did not get two-thirds required.\n  [[Page S2396]] We tried last year under the distinguished leadership \nof the Senator from Illinois [Senator Simon] but again failed.\n  We have been in the vineyards working on this particular problem, but \npart and parcel of the problem is another contract with America--the \ncontract we made with the senior citizens of America back in 1935.\n  We felt so keenly about honoring that contract, that we raised taxes \nin 1983, under the Greenspan commission, to keep the program fiscally \nsound and to maintain that solemn trust. To maintain that contract with \nour senior citizens--not for defense, not for welfare, not for foreign \naid, not for other Government programs--but for the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  If you had said at that time that we were raising taxes for welfare, \nforeign aid, defense or other spending, I would have voted no and other \nSenators would have voted no. But instead, we said, ``This is a trust \nfund and we must continue to keep that trust.''\n  Like the Senator from Mississippi has said, no one is thinking about \nviolating that trust, but yet we are constitutionally dissolving it by \nincluding revenues from the Social Security trust in the definition of \ntotal receipts. Legislative fixes will not work. As George Washington \nsaid, you cannot amend the Constitution except as the Constitution \nitself designates.\n  I am a reasonable man--as Rex Harrison said in ``My Fair Lady,'' an \nordinary man--just trying to get along on the floor of the Senate, \ncertainly supporting a balanced budget, but feeling compelled to take \nissue here having established a record in protecting Social Security.\n  In the Budget Committee in 1990, I proposed the Social Security \nPreservation Act. It stipulated that Social Security trust funds should \nnot be used in calculating the deficit. It was reported out 20 to 1, \nand on the Senate floor passed by a vote of 98 to 2. And still, I see \nadministrations, Republican and Democrat; I see Congresses, Republican \nand Democrat, violating the law.\n  Unfortunately, it does not surprise me. Former Senator Harry Byrd \nshepherded his own statute through the Congress which said, in essence, \n``Thou budget shall be balanced.'' It was the law, and yet we never \nadhered to it. I do not know how we get away with this thievery. But I \nknow that something is amiss when honest public servants say that no \none is considering using Social Security to balance the budget when, on \nthe face of the legislation, it would require it. At that point, I have \nto speak out.\n  As a result, I have written a letter to all the Senators to put to \nrest ideas about changing it by legislation later on. You cannot amend \nthe Constitution by legislation. You have to get a joint resolution, \nhave three readings in the Senate, and have an affirmation of 37, or \ntwo-thirds, of the sovereign States of America. So even if I wanted to \nprotect Social Security by statute, I could not do what they say can be \ndone.\n  I will read the letter. This is to every one of my colleagues in the \nSenate.\n\n       In 1983, the Congress made the Social Security fund \n     fiscally sound by programmed tax increases. Naturally, the \n     Congress would never have supported these tax increases if \n     the monies were to be used for foreign aid, defense, welfare \n     or the deficit costs of government. But violating the truth-\n     in-budgeting principle, the Administrations and Congresses \n     continued to use the Social Security trust fund to obscure \n     the size of the deficit. Annoyed with this violation, the \n     Budget Committee voted nearly unanimously in 1990 and the \n     United States Senate with a vote of 98-2 joined the House in \n     the now formal statutory law of the United States in section \n     13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act, forbidding by law the \n     use of the Social Security fund for the deficit. The \n     violation continues. Now comes the balanced budget amendment \n     to the Constitution requiring that, ``Total receipts shall \n     include all receipts of the United States Government except \n     those derived from borrowing.'' Left alone, this provision \n     would repeal Section 13301 and constitutionally endorse the \n     violation. The Reid amendment presently under consideration \n     corrects this unintended repeal by stating that the Social \n     Security trust fund, ``* * * should not be counted as \n     receipts or outlays for the purpose of this article.''\n       John Mitchell, the former Attorney General was known for \n     the axiom, ``Watch what we do, not what we say.'' It should \n     be made crystal clear that we mean what we say. If you want \n     to continue to use the trust fund and breach the trust, vote \n     against the Reid amendment. There it is clear and simple, so \n     everyone understands.\n       If you want to maintain the trust--the Contract with \n     America made back in 1935--then please support the Reid \n     amendment.\n\n  If this Reid amendment is allowed, there is no misunderstanding that \nwe will maintain the trust.\n  If the Reid amendment is defeated, we will be taking $636 billion \naway from the trust fund in order to obscure the size of the deficit.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, is it not true--and I am not being solicitous. No one \nknows more about the budget process on this floor than the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, and no one has more \ncredentials for making the tough decisions about what we should do to \ncut the budget than the Senator from South Carolina. He has always put \nhis vote where his mouth is on this issue which, I might say, very few \nMembers of either party have done in the past.\n  The Senator just pointed out that we are talking about the difference \nbetween, for this next year, $600-some billion--not this year--$600-\nsome billion, between now and the time it comes time to balance the \nbudget, additional, we have to find, if the Reid amendment passes.\n  Is it not true that in addition to that, what is likely to happen is \nthat our friends, who are going to find increasing pressure to balance \nthe budget and who have never been great friends of the trust fund to \nbegin with, are going to, in the next year or 2 or 3, as we move toward \nthe year 2003, since most young people the age of your children and \nmine believe they are not going to get Social Security, anyway, is it \nnot likely that we will see a movement that we will cut Social Security \nbenefits; that we will either raise the retirement age or cut benefits, \nfurther increasing the surplus that Social Security will generate \nbetween now and the year 2014, and further making the deficit look \nsmaller, so that it is easier to meet the balanced budget requirement \nby the year 2003?\n  Does the Senator think that is as likely a scenario as any other we \nare likely to see?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Delaware \nand former chairman of the Judiciary Committee knows it well. He is a \nconstitutional expert, and is right on target as to the practical \nresult.\n  We see several Senators trying to avoid the problem and not engage in \ntruth in budgeting. We have truth in packaging and truth in lending, \nbut we do not have truth in budgeting. It was not in the Contract With \nAmerica and it is not in the current version of this balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield for an additional question, as I \nunderstand it, the distinguished majority leader is going to come to \nthe floor at some point and offer a legislative fix for this \nconstitutional dilemma, to try to convince all the American people that \nthe Republicans or those who are for the balanced budget do not want to \ncut Social Security and are not going to be using Social Security trust \nfund moneys to reduce the deficit.\n  Now, we both know that we cannot alter--the Senator said it more \neloquently than anyone thus far--we cannot alter the Constitution other \nthan by the rules the Constitution sets out.\n  We will assume for just a moment the distinguished Senator from \nKansas, if that is what he decides to do, comes along and says we will \npass a resolution promising we will not do that. Is it the \nunderstanding of my friend from South Carolina that means, for \ncalculation purposes of what constitutes the deficit, that between now \nand the year 2000, we will not count the $60 billion surplus this year \nand the $100 billion surplus in the year 2000, toward reducing the \ndeficit?\n  Is that what he is going to do?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There can be no legislative fix. Constitutionally you \nare mandating Social Security receipts as part of total receipts. If \nthe distinguished majority leader wants to put in a separate \nconstitutional amendment, that may be different. I am not trying to \ntear down House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. I voted for it three times. I would like to vote for \nit a fourth time, but I cannot in good conscience repeal my own \nstatute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n   [[Page S2397]] Mr. BIDEN. When we debated this in the Judiciary \nCommittee, and this legislation came out of the committee, I, along \nwith Senator Feinstein and others, argued for this amendment in the \ncommittee. One of our senior Republican colleagues was very blunt about \nthis issue. He said, along with former Senator Tsongas of the Concord \nCoalition, who came in to testify, the following:\n  That if you take Social Security out of the mix here and set it aside \nso it is not covered by a constitutional amendment, we are not likely \nto do anything to fix it.\n  What they mean by ``fix it'' is change Social Security; that is, \neither raise the retirement age, cut the benefits or increase the \ntaxes, because everybody knows that by the time--I am 52--by the time \nit comes time for me to collect Social Security, there are not going to \nbe enough of your children and my children to pay for my Social \nSecurity benefits. So something is going to have to be done.\n  Unrelated to the balanced budget amendment and the impact of the Reid \namendment on the balanced budget amendment or the impact of the \nbalanced budget amendment on Social Security, unrelated to the balanced \nbudget amendment, just Social Security all by itself, does the Senator \nfrom South Carolina see any way in which Social Security can be \nprotected from significant change if, in fact, it is included as part \nof the balanced budget amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, taking it off-budget is the only way to protect it. \nThat is the only way that we can be sure that Social Security funds are \nnot being used to mask the size of the deficit.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You can still go in and change the age if you wanted to \nor raise the FICA tax. I do not want to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. But I think the Reid amendment is very clear. It states \nthat the receipts, ``including attributable interests and outlays of \nthe Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \nDisability Insurance Trust Fund used to provide old age survivors and \ndisability benefits shall not be counted as receipts or outlays for the \npurpose of this article.''\n  It does not say that you have to have a trust fund. They can go in \nand repeal the 1935 Roosevelt Social Security if they wanted to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds more?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to thank the Senator for allowing me to interrupt \nhim with all these questions. It seems pretty clear to me this is about \ntwo things: One, they need the Social Security dollars to make the \ndeficit look like it is less than it is, and then the next step is they \nare going to need to try to deal with changing it to increase the \namount of money they get in the trust funds to make the deficit look \neven less, which means that Social Security is going to get hit.\n  But I will withhold my statement on this until tomorrow. I thank my \ncolleague for letting me interrupt.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I cannot emphasize enough, that the surest \nway to harm Social Security, the surest way to deplete the trust fund, \nthe surest way to open a loophole which will swallow the balanced \nbudget amendment is to pass this exemption.\n  If we open up this loophole it will be big enough to drive a truck \nthrough, and it will not be long before the convoy starts rolling.\n  If we keep the balanced budget amendment whole, however, we will \nprotect Social Security. Several of my colleagues appear to \nmisunderstand how the trust fund works. The extra money in the trust \nfund is borrowed by the Treasury, not stolen but borrowed. And just \nlike any other loan in the country, it must be repaid. The trust fund \nloses nothing. In fact, it gains the interest which the Treasury has to \npay on the loan. That will not change under the balanced budget \namendment.\n  The integrity of the trust fund is furthered by the balanced budget \namendment. Any money the Treasury may borrow, must be repaid. Just \nbecause a balanced budget rule is adopted, there is no reason to think \nthe status of the trust fund will change. It is a complete non \nsequitur, Mr. President. There is absolutely nothing in the balanced \nbudget amendment which says the funds designated for the Social \nSecurity trust fund will not remain so dedicated. They will. So let me \nsay it again, as clearly and concisely as I possibly can--the trust \nfund is not harmed in any way, shape, or form by the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, the trust fund will not fare so well under the Reid \nexemption. If the loophole goes into effect, all kinds of unrelated \nspending programs will suddenly be redesignated as Social Security and \nwill soak up the Social Security surplus. That means the Treasury will \nnot have to borrow money from Social Security because the new programs \nwill be Social Security. What an insidious turn of events. Under the \nproposed exemption, the trust fund will actually be depleted years \nbefore it would without the exemption.\n  I want to respond briefly to the notion that we cannot protect Social \nSecurity through the implementing legislation. The balanced budget \namendment requires that the whole budget be balanced. Surpluses are \ncertainly permitted, and nothing in the balanced budget amendment \ndiscourages us saving for a rainy day, as the Social Security system \nnow does. None of the statutory protections that are now enacted will \nbe brushed aside, and nothing keeps us from keeping the accounts \nsegregated and accounting in a way that shows what is dedicated to \nSocial Security. Nothing will change in the way we segregate Social \nSecurity if the balanced budget amendment is adopted.\n  It is true that the budget must be balanced. But this will help \nprotect Social Security recipients who rely on those moneys after 2029, \nwhen the trust funds are projected to be insolvent. At that point, the \nbalanced budget amendment will require that there be sufficient money \nto pay those benefits. And a balanced budget rule will help those who \nrely on Social Security after 2019, when the trust fund will begin to \nredeem its loan to the Federal Government. To the extent that the \nFederal Government is in a better position to repay this debt, the \nSocial Security recipients are more strongly protected. And to the \nextent that the Government continues its profligate ways, it will be \nless, not more, able to repay the debt to the trust fund.\n  So the best way to protect Social Security recipients in the long run \nis to adopt a balanced budget amendment so that the Government will be \nable to pay its debt to retirees.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE.

This \nlegislation would provide for a fair and prompt settlement of the \nongoing labor-management dispute affecting Major League Baseball.\n  Major League Baseball has historically occupied a unique place in \nAmerican life. The parties to the current contentious dispute have been \nunable to resolve their differences, despite many months of \nnegotiations and the assistance of one of this country's most skilled \nmediators. If the dispute is permitted to continue, there is likely to \nbe substantial economic damage to the cities and communities in which \nmajor league franchises are located and to the communities that host \nspring training. The ongoing dispute also threatens further serious \nharm to an important national institution.\n  The bill I am transmitting today is a simple one. It would authorize \nthe President to appoint a 3-member National Baseball Dispute \nResolution Panel. This Panel of impartial and skilled arbitrators would \nbe empowered to gather information from all sides and impose a binding \nagreement on the parties. The Panel would be urged to act as quickly as \npossible. Its decision would not be subject to judicial review.\n  In arriving at a fair settlement, the Panel would consider a number \nof factors affecting the parties, but it could also take into account \nthe effect on the public and the best interests of the game.\n  The Panel would be given sufficient tools to do its job, without the \nneed for further appropriations. Primary support for its activities \nwould come from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, but \nother agencies would also be authorized to provide needed support.\n  The dispute now affecting Major League Baseball has been a protracted \none, and I believe that the time has come to take action. I urge the \nCongress to take prompt and favorable action on this legislation.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend a provision of part A of title IX of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, relating to Indian \neducation, to provide a technical amendment, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n      the indian education title technical correction act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to make a \ntechnical correction to the Indian title in the Improving America's \nSchools Act. I am pleased that Senator Daniel Inouye, vice chairman of \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs, has joined me as a cosponsor of this \nmeasure.\n  The technical corrections bill would correct a minor oversight in \nlanguage which could have major ramifications in the education of \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native children. The law currently states \nthat in order for a school to be eligible for an Indian Education Act \nformula grant, it must have 10 eligible students and have 25 percent of \nits student population eligible for the program. This language \nunnecessarily restricts a schools eligibility for grant funding by \nrequiring schools to meet both criteria. I have been informed that the \nintent of the conferees was to include the word ``or'' rather than \n``and'' thereby creating the potential for American Indians and Alaska \nNatives to have a greater opportunity to benefit from the Improving \nAmerica's Schools Act. This amendment is intended to correct this \noversight and fulfill the true intent of the act, to improve schools \nfor all Americans, including Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  Mr. President, time is of the essence with regard to this \nlegislation. I understand that the Department of Education is currently \ndrafting regulations to implement the new provisions of the Indian \nEducation Act. Unless this technical oversight is not immediately \nfixed, the existing language will result in the disqualification of \nmany schools serving American Indians and Alaska Natives through the \npromulgation of regulation which do not accurately reflect the intent \nof Congress. Therefore, I hope that the Senate will act quickly on this \namendment in order to prevent unnecessary hardships for the many \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native students which stand to benefit from \nthis act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT.\n\n       Section 9112(a)(1)(A) of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (as added by section 101 of the \n     Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-382)) \n     is amended by striking ``and'' and inserting ``or''.\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, even though technical correction \nbills are ordinarily not drafted until late each session of Congress, I \ncosponsor a bill, introduced by the chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, Senator John McCain of Arizona, to make a one word technical \ncorrection to the Indian title in the Improving America's Schools Act. \nI do so because the Department of Education is now drafting regulations \nto implement new provisions of the Indian Education Act, and unless \ncorrected promptly, the program for Indian children will be limited in \nways that the 103d Congress did not intend.\n  Let me provide a context for the technical correction to Public Law \n103-382 that would be accomplished by enactment of this bill. Among \nother things, the Indian Education Act provides for formula grants to \nschools to enable them to operate small supplemental programs for \nIndian children. In its version of the reauthorization, the House of \nRepresentatives would have required that a school have 20 Indian \nchildren or that the Indian children make up 25 percent of the student \nbody of the school. The Senate, on the other hand, would have required \na minimum of 10 children or that they make up 25 percent of the student \nbody of the \n[[Page S2400]]  school. Conferees agreed upon the Senate version: 10 \nstudents or 25 percent of the school's enrollment.\n  Mr. President, the issue before the conferees was only whether a \nminimum of 10 or 20 Indian children would be required for eligibility. \nThe conjunction ``or'' was not ever an issue, and that it was not is \ntestified to by the side-by-sides prepared for the Senate and House \nconferees. But, the final document prepared by the Senate Legislative \nCounsel substituted the word ``and'' for ``or.'' And that final \ndocument was enacted into law.\n  What this bill would do is correct the technical error. I have \nconsulted conferees and their notes verify that the word ``or'' was in \nboth House and Senate versions of the bill. The effect of the bill I am \nintroducing would be to restore language intended by both the House and \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, if this bill should not be enacted, hundreds of \nclassrooms with Indian children would lose the supplemental programs, \nall because of a drafting error. In reauthorizing the Indian Education \nAct, this was emphatically not the result intended by the Congress, and \nI hope that I may count on my colleagues to support enactment of this \ntechnical corrections bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 378. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to exchange \ncertain lands of the Columbia Basin Federal reclamation project, \nWashington, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n              THE BOISE CASCADE LAND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, together with Senator \nMurray, I introduce a bill to authorize a land exchange between the \nBureau of Reclamation and the Boise Cascade Corp. Unfortunately for its \nproponents, this legislation has been introduced during both the 102d \nand 103d Congress. This year, Senator Murray and I will work to pass \nthis legislation and finally get it signed into law.\n  Boise Cascade's plywood and sawmill operations in Kettle Falls, WA \nare adjacent to 26 acres of land owned by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nThe Bureau land provides a buffer between scenic Lake Roosevelt and \nBoise Cascade's operations. The National Park Service, which manages \nthe Bureau's land, historically has issued a special-use permit \nallowing Boise Cascade to operate along the edge of the land. However, \nthe Park Service has indicated that it may not reissue the permit when \nit expires in 1995, and has stated conclusively that the permit will \nnot be reissued upon expiration in 2000. Consequently, passage of this \nlegislation this year is crucial.\n  Without a special use permit, Boise Cascade would not be able to \ncontinue its operations at Kettle Falls. Thus, 350 mill jobs would be \nlost and the community would be devastated. To prevent such a \ncatastrophe, Boise Cascade has proposed exchanging 138 acres of land it \nowns for 6 of the 26 acres it needs to continue operating. The 138 \nacres is primarily wildlife habitat located along Lake Roosevelt and \nthe Colville River, and would be conveyed to the Bureau of Reclamation \nupon passage of this legislation.\n  This land exchange is supported by the Bureau of Reclamation, the \nPark Service, and Boise Cascade. In addition, a local citizen's group \nconcerned with Columbia River water quality issues has negotiated a \nseries of mitigation measures with Boise Cascade, and has given its \nfull support to the land exchange.\n  Mr. President, this exchange make good sense and will avoid a \npotentially severe problem. Last year the Energy Committee reported out \nof committee the exact legislation that I am introducing today. I urge \nthe committee to promptly review this legislation, and I will work with \nthem on this issue. I thank my colleagues for their \nconsideration.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about an \nimportant bill for Washington State. Today, I join my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] introducing legislation to \nauthorize a land exchange between Boise Cascade Corp. and the Bureau of \nReclamation.\n  Boise Cascade operates a sawmill adjacent to the Lake Roosevelt \nNational Recreation Area near Kettle Falls, WA. The land located \nbetween the mill and the lake is owned by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nHowever, it is managed by the National Park Service under its authority \nover the Lake Roosevelt unit. Unfortunately, the proximity of the mill \nto the recreation area has led to concerns within the Park Service \nabout potential effects of Boise operation on the public.\n  Mr. President, Boise Cascade has been a stellar corporate citizen in \nthis area. The company has absolutely no desire to adversely affect the \nrecreation area. In fact, given their druthers, they'd like to enhance \nthe area. That's why this bill is so important.\n  If we enact this bill, we will ensure Boise's ability to continue its \nmill operation. In addition, we will add significant benefit to Lake \nRoosevelt. That's because this bill seeks to implement a land exchange \nthat will add 132 acres to the national recreation area. Here's how it \nworks: Boise Cascade owns 138 acres along the lake near the Colville \nRiver. This land provides excellent wildlife forage habitat. The Bureau \nowns 26 acres between the mill and the lake. In exchange for 6 of these \nacres, Boise will deed its 138 to the Government for incorporation into \nthe recreation area.\n  Mr. President, this is a great deal for the taxpayers and the \ncitizens of Kettle Falls: 138 acres for just 6. There are 350 jobs at \nthe Boise mill. Needless to say, it's the major employer in that area. \nThe terms of this exchange have been mutually agreed to by the \nagencies, the company, the local citizens, and conservation groups \nconcerned with protecting the lake. It's good for the community, and \nit's good for the resource. I hope all my colleagues will recognize \nthis, and support our efforts to move the bill toward passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 380. A bill to provide for public access to information regarding \nthe availability of insurance, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n         THE ANTI-REDLINING IN INSURANCE DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to reintroduce \nlegislation that I originally introduced in the Senate last year, the \nAnti-Redlining in Insurance Disclosure Act of 1995. Although the House \nof Representatives was able to pass a more limited disclosure bill \nduring the 103d Congress, I was disappointed that the Senate was unable \nto address what I see as not only a critically important civil rights \nissue, but also an issue essential to any hopes of revitalizing the \nstruggling economies of our inner cities.\n  In recent years, this Nation has made tremendous strides in fighting \nvarious forms of discrimination, particularly in terms of employment \nand educational opportunities. Unfortunately, the progress we have made \nin combating these forms of discrimination has not lessened the need to \nexercise the same level of persistence in extinguishing equally \noffensive, less subtle forms of racism and bigotry.\n  The term redlining actually evolved from the practice of particular \nindividuals in the banking industry using maps with red lines drawn \naround certain neighborhoods. These individuals would then instruct \ntheir loan officers to avoid offering their financial services to \nresidents of these redlined neighborhoods. These red lines typically \nencircled low-income and minority communities, resulting in the \nunavailability of the financial services necessary to purchase a home, \na business, or an automobile. But even as Congress identified and moved \nto curb these discriminatory practices in the banking industry, a \ndisturbing and growing level of discrimination was emerging from the \ninsurance industry that would continue to deny certain individuals the \nopportunity to own their own home or start a small business.\n  Home ownership is an aspiration that transcends the artificial \nboundaries of race and income in America. As anyone who has secured \ntheir first home loan can attest, there is an extraordinary feeling of \nprestige and sense of self-worth that accompanies home ownership. But \nfor those individuals that reside in the economically depressed inner-\ncity neighborhoods of Milwaukee, Chicago, and other such cities, these \nfeelings of pride and accomplishment are even further intensified. It \nis \n[[Page S2401]]  tragic that redlining practices exist, and unless the \nFederal Government takes forceful action we will continue to send the \nwrong message to those who seek to stabilize and stimulate these inner-\ncity economies. We must expose and eliminate these appalling redlining \npractices that prevent hard-working, fully qualified individuals from \npursuing their dream, and their right, to obtain a home or business \nloan.\n  Though it may seem obvious to some, we must recognize that any \nserious effort to rebuild the economies of these inner-city communities \nmust have minority home and small business ownership as their \ncornerstones. There are many well-motivated individuals in these \ncommunities that are committed to economic revitalization--whether it \nis purchasing a home for their family or starting a small business and \ncreating jobs. It is heartening that there are both Democrats and \nRepublicans, conservatives and liberals who recognize the need to \nrevitalize our inner cities, and yet it seems fruitless to discuss \nideas such as enterprise zones and community development block grants \nwithout addressing a glaring problem that prevents an otherwise \nqualified individual from owning their own home or business.\n  Several years ago Congress reacted to reports and studies that an \nelement of the financial services industry was preventing residents of \nminority and low-income communities from obtaining home loans. In \nresponse, Congress passed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act [HMDA] which \nrequired banks and thrifts to report their lending practices using a \nset level of criteria. This legislation, which contrary to dire \npredictions has had a nominal impact on the vitality and prosperity of \nthe lending industry, has provided Federal and State regulators in the \nmortgage financing field with detailed information to identify mortgage \nredlining. This critical piece of legislation was passed for precisely \nthe reason of enhancing the power of State and Federal authorities to \ndetermine if banks and other lending institutions were discriminating \nin their lending practices. But as effective as disclosure requirements \nhave been in exposing these abuses in the banking industry, it is \nclearly not enough.\n  Property insurance, as we all know, is almost a prerequisite to \nobtaining a home loan. This was best illustrated by Judge Frank \nEasterbrook of the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in that \ncourt's ruling that redlining practices are illegal and a violation of \nthe Fair Housing Act. Speaking for a unanimous court, Judge Easterbrook \nobserved that ``lenders require their borrowers to secure property \ninsurance. No insurance, no loan; no loan, no house; lack of insurance \nthus makes housing unavailable.'' Judge Easterbrook's remarks \nunderscore the need to place people of all racial and ethnic \nbackgrounds on a level playing field when it comes to the opportunity \nto purchase insurance. In short, denying an individual access to \naffordable and adequate property insurance is essentially denying that \nindividual access to home ownership.\n  The key question, of course, is do redlining practices exist? \nCountless new reports and studies indicate that there is a prevalent \nand growing level of discriminatory underwriting in the insurance \nindustry. Studies such as the 1979 report of the Illinois, Indiana, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin Advisory Committees to the \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights and\n the recent study on home insurance in 14 cities released by the \ncommunity advocacy group ACORN have pointed out that insurance \nredlining practices are widespread in America. These reports highlight \nthe fallacies in the contention that lack of adequate insurance in many \nof these communities is due to economics and statistically based risk \nassessment. In addition, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that \nsuggests individuals residing in minority and low-income communities \nare systematically denied affordable or adequate homeowners insurance.\n\n  I was shocked and outraged when I first saw the extensive media \nreports of the statements made by a district sales manager of a large \ninsurance company which serves the city of Milwaukee. The sales manager \nwas recorded saying to his insurance agents:\n\n       Very honestly, I think you write too many blacks * * *. You \n     gotta sell good, solid, premium paying white people * * *. \n     They own their homes, the white works * * *. Very honestly, \n     black people will buy anything that looks good right now * * \n     * but when it comes to pay for it next time * * * you're not \n     going to get your money out of them * * *. The only way \n     you're going to correct your persistency is get away from \n     blacks.\n\n  This policy of denying affordable insurance to minorities was also \nillustrated when the manager showed one agent how to accomplish this \ngoal by stating that\n\n       * * * if a black wants insurance, you don't have to say, \n     just tell them, because based on this kind of policy, the \n     company will only allow me to accept an annual premium. Do it \n     that way.\n\n  Mr. President, Milwaukee, WI is truly a wonderful city. It has \nmidwestern charm, a strong work ethic and like many other of our \nNation's urban communities, a large inner-city population that is \nstruggling to become economically vibrant and prosperous. But what \nredlining practices do is deny those who are playing by the rules the \nopportunity to own their own home or business. Again, there are those \nwho will assert that insurance is less available in these areas because \nof risk-assessment and other economic principles. But according to a \nstudy by the Missouri insurance department, data comparing low-income \nminority areas with low-income white areas in St. Louis and Kansas City \nshowed that low-income minorities on average paid higher premiums for \nhomeowners insurance than white homeowners of similar means for \ncomparable coverage. On top of this, actual losses were lower in the \nminority areas. Clearly the problem of discrimination exists and is \nwidespread. The question now is what can we do about it.\n  Redlining practices are illegal. This was established by Judge \nEasterbrook and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in NAACP versus \nAmerican Family Insurance, when the court ruled that the Fair Housing \nAct also applies to the underwriting of homeowners insurance. The \nproblem is with the inability of some regulators\n and the unwillingness of others to enforce the law. In powerful \ntestimony before several congressional committees, it has been stated \nover and over that to enforce the law greater disclosure of crucial \ninformation is needed from the insurance industry. Assistant Secretary \nRoberta Achtenberg, head of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's Division of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity testified \nto this, as did Deval Patrick, assistant attorney general for civil \nrights. It was also expressed by numerous State insurance commissioners \nincluding those from Texas, California, and Missouri, as well as \nseveral civil rights and community groups.\n\n  As clear as the problem of insurance redlining has become, so has the \nsolution. Public disclosure can serve multiple purposes in combating \ninsurance discrimination by allowing for an accurate assessment of the \nextent and nature of the problem, as well as assisting Federal and \nState regulators who are charged with enforcing the antidiscrimination \nlaws that currently exist. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act has been \neffective, but passing disclosure laws that only apply to banks and \nthrifts is like throwing out a life preserver with rope that is several \nfeet short. We must go further, and pursue disclosure regulations that \nwill provide Federal and State insurance regulators the same tools that \nFederal and State banking regulators have, and allow them to detect and \nexpose any incidence of discrimination in the availability of \nhomeowners insurance.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Anti-Redlining in Insurance \nDisclosure Act, would require insurance companies to disclose \ninformation regarding where they write property insurance and is \nclosely patterned after the requirements in the Home Mortgage \nDisclosure Act. The bill would require the Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development to establish requirements for insurers to compile and \nsubmit policy information annually. The information that the bill \nrequires to be disclosed must be reported along census tract lines, and \nmust include the number and types of policies written, the race of the \napplicants, whether the applicant was accepted or rejected and the loss \ndata for the specified area. This information would be collected in the \n50 largest metropolitan statistical areas \n[[Page S2402]]  [MSA's] and an additional 100 MSA's based on geographic \ndiversity and size of MSA populations. These disclosure requirements \nare almost identical to those recommended by the General Accounting \nOffice in their investigation of this issue last year. Providing this \nextensive and detailed information will enable regulators to analyze \nand compare the availability, affordability, and quality of insurance \ncoverage for property, casualty, and homeowners insurance.\n  Insurance redlining is a national phenomena that demands a Federal \nresponse. In the insurance industry, enforcement by State officials of \nexisting antidiscrimination statutes has proven to be difficult for one \nprincipal reason; though many\n State insurance commissioners have been forceful and aggressive in \nexposing and sanctioning appropriate parties, other State insurance \ncommissioner offices lack the necessary resources to collect and \ncompile data information adequately. In many markets this data is \nsimply unavailable. And critical to this effort is the need to collect \nclaims and other loss data which is central to determining if the \nunavailability of adequate and affordable insurance is due to sound \neconomic underwriting principles, or to reprehensible factors such as \nthe race and ethnic background of the applicant.\n\n  Last year, the efforts of Representatives Cardiss Collins, and Joseph \nKennedy resulted in the House of Representatives passing a disclosure \nbill similar to the bill I have introduced today. My colleague from \nWisconsin, Representative Tom Barrett, has also been actively involved \nwith the insurance redlining issue. Just last year, Representative \nBarrett chaired a field hearing in Milwaukee where first-hand testimony \nwas given about the extent of these discrimination abuses in Milwaukee \nand other cities plagued by similar problems.\n  In addition, it is my understanding that due to the leadership of \nSecretary Cisneros and Assistant Secretary Achtenberg, HUD is \nconsidering the promulgation of disclosure requirements similar to the \nreporting requirements in the bill I have introduced today. Although \nsome have suggested that HUD lacks the necessary authority to pass such \nregulations, it is important to note that HUD has been identified by a \nFederal court in Ohio as legally authorized to enforce the Fair Housing \nAct as it relates to homeowners insurance. This was affirmed in \nNationwide Mutual Insurance Company versus Cisneros, when the U.S. \nDistrict Court upheld HUD's regulatory authority, noting that HUD's \ncontention that it had been delegated authority under the Fair Housing \nAct was ``reasonable and entitled to substantial deference.'' I look \nforward to monitoring the development of HUD's actions, and will \ncertainly lend my support and assistance to their efforts to curb \nredlining practices.\n  Mr. President, Voltaire once said that ``Prejudices are what fools \nuse for reason.'' It is clearly one thing to underwrite insurance \npolicies based on sound economic factors and principles--it is another \nthing to deny adequate or affordable insurance based on an individual's \nrace or ethnic background. We should be very proud of the civil rights \naccomplishments our society has made in the last 30 years. But as many \npotential homeowners in my State and across the country have \ndiscovered, too many individuals in the insurance industry have used \ntheir prejudices to determine the economic and social future of \ncommunities that are on the brink of collapse. Passing this legislation \nwould represent marked progress in the pathway to offering all of our \ncitizens, regardless of racial or ethnic background, equal access to \nsocial justice and economic opportunity.\n  I would like to conclude, Mr. President, by asking unanimous consent \nthat several items be printed in the Record. These items include the \ntext of the bill, a letter I received from several organizations \nsupporting the legislation, a letter that I, Senator Simon, and several \nmember of the House sent to Roberta Achtenberg, Assistant Secretary for \nFair Housing and Equal Opportunity as well as a response I received \nfrom that Department, and finally, two editorials from the Houston Post \nand the Dallas Morning News on the issue of insurance redlining.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 380\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Any such \n     written question shall clearly indicate that a response to \n     the question is voluntary on the part of the applicant or \n     policyholder, but encouraged, and that the information is \n     being requested by the Federal Government to monitor the \n     availability and affordability of insurance. If an applicant \n     for, or policyholder of, insurance declines to provide such \n     information, the agent or insurer for such insurance may \n     provide such information.\n       (3) Rule for reporting by designated insurers.--A \n     designated insurer for a designated line shall submit--\n       (A) information required under subparagraphs (A), (B), and \n     (D) of paragraph (1) and information required pursuant to \n     paragraph (2), for risks insured under such line that are \n     located within each designated MSA, any part of which is \n     located in a State for which the insurer is designated; and\n       (B) information required under paragraph (1)(C) for agents \n     within such designated MSA's.\n       (c) Nondesignated Insurers.--The regulations issued under \n     section 3 shall require each insurer that issues an insurance \n     policy in a designated line of insurance under section \n     13(c)(1) that covers an insured risk located in a designated \n     MSA and which is not a designated insurer for the line in any \n     State in which any part of such MSA is located, to compile \n     and submit to the Secretary, for each annual reporting \n     period--\n       (1) the total number of policies issued in such line;\n       (2) the total exposures covered by such policies; and\n       (3) the total amount of premiums for such policies;\n     by designated MSA and applicable region in which the insured \n     risk is located.\n\n     SEC. 5.

For \n     purposes of this Act, homeowners insurance shall not include \n     any renters coverage or coverage for the personal property of \n     a condominium owner.\n       (2) Report.--At any time the Secretary determines that any \n     line of insurance not described in paragraph (1) should be a \n     designated line because disparities in coverage provided \n     under such line exist among geographic areas having different \n     income levels or racial composition, the Secretary shall \n     submit a report recommending designating such line of \n     insurance as a designated line for purposes of this Act to \n     the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the \n     House of Representatives and the appropriate committees of \n     the Senate.\n       (3) Duration.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     the Secretary shall make the designations under this \n     subsection once every 5 years, by regulation, and each line \n     and subline or coverage type designated under such \n     regulations shall be designated for each of the first 5 \n     successive annual reporting periods occurring after issuance \n     of the regulations.\n       (B) Alteration.--During any 5-year period referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) in which designations are in effect, the \n     Secretary may amend or revise the designated lines, sublines, \n     and coverage types only by regulation and only in accordance \n     with the requirements of this subsection. Such regulations \n     amending or revising designations shall apply only to annual \n     reporting periods beginning after the expiration of the 6-\n     month period beginning on the date of issuance of the \n     regulations.\n       (d) Timing of Designations.--The Secretary shall make the \n     designations required by subsections (b)(4) and (c)(3)(A) and \n     notify interested parties during the 6-month period ending 6 \n     months before the commencement of the first annual reporting \n     period to which such designations apply.\n       (e) Obtaining Information.--The Secretary may require \n     insurers to submit to the Secretary such information as the \n     Secretary considers necessary to make designations \n     specifically required under this Act. The Secretary may not \n     require insurers to submit any information under this \n     subsection that relates to any line of insurance not \n     specifically authorized to be designated pursuant to this Act \n     or that is to be used solely for the purpose of a report \n     under subsection (c)(2).\n\n     SEC. 14.

The Secretary shall allow insurers, \n     or statistical agents acting on behalf of insurers, to match \n     addresses and applicable regions through the use of 9-digit \n     zip codes if the Secretary determines that such use will \n     substantially reduce the cost and burden to insurers of such \n     matching without significant adverse impact on the \n     reliability of the matching.\n       (b) Address Conversion Software.--The Secretary shall make \n     available, to any insurer required to provide information to \n     the Secretary under this Act, computer software that can be \n     used to convert addresses to applicable regions within \n     designated MSA's. The software shall be made available in \n     forms that provide such conversion for designated MSA's on a \n     nationwide basis and on a State-by-State basis. The software \n     shall be made available not later than 6 months before the \n     first annual reporting period to which the reporting \n     requirements under this Act apply (pursuant to section 26) \n     and shall be updated annually. The software shall be made \n     available without charge, except for an amount, determined by \n     the Secretary, which shall not exceed the actual cost of \n     reproducing the software.\n       (c) Convertibility.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary may, by regulation, provide \n     for insurers to comply with the requirements under sections \n     4, 5, and 8(b) by reporting the information required under \n     such sections on the basis of geographical location other \n     than MSA and applicable region, but only if the Secretary \n     determines that information reported on such other basis is \n     convertible to the basis of MSA and applicable region and \n     such conversion does not affect the accuracy of the \n     information.\n       (2) Limitation.--With respect to any information submitted \n     on the basis of geographical location other than designated \n     MSA and applicable region pursuant to paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary may disclose the information only on the basis of \n     designated MSA and applicable region.\n\n     SEC. 15. ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of this Act, the annual \n     reporting periods shall be the 12-month periods commencing in \n     each calendar year on the same day, which shall be selected \n     under subsection (b) by the Secretary.\n       (b) Selection.--Not later than the expiration of the 6-\n     month period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary shall, by regulation, select a day of the year \n     upon which all annual reporting periods shall commence. In \n     determining such day, the Secretary shall consider the \n     reporting periods used for purposes of State and other \n     insurance statistical reporting systems, in order to minimize \n     the burdens on insurers.\n\n     SEC. 16.

The Secretary is authorized to determine \n     whether such inconsistencies exist and to resolve issues \n     regarding such inconsistencies. The Secretary may not provide \n     that any State law or requirement is inconsistent with \n     subsection (a) if it imposes requirements equivalent to the \n     requirements under such subsection or requirements that are \n     more stringent or comprehensive, in the determination of the \n     Secretary.\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\n       (d) Immunity.--In issuing regulations under subsection (a), \n     the Secretary shall specifically consider the necessity of \n     providing insurers, agents, and brokers with immunity solely \n     for the act of conveying or communicating the reasons for a \n     declination or cancellation of, or refusal to renew insurance \n     on behalf of a principal making such decision. The Secretary \n     may provide for immunity under the regulations issued under \n     subsection (a) if the Secretary determines that such a \n     provision is necessary and in the public interest, except \n     that the Secretary may not provide immunity for any conduct \n     that is negligent, reckless, or willful.\n       (e) Enforcement.--The Secretary may authorize the States to \n     enforce the requirements under regulations issued under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 17.

STUDIES.\n\n       (a) Study of Insurance Prescreening.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall conduct a study to \n     determine the feasibility and utility of requiring insurers \n     to report information with respect to the characteristics of \n     applicants for insurance and reasons for rejection of \n     applicants. The study shall examine the extent to which--\n       (A) oral applications or representations are used by \n     insurers and agents in making determinations regarding \n     whether or not to insure a prospective insured;\n       (B) written applications are used by insurers and agents in \n     making determinations regarding whether or not to insure a \n     prospective insured;\n       (C) written applications are submitted after the insurer or \n     agent has already made a determination to provide insurance \n     to a prospective insured or has determined that the \n     prospective insured is eligible for insurance; and\n       (D) prospective insured persons are discouraged from \n     submitting applications for insurance based, in whole or in \n     part, on--\n       (i) the location of the risk to be insured;\n       (ii) the racial characteristics of the prospective insured;\n       (iii) the racial composition of the neighborhood in which \n     the risk to be insured is located; and\n       (iv) in the case of residential property insurance, the age \n     and value of the risk to be insured.\n       (2) Report.--The Secretary shall report the results of the \n     study under paragraph (1) to the Committee on Banking, \n     Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and \n     the appropriate committees of the Senate, not later than 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act. The report \n     shall include recommendations of the Secretary--\n       (A) with respect to requiring insurers to report on the \n     disposition of oral and written applications for insurance; \n     and\n     [[Page S2408]]   (B) for any legislation that the Secretary \n     considers appropriate regarding the issues described in the \n     report.\n       (b) Study of Insurer Actions To Meet Insurance Needs of \n     Certain Neighborhoods.--The Secretary shall conduct a study \n     of various practices, actions, and methods undertaken by \n     insurers to meet the property and casualty insurance needs of \n     residents of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, minority \n     neighborhoods, and small businesses located in such \n     neighborhoods. The Secretary shall report the results of the \n     study, including any recommendations, to the Committee on \n     Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives and the appropriate committees of the Senate, \n     not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (c) Study of Disparate Claims Treatment.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall conduct a study to \n     determine whether, and the extent to which, insurers engage \n     in disparate treatment in handling claims of policyholders \n     under designated lines of insurance based on the race, \n     gender, and income level of the policyholder, and on the \n     racial characteristics and income levels of the area in which \n     the insured risk is located. In conducting the study, the \n     Secretary shall specifically consider whether residents of \n     low-income neighborhoods or areas and minority neighborhoods \n     or areas are more likely than residents of other areas to \n     have their claims contested or their insurance coverage \n     canceled.\n       (2) Report.--The Secretary shall submit a report on the \n     results of the study to the Committee on Banking, Finance and \n     Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the \n     appropriate committees of the Senate, not later than 2 years \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Study of Rating Territories.--The Secretary shall \n     conduct a study to determine whether the practice in the \n     insurance industry of basing insurance premium amounts on the \n     territory in which the insured risk is located has a \n     disparate impact on the availability, affordability, or \n     quality of insurance by race, gender, or type of \n     neighborhood. The Secretary shall submit a report on the \n     results of the study to the Committee on Banking, Finance and \n     Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the \n     appropriate committees of the Senate, not later than 12 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Study of Insurer Reinvestment Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall conduct a study to \n     determine the feasibility of requiring insurers to reinvest \n     in communities and neighborhoods from which they collect \n     premiums for insurance and whether, and the extent to which, \n     community reinvestment requirements for insurers should be \n     established that are comparable to the community reinvestment \n     requirements applicable to depository institutions. The \n     Secretary shall consult with representatives of insurers and \n     consumer, community, and civil rights organizations regarding \n     the results of the study and any recommendations to be made \n     based on the results of the study.\n       (2) Report.--The Secretary shall report the results of the \n     study, including any such recommendations, to the Committee \n     on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives and the appropriate committees of the Senate, \n     not later than 6 months after the conclusion of the first \n     annual reporting period to which the reporting requirements \n     under this Act apply (pursuant to section 26).\n\n     SEC. 21. EXEMPTION AND RELATION TO STATE LAWS.\n\n       (a) Exemption for United States Programs.--Reporting shall \n     not be required under this Act with respect to insurance \n     provided by any program underwritten or administered by the \n     United States.\n       (b) Relation to State Laws.--This Act does not annul, \n     alter, or affect, or exempt the obligation of any insurer \n     subject to this Act to comply with the laws of any State or \n     subdivision thereof with respect to public disclosure, \n     submission of information, and recordkeeping.\n\n     SEC. 22. REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall issue any regulations \n     required under this Act and any other regulations that may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act. The regulations shall be \n     issued through rulemaking in accordance with the procedures \n     under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, for \n     substantive rules. Except as otherwise provided in this Act, \n     such final regulations shall be issued not later than the \n     expiration of the 18-month period beginning on the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Burdens.--In prescribing such regulations, the \n     Secretary shall take into consideration the administrative, \n     paperwork, and other burdens on insurance agents, including \n     independent insurance agents, involved in complying with the \n     requirements of this Act and shall minimize the burdens \n     imposed by such requirements with respect to such agents.\n\n     SEC. 23.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The requirements of this Act relating to reporting of \n     information by insurers shall take effect with respect to the \n     first annual reporting period that begins not less than 3 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 1994.\n     Assistant Secretary Roberta Achtenberg,\n     Division of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Department of \n         Housing and Urban Development,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Achtenberg: We understand you have recently \n     received a letter from the ranking Republican member of the \n     House Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and \n     Competitiveness, regarding the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development's (HUD) advance notice of proposed \n     rulemaking (ANPR) on discrimination in property insurance. We \n     are writing to inform you that we take a different view from \n     this letter and we would like to encourage you to proceed as \n     scheduled with the ANPR.\n       We are concerned with several of the letter's assertions, \n     particularly the contentions that insurance underwriting is \n     unrelated to the Fair Housing Act and that HUD is not the \n     proper agency to oversee a federal data collection effort. We \n     respectfully disagree with these notions, as do the federal \n     courts.\n       Insurance redlining abuses are widespread and well \n     documented. In addition to the countless studies and reports \n     that have verified discriminatory underwriting practices, \n     field hearings such as the recent Chicago hearing sponsored \n     by HUD's Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Division and the \n     hearings in House and Senate committees have clearly \n     demonstrated that property and other lines of insurance have \n     become unaffordable or unavailable in many minority and low-\n     income communities. Such discriminatory practices are not \n     confined to one insurance company, one community or one \n     state--redlining is a national phenomena that requires an \n     appropriate federal response.\n       Redlining practices are illegal. This was established in \n     NAACP v. American Family Insurance when the Seventh Circuit \n     Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that the underwriting of \n     homeowners insurance falls under the umbrella of the Fair \n     Housing Act. Judge Frank Easterbrook, speaking for a \n     unanimous Court, stated that ``lenders require their \n     borrowers to secure property insurance. No insurance, no \n     loan; no loan, no house; lack of insurance thus makes housing \n     unavailable.'' As you know, HUD has also been identified by a \n     federal court in Ohio as legally authorized to enforce the \n     Fair Housing Act as it relates to homeowners insurance. This \n     was affirmed in Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company v. \n     Cisneros, when the U.S. District Court upheld HUD's \n     regulatory authority, noting that HUD's contention that it \n     had been delegated authority under the Fair Housing Act was \n     ``reasonable and entitled to substantial deference''.\n       It is also clear that greater disclosure is a key element \n     in combating redlining. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act \n     (HMDA) has provided federal and state regulators in the \n     mortgage financing field with detailed information to \n     identify mortgage redlining. As you know, this legislation \n     has been effective and has had little, if any, adverse impact \n     on the vitality and prosperity of the banking industry. This \n     critical piece of legislation was passed for precisely the \n     reason of enhancing the power of state and federal \n     authorities to determine if banks and other lending \n     institutions were discriminating in their lending practices. \n     As needed and effective as that legislation is, we know that \n     it is difficult, if not impossible as noted by the Seventh \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, to obtain a home loan without the \n     necessary insurance. Thus, seeking this sort of disclosure \n     only from the lending industry is like throwing out a life \n     preserver with a rope that is several feet short. We must go \n     further.\n       In the insurance industry, enforcement by state officials \n     of existing anti-discrimination statutes has proven to be \n     difficult for one principal reason; though many state \n     insurance commissioners have been forceful and aggressive in \n     exposing and sanctioning appropriate parties, other state \n     insurance commissioner offices lack the necessary resources \n     to collect and compile data information adequately. In many \n     markets this data is simply unavailable. And critical to this \n     effort is the need to collect claims and other loss data \n     which is central to determining if the unavailability of \n     adequate insurance is due to sound economic underwriting \n     principles, or to reprehensible factors such as the race and \n     income status of the applicant.\n       In powerful testimony before several Congressional \n     committees, it has been stated over and over that to enforce \n     the law greater disclosure of crucial information is needed \n     from the insurance industry. This was included in your \n     testimony, Secretary Achtenberg, as well as the testimony of \n     Deval Patrick, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \n     It was also expressed by a number of state insurance \n     commissioners from across the country.\n       The letter you received also expressed concerns about the \n     possibility that HUD may promulgate data reporting \n     requirements stronger than those contained in H.R. 1188, the \n     Anti-Redlining in Insurance Disclosure Act. These reporting \n     requirements, such as the collection of claims and loss data, \n     including a large number of Metropolitan Statistical Areas \n     (MSAs), and collecting this data by census tract as opposed \n     to zip codes, have all been recommended by the General \n     Accounting Office, numerous consumer and civil rights groups \n     and various state insurance\n      commissioners. We join these voices in urging you to adopt \n     these strong reporting requirements.\n       Finally, we would like to commend you, Secretary \n     Achtenberg, as well as Secretary Cisneros and other officials \n     in the Clinton Administration for your forceful stand against \n     discriminatory redlining practices. Although it is \n     disappointing that Congress was unable to pass anti-redlining \n     legislation this year, we are heartened by the \n     Administration's willingness to initiate efforts to curtail \n     and root out discrimination in the insurance marketplace. We \n     look forward to following your progress and invite you to \n     contact us if we can be of any future assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Russell Feingold,\n     Paul Simon,\n       Senators.\n     Joseph P. Kennedy II,\n     Thomas Barrett,\n     Cleo Fields,\n     Henry B. Gonzalez,\n     Lucille Roybal-Allard,\n     Esteban Edward Torres,\n       Representatives.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        U.S. Department of Housing\n\n\n                                        and Urban Development,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 1994.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Thank you for your letter of October \n     28, 1994, expressing your concerns and constructive \n     recommendations on the issues of insurance redlining and \n     discrimination. Let me assure you that the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development (HUD or the Department) is \n     proceeding as scheduled with the promulgation of a regulation \n     applying the Fair Housing Act (the Act) to property \n     insurance. A similar letter has been sent to Senator Paul \n     Simon, Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II, Congressman Henry B. \n     Gonzalez, Congressman Thomas Barrett, Congressman Cleo \n     Fields, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard and Congressman \n     Esteban Edward Torres.\n       Clearly, the Department shares your view that HUD has \n     authority, and indeed the responsibility, to enforce the Act \n     (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended) in \n     the area of property insurance. Several Administrations, \n     beginning with a HUD General Counsel opinion in 1978, have \n     concluded that the Act prohibits discrimination in the \n     provision of property or hazard insurance. All the court \n     decisions that have addressed this issue, with one exception \n     which was decided prior to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of \n     1988, have drawn this same conclusion. Because HUD is the \n     primary Title VIII law enforcement agency, and the only \n     agency with authority to promulgate regulations under that \n     Act, the Department will fulfill its obligation to issue \n     rules applying the Act to property insurance.\n       As you know, in 1989 HUD issued regulations implementing \n     the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. In these \n     regulations, the Department determined that the Act prohibits \n     ``refusing to provide . . . property or hazard insurance . . \n     . or providing such . . . insurance differently because of \n     race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or \n     national origin'' (24 C.F.R. Section 100.70(a)(4). HUD \n     intends to go beyond this general prohibition and provide \n     more detailed guidance regarding the types of practices and \n     circumstances under which violations of the Act occur.\n       The Department also shares your viewpoint on the value of \n     greater disclosure of crucial information. The Department was \n     also disappointed that Congress was unable to pass anti-\n     redlining legislation this year. HUD looks forward to working \n     with you to achieve this objective in the next session of \n     Congress.\n       Your contributions to the public meetings that HUD held \n     during the past few months were most helpful in shaping the \n     Department's thoughts on how HUD should approach the \n     regulation. The hearings you have held on insurance \n     discrimination generated substantial information that will be \n     tremendously beneficial to HUD's rulemaking process. Your \n     specific recommendations on the rule and the public attention \n     that you have stimulated have assisted HUD and many others in \n     cities throughout the country who are attempting to resolve \n     these serious problems.\n       Any further detailed recommendations or general \n     observations you could share with the Department would be \n     greatly appreciated.\n       Thank you for your interest in the Department's programs \n     and for the guidance you have provided HUD and your concerted \n     efforts to combat the national problems of insurance \n     redlining and discrimination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William J. Gilmartin,\n     Assistant Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 February 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: We write to offer our endorsement of \n     the ``Anti-Redlining in Insurance Disclosure Act of 1995.'' \n     This legislation represents a critical first step towards \n     [[Page S2410]]  addressing the serious problem of unfair \n     discrimination and redlining in the provision of homeowners \n     insurance in a simple yet effective way--through the power of \n     sunshine.\n       Hearings in both the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate last year as well as numerous studies and lawsuits \n     have shown that residents of low-income, predominantly \n     minority areas have a harder time obtaining insurance \n     coverage for their homes. Most recently, the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) released the \n     results of its study of homeowners insurance in more than 40 \n     urban areas in 20 states. In its report, the NAIC concluded \n     that ``[t]here is considerable evidence that residents of \n     urban communities, particularly residents of low-income and \n     minority neighborhoods, face greater difficulty in obtaining \n     high-quality homeowners insurance through the voluntary \n     market than residents of other areas.''\n       Availability and affordability problems for these \n     communities contributes to and furthers urban decay and \n     disinvestment. The lack of affordable insurance is a material \n     deterrent to homeownership and economic development in low \n     income and minority communities. Without insurance, people \n     simply cannot buy homes. And without high-quality insurance, \n     homeowners in these areas are forced to cover much of their \n     loss out of their own pockets--losses they had hoped \n     insurance would cover.\n       The legislation provides the tools to better understand the \n     extent of the problem and help develop solutions by simply \n     requiring insurers to begin to make public information as to \n     where and at what price they write insurance. It also would \n     collect data on insurer losses which is extremely important \n     data in assessing the underlying causes for these problems. \n     The data collected by this legislation will go a long way to \n     shedding light on the debate over insurance redlining and \n     will be a valuable tool for enforcement of civil rights laws \n     at the state and federal level.\n       Your legislation incorporates 4 key elements that are \n     essential to advancing fair and equal access to insurance:\n       First, the bill calls for the collection of data on the \n     cost and type of insurance policies written by the census \n     tract (or zip + 4's) where the policy is issued. Only census \n     tracts provide the kind of relevant demographic data needed \n     to gauge the extent of disparities created by insurance \n     redlining on minority and low-income neighborhoods. The Home \n     Mortgage Disclosure Act requires banks to report loan \n     information on a census tract basis, and this standard should \n     apply to the insurance industry as well.\n       Second, the bill includes the collection of data on \n     insurance losses and claims. While insurers claim disparities \n     in prices between different neighborhoods are solely based on \n     loss experience, evidence suggests the opposite. Data \n     analyzed by the Missouri Department of Insurance, for \n     example, indicated that residents of minority neighborhoods \n     pay more in premiums, but incur fewer losses, than residents \n     of comparable white neighborhoods. Only through the \n     collection of loss data can we conclusively resolve the \n     debate about whether these disparities are due to risk or \n     prejudice.\n       Third, the bill would collect this data in 150 Metropolitan \n     Statistical Areas (MSA's). The NAIC data suggest that \n     availability and affordability problems are widespread across \n     the nation. In order to obtain information on all of those \n     areas that may be experiencing such problems, data needs to \n     be collected from as many MSAs as possible. Furthermore, the \n     data will be invaluable as a civil rights enforcement tool, \n     and that tool should be available to the greatest number of \n     communities and citizens.\n       Fourth, the bill provides for the reporting of the race and \n     gender by policyholders on a voluntary basis. Such data has \n     been collected under HMDA and other federal, state and \n     private entities for years and is essential to assist efforts \n     to enforce state and federal laws prohibiting discrimination \n     in the provision of insurance.\n       We are eager to work with you to obtain passage of the \n     ``Anti-Redlining in Insurance Disclosure Act of 1995,'' and \n     commend you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning.\n       American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n       American Planning Association.\n       Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now \n     (ACORN).\n       Center for Community Change.\n       Consumer Federation of America's Insurance Group.\n       Consumers Union.\n       Jesuit Conference, USA, Office of Social Ministries.\n       National Council of La Raza.\n       National Fair Housing Alliance.\n       National Neighborhood Coalition.\n       NETWORK: A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby.\n       United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and \n     Society.\n       United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 9, 1995]\n\n        Insurance Reform; The Important Thing is to Get it Done\n\n       Call it redlining. Call it lack of availability. Call it \n     what you want to call it. The fact remains that too many \n     risk-worthy Texans are unable to obtain automobile and \n     homeowners insurance at the best rates.\n       The problem is real, and it is serious. Not even the \n     insurance industry denies that a problem exists, though it \n     vehemently disputes accusations that it denies insurance to \n     consumers because of where they live, their skin color or \n     other factors unrelated to risk.\n       Nonetheless, compelling evidence compiled by the Texas \n     Insurance Department indicates that a disproportionate number \n     of the Texans unable to obtain affordable insurance are \n     racial or ethnic minorities living in lower-income \n     neighborhoods.\n       The insurance industry may resent the charges of unfair \n     discrimination being hurled by consumer groups, state \n     regulators and some state legislators. However, it is \n     impossible to ignore that most victims of what may be \n     charitably called flaws in the marketplace are neither white \n     nor wealthy.\n       The issue has come to a head because Texas Insurance \n     Commissioner Rebecca Lightsey, an appointee of Democratic \n     Gov. Ann Richards, must decide whether to enact new anti-\n     discrimination rules before her term expires Feb. 1. \n     Republican Gov.-elect George W. Bush wants her to wait so \n     that the issue may be addressed by his nominee to the post, \n     Elton Bomer.\n       Mr. Bush's request is reasonable. It would be decent of Ms. \n     Lightsey to comply.\n       But more important than protocol or deference to an \n     incoming governor is attention to the issue. Denying \n     insurance abets poverty. It is immoral. It is unfair. It \n     makes no economic sense.\n       In such areas as Oak Cliff and South Dallas, there are many \n     automobiles and homes worth insuring. No insurer should have \n     to provide preferred or standard-rate insurance to a consumer \n     who constitutes a bad risk. But neither should he deny it \n     because of inappropriate or prejudicial notions of \n     insurability.\n       There are two acceptable courses. Ms. Lightsey can enact \n     the rules, in which case Mr. Bush could refine them later as \n     he sees fit. Or she can let Mr. Bush handle it.\n       If Ms. Lightsey acts, she should do so because the problem \n     should not fester a moment longer. There should be no \n     implication that Mr. Bush would not act; his good record of \n     support for civil and equal rights indicates quite the \n     contrary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Houston Post, Jan. 19, 1995]\n\n            Outgoing Texas Insurance Regulator Unintimidated\n\n       Despite criticism, outgoing Texas Insurance Commissioner \n     Rebecca Lightsey has courageously promulgated rules to stop \n     neighborhood ``redlining'' and other discrimination against \n     automobile and property insurance buyers.\n       The decision was ripe for making on her watch and she made \n     it, undaunted by sniping from the insurance industry and new \n     Republican Gov. George Bush's camp that she was \n     inappropriately acting on her way out.\n       The insurance industry has been fighting to block \n     antidiscrimination rules for two years or more. And Bush, who \n     had campaign backing from insurance industry leaders, urged \n     Lightsey to let Bush's new commissioner, former state Rep. \n     Elton Bomer, decide whether such rules should be adopted. \n     There appeared a strong likelihood that if Lightsey had \n     acquiesced, we'd have no rules.\n       Lightsey, an interim appointee of Democratic Gov. Ann \n     Richards, succeeded J. Robert Hunter, another Richards \n     appointee. Hunter resigned after Bush defeated Richards. \n     Lightsey's term ends Feb. 1.\n       An attorney, former Texas Consumer Association executive \n     director and an aide to Gov. Richards, Lightsey has more \n     insurance regulatory experience than Bomer.\n       As a Richards staff attorney, she worked on insurance \n     matters, including development of a comprehensive insurance \n     regulation reform law in 1991. She earlier dealt with \n     insurance matters for the consumer association.\n       Before succeeding Hunter, Lightsey also was executive \n     director of the Texas Insurance Purchasing Alliance. It was \n     created by the Legislature to make health insurance more \n     obtainable for small employers.\n       The non-discrimination rules she adopted--after holding a \n     Jan. 4 public hearing that Bush wanted canceled--were not \n     hastily written. They were developed by the Texas Department \n     of Insurance after about 18 months of studies and earlier \n     hearings under Hunter and the three-member State Board of \n     Insurance that preceded him. The rules are modified \n     replacements for similar 1993 rules the board adopted, which \n     the insurance industry got a court to throw out.\n       Although the insurance industry claims the rules are not \n     needed because discrimination is already against state and \n     federal laws, studies by the insurance department and the \n     Office of Public Insurance Counsel indicate discrimination is \n     occurring. It is keeping poor people, particularly in \n     minority neighborhoods, from obtaining house and car \n     insurance or forcing them to pay higher rates. This should \n     not be allowed.\n       The new rules will prohibit:\n       Consideration of insurance customers' race, color, religion \n     or national origin. Discrimination based on geographic \n     location, disability, sex or age also will be banned unless \n     companies show they cause extra risk.\n       Use of underwriting guidelines (secret policies as to who \n     will be insured) not directly related to the risk of extra \n     losses and claims.\n       Charging of higher rates or denial of coverage to those \n     wanting only the minimum amount of car insurance to satisfy \n     state law.\n       Consumers can sue for triple damages if the rules are \n     broken.\n       [[Page S2411]] None of these rules is unreasonable. If the \n     industry is not violating them, it should have no cause for \n     alarm. If it is, such practices should be stopped.\n       There was no good reason to put off the rules' adoption so \n     the Bush administration could go over the same ground and \n     give the industry more time to fight them.\n       Lightsey has ordered the rules to go into effect June 1. \n     This gives the Legislature--or Bomer and Bush, who have \n     indicated they don't even know much about the rules--time to \n     review and possibly cancel them.\n       If the rules are killed, however, those responsible had \n     better be able to show good cause.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Mack, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Hollings, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 381. A bill to strengthen international sanctions against the \nCastro government in Cuba, to develop a plan to support a transition \ngovernment leading to a democratically elected government in Cuba, and \nfor other purposes; ordered held at the desk.\n\n\n            the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the day following the 1994 elections, I met \nwith reporters in Raleigh to discuss in some detail the priorities I \nintended to pursue as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. High on my list of priorities was to do everything possible \nas chairman to help bring freedom and democracy to Cuba.\n  Fidel Castro's brutal and cruel Communist dictatorship has persecuted \nthe Cuban people for 36 years. He is the world's longest-reigning \ntyrant.\n  That is why I am introducing today a bill titled the ``Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act'' as my first piece of \nlegislation as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Let me be clear: Whether Castro leaves Cuba in a vertical position or \na horizontal position is up to him and the Cuban people. But he must--\nand will--leave Cuba.\n  There are some voices murmuring that the United States should lift \nthe embargo and begin doing business with Castro. I categorically \nreject such suggestions, because for 36 years, both Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents have maintained a consistent, bipartisan policy \nof isolating Castro's dictatorship.\n  There must be no retreat in that policy today. If anything, with the \ncollapse of the U.S.S.R.--and the end of Soviet subsidies to Cuba--the \nembargo is finally having the effect on Castro that has been intended \nall along. Why should the United States let up the pressure now? It's \ntime to tighten the screws--not loosen them. We have an obligation--to \nour principles and to the Cuban people--to elevate the pressure on \nCastro until the Cuban people are free.\n  The bi-partisan Cuba policy has led the American people to stand \ntogether in support of restoring freedom to Cuba. As for the \nlegislation I am offering today, it incorporates and builds upon the \nsignificant work of the two distinguished Senators from Florida, Connie \nMack and Bob Graham, and of three distinguished Members of the House of \nRepresentatives: Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Bob Menendez, and Ileana Ros-\nLehtinen.\n  The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act:\n  Strengthens international sanctions against the Castro regime by \nprohibiting sugar imports from countries that purchase sugar from Cuba \nand then sell that sugar in the United States by instructing our \nrepresentatives to the international financial institutions to vote \nagainst loans to Cuba and to require the United States to withhold our \ncontribution to those same institutions if they ignore our objections \nand aid the Castro regime, by urging the President to seek an \ninternational embargo against Cuba at the United Nations, and by \nprohibiting loans or other financing by a United States person to a \nforeign person or entity who purchases an American property confiscated \nby the Cuban Government.\n  Reaffirms the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act;\n  Revitalizes our broadcasting programs to Cuba by mandating the \nconversion of television Marti to ultra-high frequency [UHF] \nbroadcasting.\n  Cuts off foreign aid to any independent State of the Former Soviet \nUnion that aids Castro, especially if that aid goes for the operation \nof military and intelligence facilities in Cuba which threaten the \nUnited States;\n  Encourages free and fair elections in Cuba after Castro is gone, and \nauthorizes programs to promote free market and private enterprise \ndevelopment; and\n  Help U.S. citizens and U.S. companies whose property was confiscated \nby Castro. The bill denies entry into the United States of anyone who \nconfiscates or benefits from confiscated American property; and it \nallows a U.S. citizen with a confiscated property claim to go into a \nU.S. court to seek compensation from a person or entity which is being \nunjustly enriched by the use of that confiscated property.\n  The Cuban people are industrious and innovative. Where they live and \nwork in freedom, they have prospered. My hope is that this bill will \nhasten an end to the brutal Castro dictatorship and make Cuba free and \nprosperous. Libertad Para Cuba.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of \n     approximately 60 percent in the last 5 years as a result of--\n       (A) the reduction in its subsidization by the former Soviet \n     Union;\n       (B) 36 years of Communist tyranny and economic \n     mismanagement by the Castro government;\n       (C) the precipitous decline in trade between Cuba and the \n     countries of the former Soviet bloc; and\n       (D) the policy of the Russian Government and the countries \n     of the former Soviet bloc to conduct economic relations with \n     Cuba predominantly on commercial terms.\n       (2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban \n     people have substantially deteriorated as a result of Cuba's \n     economic decline and the refusal of the Castro \n     [[Page S2412]]  regime to permit free and fair democratic \n     elections in Cuba or to adopt any economic or political \n     reforms that would lead to democracy, a market economy, or an \n     economic recovery.\n       (3) The repression of the Cuban people, including a ban on \n     free and fair democratic elections and the continuing \n     violation of fundamental human rights, has isolated the Cuban \n     regime as the only nondemocratic government in the Western \n     Hemisphere.\n       (4) As long as no such economic or political reforms are \n     adopted by the Cuban government, the economic condition of \n     the country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not \n     improve in any significant way.\n       (5) Fidel Castro has defined democratic pluralism as \n     ``pluralistic garbage'' and has made clear that he has no \n     intention of permitting free and fair democratic elections in \n     Cuba or otherwise tolerating the democratization of Cuban \n     society.\n       (6) The Castro government, in an attempt to retain absolute \n     political power, continues to utilize, as it has from its \n     inception, torture in various forms (including psychiatric \n     abuse), execution, exile, confiscation, political \n     imprisonment, and other forms of terror and repression as \n     most recently demonstrated by the massacre of more than 70 \n     Cuban men, women, and children attempting to flee Cuba.\n       (7) The Castro government holds hostage in Cuba innocent \n     Cubans whose relatives have escaped the country.\n       (8) The Castro government has threatened international \n     peace and security by engaging in acts of armed subversion \n     and terrorism, such as the training and arming of groups \n     dedicated to international violence.\n       (9) The Government of Cuba engages in illegal international \n     narcotics trade and harbors fugitives from justice in the \n     United States.\n       (10) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has \n     deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve \n     their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to \n     risk or lose their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from \n     Cuba to freedom.\n       (11) Attempts to escape from Cuba and courageous acts of \n     defiance of the Castro regime by Cuban pro-democracy and \n     human rights groups have ensured the international \n     community's continued awareness of, and concern for, the \n     plight of Cuba.\n       (12) The Cuban people deserve to be assisted in a decisive \n     manner in order to end the tyranny that has oppressed them \n     for 36 years.\n       (13) Radio Marti and Television Marti have both been \n     effective vehicles for providing the people of Cuba with news \n     and information and have helped to bolster the morale of the \n     Cubans living under tyranny.\n       (14) The consistent policy of the United States towards \n     Cuba since the beginning of the Castro regime, carried out by \n     both Democratic and Republican administrations, has sought to \n     keep faith with the people of Cuba, and has been effective in \n     isolating the totalitarian Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to strengthen international sanctions against the \n     Castro government;\n       (2) to encourage the holding of free and fair democratic \n     elections in Cuba, conducted under the supervision of \n     internationally recognized observers;\n       (3) to provide a policy framework for United States support \n     to the Cuban people in response to the formation of a \n     transition government or a democratically elected government \n     in Cuba; and\n       (4) to protect the rights of United States persons who own \n     claims to confiscated property abroad.\n\n     SEC. 4.

App. 5(b)), the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Export Administration \n     Act of 1979.\n       (6) Property.--The term ``property'' means--\n       (A) any property, right, or interest, including any \n     leasehold interest,\n       (B) debts owed by a foreign government or by any enterprise \n     which has been confiscated by a foreign government; and\n       (C) debts which are a charge on property confiscated by a \n     foreign government.\n       (7) Traffics.--The term ``traffics'' means selling, \n     transfering, distributing, dispensing, or otherwise disposing \n     of property, or purchasing, receiving, possessing, obtaining \n     control of, managing, or using property.\n       (8) Transition government in cuba.--The term ``transition \n     government in Cuba'' means a government described in section \n     205.\n       (9) United states person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' means\n       (A) any United States citizen, including, in the context of \n     claims to confiscated property, any person who becomes a \n     United States citizen after the property was confiscated but \n     before final resolution of the claim to that property; and\n       (B) any corporation, trust, partnership, or other juridical \n     entity 50 percent or more beneficially owned by United States \n     citizens.\n   TITLE I--STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST THE CASTRO \n                               GOVERNMENT\n\n     SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the acts of the Castro government, including its \n     massive, systematic, and extraordinary violations of human \n     rights, are a threat to international peace;\n       (2) the President should advocate, and should instruct the \n     United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations \n     to propose and seek within the Security Council a mandatory \n     international embargo against the totalitarian government of \n     Cuba pursuant to chapter VII of the Charter of the United \n     Nations, which is similar to consultations conducted by \n     United States representatives with respect to Haiti; and\n       (3) any resumption of efforts by any independent state of \n     the former Soviet Union to make operational the nuclear \n     facility at Cienfuegos, Cuba, will have a detrimental impact \n     on United States assistance to such state.\n\n     SEC. 102.

[Section 498(a)(11) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act currently does not mention \n     intelligence facilities or specify the facilities at \n     Lourdes and Cienfuegos].\n       (c) Prohibits the President from providing assistance for \n     the government of any independent state that the President \n     has determined and certified to Congress is providing \n     assistance for, or engaging in nonmarket based trade with, \n     the Government of Cuba.

The intent of this section is to prevent \n     indirect support of the Cuban sugar industry through \n     countries that buy\n      Cuban sugar for either domestic consumption or reprocessing \n     for export and sell their own or the reprocessed sugar to \n     the United States.\n       (b) Provides for the removal of the sanction in subsection \n     (a) if the country certifies to the President that the \n     country will not import sugar, syrup, or molasses that is the \n     product of Cuba until free and fair elections are held in \n     Cuba. Such a certification would cease to apply if the \n     President makes a subsequent certification under subsection \n     (a).\n       (c) Instructs the President to report to Congress all \n     determinations in subsections (a) and (b).\n       (d) Allows the President to reallocate to other countries \n     the quota of sugars, syrups, and molasses allocated to a \n     country subject to sanction under subsection (a).\n\n\n           title ii: support for a free and independent cuba\n\n       Section 201.

A bill to establish a Wounded Knee National Tribal Park, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n    the wounded knee national tribal park establishment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am joining with my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Pressler, and Senators Campbell, Simon, Pell, and \nDorgan to introduce legislation that would establish the Wounded Knee \nNational Tribal Park in the State of South Dakota. The purpose of this \neffort is to acknowledge the armed struggle between the Plains Indians \nand the U.S. Army that culminated in the death of over 300 Lakota Sioux \nmen, women, and children at Wounded Knee, SD, on December 29, 1890.\n  There is no question about the historical significance of the Wounded \nKnee tragedy. Wounded Knee not only signaled an end to a chapter in \nAmerican history often referred to as the ``Indian Wars'' but it also \nmarked a change in national policy that once forced Indian tribes to \nlocate on smaller and smaller reservations.\n  History books show that on December 15, 1890, Federal agents, \nconcerned about the potential ramifications of a spiritual movement \namong the Sioux Indians, attempted to arrest Chief Sitting Bull. When \none of his followers shot at the agents, they returned gunfire, \nmortally wounding Sitting Bull.\n  Sitting Bull's half-brother, Chief Big Foot, took in Sitting Bull's \nfollowers. The band fled from the Bad Lands toward the Pine Ridge \nIndian Reservation. The U.S. Army intercepted the party and accepted an \nunconditional surrender from Chief Big Foot. The entire band was \nescorted to a military camp at Wounded Knee Creek.\n  At Wounded Knee, a single gunshot was fired. It is not known to this \nday whether the shot was fired by a member of the Sioux Tribe or the \nU.S. Army. What is known is that the gunshot led to a largely one-side \nvolley of bullets leaving approximately 350 to 370 Sioux men, women, \nand children dead or wounded. The U.S. Army suffered 60 casualties, \nmany of whom reportedly were hit by bullets fired by their comrades.\n  These are the tragic facts of what is known as the Wounded Knee \nMassacre. One hundred years later, in 1990, the 101st Congress passed \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 153, which acknowledged the carnage at \nWounded Knee and expressed ``congressional support for the \nestablishment of a suitable and appropriate memorial to those who were \ntragically slain at Wounded Knee.''\n    \n    \n  The bill we are introducing today gives substance to the sentiment \nexpressed by the resolution.\n  Mr. President, considerable time and thought has been given to the \nWounded Knee memorial project by descendants of the victims and \nsurvivors of the Wounded Knee tragedy, by the Oglala Sioux and the \nCheyenne River Sioux tribal governments, and by Members of Congress, \nthe State of South Dakota, and the Department of the Interior.\n  The effort to establish a memorial goes back even further than 1990. \nSince 1950, Wounded Knee has been studied six times by the National \nPark Service and has been identified as a prime candidate for addition \nto the National Park System. Since 1987, the Lakota Tribes of South \nDakota have been working with the National Park Service to plan for the \npreservation of Wounded Knee.\n  In Congress, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on \nproposals to establish a\n Wounded Knee Memorial and Historic Site on September 25, 1990 in \nWashington, and on April 30, 1991 at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation \nin South Dakota.\n\n  In May 1991, at the request of the Lakota Sioux and with the support \nof the Secretary of the Interior, the National Park Service began to \nexplore management alternatives for the Wounded Knee site. The process \nincluded strong public participation from the Oglala Sioux Tribe, the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and the Wounded Knee Survivors Association.\n  Those hearings enabled all the parties involved to discover much \ncommon ground and strengthened our shared resolve to move forward with \nthe establishment of the Wounded Knee National Tribal Park.\n  The step we are taking today is not an end, but a beginning.\n  Many issues remain to be addressed, including land acquisition for \nthe Wounded Knee National Park, design of the memorial, and management \nof the National Tribal Park. I welcome debate on these and other \nmatters, and look forward to participation in the debate.\n  By passing this legislation, we will clear the way for resolution of \nthose issues. More important, we will preserve for future generations \nan important chapter from the text of America's past.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n      [[Page S2418]] SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Daschle, as well as Senators Campbell, Simon, \nPell, and Dorgan in introducing legislation to establish the Wounded \nKnee National Tribal Park in the State of South Dakota. The purpose of \nour legislation is to acknowledge, preserve and protect the \nhistorically significant sites of the Wounded Knee tragedy of 1890. \nNational recognition of this area is long overdue.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is the product of our \ncumulative efforts over the past several sessions of Congress to \nproperly recognize the Wounded Knee tragedy. Indeed, Wounded Knee has \nbeen the subject of Senate consideration for a number of years. Let me \nhighlight some of this activity:\n  During the 101st Congress, the Senate Select Committee on Indian \nAffairs held hearings to discuss the historical significance of Wounded \nKnee. Also during the 101st Congress, the Senate adopted Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 153, recognizing the 100th anniversary of the \nWounded Knee Massacre. This resolution, which I cosponsored, also \nexpressed support for the establishment of a suitable and appropriate \nmemorial to those who were slain at Wounded Knee in 1890.\n  Late in the 102d Congress and again in the 103d Congress, Senator \nDaschle and I introduced legislation (S. 3213 and S. 278) to establish \nthe Chief Big Foot National Memorial Park and the Wounded Knee National \nMemorial.\n  During the 103d Congress, the Senate Energy Committee's Subcommittee \non Public Lands, National Parks and Forests held a hearing on S. 278 \n(July 29, 1993).\n  In addition to this congressional activity, the National Park Service \nhas studied the historical significance of Wounded Knee six times since \n1950. The Park Service consistently has reaffirmed it as a nationally \nsignificant area. In fact, our bill is in part based on one of the \nproposed alternatives mentioned in a January 1993 NPS report on Wounded \nKnee.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will agree during this 104th \nCongress to ensure the protection and preservation of the historical \nsites at the Wounded Knee tragedy. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues, members of the Cheyenne River and Oglala Sioux Tribes, the \nGovernor of South Dakota, the National Park Service, and other \norganizations to move this legislation forward. Above all, we must \nensure this legislation is implemented with proper consultation with \nthe Indian communities. It is imperative that Indian perspectives be \nincluded in developing the memorials' interpretive sites.\n  Enactment of our legislation will promote a greater understanding of \nthe events associated with the Wounded Knee tragedy. In addition, \nappreciation of Indian culture, heritage, and history will be enhanced \nthrough establishment of these memorials.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2399-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 50\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Montana [Mr. \nBurns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 50, a bill to repeal the increase \nin tax on social security benefits.\n\n\n                                 S. 104\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch] was added as a cosponsor of S. 104, a bill to establish the \nposition of Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism within the office of the \nSecretary of State.\n\n\n                                 S. 191\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 191, a bill to \namend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to ensure that \nconstitutionally protected private property rights are not infringed \nuntil adequate protection is afforded by reauthorization of the Act, to \nprotect against economic losses from critical habitat designation, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 219\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Stevens] was added as a cosponsor of S. 219, a bill to ensure \neconomy and efficiency of Federal Government operations by establishing \na moratorium on regulatory rulemaking actions, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 307\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 307, a bill to \nrequire the Secretary of the Treasury to design and issue new \ncounterfeit-resistant $100 currency.\n\n\n                                 S. 324\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Brown] was added as a cosponsor of S. 324, a bill to amend the \nFair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exclude from the definition of \nemployee firefighters and rescue squad workers who perform volunteer \nservices and to prevent employers from requiring employees who are \nfirefighters or rescue squad workers to perform volunteer services, and \nto allow an employer not to pay overtime compensation to a firefighter \nor rescue squad worker who performs volunteer services for the \nemployer, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Chafee] was added as a cosponsor of S. 327, a bill to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide clarification for the \ndeductibility of expenses incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the \nbusiness use of the home.\n\n\n                                 S. 348\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nBennett] was added as a cosponsor of S. 348, a bill to provide for a \nreview by the Congress of rules promulgated by agencies, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 17\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kempthorne, the name of the Senator from \nMissouri [Mr. Ashcroft] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint \nResolution 17, A joint resolution naming the CVN-76 aircraft carrier as \nthe U.S.S.

If, at any subcommittee meeting, a measure or \n     matter cannot be ordered reported because of the absence of \n     such a minority member, the measure or matter shall lay over \n     for a day. If the presence of a member of the minority is not \n     then obtained, a majority of the members of the subcommittee, \n     actually present, may order such measure or matter reported.\n       (c) No measure or matter shall be ordered reported from the \n     committee or a subcommittee unless a majority of the \n     committee or subcommittee is actually present at the time \n     such action is taken.\n       Rule 5.--With the approval of the chairman of the committee \n     or subcommittee, one member thereof may conduct public \n     hearings other than taking sworn testimony.\n       Rule 6.--Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and \n     matters before the committee or a subcommittee if the absent \n     member has been informed of the matter on which he is being \n     recorded and has affirmatively requested that he be so \n     recorded. While proxies may be voted on a motion to report a \n     measure or matter from the committee, such a motion shall \n     also require the concurrence of a\n      majority of the members who are actually present at the time \n     such action is taken.\n       The committee may poll any matters of committee business as \n     a matter of unanimous consent; provided that every member is \n     polled and every poll consists of the following two \n     questions:\n       (1) Do you agree or disagree to poll the proposal; and\n       (2) Do you favor or oppose the proposal.\n       Rule 7.--There shall be prepared and kept a complete \n     transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record \n     the proceedings of each committee or subcommittee meeting or \n     conference whether or not such meetings or any part thereof \n     is closed pursuant to the specific provisions of subsections \n     (b) and (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     unless a majority of said members vote to forgo such a \n     record.

The presiding \n     officer at any hearing is authorized to limit the time of \n     each witness appearing before the committee or a \n     subcommittee. The committee or a subcommittee shall, as far \n     as practicable, utilize testimony previously taken on bills \n     and measures similar to those before it for consideration.\n       Rule 10.--Should a subcommittee fail to report back to the \n     full committee on any measure within a reasonable time, the \n     chairman may withdraw the measure from such subcommittee and \n     report that fact to the full committee for further \n     disposition.\n       Rule 11.--No subcommittee may schedule a meeting or hearing \n     at a time designated for a hearing or meeting of the full \n     committee.

Whenever a bill or joint resolution repealing or \n     amending any statute or part thereof shall be before the \n     committee or a subcommittee for final consideration, the \n     clerk shall place before each member of the committee or \n     subcommittee a print of the statute or the part or section \n     thereof to be amended or replaced showing by stricken-through \n     type, the part or parts to be omitted and in italics, the \n     matter proposed to be added.\n       Rule 16.--An appropriate opportunity shall be given the \n     minority to examine the proposed text of committee reports \n     prior to their filing or publication. In the event there are \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views, an appropriate \n     opportunity shall be given the majority to examine the \n     proposed text prior to filing or publication.\n       Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue \n     subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear \n     subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has \n     been authorized by majority vote of the committee.\n       (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn \n     testimony or hear subpoenaed witnesses, three members of the \n     committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum: \n     provided, with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, a single \n     member may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony.\n       (c) The committee may, by a majority vote, delegate the \n     authority to issue subpoenas to the chairman of the committee \n     or a subcommittee, or to any member designated by such \n     chairman. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any \n     other member so requesting, shall be notified regarding the \n     identity of the person to whom it will be issued and the \n     nature of the information sought and its relationship to the \n     authorized investigative activity, except where the chairman \n     of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, determines that such notice would \n     unduly impede the investigation. All information obtained \n     pursuant to such investigative activity shall be made \n     available as promptly as possible to each member of the \n     committee requesting same, or to any assistant to a member of \n     the committee designated by such member in writing, but the \n     use of any such information is subject to restrictions \n     imposed by the rules of the Senate. Such information, to the \n     extent that it is relevant to the investigation shall, if \n     requested by a member, be summarized in writing as soon as \n     practicable. Upon the request of any member, the chairman of \n     the committee or subcommittee shall call an executive session \n     to discuss such investigative activity or the issuance of any \n     subpoena in connection therewith.\n       (d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing or any \n     witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel \n     of his own choosing who shall be permitted, while the witness \n     is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.\n       (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential \n     material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of \n     the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made \n     public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary, \n     unless authorized by a majority of the members of the \n     committee or subcommittee.\n       Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of \n     their background and financial interests, including the \n     financial interests of their spouse and children living in \n     their household, on a form approved by the committee which \n     shall be sworn to as to its completeness and accuracy. The \n     committee form shall be in two parts--\n       (I) information relating to employment, education and \n     background of the nominee relating to the position to which \n     the individual is nominated, and which is to be made public; \n     and\n       (II) information relating to financial and other background \n     of the nominee, to be made public when the committee \n     determines that such information bears directly on the \n     nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the \n     individual is nominated.\n       Information relating to background and financial interests \n     (parts I and II) shall not be required of (a) candidates for \n     appointment and promotion in the Public Health Service Corps; \n     and (b) nominees for less than full-time appointments to \n     councils, commissions or boards when the committee determines \n     that some or all of the information is not relevant to the \n     nature of the position. Information relating to other \n     background and financial interests (part II) shall not be \n     required of any nominee when the committee determines that it \n     is not relevant to the nature of the position.\n       Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or \n     meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation, \n     shall not be initiated until at least five days after the \n     nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the \n     chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority \n     member, waives this waiting period.\n       Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the \n     committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the \n     committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at \n     any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire \n     membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice, \n     or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.\n       Rule 20.--In addition to the foregoing, the proceedings of \n     the committee shall be governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate and the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization \n     Act of 1946, as amended.\n\n            [Excerpts from the Standing Rules of the Senate]\n\n\n                     rule xxv--standing committees\n\n       1.

The \n     prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall not \n     apply to the Committee on Appropriations or the Committee on \n     the Budget. The majority leader or his designee shall \n     announce to the Senate whenever consent has been given under \n     this subparagraph and shall state the time and place of such \n     meeting. The right to make such announcement of consent shall \n     have the same priority as the filing of a cloture motion.\n       (b) Each meeting of a committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be \n     open to the public, except that a meeting or series of \n     meetings by a committee or a subcommittee thereof on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the member of the committee \n     or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or \n     meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial\n      or other benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order \n     to prevent undue injury to the competitive position of \n     such person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       (c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or \n     subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be \n     broadcast by radio or television, or both, under such rules \n     as the committee or subcommittee may adopt.\n       (d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting \n     that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval \n     or disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance of \n     any such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to \n     enforce order on his own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Senator. When the Chair finds it \n     necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear \n     the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so \n     long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.\n       (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete \n     transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record \n     the proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not \n     such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this \n     paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo \n     such a record.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources With \n       Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters\n\n\n                                hearings\n\n       Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act \n     requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announced \n     the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least \n     one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.\n       The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice \n     to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time \n     and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of \n     section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the \n     committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the \n     development of hearings:\n       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in \n     the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement \n     of such hearing.\n       2. Seven days prior to public notice of each committee or \n     subcommittee hearing, the committee or subcommittee should \n     provide written notice to each member of the committee of the \n     time, place, and specific subject matter of such hearing, \n     accompanied by a list of those witnesses who have been or are \n     proposed to be invited to appear.\n       3. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the \n     maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of \n     the committee rules as it relates to the submission of \n     written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance \n     of a hearing. When statements are received in advance of a \n     hearing, the\n      committee or subcommittee (as appropriate) should distribute \n     copies of such statements to each of its members.\n\n\n         EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKING UP BILLS\n\n       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to \n     assist each member of the committee so that there may be full \n     and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a \n     subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be \n     followed:\n       1. Seven days prior to the proposed data for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice \n     to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific \n     subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing \n     each bill or other matters to be considered and including:\n       (a) two copies of each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       (b) two copies of a summary of the provisions of each bill, \n     joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       2. Three days prior to the scheduled date for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills, the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should deliver to each of its \n     members two copies of a cordon print or an equivalent \n     explanation of changes of existing law proposed to be made by \n     each bill, joint resolution, or other legislative matter to \n     be considered at such executive session.\n       3. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an \n     executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, each \n     member of the committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) \n     should provide to all other such members two written copies \n     of any amendment or a description of any amendment which that \n     member proposes to offer to each bill, joint resolution, or \n     other legislative matter to be considered at such executive \n     session.\n       4. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an \n     executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the \n     committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide \n     each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of \n     any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee \n     with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter to be considered at such executive \n     session.\n\n\n         COMMITTEE REPORTS, PUBLICATIONS, AND RELATED DOCUMENTS\n\n       Rule 16 of the committee rules requires that the minority \n     be given an opportunity to examine the proposed text of \n     committee reports prior to their filing and that the majority \n     be given an opportunity to examine the proposed text of \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views prior to their \n     filing. The views of all members of the committee should be \n     taken fully and fairly into account with respect to all \n     official documents filed or published by the committee. Thus, \n     consistent with the spirit of rule 16, the proposed text of \n     each committee report, hearing record, and other related \n     committee document or publication should be provided to the \n     chairman and ranking minority member of the committee and the \n     chairman and ranking minority member of the appropriate \n     subcommittee at least forty-eight hours prior to its filing \n     or publication.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2421-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2423-S2425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           IT'S DRUGS, STUPID\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the finest public servants in \nmy years in Congress was Joseph Califano, who headed what was then \nknown as Health, Education and Welfare for President Carter. He wrote a \nstory in the Sunday New York Times on the drug problem that makes \neminent good sense.\n  Recently, the Chicago Sun-Times had a front-page story saying that 95 \npercent of those who apply for drug treatment are being turned down. I \nvisited Cook County jail with 9,000 inmates. In a minimum security \nbarracks, with about 45 men sleeping on cots, one of the prisoners told \nme he wanted to get into drug treatment. I turned to the assistant \nwarden who was with me and asked why he could not get in, and the \nwarden said they had only 120 spots for drug treatment for 9,000 \nprisoners. I turned to the rest of the men and asked how many of them \nwould like to get into drug treatment and about 30 raised their hands.\n  Our failure to provide drug treatment for people who need it is \nshort-sighted. We demagog on the crime issue and pretend we are really \ndoing something when we create 60 new causes for capital punishment and \nset more mandatory minmums. The reality is, we are \n[[Page S2424]]  doing nothing through those things to reduce the crime \nrate.\n  Senator Kennedy uses the figure that 75 percent of those who do \nreceive drug treatment while in prison do not come back, and 75 percent \nof those who do not, do come back. I don't know if those statistics are \nprecisely accurate, but the general principle is clearly accurate. I am \ngrateful to Joe Califano for providing sensible leadership once more.\n  At this point, I ask that his statement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 29, 1995]\n\n                           It's Drugs, Stupid\n\n                          (By Joseph Califano)\n\n       Despite all the Republican preening and Democratic pouting \n     since Nov. 8, neither political party gets it. If Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich is serious about delivering results from his \n     party's ``Contract With America'' and if President clinton \n     means to revive his Presidency, each can start by recognizing \n     how fundamentally drugs have changed society's problems and \n     that together they can transform Government's response.\n       For 30 years, America has tried to curb crime with more \n     judges, tougher punishments and bigger prisons. We have tried \n     to rein in health costs by manipulating payments to doctors \n     and hospitals. We've fought poverty with welfare systems that \n     offer little incentive to work. All the while, we have \n     undermined these efforts with our personal and national \n     denial about the sinister dimension drug abuse and addition \n     have added to our society. If Gingrich and Clinton want to \n     prove to us that they can make a difference in what really \n     ails America, they should ``get real'' about how drugs have \n     recast three of the nation's biggest challenges.\n       Law, Order and Justice--In 1960 there were fewer than \n     30,000 arrests for drug offenses; in 30 years, that number \n     soared beyond one million. Since 1989, more individuals have \n     been incarcerated for drug offenses than for all violent \n     crimes--and most violent crimes are committed by drug \n     (including alcohol) abusers.\n       Probation and parole are sick jokes in most cities. As \n     essential first steps to rehabilitation, many parolees need \n     drug treatment and after-care, which means far more \n     monitoring than their drug-free predecessors of a generation \n     ago required, not less. Yet in Los Angeles, for example, \n     probation officers are expected to handle as many as 1,000 \n     cases at a time. With most offenders committing drug- or \n     alcohol-related crimes, it's no wonder so many parolees go \n     right back to jail: 80 percent of prisoners have prior \n     convictions and more than 60 percent have served time before.\n       Congress and state legislatures keep passing laws more \n     relevant to the celluloid gangsters and inmates of classic \n     1930's movies than 1990's reality. Today's prisons are wall \n     to wall with drug dealers, addicts, alcohol abusers and the \n     mentally ill (often related to drug abuse). The prison \n     population shot past a million in 1994 and is likely to \n     double soon\n      after the year 2000. Among industrialized nations, the \n     United States is second only to Russia in the number of \n     its citizens it imprisons: 519 per 100,000, compared with \n     368 for next-place South Africa, 116 for Canada and 36 for \n     Japan.\n       Judges and prosecutors are demoralized as they juggle \n     caseloads of more than twice the recommended maximum. In 1991 \n     eight states had to close their civil jury trial systems for \n     all or part of the year to comply with speedy trial \n     requirements of criminal cases involving drug abusers. Even \n     where civil courts remain open, the rush of drug-related \n     cases has created intolerable delays--4 years in Newark, 5 in \n     Philadelphia and up to 10 in Cook County, Ill. In our \n     impersonal, bureaucratic world, if society keeps denying \n     citizens timely, individual hearings for their grievances, \n     they may blow off angry steam in destructive ways.\n       Health Care Cost Containment.--Emergency rooms from Boston \n     to Baton Rouge are piled high with the debris of drug use on \n     city streets--victims of gunshot wounds, drug-promoted child \n     and spouse abuse, and drug-related medical conditions like \n     cardiac complications and sexually transmitted diseases. AIDS \n     and tuberculosis have spread rapidly in large part because of \n     drug use. Beyond dirty needles, studies show that teen-agers \n     high on pot, alcohol or other drugs are far more likely to \n     have sex, and to have it without a condom.\n       Each year drugs and alcohol trigger up to $75 billion in \n     health care costs. The cruelest impact afflicts the half-\n     million newborns exposed to drugs during pregnancy. Crack \n     babies, a rarity a decade ago, crowd $2,000-a-day neonatal \n     wards. Many die. It can cost $1 million to bring each \n     survivor to adulthood.\n       Even where prenatal care is available--as it is for most \n     Medicaid beneficiaries--women on drugs tend not to take \n     advantage of it. And as for drug treatment, only a relatively \n     small percentage of drug-abusing pregnant mothers seek it, \n     and they must often wait in line for scarce slots. Pregnant \n     mothers' failure to seek prenatal care and stop abusing drugs \n     accounts for much of the almost $3 billion that Medicaid \n     spent in 1994 on impatient hospital care related to drug use.\n       The Fight Against Poverty.--Drugs have changed the nature \n     of poverty. Nowhere is this more glaring than in the welfare \n     systems and the persistent problem of teen-age pregnancy.\n       Speaker Gingrich and President Clinton are hell-bent to put \n     welfare mothers to work. But all the financial lures and \n     prods and all the job training in the world will do precious \n     little to make employable the hundreds of thousands of \n     welfare recipients who are addicts and abusers.\n       For too long, reformers have had their heads in the sand \n     about this unpleasant reality. Liberals fear that admitting \n     the extent of alcohol and drug abuse among welfare recipients \n     will incite even more punitive reactions than those now \n     fashionable. Conservatives don't want to face up to the cost \n     of drug treatment. This political denial assures failure of \n     any effort to put these welfare recipients to work.\n       The future is not legalization. Legalizing drug use would \n     write off millions of minority Americans, especially children \n     and drug-exposed babies, whose communities are most under \n     siege by drugs. It has not worked in any nation where it's \n     been tried, and our own experience with alcohol and \n     cigarettes shows how unlikely we are to keep legalized drugs \n     away from children.\n       Drugs are the greatest threat to family stability, decent \n     housing, public schools and even minimal social amenities in \n     urban ghettos. Contrary to the claim of pot proponents, \n     marijuana is dangerous. It devastates short-term memory and \n     the ability to concentrate precisely when our children need \n     them most--when they are in school. And a child 12 to 17 \n     years old who smokes pot is 85 times as likely to use cocaine \n     as a child who does not. Cocaine is much more addictive than \n     alcohol, which has already hooked more than 18 million \n     Americans. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, a top drug expert, \n     estimates that legalizing cocaine would give us at least 20 \n     million addicts, more than 10 times the number today.\n       It's especially reckless to promote legalization when we \n     have not committed research funds and energies to addiction \n     prevention and treatment on a scale commensurate with the \n     epidemic. The National Institutes of Health spend some $4 \n     billion for research on cancer, cardiovascular disease and \n     AIDS, but less than 15 percent of that amount for research on \n     substance abuse and addiction, the largest single cause and \n     exacerbator of those diseases.\n       Treatment varies widely, from inpatient to outpatient, from \n     quick-fix acupuncture to residential programs ranging a few \n     weeks to more than a year, from methadone dependence to drug-\n     free therapeutic communities. Fewer than 25 percent of the \n     individuals who need drug or alcohol treatment enter a \n     program. On average, a quarter complete treatment; half of \n     them are drug- or alcohol-free a year later. In other words, \n     with wide variations depending on individual circumstances, \n     those entering programs have a one-in-eight chance of being \n     free of drugs or alcohol a year later. Those odds beat many \n     for long-shot cancer chemotherapies, and research should \n     significantly improve them. But a recent\n      study in California found that even at current rates of \n     success, $1 invested in treatment saves $7 in crime, \n     health care and welfare costs.\n       Here are a few suggestions for immediate action to attack \n     the dimension drugs have added to these three problems:\n       Grant Federal funds to state and Federal prison systems \n     only if they provide drug and alcohol treatment and after-\n     care for all inmates who need it.\n       Instead of across-the-board mandatory sentences, keep \n     inmates with drug and alcohol problems in jails, boot camps \n     or halfway houses until they experience a year of sobriety \n     after treatment.\n       Require drug and alcohol addicts to go regularly to \n     treatment and after-care programs like Alcoholics Anonymous \n     while on parole or probation.\n       Provide Federal funds for police only to cities that \n     enforce drug laws throughout their jurisdiction. End the \n     acceptance of drug bazaars in Harlem and southeast Washington \n     that would not be tolerated on Manhattan's Upper East Side or \n     in Georgetown.\n       Encourage judges with lots of drug cases to employ public \n     health professionals, just as they hire economists to assist \n     with antitrust cases.\n       Cut off welfare payments to drug addicts and alcoholics who \n     refuse to seek treatment and pursue after-care. As employers \n     and health professionals know, addicts need lots of carrots \n     and sticks, including the treat of loss of job and income, to \n     get the monkey off their back.\n       Put children of drug- or alcohol-addicted welfare mothers \n     who refuse treatment into foster care or orphanages. Speaker \n     Gingrich and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have done the \n     nation a disservice by playing all-or-nothing politics with \n     this issue. The compassionate and cost-effective middle \n     ground is to identify those parents who abuse their children \n     by their own drug and alcohol abuse and place those children \n     in decent orphanages and foster care until the parents shape \n     up.\n       Subject inmates, parolees and welfare recipients with a \n     history of substance abuse to random drug tests, and fund the \n     treatment they need. Liberals must recognize that getting off \n     drugs is the only chance these individuals (and their babies) \n     have to enjoy their civil rights. Conservatives who preach an \n     end to criminal recidivism and welfare dependency must \n     recognize that reincarceration and removal from the welfare \n     rolls for those who test positive is a cruel Catch-22 unless \n     treatment is available.\n       [[Page S2425]] Fortunately, the new Congress and the new \n     Clinton are certain not to legalize drugs. Unfortunately, it \n     is less clear whether they will recognize the nasty new stain \n     of intractability that drugs have added to crime, health \n     costs and welfare dependency, and go on to tap the potential \n     of research, prevention and treatment to save billions of \n     dollars and millions of lives.\n       If a mainstream disease like diabetes or cancer affected as \n     many individuals and families as drug and alcohol abuse and \n     addiction do, this nation would mount an effort on the scale \n     of the Manhattan Project to deal with it.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2423-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     AMERICA'S GOLD-STAR MOM: ROSE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am asking that a column written by \nSteve Neal, in tribute to the mother of our colleague, Edward Kennedy, \nbe placed into the Record.\n  It is a great tribute to Mrs. Kennedy.\n  I did not have the privilege of knowing her well, but I wish I had.\n  In addition to what is said in the Steve Neal column, I believe it is \nnot an exaggeration to say that no mother has contributed as much to \nthe Nation in our 206 year history as Rose Kennedy.\n  Her life was a story of tragedy and triumph and a brilliant spirit, \ndespite all the tragedies. The remarkable contributions that Ted \nKennedy makes to this body and to the Nation are one of many tributes \nto Rose Kennedy.\n  At this point, I ask that the Steven Neal column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The column follows:\n\n                  [From the Sun-Times, Jan. 24, 1995]\n\n                     America's Gold-Star Mom: Rose\n\n                            (By Steve Neal)\n\n       Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy had style. She spoke on her son's \n     behalf at a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Brighton. Mass. \n     It was John F. Kennedy's first campaign. He was running for \n     Congress in 1946. Mrs. Kennedy, who had lost her eldest son \n     Joseph in World War II and had nearly lost another, didn't \n     talk about her family's tragedy. She dazzled the crowd with \n     her wit. As the daughter of a former Boston mayor, Rose \n     Kennedy was a political natural. When she finished her talk \n     at the VFW hall. Mrs. Kennedy got a rousing ovation. Then she \n     introduced the young JFK.\n       Dave Powers, JFK's war buddy, recalled that Kennedy was \n     ``slightly over-whelmed that his mother could talk that well \n     to an audience.'' As Mrs. Kennedy made her exit, her son \n     stopped her and said, ``Mother, they really love you.''\n       So did the world.\n       Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy, who died Sunday at 104, \n     was America's gold-star mother and one of the more \n     extraordinary women of the 20th century. She taught JFK how \n     to give a political speech and how to work a crowd. He \n     couldn't have had a better teacher.\n       Three of her sons were elected to the U.S. Senate and her \n     son John won the presidency of the United States. She took \n     pride in their accomplishments.\n       ``As Jack's mother, I am confident that Jack will win \n     because his father says so, and through the years I have seen \n     his predictions and judgments vindicated almost without \n     exception,'' Mrs. Kennedy wrote in her diary in June, 1960. \n     ``And so, I believe it. He also says, and has said all along, \n     that if Jack gets the nomination he can beat Nixon.''\n       Mrs. Kennedy had a long memory. ``We are all furious at \n     Governor [Pat] Brown of California and Governor [David] \n     Lawrence of Pennsylvania because they will not come out for \n     Jack now. Their support would clinch the nomination for him. \n     Joe has worked on Lawrence all winter but he still can't \n     believe a Catholic can be elected.''\n       Mrs. Kennedy wrote of JFK's first debate: ``I watched Jack \n     last night on the debate, praying through every sentence, as \n     I had prayed during the day. He looked more assured than \n     Nixon and looked better physically. Jack seemed to have the \n     initiative and once or twice rose to inspiring heights of \n     oratory.'' But she noted that he could improve: ``People \n     think that Jack speaks too fast. I agree and have already \n     told him.''\n       Four of her children had tragic deaths. She said that the \n     wounds of those tragedies never healed. But her courage and \n     faith kept her going. ``One of the best ways to assuage grief \n     is to find a way to turn some part of the loss to a positive, \n     affirmative use for the benefit of other people,'' Mrs. \n     Kennedy wrote in her memoirs. ``I do believe that God blesses \n     us for that and the burden is lightened.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2425-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ANGUISH IN RWANDA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, the Washington Post had an \ninteresting editorial titled, ``Anguish in Rwanda.''\n  It speaks of the need for the United Nations to have a few troops, to \ngive some stability to a nation that is teetering on the edge of \ninstability. Perhaps even that is a too favorable description of the \nsituation.\n  I introduced legislation in the last session, which I will be \nreintroducing this session, to authorize the United States to have up \nto 3,000 troops that would be available to the United Nations for their \nefforts, subject to the approval of the President of the United States. \nWe should call on other nations to do the same.\n  The great threat to U.S. security and the security of other nations \ntoday is instability. By having a small force, a group of volunteers \nfrom within our Armed Forces available, we could do much to provide \nstability in places like Rwanda.\n  I ask that the Post editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 1995]\n\n                           Anguish in Rwanda\n\n       To protect a million-plus Rwandan refugees in Zaire, the \n     United Nations appealed to 60 nations for peace-keepers. All \n     60 said no. The secretary general then asked for a few dozen \n     U.N. officers to support soldiers from Zaire. Again the \n     answer was no. Falling back, U.N. Secretary General Boutros \n     Boutros-Ghali now simply asks the Security Council to make \n     available some Zairian troops assisted by civilian refugee \n     officials. The prospects are uncertain.\n       In the camps there is no uncertainty, only desperation. The \n     Hutus who perpetrated genocide in Rwanda last spring lost to \n     the Tutsi-minority rebels and then carried many of their \n     people, with their supporting community structures, into \n     exile in Zaire. The international relief agencies found these \n     structures essential to funnel in quick aid. But that gave \n     new power and coin to the old Hutu hierarchy, including war \n     criminals, who steal the aid and keep refugees from going \n     home. A moral dilemma has split the agencies: Stay and \n     sustain a regime of killers, or leave and let suffering \n     refugees suffer more. This is the context in which the United \n     Nations seeks to build an alternative security structure.\n       Last year's television pictures of the genocide publicized \n     the need for emergency supplies, and many responded. But the \n     humanitarian needs of the camps merge into an obscure zone of \n     political struggle, and many lose interest. Dozens of \n     countries were ready to send material aid. None is ready to \n     expose its soldiers to risk for the Hutus. Nor is the problem \n     confined to Rwanda. Its descent to a hollowed-out chaos where \n     it can no longer order its own affairs is typical of the \n     ethnic and national disputes that now disfigure world \n     politics. Expect more in humanitarian crises, the CIA warned \n     last month, and less in international relief.\n       So many things remain to be done. Right at the top ought to \n     be the establishment of a standby humanitarian food-and-\n     police service, run out of the Security Council, where the \n     United States has a veto, so that when the next quaking call \n     comes, the secretary general does not have to run around \n     begging 60 distracted countries to help in vain.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2425-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2425-S2426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, Senator Frank \nMurkowski and I had the chance to visit Vietnam. And shortly after we \ngot back, I read the column by Tom Friedman in the New York Times about \nVietnam, which makes so much sense.\n    \n    \n  We are now inching toward full diplomatic relations that should have \noccurred years ago. Sixteen years ago I had lunch with the Vietnamese \ndelegation at the United Nations and urged full diplomatic recognition \nat that time. We should do it now--the sooner, the better.\n  I ask that the Tom Friedman column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 18, 1995]\n\n                         Good Morning, Vietnam\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       Hanoi, Vietnam.--In 1966, at the height of the Vietnam War, \n     Senator George Aiken became famous for suggesting that we \n     simply declare victory and bring American troops home. That \n     victory was phony, but 29 years later we truly have one in \n     Vietnam, if winning is measured by a Vietnam that is \n     economically, politically and strategically pro-Western. Yet \n     despite that victory, Washington is reluctant to open full \n     diplomatic relations with Hanoi and consolidate its tentative \n     move into America's orbit. It's time. It's time we started \n     relating to Vietnam as a country, not a conflict. It's time \n     that we declare victory and go back to Vietnam to reap it.\n       President Bush should have been the one to open relations. \n     He knew it was the right thing to do, and he had the \n     credibility with veterans' groups to do it. But he didn't. \n     (Wouldn't be prudent.) President Clinton, despite his \n     problems with Vietnam vets, has inched closer to Hanoi, by \n     lifting economic sanctions last year and agreeing to a low-\n     level liaison office this year. For months the State \n     Department has been quietly recommending full normalization, \n     but after the midterm Republican rout the White House said \n     ``Forget it.'' (Wouldn't be prudent.) That is America's loss.\n        [[Page S2426]] Vietnam's 72 million industrious, literate \n     people are building a market economy from the ground up. \n     Because U.S. diplomats and businesses are not here in force \n     as the foundation stones are laid and the legal system is \n     reformed, this means U.S. standards, regulations and laws are \n     not being wired in. Australia already dominates the phone \n     system, British Petroleum has the oil sector and Singapore \n     advises on the legal code.\n       I was riding in a taxi here the other day and the driver \n     was studying English from BBC tapes. For 30 minutes I had to \n     listen to a repetition of: ``I like football. I like \n     Manchester United,'' the prominent British soccer team. When \n     they think football here they don't think Dallas Cowboys, and \n     when they think telephones they don't think AT\n       Strategically, the big issue in Asia will be the \n     containment of China, whose military might, and appetite, \n     will grow as China grows. There is no more powerful \n     counterweight to Beijing than Hanoi, whose tiny army \n     bludgeoned China's in their 1979 border war. China is \n     Vietnam's historical enemy. Most of Hanoi's boulevards are \n     named for heroes of the wars against China. The biggest \n     display in the Hanoi Army Museum is not of Vietnam's victory \n     over the U.S. in 1975, but its victory over the Mongols from \n     the north in 1288. A U.S.-Vietnam entente would get China's \n     attention--and keep it.\n       As for our M.I.A's, every U.S. official dealing with this \n     issue says Vietnamese cooperation has improved (not \n     diminished, as opponents of relations predicted) since we \n     lifted the economic embargo. The reason is not anything the \n     Hanoi Government is doing, but because the Vietnamese people, \n     villagers and veterans, are now coming forward with \n     information about graves and bones that they were holding \n     back as long as America was embargoing them economically. \n     U.S. M.I.A. officials say normal relations and more Americans \n     traveling here would only elicit more grass-roots \n     cooperation, which is the only way the 1,621 remaining M.I.A. \n     cases will be resolved.\n       It is pathetic that a small, vindictive cult of M.I.A. \n     activists in America--who broadcast U.F.O. sightings of \n     P.O.W.'s roaming the Vietnamese countryside and demand we \n     withhold normalization to punish Hanoi for war we never \n     should have fought--have intimidated Washington into a \n     Vietnam policy that is bad for M.I.A.'s and bad for America.\n       The Vietnamese, who have 300,000 M.I.A.'s, have let the \n     future bury the past. As Deputy Foreign Minister LeMai told \n     me: ``If we nursed all of our grudges with all the powers \n     that we have fought against, we wouldn't have relations with \n     anyone. The war divided your society; recognizing Vietnam \n     would put this behind you. It would heal your own wounds.''\n       He's right. It's time we too buried the past. Hue today is \n     a cuisine, not a battle; Tet is a New Year's celebration, not \n     an offensive; Haiphong is a harbor, not something to be \n     bombed at Christmas; and Highway 1 is where they run the \n     Hanoi Marathon, not the military artery of an enemy nation. \n     President Clinton didn't start this war, and he didn't fight \n     this war, but with a little bit of courage, he could finally \n     end this war.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2425-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2426-S2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             A FRACTURED COMMUNITY AND SHORT OF PERFECTION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, the annual Man of the Year \nAward in St. Louis was given to two people rather than one, our two \nformer colleagues, Tom Eagleton and Jack Danforth.\n  They are both among our finest.\n  I am pleased that the citizens of St. Louis appropriately honored \nboth of them.\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch published their comments on that \noccasion, and because of our association with the two of them and \nbecause of what they say about government and our attitudes toward one \nanother in this excessively partisan climate, I urge my colleagues to \nread their comments.\n  I ask that their remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jan. 10, 1995]\n\n                         A Fractured Community\n\n                        (By Thomas F. Eagleton)\n\n       I recently attended a meeting of St. Louis businessmen and \n     heard Charles ``Chuck'' Knight, chairman and CEO of Emerson \n     Electric, say the following: ``Downtown's top attractions--\n     the Arch, Busch Stadium, Kiel Center, Union Station, the \n     convention center, the new football stadium, the casinos--\n     will draw in excess of 12 million visitors annually. That's \n     more than Disneyland.''\n       Chuck Knight is correct in his enthusiasm for downtown St. \n     Louis, Downtown St. Louis has been revived. Downtown St. \n     Louis is being rescued.\n       But the city of St. Louis as a whole has not. The Arch does \n     not a city make. Busch Stadium does not a city make. The Kiel \n     Center does not a city make. A football stadium does not a \n     city make.\n       A city is people. A city is neighborhoods. A city is the \n     interrelation of people with common concerns and common \n     hopes. A city is the cohesive interaction of its peoples and \n     its purposes. A city is the sum of its treasured pact and its \n     capacity to flourish in the future.\n       Today's city of St. Louis can glory in its past as one of \n     America's great cities, but as presently structured, it is a \n     fading city with a troubled future.\n       When I entered politics, the city of St. Louis had 850,000 \n     people. Today it is 380,000. The 1994 official State of \n     Missouri demographic report says that in 2020 the population \n     of St. Louis will be between 225,000 and 275,000--much \n     smaller than the Wichita of 2020.\n       There is a structural noose around the St. Louis region's \n     neck. We don't discuss it much, but the St. Louis \n     metropolitan area is the textbook example of the most \n     politically fragmented, disarrayed urban region in the \n     nation. We are America's worst-case governance scenario. When \n     we succeed, we do so in spite of our structural handicaps.\n       Back in 1876, the voters approved the separation of the \n     city from the county. There were five municipalities in St. \n     Louis County at that time. There are now 90. One has 11 \n     residents. There are 21 St. Louis County cities with under \n     1,000 people. Only nine exceed 20,000.\n       There are 43 fire protection units and 62 police \n     departments.\n       In the St. Louis metropolitan region, resource disparities \n     are staggering. The city has been tax-abated to excess. In \n     the county, there continues a frenetic, never-ending ``land \n     rush'' to capture tax base in unincorporated portions of the \n     county.\n       I realize we live in a time when it is out of fashion to \n     discuss the impact of government on private decision-making. \n     I also realize that we like to cling to the sentimental \n     notion that somehow quaint Webster Groves and Ladue, for \n     example, are so self-sufficient as to have no need of \n     interaction and interconnection with governmental conditions \n     around them.\n       Just as the city of St. Louis has outlived its history, St. \n     Louis County has outgrown its sentimental quaintness. Our \n     city and\n      our county are an aggregation of jerry-built, haphazard, \n     fragmented, disconnected governmental units, many barely \n     treading water. We have had a succession of Boards of \n     freeholders, a Board of Electors, and a Boundary \n     Commission. All have attempted to tinker with the \n     governmental structure and for one reason or another have \n     made no discernable improvement.\n       We have tried some targeted remedies, such as a Sewer \n     District, Junior College District, Zoo and Museum District, \n     and joint support for a hospital. We have Bi-State. These \n     regional efforts have helped, but the city-county disunion \n     persists.\n       St. Louis and St. Louis County still remain as the foremost \n     textbook example of how free people can misgovern themselves \n     on the local level.\n       Enough handwringing. What do we do?\n       We have two choices.\n       Creeping incrementalism. Deal with the situation at the \n     margins--tinkering with charter reform--go to the Missouri \n     legislature or voters for non-controversial changes.\n       Cold bath. Just as the end of communism required a bold, \n     total leap into capitalism, so too the end of St. Louis-St. \n     Louis County disunion will require a bold, total immersion. \n     St. Louis, like Berlin, would be whole again.\n       I fervently believe in the latter precept. Incrementalism \n     won't go to the root of the distress. I'll give an example. \n     Whether the St. Louis Police Board is appointed by the \n     governor or the mayor will not have an overwhelming, decisive \n     impact on the destiny of St. Louis. Only the boldness of \n     urban consolidation--one city--will be meaningful.\n       Let me be clear. I am not alleging that solving the \n     governmental barriers of the St. Louis region will alone \n     create a spontaneous regeneration of a new and greater St. \n     Louis with unfettered decency and personal responsibility \n     reigning supreme.\n    \n    \n       Eliminating the Berlin Wall has not as yet equalized East \n     and West. Eliminating Skinker Boulevard as our own Berlin \n     Wall between poverty and prosperity will not by itself ensure \n     an instantaneous panacea.\n       It would allow for local government to do its part of the \n     societal job at its united best rather than at its fragmented \n     worst. It would allow for a consolidation of effort and a \n     focus of responsibility that simply isn't possible when \n     political authority is fragmented into bits and pieces.\n       The day should come when St. Louis recaptures its \n     population, its tax base and its greatness.\n       To paraphrase a famous Jewish sage, if not now, when? If \n     not us, who?\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jan. 10, 1995]\n\n                          Short of Perfection\n\n                         (By John C. Danforth)\n\n       It is a most special honor to be joined in anyone's mind \n     with Tom Eagleton. For all of my political life, Tom has been \n     for me the model of what a public servant should be--smart, \n     energetic, dedicated, always committed to the principles in \n     which he believed. It never mattered to me that his positions \n     were not exactly my own. He was a very fine Senator, and he \n     is a very good friend, and I am proud to share this honor \n     with him.\n       I don't know whether I am making much more out of it than \n     was intended, but it seems to me that there is a message in \n     this dual award--a message from St. Louis to the country--\n     that it is St. Louis' own answer to \n     [[Page S2427]]  the meanness and the anger that is the \n     politics of the 1990s. The message is that politics does not \n     have to be as mean and as angry as is now the rule.\n       I don't say this only because of the personal relationship \n     between Tom and me. But beyond recognizing our good \n     relationship, there is something more in the message of \n     today's awards.\n       Consider what it means when there are two men of the year \n     who made careers in politics, when one is a Democrat and the \n     other a Republican, one a liberal, the other a conservative, \n     one a supporter of Carter and Mondale, the other a supporter \n     of Reagan and Bush. Consider what it means when there are two \n     men of the year, who often disagreed, who often canceled one \n     another's votes in the Senate.\n       For those citizens who are in a constant state of rage \n     about government, it would be difficult to honor either Tom \n     or me; it would be impossible to honor both of us at the same \n     time. It would be difficult to honor either of us because, \n     with the thousands of Senate votes we cast, each of us has \n     done enough controversial things to make every Missourian mad \n     at least some of the time.\n       And if it would be difficult for an outraged citizen to \n     honor either one of us separately, it would be absolutely \n     impossible to honor both of us together. Even those who \n     agreed with one of us could not have agreed with both of us \n     at the same time.\n       If it is essential to you that your politicians reflect \n     your views, and if it angers you when they don't, then Tom, \n     or I, and certainly both of us together, must have made you \n     very angry very often. Many people have theories to explain \n     the general sense of outrage felt against politics and \n     politicians. Some point to the media generally, or more \n     specifically to talk radio or Rush Limbaugh. Some point to \n     negative election campaigns and unprincipled political \n     consultants. All of that deserves attention, but I think \n     there is something more--something broader than the latest \n     trends in the media or in campaigning. It has to do with what \n     people expect from government.\n       When expectations are unrealistically high, outrage at \n     failure is sure to follow. When we believe that government \n     should have all our answers, we are angry when it has none of \n     our answers. And unrealistic expectations of government are \n     the order of the day. This is true on both the left and the \n     right. On the left, it is thought that government can manage \n     the economy and cure the ills of society. On the right it is \n     thought that government can deter crime and restore personal \n     and religious values. In each case, platforms and programs \n     are thought to hold the key to success, if only the right law \n     is enacted, if only the right people are in charge.\n       We attribute our failures as a country to failures of our \n     government. We say that our politicians are out of touch. \n     They don't do things our way. They are incompetent, maybe \n     even corrupt.\n       Our problems are not of our making, but of their making. If \n     only right thinkers were in power, we could get on with the \n     people's business--the business of balancing the budget and \n     cutting taxes and retaining all the benefits we demand.\n       It is no wonder that we are so angry at government when our \n     expectations are so high. If government has the power to make \n     things right for us and simply doesn't do so, of course we \n     should be mad.\n       But we have got it wrong, wildly wrong by any historic \n     standard. It is not that government is bad, only that it is \n     government. As such it is limited, not by accident, but by \n     design, not because it is poorly run, but because it is run \n     as our founders intended it to be.\n       Government is not perfect, and it was not supposed to be \n     perfect. It is not omnipotent, because it was not intended to \n     be omnipotent. It was not intended to rule the economy or our \n     health care system or our families or our values. It never \n     had the total answer, it never had total power--it had \n     limited power and the limited capacity to make things better.\n       It makes sense to honor Tom Eagleton and Jack Danforth with \n     the same award only if there is a high level of tolerance for \n     each of us, only if you see that each of us was off the mark, \n     that neither of us had all the answers, that it was enough to \n     make a good try.\n       The business of government is not to reach perfection, for \n     perfection is not reached in this world. Marxism's lesson is \n     that when government attempts to reach perfection, it must be \n     totalitarian.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2426-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 RECALLING A MAN WHO STAYED THE COURSE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the gems in our society today \nis Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America \nand former assistant to Lyndon Johnson.\n  Recently, I saw his op-ed piece in the Los Angeles Times on the 30th \nanniversary of the inauguration of Lyndon Johnson as president.\n  His article reminded me what I heard on the radio recently that our \nstatistics on the children who live in households below the poverty \nlevel has risen to 26 percent. I did not hear the source for that, I do \nnot know if it is accurate. The traditional measurement we have been \nusing is 23 percent. And what a tradegy that is. No other Western \nindustrialized democracy comes anywhere near a figure like that, a \nfigure that is totally and completely preventable.\n  While the Vietnam war marred the record of Lyndon Johnson, what he \naccomplished in the domestic field--in helping people who desperately \nneed help--should jog our conscience today. There is so much mean-\nspiritedness and lack of concern for the poor. It appalls me.\n  All Americans need hope and instead of giving many of them hope, we \nare giving them jail cells or desperate poverty.\n  I ask that the Jack Valenti item be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                 Recalling a Man Who Stayed the Course\n\n                           (By Jack Valenti)\n\n       On this day 30 years ago, Lyndon B. Johnson was inaugurated \n     in his own right as the 36th President of the United States. \n     He has been elected President the previous November in a \n     landslide of public favor, with the largest percentage of \n     votes in this century, matched by no other victorious \n     President in the ensuing years. This day plus two is also the \n     22nd anniversary of his death.\n       Is it odd or is it merely the lament of one who served him \n     as best I could that his presidency and his passing find only \n     casual regard on this day?\n       He was the greatest parliamentary commander of his era. he \n     came to the presidency with a fixed compass course about \n     where he wanted to take the nation, and unshakable \n     convictions about what he wanted to do to lift the quality of \n     life. Against opposing forces in and outside his own party, \n     in conflict with those who thought he had no right to be \n     President, contradicting conventional wisdom and political \n     polls, he never hesitated, never flagged, never changed \n     course. He was a professional who knew every nook and cranny \n     of the arena, and when he was in full throttle, he was \n     virtually unstoppable.\n       He defined swiftly who he was and what he was about. He \n     said that he was going to pass a civil-rights bill and a \n     voting rights bill because, as he declared, ``every citizen \n     ought to have the right to live his own life without fear, \n     and every citizen ought to have the right to vote and when \n     you got the vote, you have political power, and when you have \n     political power, folks listen to you.'' He promptly told his \n     longtime Southern congressional friends that though he loved \n     them, they had best get out of his way or he would run them \n     down. He was going to pass those civil-rights bills. And he \n     did.\n       He made it clear that he was no longer going to tolerate \n     ``a little old lady being turned away from a hospital because \n     she had no money to pay the bill. By God, that's never going \n     to happen again.'' He determined to pass what he called \n     ``Harry Truman's medical-insurance bill.'' And he did. It was \n     called Medicare.\n       He railed against the absence of education in too many of \n     America's young. He stood on public rostrums and shouted, \n     ``We're going to make it possible for every boy and girl in \n     America, no matter how poor, no matter their race or \n     religion, no matter what remote corner of the country they \n     live in, to get all the education they can take, by federal \n     loan, scholarship or grant.'' And he passed the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act.\n       He was in a raging passion to destroy poverty in the land. \n     He waged his own ``War on Poverty,'' giving birth to Head \n     Start and a legion of other programs to stir the poor, to \n     ignite their hopes and raise their sights. Some of the \n     programs worked. Some didn't. But he said over and over \n     again, ``If you don't risk, you never rise.''\n       He often said that no President can lay claim to greatness \n     unless he presides over a robust economy. And so he courted, \n     shamelessly, the business, banking and industrial proconsuls \n     of the nation and made them believe what he said. And the \n     economy prospered.\n       On the first night of his presidency, he ruminated about \n     the awesome task ahead. But there was on the horizon that \n     night only a thin smudge of a line that was Vietnam. In time, \n     like a relentless cancer curling about the soul of a nation, \n     Vietnam infected his presidency.\n       If there had not been 16,000 American soldiers in Vietnam \n     when he took office, would he have sent troops there? I don't \n     believe he would have. But who really knows? What I do know \n     is that he grieved, a deep-down sorrow, that he could not \n     find ``an honorable way out'' other than ``hauling ass out of \n     there.''\n       I think that grieving cut his life short. Every President \n     will testify that when he has to send young men into battle \n     and the casualties begin to mount, it's like drinking \n     carbolic acid every morning.\n       But it was all a long time ago. To many young people not \n     born when L.B.J. died, he is a remote, distant figure coated \n     with the fungus of Vietnam. They view him, if at all, \n     dispiritedly.\n       But to others, to paraphrase Ralph Ellison, because of \n     Vietnam, L.B.J. will just have to settle for being the \n     greatest American President for the undereducated young, the \n     poor and the old, the sick and the black. But perhaps that's \n     not too bad an epitaph on this day so far away from where he \n     lived.\n\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2427-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n                      YOU CAN'T LEAD BY FOLLOWING\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in going over some old newspapers \nthat I missed while I was in Illinois over the Christmas/New Year \nholiday, I came across an op-ed piece by Robin Gerber, a senior fellow \nat the University of Maryland's Center for Political Leadership and \nParticipation.\n  It comments on what I consider to be a fundamental weakness in our \npolitical process today, that people are trying to follow the polls in \nhow they respond to problems.\n  There is a great quote in the op-ed piece from our House colleague, \nSteny Hoyer, for whom my admiration has grown through the years. \nCongressman Hoyer states: ``What polls do is confuse us. We're not \ntrying to figure out what's right but what is the passion of the day. \nPolls make us sloppy intellectually. They are a substitute for \nthinking.''\n  I ask that the Robin Gerber item be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                      You Can't Lead by Following\n\n                           (By Robin Gerber)\n\n       There is much talk now of governing from the ``center,'' of \n     how centrist politics can overcome the debacle of the Nov. 8 \n     election and put the president and his party on a true course \n     for reelection in 1996. But it is the moral center that must \n     be found before the political one can be explored.\n       This quest for defining political vision is imperiled by \n     the misplaced reliance by politicians of both parties on \n     public opinion polls.\n       Pollsters' authoritative declamations and directions, \n     gleaned from the complex science of gauging the public \n     interest, corrupt the straightforward instincts needed to \n     govern from the gut. Rep. Steny Hoyer, past chairman of the \n     Democratic Caucus, puts it this way, ``What polls do is \n     confuse us. We're not trying to figure out what's right but \n     what is the passion of the day. Polls make us sloppy \n     intellectually. They're a substitute for thinking.''\n       In an unprecedented effort to lead by following, \n     politicians of the 1990s use polls to support a new form of \n     hyper-interactive governing. Like some collective \n     psychoanalysis on living room couches across the nation, \n     Americans are being probed and prodded as never before. But \n     you can't legislate by the numbers. From the field of war to \n     the football field, no general or quarterback has led by \n     following the combined opinions of the troops or the tight-\n     ends.\n       Pollsters argue that polls are valuable market assessment \n     tools, a means to focus policy and message on voters' \n     concerns. Even the Founders acknowledged that candidates who \n     depend on the suffrage of their fellow citizens for election \n     should be informed of those citizens' ``dispositions and \n     inclinations and should be willing to allow them their proper \n     degree of influence.'' But polling in 1994 has gone beyond an \n     ancillary tool for governing or campaigning. Rather than a \n     point of departure for sensitive and thoughtful leaders, \n     polls have\n      become a point of no return that overshadows the imperative \n     for leadership. As James MacGregor Burns wrote in his \n     classic text on leadership, ``the transforming leader taps \n     the needs and raises the aspirations and helps shape the \n     values--and hence mobilizes the potential--of followers.'' \n     To be transforming leaders, today's politicians cannot \n     afford to drift, absent the anchor of ideals, in a sea of \n     percentage points.\n       Two hundred years ago, the Federalist papers expressed our \n     belief as a nation that ``the public voice pronounced by the \n     representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the \n     public good, than if pronounced by the people themselves.'' \n     Measuring and articulating substantive discontent should \n     serve the purpose of keeping elected representatives' debate \n     and decisions in tune with their constituency, not in \n     automatonic lock-step. Pollster Celinda Lake reads the \n     electorate as wanting to raise the pitch of technologically \n     steered democracy so that citizens could directly bestow \n     their opinion on major legislative issues. In that case, \n     perhaps we should give up on our founding ideal of a republic \n     and elect the pollsters directly.\n       Representative democracy is our greatest national heritage \n     and gives us our greatest national challenge. We seek leaders \n     who will listen and interpret sometimes incoherent, sometimes \n     inchoate messages into policies greater than the sum of our \n     collective consciousness. Political leaders who will \n     transform this country, rather than be transfixed by shifting \n     techno-derived edicts, must lead and govern from the center \n     of their own hearts and minds. No poll has yet been devised \n     that can substitute.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2428-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              EDUCATION CHIEF DECLARES WAR ON TV VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the problem of television violence, \nwhich I have addressed on a number of occasions in committee and on the \nfloor of the Senate, has recently been addressed by a group of \npsychiatrists and other social leaders in Great Britain, where the \nstandards are appreciably tighter than ours. And in reading the \nJerusalem Post the other day, I came across an article titled, \n``Education chief declares war on TV violence.''\n  The reaction in Israel to too much violence on the television screen \nis like ours and the British reaction.\n  At this point, I ask that the Jerusalem Post article be printed in \nthe Record. The article follows:\n\n              Education Chief Declares War on TV Violence\n\n                           (By Liat Collins)\n\n       Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein last week declared war \n     on TV violence, telling the Knesset that if networks do not \n     demonstrate self restraint in screening movies, he would \n     submit a bill to the cabinet.\n       Rubinstein's statements came at the end of a discussion on \n     the distribution of ``snuff'' and violent movies in Israel. \n     ``Snuff movies'' document the deliberate torture and murder \n     of a victim for ``entertainment.''\n       ``This type of film goes beyond all acceptable moral \n     boundaries; we're talking about an evil and sick phenomenon. \n     Therefore we must enforce the existing laws, and if need be I \n     will equip myself with extra penal measures,'' Rubinstein \n     said.\n       ``Freedom of expression and civil liberties do not stretch \n     to filmed murders and violence as entertainment,'' he added.\n       The discussion was initiated by MKs Anat Maor (Meretz), \n     David Mena (Likud), Elie Goldschmidt (Labor) and Shlomo \n     Benizri (Shas), who filed motions for the agenda following an \n     interview in Yediot Aharonot with two youths who collect and \n     view these films.\n       The two adolescents laconically describe how victims have \n     been disembowelled and dismembered alive. One noted that one \n     of the two teenaged killers of taxi driver Derek Roth had \n     seen such movies. He also said he regretted not being awake \n     in time to see the screened footage of the Dizengoff bus \n     bomb.\n       While condemning the movies, Rubinstein warned of trying to \n     turn two adolescents into representatives of an entire \n     generation.\n       Benizri, on the other hand, called the phenomenon ``the \n     result of a sick society.'' All the MKs spoke of the need for \n     police cooperation in rooting out the films, and called for \n     strict punitive measures against both distributors and \n     viewers of these movies.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2428-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2428-S2430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            P.S./WASHINGTON\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, for more than 40 years, since I was \na young newspaperman in suburban St. Louis, I have written a weekly \nnewspaper column on the topics of the day.\n  I hope my colleagues will find the newspaper columns I wrote in \nJanuary of interest, so I ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The columns follow:\n\n                    The Value of the Carter Missions\n\n       There has been some editorial sniping--as well as criticism \n     from political leaders, most of it not in public statements--\n     about former President Jimmy Carter's efforts in North Korea, \n     Haiti and Bosnia.\n       ``We can have only one person making foreign policy for the \n     United States--and that should be the President, is the \n     argument.\n       What these nay-sayers miss is the reality that Jimmy Carter \n     does not make any pretense of speaking for the United States. \n     If he were to travel abroad and claim to speak for the \n     President when he has no authorization to do so, that would \n     be wrong.\n       In the case of Haiti, he went on the mission at the request \n     of the President.\n       But Jimmy Carter is a person of international stature who \n     can do more to bring people together than any person other \n     than Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali of the United \n     Nations.\n       Carter is regarded as well-motivated and not trying to \n     promote any private agenda or any national agenda other than \n     helping to bring about a world of peace and stability.\n       When he has gone at the request of other nations to be an \n     observer of elections, where countries are moving to \n     democracy, there has been no criticism.\n       When he helps bring the two sides of a civil war together \n     in Liberia in Africa, no one pays any attention.\n       At the Carter Center in Atlanta, he gets people from \n     various nations together to discuss frictions and hopes, and \n     there is hardly a paragraph in any newspaper about it.\n       But when he moves onto a more\n        visible problem, then the critics emerge.\n       Part of this is because foreign policy has not been a \n     strong suit of President Clinton. He is better at foreign \n     affairs than he was a year ago and a year from now he will be \n     still better.\n       It is difficult to move from being Governor of Arkansas to \n     overnight being the most influential person in the world on \n     foreign policy.\n       Because of a partial foreign policy vacuum in the current \n     administration, some believe that the visibility of a former \n     President doing creative things causes Clinton political \n     embarrassment.\n       My strong belief is that President Clinton should continue \n     to welcome Jimmy Carter's leadership, as he does that of the \n     United Nations Secretary General, but simply make clear that \n     ordinarily Jimmy Carter is acting on his own, not speaking \n     for the United States.\n       [[Page S2429]] Whether the former President's activities in \n     Bosina will produce long-term gains is still unclear. But \n     they have done no harm, and may do great good.\n       In North Korea and Haiti there is no question of the \n     significant contribution of Jimmy Carter.\n       With the possible exception of John Quincy Adams, no former \n     President has served as effectively as has Jimmy Carter. I \n     would also give high marks for post-president leadership to \n     Thomas Jefferson and Herbert Hoover--Jefferson largely \n     through correspondence and Hoover in a variety of public \n     endeavors.\n       My hope is that Jimmy Carter will ignore the critics and \n     continue to serve the cause of world peace.\n       We are indebted to him.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               Inching Toward a Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       The nation is inching toward having a balanced budget \n     amendment to the U.S.Constitution, and that is good news for \n     the generations to come.\n       We have been living on a huge credit card and when the time \n     comes to pay for it, we say blithely: ``Send the bill to our \n     children and grandchildren.'' It is morally indefensible.\n       Both political parties share the blame.\n       For 26 years in a row we have been spending more than we \n     take in, and we are already paying for it. A New York Federal \n     Reserve Bank study shows that between 1978 and 1988 the \n     deficit cost us 5 percent of our national income. The \n     Congressional Budget Office suggests that the loss of 1 \n     percent of our national income means the loss of 600,000 \n     jobs.\n       The deficit has eaten away at our savings, sending interest \n     rates up, reducting our productive capacity because it makes \n     investment too expensive, ultimately reducing the growth of \n     our national income. As late as 1986, the average \n     manufacturing wage per hour was higher in the United States \n     than any other nation. Now 13 nations have exceeded us.\n       Studies indicate that between 37 percent and 55 percent of \n     our trade deficit has been caused by the budget deficit. That \n     means that the single biggest cause of sending our jobs \n     overseas has been the budget deficit, but the issue is \n     complicated enough that it is not generally understood.\n       The General Accounting Office in 1992 reported that if we \n     continue on the course of deficit spending we would have a \n     gradual decline or stalemate in our standard of living, but \n     if by the year 2001 we would balanced the budget, by the year \n     2020 the average American would have an increased income of \n     36 percent.\n       Worst of all, the history of nations is that if we continue \n     piling up debt, eventually we will do what\n      the economist call ``monetizing the debt.'' That means that \n     to ``solve'' our problem we will start printing more and \n     more money and our dollars would be less and less \n     valuable. Among other things, that would devastate all \n     private savings as well as things like Social Security.\n       On top of all that, more and more of our debt is owed to \n     other nations. We now owe more than $800 billion to people \n     outside the United States and that makes our international \n     situation somewhat precarious. The greater our debt, the less \n     independent we can be. It's true of a family; it's true of a \n     country.\n       It now looks like the proposal, narrowly defeated in the \n     past, will pass. It has been advocated by many people over \n     the years, the first being Thomas Jefferson.\n       It will include a provision that if there is a 60 percent \n     vote of the House and Senate, we can have a deficit, for \n     there are years in a recession or war when it may be \n     necessary.\n       Today interest spending by the federal government is \n     ballooning, squeezing out our ability to respond to great \n     needs. In 1949 we devoted 9 percent of the federal budget to \n     education; today it is 2 percent. In 1950 we were paying \n     interest on the debt of World War II and we spent $5.8 \n     billion. This year we will spend more than $300 billion.\n       To their credit, President Clinton and a bare majority in \n     Congress reduced the deficit in 1993, but that was only the \n     first step needed.\n       If we adopt the balanced budget amendment and it is \n     approved by 38 state legislatures, we will all have to \n     sacrifice a little.\n       But I face a choice of sacrificing a little, or harming the \n     future of my three grandchildren. I don't have a difficult \n     time making that choice, and I don't believe most Americans \n     do.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     Cultural Chasms That Divide Us\n\n       Madeleine Doubek, political editor of the Daily Herald, the \n     widely circulated newspaper based in the northern and western \n     Chicago suburbs, noted that at a recent news conference I \n     answered a reporter's question by saying: ``We have to reach \n     . . . across the borders of race and religion and ethnic \n     background and economic barriers. We have to communicate to \n     people in the suburbs that they have something at stake in \n     the fate of those who are less fortunate in our society.''\n       She called me and asked whether that implied racism and \n     classism in the suburbs, and I responded that it did.\n       I do suggest that those evils are a monopoly of the \n     suburbs. Prejudice rears its ugly head in the central cities, \n     and in the rural areas, as well as in the suburbs.\n       But there has been a flight from the problems of the \n     cities, a flight to better schools and less crime. Sometimes \n     those two understandable causes have also been confused with \n     flight from African Americans and Latinos.\n       But whatever the cause, the result is a growing gulf \n     between urban America and suburban America, and that's not \n     good for anyone. We don't want this nation to develop into a \n     Bosnia or Northern Ireland. The harm that comes from the \n     deepening divisions in our society should be obvious.\n       What can we do about it? More specifically, what can \n     suburbanites and all of us do about it? Let me suggest a few \n     things:\n       (1) Religious institutions play a powerful role in American \n     life. Ask the question at the appropriate meeting, or to the \n     right people, what your church or temple is doing to bring \n     greater understanding across the barriers that divide us. I \n     would be interested in hearing of specific\n      actions that are planned or are being taken.\n       (2) Rotary Clubs, business and professional women's groups, \n     teachers' associations and other civic and business-related \n     groups can sponsor programs that help to create greater \n     sensitivity. The myths that are believed about another race \n     or religion or ethnic group often can be demolished in this \n     type of setting. When business and professional people \n     understand that it is good economics not to discriminate, \n     everyone wins.\n       (3) Individuals can make sure that their children are \n     exposed to people of differing cultural backgrounds in a \n     positive way. Too few white families have ever had an African \n     American or Latino or Asian American family to their homes \n     for dinner. Too few African American families have ever had a \n     white family to their home for dinner. The same can be said \n     across too many ethnic and religious barriers. What seems \n     like a small thing for your family to do can be immensely \n     important for the future of your children, and the future of \n     your community and our nation and our world.\n       I spoke at three events honoring Martin Luther King Jr.'s \n     birthday this year, and what disturbed me about two of them \n     is that I spoke only to African Americans.\n       Dr. King wanted us to reach out to one another, understand \n     one another, and replace hatred and prejudice with love and \n     understanding.\n       That message is needed in the suburbs, but also in our \n     cities and rural areas.\n       ``One nation, indivisible'' we recite when we say the \n     pledge of allegiance to our flag.\n       Do we mean it? Are we willing to do concrete things to make \n     it a reality?\n                                                                    ____\n\n               Religious Zealotry Can Turn Good Into Evil\n\n       There is much that is good about people who have religious \n     beliefs and practice their religion, however imperfectly we \n     all do it. But religion can be abused when people are too \n     zealous--and can be abused when there is a shell of religion \n     that translates into hostility to others.\n       Almost all religions, if not all, suggest that we should be \n     concerned about those less fortunate. According to a poll \n     conducted for the Center for the Study of American Religion \n     at Princeton University, those who attend religious services \n     weekly in the United States are significantly more likely to \n     think seriously about their responsibilities to the poor.\n       Many other examples of the good that religious belief \n     provides our society should be given.\n       But when people are so zealous that they kill people at \n     abortion clinics, or try to impose their beliefs on others, \n     then what is good can become an evil. Many of the most bloody \n     wars have been conducted in the name of religion, usually \n     simply used as a tool by ambitious rulers, but sometimes out \n     of genuine belief by the leaders.\n       There is also the problem where faith has almost diminished \n     to nothing, except hostility to others who do not share the \n     same religious heritage.\n       My impression is that most of those involved in the \n     violence of the Protestant-Catholic struggle in Northern \n     Ireland are not necessarily people of deep religious \n     commitment, but people who have grown up with one heritage \n     and have learned to hate the other side.\n       During my years in the Army I was stationed in Germany, and \n     I remember the young German who told me with great pride that \n     no one in his family had married a Roman Catholic for over a \n     century. I asked what church he attended, and he told me that \n     while he was proud of being a Protestant, he didn't attend \n     any church.\n       But he had learned to hate.\n       Hitler had only nominal Christian ties. He believed little, \n     and practiced nothing in the way of religion, but his \n     religious heritage somehow left him with a hatred of Jews.\n       In Bosnia, nations with strong Orthodox ties are generally \n     much more sympathetic to the Serbian cause than other \n     nations, not for genuine religious reasons but for heritage \n     reasons. Serbia is largely Orthodox Christian.\n       Muslim countries believe that the reason Europeans and \n     Americans have not responded more to the plight of the \n     Bosnian Muslims is precisely because they are Muslims. I do \n     not believe that is true for the United States, but \n     unfortunately it contains some truth for the more tradition-\n     bound European nations, even though the actual practice of \n     religion is much less evident in Western Europe than in the \n     United States. The \n     [[Page S2430]]  empty shell of Christianity too often only \n     has hostility toward non-Christians.\n       One of several good things about what we did in Somalia \n     (incorrectly labeled a disaster by those who look at it \n     superficially), in addition to preventing starvation by \n     hundreds of thousands of people, is that a nation labeled by \n     the world as Christian/Jewish, the United States, came to the \n     rescue of a people almost totally Muslim. How would we have \n     looked if the world's most powerful nation had done nothing \n     about massive starvation in a desperate country! But many \n     Muslim nations were permanently surprised that we responded.\n       The lesson of history is that the genuine practice of \n     religion is wholesome, good for the individual and good for a \n     community and nation. But extreme caution is in order when \n     leaders try to impose their beliefs on others through \n     government.\n       And the ``stop'' sign should go up when political leaders \n     who share a heritage call on others to hate or kill those who \n     do not share the same faith.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2428-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF DR.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about two \nimportant issues facing the Senate. The first is the nomination of Dr. \nHenry Foster, to be Surgeon General of the United States, and the \nsecond is the continuing impasse over the baseball strike.\n  With respect to the Foster nomination, Dr. Henry Foster has had an \nextraordinary, distinguished career in medicine and public health. And \nI believe that the forthcoming hearings on his nomination will \ndemonstrate that he is well qualified to be Surgeon General.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to make three brief points. \nFirst, and most important at this stage of the debate, I reject the \nview that Dr. Foster's participation in abortions should disqualify him \nfrom this high position. Abortion is not a numbers game. It is a legal \nmedical procedure and a constitutionally protected right.\n  Second, the American Medical Association enthusiastically supports \nDr. Foster's nomination because of his distinguished service as Dean of \nMeharry Medical College, his record of achievement in medical research, \nhis impressive leadership on issues such as preventive health care for \nwomen and children, for reducing infant mortality and teenage pregnancy \nand fighting drug abuse.\n  Third, Dr. Foster has had and deserves to continue to have strong \nbipartisan support. As recently as 1991, he was honored by President \nBush as one of the President's Thousand Points of Light for his \ninnovative I Have A Future Program to reduce teenage pregnancy. I look \nforward to the consideration of Dr. Foster's nomination by the Senate \nLabor Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2430-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2430-S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BINDING ARBITRATION TO SETTLE BASEBALL STRIKE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced legislation \nproposed by President Clinton to require the major league baseball \nplayers and owners to submit to binding arbitration to settle the \nbaseball strike.\n  Generally, Congress is reluctant to inject itself in labor disputes. \nAll of us hope that the parties will find a way to end the impasse and \nsettle their differences voluntarily. But there are rare instances in \nwhich Congress has a role to play in settling such disputes, and this \nmay well be one of those times.\n  There is no doubt that Congress' constitutional authority to regulate \ninterstate commerce gives us the power to enact legislation to settle \nthis dispute. Many aspects of major league baseball affect commerce \nbetween the States. The strike has caused significant disruptions, \nespecially in the cities where the 28 major league teams play and is \nabout to cause significant additional disruption in Florida and Arizona \nwhere spring training is supposed to begin next week.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors estimates that the major league cities \nlost an average of $1.16 million per home game and 1,250 full- and \npart-time jobs because of the strike in 1994. Hard-pressed cities with \nsubstantial investments of tax dollars in municipal stadiums are losing \nsubstantial revenues. The cancellation of the 1994 league playoffs and \nthe World Series was especially damaging to whichever cities would have \nhosted the playoff games and the World Series.\n  Obviously, Congress does not intervene in every labor dispute that \nburdens interstate commerce, but baseball is different and unique. It \nis more than a nationwide industry. It is our national sport. Baseball \nis part of American life.\n  We in Congress as representatives of fans throughout the country \nshould not remain silent while baseball is damaged by a strike that the \nowners and players seem unable to resolve themselves. Clearly, Congress \nhas the power to act. The question is who speaks for Red Sox and \nmillions of other fans across America. At this stage in the deadlock, \nif Congress does not speak for them, it may well be that no one will.\n  For all these reasons, Congress can act and should be prepared to \nact. Legislation to end the strike would not set a precedent for \ninjecting Congress into other labor disputes. There is still time for \nthe owners and players to resolve this dispute on their own or to act \nvoluntarily to establish a safety mechanism for doing so. The players \nunion is willing to agree to voluntary binding arbitration. It is hard \nto see why the owners are not willing to do so as well.

Mr. President, I am very concerned about the situation in \nCroatia, where the Krajina Serbs have refused to consider an \ninternational peace plan for the country, and where President Tudjman \nhas indicated that he will ask UNPROFOR troops to leave when their \nmandate expires in March. Last weekend in Munich, Bosnian Croats and \nMoslems, with the support of the Croatian Government, agreed to bolster \ntheir federation agreement. This good news is overshadowed, however, by \ndangerous developments in the Croatian peace process.\n  Last week, Serbian nationalists who control one-third of Croatia \ndeclined to consider a plan to resolve the status of Croatia's U.N.-\nprotected area [UNPA's] prompting fears of a renewed Croatian war. The \nplan was developed by the Zagreb Four--or Z-4--consisting of the United \nStates, Russia, the United Nations, and the European Union. It ought to \nhave been the last step in an otherwise successful process to reduce \ntensions and normalize relations between Croatia and the Serbs living \nin the UNPA's.\n  I would particularly like to commend our Ambassador to Croatia, Peter \nGalbraith, the United States representative to the Z-4 process--who was \na senior staff member with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations \nduring my tenure as chairman--for his efforts in this regard. A Z-4-\nnegotiated ceasefire is in place, and the parties have agreed to \nconfidence-building measures that include opening transportation and \ncommunications links between Croatia and the U.N. zones. These are \nimportant gains which I hope will not be lost by last week's setback \nwith regard to a political settlement.\n  By all accounts, the Z-4 plan goes a long way to address the concerns \nof both the Croatian Government and the Krajina Serbs. It calls for the \nrestoration of Croatian sovereignty to all the U.N areas, with \nconsiderable autonomy for the local Serbian population.\n  As I said, the Krajina Serbs have not even deigned to look at the \nplan; the Croatian Government has not yet responded to it. President \nFranjo Tudjman's decision not to renew the mandate for UNPROFOR, the \n15,000-troop U.N. force in Croatia, has dangerous repercussions for the \nZ-4 process. The threat of withdrawal has provided a convenient, though \nunacceptable excuse for the Serbs to ignore the peace process.\n  To my mind, it would be a grave mistake for UNPROFOR to withdraw at \nthis time. Frankly, I am concerned that the U.N. withdrawal will \nprecipitate renewed fighting between the Serbs living in Croatia and \nthe Croatian Government, and indeed, even between Serbia and Croatia. \nWhile the United Nations does not have a flawless record in Croatia, \nUNPROFOR's presence since early 1992 has prevented the reemergence of \nfull-scale war. Without UNPROFOR to patrol the demilitarized zones, the \ncurrent ceasefire negotiated by the Z-4 is likely to collapse. \nUNPROFOR's withdrawal could very well offer an opportunity for the \nSerbs to attack, and Croatia's intentions regarding Serb-controlled \nareas in the wake of a U.N. withdrawal are unclear.\n  A new war in Croatia, by all estimates would make the horror in \nBosnia pale in comparison. Mr. President, I hope the parties to the \nconflict wake up; see the treacherous path on which they are headed; \ncall off the U.N. withdrawal; and seriously consider the Z-4 peace \nplan.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2431-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BUTTE, MONTANA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is my third statement this week on \nwhy Micron Technologies should come to Butte, MT.\n  I would like to talk this evening about a topic that is very dear to \nmy heart; that is, fishing in the great State of Montana.\n  The first line in Norman Maclean's famous book ``A River Runs Through \nIt'' reads: ``In our family, there was no clear line between religion \nand fly fishing.''\n  Our friend and former colleague Jack Danforth has always told me that \nhe thought that was the most beautiful sentence in the English \nlanguage. We all know that Senator Danforth is an ordained minister. \nBut what many may not know is that he is also an avid fly fisherman.\n  And any avid fly fisherman knows that fishing in Montana's blue \nribbon streams is something close to a religious experience. It is one \nof the things about Montana that makes it a truly special place to \nlive.\n  Moreover, any successful business looking to relocate or expand puts \na high quality of life at the top of their list.\n  Micron, being a successful company, wants its employees to be as \nproductive as possible. And the best way to be productive in your job \nis to have a good quality of life.\n  For many Montanans, quality of life is measured by how many days they \ncan fish. And the Butte area is right in the middle of some of the best \ntrout fishing in the world. Rivers like the Big Hole, Ruby, Beaverhead, \nMissouri, and the Clark Fork are on any serious fisherman's wish list, \nand Butte is only an hour or so away from each of these rivers.\n  George Grant, a renowned fly-tier and lifelong resident of Butte, \nonce wrote:\n       In the nine great trout States of the Western United States \n     it would be difficult to find a single stream that exceeds \n     the overall quality of the Big Hole River. The Big Hole rises \n     at high altitude and flows clear and cold through wide \n     valleys and narrow canyons seldom presenting similar water or \n     scenery throughout its entire 150 fascinating miles.\n\n  Having spent a little time on the Big Hole myself, I have got to \nagree.\n  Finally, the folks at Micron are used to the language of the \nsemiconductor industry--words like D-RAMs, C-MOS, kilobits, dice, and \nE-PROM's.\n  Well, Montana fisherman have their own language. We talk about pupas, \nnymphs, emergers, and mayflies. We tell stories--and sometimes they are \neven true--about rainbows, browns and cutthroat hitting on PMD's, san \njuan worms, wooly buggers, and Joe's Hoppers.\n  Fortunately, the folks at Micron should not feel too intimidated. \nThere are plenty of guides, fly shops and friendly locals in Butte who \nwill help translate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2431-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n                REMEMBERING SENATOR J. WILLIAM FULBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the United States lost a great and \ndistinguished citizen today with the death of former Senator J. William \nFulbright.\n  Senator Fulbright was a giant in the Senate. He became a person of \ninternational reknown and reputation during the period of his \nchairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Relations from 1959 until his \ndefeat in 1974. I came to know him very will after I joined the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations in 1969 and came to admire very much his \ncareful and thorough approach to issues of tremendous national \nimportance, most especially the war in Vietnam.\n  William Fulbright was born in Missouri and grew up in Fayetteville, \nAR. He attended pubic schools, graduated from the University of \nArkansas in 1925, as a Rhodes Scholar from Oxford University England in \n1928, and from the Law Department of George Washington University in \n1934. In 1939 he became president of the University of Arkansas--the \nyoungest in its history. He served one term in the House of \nRepresentatives from 1943-1945 and went on to election to the Senate in \n1944. He was reelected in 1950, 1956, 1962, and 1968.\n  William Fulbright brought to his political career a great love and \nunderstanding of the responsibilities of an educator. His experience as \na Rhodes Scholar taught him the value of international exchanges and \nled him to conceive of the Fulbright Scholars Program in the period \nimmediately following World War II, which he described as ``a modest \nprogram with an immodest aim.'' Since the program's establishment in \n1946, more than 100,000 people from abroad have studied in the United \nStates and more than 65,000 U.S. students and professors have studied \noverseas in what is undoubtedly the largest and most successful \ninternational exchange program in existence.\n  Earlier, as a freshman member of the U.S. House of Representatives, \nSenator Fulbright offered a resolution setting forth U.S. support for \nan international peacekeeping organization. This resolution, the first \nto be passed by the U.S. Congress since the League of Nations debacle \nfollowing World War I, set the stage for establishment of the United \nNations in 1945.\n  He was a maverick during much of his time in the Senate and was known \nfor taking positions he believed in regardless of their level of \npopularity. For instance, in 1954, he cast the single Senate vote \nagainst funding Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's investigative \nsubcommittee.\n  Senator Fulbright's period of greatest prominence was that of the \nVietnam war. He introduced the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which gave \nPresident Johnson virtually free rein in the early stages of the \nVietnam war. Only two Senators opposed the resolution and Senator \nFulbright later made it clear he wished it had been three, including \nhimself. ``Not that it would have made the slightest difference in the \ncourse of affairs, but I'd feel better about myself.''\n  Senator Fulbright was one of the earliest critics of the war. Under \nhis stewardship the Committee on Foreign Relations conducted extensive \ninvestigations of involvement in Vietnam, held numerous hearings and \nwas the fountainhead of legislative initiatives beginning in 1969 to \nrestrict United States activities in Vietnam. In 1973, a Fulbright-\nAiken amendment stopped direct involvement of United States combat \nforces in Vietnam.\n  Through the committee's intensive work on the war, Senator Fulbright \ntried steadfastly to educate his colleagues, the Senate, the Congress, \nand the public as to the tremendous folly of the Vietnam involvement.\n  I can well remember watching Senator Fulbright facing down hostile \nwitnesses while chairing hearings of great thoroughness and steadily \nand calmly posing questions until the truth of various problems was \nthere for all to behold.\n  His widow, Harriett, recalled that the Senator deeply believed ``that \nin order to ensure prosperity for all members of a free country, those \nwho live in a democracy must be educated,'' In fact, education ran \nthrough the heart of whatever he said and did. His speeches he wrote \nhimself on yellow pads in pencil, full of lines through any fuzzy \nphrase. He worked them over until he was satisfied that every sentence \nwas not only perfectly understandable but devoid of hyperbole. They \nwere meant to clarify and persuade; in other words to educate--to \neducate audiences around the world as well as constituents.\n  One of the finest writers in the history of the Washington Post, the \nlate Henry Mitchell, wrote a profile of William Fulbright in 1984. He \npointed out that, despite Senator Fulbright's concerns over the \narrogance of power:\n\n       He does not say a nation can forget self-respect in the \n     world or allow its citizens to be run over roughshod by \n     others.\n       ``But dignity has nothing to do with domination, nor is \n     self-respect the same thing as arrogance. A nation can take \n     pride in its accomplishments without taking on a missionary \n     role in the world. . .\n       ``Which is the greater legacy any generation of leaders can \n     bequeath, a temporary primacy consisting of the ability to \n     push other people around, or a well-run society of cities \n     without violence of slums, of productive farms and of \n     education and opportunity for all citizens?''\n       To ask it is to answer it.\n\n  Mr. President, the Vietnam war made the Nation very much aware of the \nefforts of William Fulbright and of the Committee on Foreign Relations. \nTo many in official Washington, he was anathema. But to others who saw \nVietnam as a quagmire he was simply a hero. A leader who gave \nlegitimacy, respectability and honor to opposition to the war and what \nit was doing to the United States. At the time there were many who were \nquite disdainful of William Fulbright and who disliked him intensely. I \nremember well how he would sometimes conclude that his sponsorship of a \nmeasure would cost votes rather than gain them. This was a price that \nhe felt he had to pay.\n  In 1993 Senator Fulbright's fellow Arkansan, President Clinton, \nawarded the Medal of Freedom to the Senator. President Clinton said at \nthat time ``Senator Fulbright has long been known as a patriot and a \nrealist. He has never been one to waste time and energy cursing the \ndarkness; he is far too busy seeking and finding lamps to be lit.''\n  William Fulbright has been gone from this body for over 20 years. The \ncontroversy surrounding him as certainly abated and many more have come \nto appreciate the intelligence and care he brought to his assessment of \npublic issues. His reputation has grown over the past two decades \nrather than dwindled. And his term as chairman of the Committee on \nForeign Relations is now regarded as a halcyon period for the committee \nand the Senate.\n  There were many challenges to be faced in the period of his \nchairmanship and he did not shirk from taking those challenges on and \ndoing his best to meet them. His central interest was never personal \naggrandizement but rather the discovery of the best way for the Nation \nto proceed. He is gone now but his legacy is powerful and he will live \non as Fulbright Scholars are trained and educated and return to their \ncountries and to the United States better able to play meaningful and \nproductive roles.\n  Our deepest sympathy goes to his widow, Harriett and his family.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/09/senate-section/article/S2432-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2432-S2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     MEASURE TO BE HELD AT THE DESK\n\n  Mr. HELMS.
