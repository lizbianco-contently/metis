Mr. President, in the absence of other Senators in the \nChamber to debate the motion to proceed, and I know my colleagues will \nbe arriving shortly, I think it appropriate to take a few minutes to \ncomment on a historic ceremony which will take place at the White House \nat 12 noon today when the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization are scheduled to sign a historic agreement.\n  I well recall the day, a little over 2 years ago, 2 years and 15 days \nago, on September 13, 1993, when Prime Minister Rabin and PLO Chairman \nYasser Arafat signed the initial agreement.\n  I must say that was a difficult day for me personally to watch Yasser \nArafat honored at the White House after the long record of terrorism in \nwhich the PLO had engaged, including being implicated in the murder of \nthe charge d'affaires at the United States embassy in the Sudan in \n1974, the No. 2 United States official in that country, the hijacking \nof the Achille Lauro and the death of Mr. Klinghoffer, and many other \nacts of terrorism.\n  It seemed to me, as I think it did to most other Americans, that if \nIsrael--the prime victim of the terrorist attacks by the PLO--through \nits leaders, Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres, were \nwilling to shake hands with Yasser Arafat under those circumstances, \nthat the United States should do what it could to facilitate the peace \nprocess. That is in deference to the leaders of that sovereign state.\n  I also recall when a letter was circulated on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate criticizing then Prime Minister Shamir for refusing to give land \nfor peace. I was one who refused to sign that document on the \nproposition that U.S. Senators thousands of miles away from turmoil \nought not to try to influence, let alone dictate, policies to the \nleaders of other sovereign states under those circumstances.\n  Now, after very protracted negotiations, we have Prime Minister Rabin \nand Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat coming to the White \nHouse today to sign this historic agreement.\n  During the course of the past several weeks, Senator Hank Brown of \nColorado and I have had occasion to travel, including a trip to the \nMideast to talk to the leaders of the nations there. After being there, \nMr. President, I have a sense of guarded optimism about the future of \npeace in the Mideast.\n  I have traveled into that region extensively, going back to my first \ntrip there in 1964. I do have very substantial reservations as to the \nadequacy of the PLO, the Palestinian response, and the response of \nYasser Arafat to eliminate terrorism in the area.\n  Last year, Senator Shelby and I introduced an amendment to the \nforeign operations bill which would have cut off United States aid if \nthe PLO and Chairman Arafat did not take steps to curtail terrorism, \nand also to amend the PLO charter to eliminate the provisions which \ncalled for the destruction of Israel.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I am not satisfied with what Chairman Arafat \nhas done in either regard.\n  There has been the explanation, really an excuse, that they could not \namend the charter because there was not a convening Palestinian \nauthority at that time. Also, Chairman Arafat has said that he has \ntaken certain action to declare those provisions null and void, but I \nthink realistically much more could have been done.\n  Similarly, on the critical issue of stopping terrorism, I think a \ngreat deal more could have been done by Chairman Arafat on that \nimportant aspect.\n  Senator Brown and I had an opportunity to meet with Chairman Arafat, \nand we asked him those questions very directly. We asked him why he did \nnot do more to control Hamas, why he did not turn over individuals in \nthe Palestinian group who were suspected of murder. \n\n[[Page S 14434]]\n\n  When we went over a detailed list, for each one there was an \nexplanation, really an excuse. Some of the acts of terrorism or murder \noccurred before the agreement was signed; in other cases, the \nappropriate Israeli officials had not filed the cases; in other cases, \nthe papers were not precise.\n  We challenged Chairman Arafat on why he made speeches condemning \nterrorism in English and not in Arabic, and although it is plain he has \nmade the speeches in English and not in Arabic, he said his English was \nnot good and made the contention that he had, in fact, made the \nspeeches in Arabic. He continues to make speeches which poison the \natmosphere in which both parties seek a peaceful resolution to the \nconflict.\n  When pressed as to why he did not do more to control Hamas, he made \nan explanation that he himself was under threat of assassination from \nthe Hamas who are in part directed from Syria.\n  Later in the conversation we discussed the Syrian Government and \nPresident Assad of Syria. Chairman Arafat said President Assad was a \ngood friend of his, which led to the inevitable question: How could \nthreats of terror and assassination come from the Hamas in Syria, when \nPresident Assad was a good friend? And Chairman Arafat, in an effort to \nsmile, said, ``Well, that's his style,'' confirming the great \ndifficulties which are present in the Mideast.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make some additional comments about \nthe historic meeting which is scheduled in less than an hour at the \nWhite House where a very significant agreement will be signed between \nthe State of Israel and the Palestinians, the PLO.\n  I had commented earlier about a trip which Senator Brown and I had \nmade recently, including a stop in the Mideast. I have been a student \nof the issues there for many years, having made my first trip there in \n1964, and in the last almost 15 years I have been a member of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations and have done \nconsiderable work there and am cautiously optimistic about the \nprospects for peace in the Mideast.\n  It is a matter of grave concern, however, to note the continuous, \nhorrible terrorist attacks on Israel which have been maintained, \nnotwithstanding efforts of the Israeli Government to stop them and the \npressure which the United States Government has tried to apply to \nChairman Yasser Arafat and the PLO to contain those terrorist attacks.\n  Last year, Senator Shelby and I offered an amendment, which was \nadopted, which conditioned United States aid to the Palestinians on the \nPLO making every conceivable effort to stop the terrorist attacks and \nalso for the PLO to take out the language from the PLO charter calling \nfor the destruction of Israel.\n  I considered renewing that kind of an issue in the legislation which \nwas recently passed in the foreign aid bill and decided not to press \nthe matter at this time when the negotiations were so sensitive and so \nnear agreement. But it is with considerable reservation that I see U.S. \naid going forward. There are conditions that exist in law which call \nupon Chairman Arafat and the PLO to do their utmost to stop terrorist \nattacks. Nobody can ask them to be a guarantor or with absolute \ncertainty to stop those terrorist attacks, but it is an issue as to \nwhether they are making their maximum effort.\n  Frankly, I have doubts about this. To reiterate my earlier remarks, \nwhen Senator Brown and I were in Israel, we visited with Chairman \nArafat in the Gaza and asked him a number of very direct, pointed \nquestions.\n  First, on the subject as to why he spoke in English and not in Arabic \nwhen he was denouncing terrorism. Chairman Arafat denied that he always \nspoke in English and said that his English was not good and said that \nhe had spoken in Arabic. We then challenged him on a number of alleged \nmurderers who were being protected by the PLO, as to why they were not \nturned over to Israel.\n  Chairman Arafat then deferred to one of his subordinates who raised \none explanation, really, one excuse after another saying that some of \nthe incidents had occurred prior to the time the agreement was signed \nand some the Israeli Government had not made the proper demands, the \nproper papers were not filed.\n  But it seems to me, Mr. President, that Chairman Arafat could do a \ngreat deal more than he is doing at the present time to restrain \nterrorism. I believe that the U.S. Congress, certainly the executive \nbranch but also the Congress, must be alert on this very, very \nimportant issue.\n  On the issue about pressing Chairman Arafat about stopping terrorism \nfor the Hamas, Chairman Arafat responded the Hamas had even threatened \nhis life coming out of Syria or coming out of Iran. He later said that \nPresident Assad was a good friend, which led to the obvious question \nabout how a good friend would be tolerating the Hamas which made \nthreats on Arafat's life. Arafat said, well, that is President Assad, \nhardly an understandable explanation.\n  Also as part of our trip, Senator Brown and I visited other \ncountries, and wherever we went, we were struck with the greatest \nrespect and admiration that the United States has held all around the \nworld. There is enormous prestige, there is enormous power, there is \nenormous good will for the United States to be an intermediary and a \nbroker for peace.\n  When Senator Brown and I were in India, for example, we talked to \nPrime Minister Rao, who said that he would like to see the subcontinent \nnuclear free in the next 10 to 15 years.\n  The next day, I talked to President Benazir Bhutto and told her of \nthe Indian Prime Minister's statement. She said, ``Do you have it in \nwriting?'' She was very surprised.\n  We then wrote to the President telling him of our conversations and \nsuggesting that he take the initiative to try to broker a peace between \nthose two nations, where there is such enormous hostility.\n  I compliment President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher for \ntheir leadership, which has been instrumental in bringing about the \nagreement which is scheduled to be signed within the hour at the White \nHouse and for their efforts and success in the agreement which was \nsigned back on September 13, 1993. And I do believe that an activist \nPresident, who really exerted leadership on a worldwide basis, could do \na great deal around the world, as, for example, in bringing the Prime \nMinisters of India and Pakistan together.\n  I see that my distinguished colleague, Senator Nickles, has come to \nthe floor. I shall conclude, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a text of my report on the foreign \ntravels, some of which I have commented about this morning, be printed \nin full in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record; as follows:\n\n               Senator Specter's Report on Foreign Travel\n\n       During the period of August 20-September 2, 1995, Senator \n     Hank Brown and I traveled to ten countries in two weeks and \n     met with heads of state of eight of these countries.\n\n\n                                 TAIWAN\n\n       We departed on August 20, 1995 and arrived in Taipei, \n     Taiwan on August 22, 1995, after having crossed the \n     international date line. At 5:00 pm, we had a lengthy meeting \n     with Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui. We discussed President \n     Lee's private visit to the United States to visit his alma \n     mater, Cornell University from June 6-10, 1995, and the \n     People's Republic of China's (PRC's) retaliation for that \n     visit by conducting live missile tests wherein the PRC fired \n     6 missiles targeted 85 miles north of Taiwan's coast--2 \n     missiles from Manchuria, 2 missiles from northwest China and \n     2 missiles from Central China.\n       President Lee also detailed the ``One China'' policy, under \n     which both Taiwan and the PRC believe that there is only one \n     China. Taiwan and the PRC differ, however, in that the PRC \n     insists Taiwan is part of China and that there can be two \n     systems operating in one country. Taiwan, on the other hand, \n     has taken the position, through its national unification \n     guidelines, that the PRC must realize certain political and \n     economic reforms before the unification may occur.\n       We also discussed our concerns regarding the current trade \n     imbalance between Taiwan and the U.S. President Lee assured \n     us that he has been working hard to reduce the trade \n     imbalance. He noted that his efforts have led to a drop in \n     the trade deficit from $16.5 billion to $6 billion and that \n     he personally is committed to reducing the deficit by at \n     least 10 percent per year by expanding Taiwanese purchases of \n     U.S. exports and reducing tariffs on imported U.S. products.\n       On the evening of August 22nd, we had a working dinner with \n     Taiwanese Foreign Minister and former Ambassador to the \n     United \n\n[[Page S 14435]]\n     States Frederick F. Chien. We discussed Taiwan's political reforms and \n     its movement toward freedom of the press, open elections and \n     democratization. We also discussed at greater length the One \n     China policy and Taiwan's diplomatic and economic relations \n     with the PRC.\n       Dr. Lyushun Shen, the Director of Public Affairs at the \n     Taipei Education and Cultural Representatives Office in \n     Washington, D.C., noted that the PRC's recent missile firings \n     have had a strong impact on Taiwan's stock market, with the \n     index dropping 200 points the first day and 1000 points \n     overall, from 5500 to 4500.\n\n\n                                CAMBODIA\n\n       On Wednesday, August 23rd, we departed Taipei at 6:45 am. \n     We arrived in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for an early meeting with \n     King Norodom Sihanouk. The King detailed his image of the \n     future of Cambodia, including his assessment that every \n     Cambodian is determined, and he is personally committed, to \n     ensure the continuation of a liberal democracy, along with a \n     multiparty system and free press, coupled with a free market \n     economy.\n       We spoke to King Sihanouk regarding the importance of \n     protecting human rights. In response, he observed that human \n     rights groups are active in defending their rights, without \n     interference from the government. Further, he stated that \n     when the 1st Prime Minister did not want to allow the United \n     Nations to maintain an office in Cambodia for human rights, \n     the King insisted, and succeeded in allowing the office to \n     remain open.\n       I asked King Sihanouk about the continued threat of the \n     Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot to the security and stability of \n     Cambodia. He dismissed the Khmer Rouge as a small movement of \n     communist extremists centered near the Thailand border. \n     According to the King, the Khmer Rouge has been severely \n     decimated by 10,000 defections over the last several years, \n     leaving primarily a small band of hardliners, totalling no \n     more than 6,000.\n       We also raised our concerns about the expulsion of Sam \n     Rainsy from Parliament because of his criticisms of the \n     government. The King responded that party issues are private \n     issues between each Member of Parliament (MP) and the party \n     on which they stood for election. Since Rainsy ceased to \n     represent and support the party platform on which he was \n     elected, the King reasoned, he could be removed from the \n     party. Upon such removal, he continued, Rainsy could then be \n     removed from Parliament because he no longer was a party \n     member.\n       After our meeting with King Sihanouk, we met with \n     Cambodia's 2nd Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is currently in a \n     power sharing relationship with the 1st Prime Minister Prince \n     Ranariddh Sihanouk. We discussed with Mr. Sen whether he has \n     any differences with the 1st Prime Minister and whether he \n     plans to challenge the 1st Prime Minister in the upcoming \n     elections in 1998. Mr. Sen acknowledged that he and the 1st \n     Prime Minister are from different political parties, but that \n     the two parties will join together as allies in the upcoming \n     elections rather than fielding opposing slates of candidates, \n     and that Mr. Sen would not challenge the 1st Prime Minister \n     for the position of 1st Prime Minister.\n       Mr. Sen expounded at some length about the benefit of a \n     political alliance before and after an election rather than a \n     divisive fight before an election and an alliance afterwards. \n     Such a system, Mr. Sen argued, is the most secure and the \n     most democratic. We suggested that when opposite parties \n     combine forces, it eliminates competition and the voters are \n     not given a choice of differing platforms. Mr. Sen responded \n     that his main objective is political stability and that the \n     Cambodian system does not end pluralism, but instead, ensures \n     pluralism with cooperation. He also noted that in a country \n     without the long tradition of democracy and the mechanisms \n     for elections that we enjoy in the U.S., if the two main \n     parties did not cooperate, it would be impossible to even \n     install a ballot box at the polls, much less conduct a free \n     election.\n       Mr. Sen further opined that the Cambodian government is not \n     like the Democrats and Republicans in Congress. If the \n     Cambodian People's Party (CPP) withdrew from its alliance \n     with the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, \n     Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), the government \n     would collapse, and conversely, if the FUNCINPEC party \n     withdrew from the alliance the government would also \n     collapse. So, according to Mr. Sen, in Cambodia the two top \n     political parties must cooperate together to ensure that \n     democracy continues.\n       After our meeting with Mr. Sen, we met briefly with several \n     prominent representatives of human rights organizations in \n     Cambodia, along with some Cambodian elected officials. The \n     focus of the discussion was on the expulsion of Rainsy from \n     Parliament and the concerns of those who fear that the \n     government may oust them in a like fashion from Parliament \n     for criticism of the government\n       Although Cambodia claims to have adopted the German model \n     of Parliamentary government, the human rights leaders noted \n     that under German Parliamentary Rules, a Member of Parliament \n     may only be expelled from the party. The MP cannot be \n     expelled from Parliament even if that MP was elected on a \n     party slate. Instead that MP would hold the seat until the \n     next elections at which time the party could select a \n     different individual as the designated MP for that area.\n       We had a country team briefing by embassy staff about \n     Cambodia's political and economic stability. We were briefed \n     on the Khmer Rouge insurgency and the limited threat posed by \n     the Khmer Rouge in Phnom Penh. It was noted that defections \n     in their ranks have reduced the Khmer Rouge to 6,000-7,000 \n     individuals, down dramatically from 30,000-40,000 in the mid \n     1970's.\n       We asked why the U.S. should continue its annual aid to \n     Cambodia, which currently totals $40 million. The response \n     was that U.S. aid, which primarily takes the form of \n     humanitarian assistance, medical training and military \n     training in joint exercises, all help to strengthen \n     democratic forces in Cambodia and lessen the need for larger \n     expenditures by limiting the danger of confrontation in the \n     future. Robert Porter, the U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission also \n     observed that joint training exercises help enhance U.S. \n     military readiness by giving U.S. personnel onsite training \n     in tropical climates, conditions and cultures.\n       We also met with Prince Ranariddh Norodom, the 1st Prime \n     Minister (and son of King Sihanouk), and expressed our \n     interest in seeing an improvement in the movement toward \n     democracy and free elections. In particular, we discussed the \n     creation of a Constitutional Council in Cambodia to review \n     all laws and determine whether they conform with the \n     Cambodian Constitution. The 1st Prime Minister expressed an \n     interest in finalizing the Constitutional Council due to the \n     fact that the National Assembly had already passed 40 laws \n     which have not yet been adjudged Constitutional.\n       When pressed on the importance of ensuring constitutional \n     and democratic governance, the 1st Prime Minister responded \n     that Cambodia is a constitutional government which was \n     supported by a large majority on election day. He further \n     noted, however, that the current government must be compared \n     to the previous autocratic and ruthless regime of Pol Pot and \n     the Khmer Rouge. In addition, with the small but continued \n     threat of the Khmer Rouge, the current government must be \n     particularly sensitive to the importance of internal \n     security.\n       We raised our concerns about the explusion of MP Rainsy \n     from Parliament and the implication of this expulsion on the \n     growth of democracy in Cambodia. He emphasized that Cambodia \n     needs political stability now, with the two parties united \n     together. If someone wants to oppose the party and the \n     government then that party should leave the party and form \n     their own party.\n       On the issue of freedom of the press, the 1st Prime \n     Minister stated that freedom of the press in Cambodia is not \n     bad, particularly when compared to press freedoms in \n     countries in the region, such as Thailand, Singapore, \n     Malaysia and Indonesia--and those countries do not have \n     comparable security problems. He said currently, there are \n     over 50 newspapers that have full freedom to criticize the \n     government and many actively oppose the government, all \n     without criminal penalties. The 1st Prime Minister noted \n     ruefully that many of the cartoonists seem to take great \n     pleasure in lampooning him.\n       The 1st Prime Minister then discussed his strategy for \n     reducing poverty and thus encouraging the Khmer Rouge to \n     leave Pol Pot and join the Cambodian government through \n     improvements in education, agriculture and rural roads.\n\n\n                                MYANMAR\n\n       We departed Cambodia and arrived in Yangon, Myanmar, where \n     we were briefed by U.S. embassy personnel, led by Charge \n     d'Affaires Marilyn Meyers. There is currently no U.S. \n     ambassador to Myanmar, nor has there been since December, \n     1990, when the U.S. withdrew its ambassador to protest the \n     government's refusal to honor the results of a free election.\n       We were briefed on the poor condition of democracy and \n     human rights in Myanmar. In the 1990 elections, the State Law \n     and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) refused to honor the \n     results of a landslide electoral victory by the National \n     League for Democracy (NLD) led by Aung San Suu Kyi. In that \n     election, opposition parties won 80% of the seats in \n     Parliament.\n       We were also briefed on the tremendous problem with \n     narcotics trafficking in Myanmar. Our reports indicate that \n     over 60% of the heroin passing through the ``golden \n     triangle'' of southeast Asia passes through Burma on its way \n     to distribution in the United States and across the world. \n     The government has apparently sought to combat the narcotics \n     trade by limited incursions against known drug lords. The \n     U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has provided training and \n     funds to the government to assist it in its efforts at \n     detection and eradication of narcotics.\n       After the country team briefing, we met with Lt. General \n     Kim Nyuet of the SLORC. We conveyed our concerns over the \n     imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the lack of democracy in \n     Myanmar. General Nyuet expounded at length about Myanmar's \n     unique characteristics, noting that the country is comprised \n     of 135 different races of people, with different customs, \n     languages and religions.\n       The General claimed that the 1990 elections were marred by \n     uprisings and violence--including beheadings in center city \n     Yangon--which resulted in a breakdown of the government \n     machinery. As a result of this breakdown and the ensuing \n     public dissatisfaction, Nyuet argued, there emerged a need \n     for law and order as the first priority for keeping the \n     country together. \n\n[[Page S 14436]]\n\n       We emphasized to General Nyuet the importance of human \n     rights as the linchpin to warmer relations between Myanmar \n     and the U.S., and advised the General that Congress is \n     considering an amendment by Senator McConnell that would \n     impose stringent sanctions against Myanmar until there is \n     concrete improvement in democracy and human rights. In \n     particular, I advised him that the U.S. will closely monitor \n     progress on a Constitutional Convention and the release of \n     all political detainees. When I asked him whether Aung San \n     Suu Kyi would be named to participate in the Convention, he \n     shrugged and said that all the delegates had already been \n     chosen.\n       Although I applauded his recent release of 1991 Nobel Peace \n     Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, we advised General Nyuet \n     that SLORC can and should remove its remaining restrictions \n     on Aung San Suu Kyi, including the monitoring of her meetings \n     and harassment and intimidation of individuals with whom she \n     meets. I also urged him to reconsider his suggestion that \n     Aung San Suu Kyi would not be allowed to be a delegate to the \n     Constitutional Convention.\n       The next morning, August 25th, we had the privilege of \n     meeting Aung San Suu Kyi for breakfast. She was a very warm, \n     dynamic, and impressive person who conveyed an intense desire \n     for democratic reforms and improvements in human rights in \n     Myanmar.\n       She spoke passionately and poetically about the importance \n     of dialog as the means for resolving conflict peacefully. \n     Every situation of conflict ends in dialog, she noted, so \n     intelligent people should be able to go directly to dialog \n     without the need for devastation. Dialog is inevitable, and \n     the sooner this dialog begins, the better.\n       She also discussed the nearly 6 years she spent under house \n     arrest without any charges and no trial and the similar \n     treatment accorded to many of her fellow country men and \n     women.\n\n\n                                 INDIA\n\n       Later that afternoon, we flew to New Delhi, where we met \n     with Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee, India's Ambassador to \n     the United States S.S. Ray, and other Indian officials for \n     dinner at the Foreign Minister's residence.\n       The main focus of our discussions was the relationship \n     between India and Pakistan. In particular, we discussed the \n     tremendous tensions between these two countries over the \n     situation in Kashmir, terrorism and nuclear weapons. Our \n     hosts spoke emphatically about the need to maintain sanctions \n     against Pakistan for the purchase of missile component parts \n     from China and the importance of supporting the Pressler \n     amendment which would keep these sanctions in place. They \n     noted that any movement away from these sanctions, \n     particularly any legislation that would allow Pakistan to \n     receive military equipment, would send the wrong signal and \n     damage the relationship between the U.S. and India.\n       We related to the Indian officials Aung San Suu Kyi's \n     discussion of the importance and inevitability of dialog as a \n     means to resolve all conflicts, and we asked them if the U.S. \n     could do anything to facilitate greater dialog between India \n     and Pakistan. They expressed an interest in achieving an \n     agreement that would enable both sides to lessen their \n     expenditures on border troops and military equipment and that \n     would lessen the growing tension between the two countries on \n     issues of nuclear proliferation and first strike limitations.\n       The next morning, August 26th, we met privately with \n     India's Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. He expressed a deep \n     concern about India's arms race with Pakistan and noted that \n     India has taken an important step by decreasing its military \n     budget.\n       He also stated that he would be very interested in \n     negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on the Indian subcontinent within ten or \n     fifteen years, including renouncing the first strike use of \n     such weapons. His interest in such negotiations with Pakistan \n     would cover bilateral talks or would encompass a regional \n     conference including participation by the United States, \n     China and Russia, in addition to India and Pakistan. When I \n     pressed him on whether his proposal would include \n     international inspections, he said that he did not want to \n     get involved in details, but that India has experts working \n     on all details on all related matters.\n\n\n                                PAKISTAN\n\n       On August 27th, we departed India and flew to Islamabad, \n     Pakistan, where we had a meeting and subsequent dinner with \n     President Farooq Leghari. We discussed the importance of \n     establishing peace in the region by addressing the problems \n     of terrorism and nuclear containment.\n       On the issue of terrorism, we expressed our concern about \n     the role of Iran in fostering revolutionary and religious \n     fervor, manifesting themselves in acts of terrorism. \n     President Leghari stated his belief that Iran still contains \n     extremist elements but that the voices of moderation \n     predominate. He noted that opening trade and dialog with Iran \n     will help to reduce its insecurity and bring it back into \n     international fold.\n       The next morning, August 28th, we had breakfast with Prime \n     Minister Benazir Bhutto. She expressed genuine surprise over \n     the content of our discussions with India Prime Minister Rao \n     with respect to an agreement to dismantle all nuclear weapons \n     on the Indian subcontinent within 10 to 15 years. She stated \n     that this was the first time that she had heard any such \n     commitment from India and she asked if we could get Mr. Rao \n     to put his agreement in writing.\n       When we pressed her on the importance of dialog between \n     India and Pakistan, and asked her when the last time was that \n     she spoke with India Prime Minister Rao, she said that she \n     had not spoken with him since she became Prime Minister. She \n     noted that she had attempted to begin a dialog at the Foreign \n     Secretary level, but that the talks were disbanded when India \n     initiated military hostilities against Pakistan. She also \n     related the perception in Pakistan that she is soft on India \n     precisely because she was seeking a dialog with India.\n       We suggested to Prime Minister Bhutto that the U.S. would \n     be willing to serve as an intermediary between the two \n     countries to facilitate this dialog, particularly in the area \n     of nuclear containment. Ms. Bhutto responded that since \n     Pakistan is the one targeted by India's missiles, and because \n     Pakistan lacks the capability to launch a 1st strike, it is \n     more appropriate for India to renounce a first strike option \n     unilaterally.\n       I wrote a letter to President Clinton summarizing our \n     meetings with Prime Ministers Rao and Bhutto and suggesting \n     that it would be very productive for the United States to \n     initiate and broker discussions between India and Pakistan \n     regarding nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems. A \n     copy of this letter is attached to this report.\n       On the issue of Pakistan's purchase of M-11 missile \n     components from China, Ms. Bhutto denied that Pakistan had \n     ever purchased or possessed such missiles. She noted that \n     Pakistan would not be under such pressure to develop nuclear \n     capabilities if India had not acquired such capabilities, and \n     that Pakistan only began developing its nuclear program in \n     1974, after India detonated its first nuclear test.\n       She also questioned the continuing U.S. sanctions against \n     Pakistan for the purchase of these components, noting that \n     the U.S. had originally levied sanctions against both China \n     and Pakistan for the sale and subsequently removed the \n     sanctions only from China.\n       Ms. Bhutto agreed with our suggestion that the U.S. could \n     perform a critical role as a third party mediator between \n     India and Pakistan on nuclear as well as conventional \n     weapons. She remarked that there has never been an \n     understanding between India and Pakistan unless a third party \n     has mediated, and she stated her belief that Prime Minister \n     Rao would be the ideal person to participate in such \n     negotiations because he is now in a position to be a \n     statesman.\n       At a press briefing, we commented on our discussions with \n     the Prime Minister of India and Pakistan on possible \n     discussions to remove the nuclear threat from the \n     subcontinent.\n       Shortly thereafter, the Indian government through its \n     embassy in Washington, D.C. sought to deny Prime Minister \n     Rao's statements on negotiations on nuclear disarmament by \n     claiming that our meeting covered only the 1988 Rajiv Gandhi \n     Action Plan on nuclear disarmament. We did discuss the issues \n     set forth above and we did not discuss the Gandhi Action \n     Plan.\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n       We departed Islamabad on August 28th for Damascus, Syria. \n     The next morning, we met with Foreign Minister Farouk al-\n     Sharah. Our discussion with Sharah had barely begun when he \n     complained about the nuclear threat posed by Israel.\n       I asked Mr. Sharah if Syria fears that Israel will use \n     nuclear weapons against Syria. Interestingly, Mr. Sharah \n     acknowledged his concern, but noted that Israel would not \n     likely detonate a nuclear device because any such use, in a \n     region where the nations are so close together, would affect \n     Israelis as well as Syrians.\n       When asked if Syria had developed nuclear capabilities, Mr. \n     Sharah responded that it is important that nations develop \n     nuclear capabilities for peaceful uses and acknowledged that \n     Syria is moving in this direction, while remaining a party to \n     the Non Proliferation Treaty and cooperating with \n     international inspections.\n       We also discussed that status of peace talks between Syria \n     and Israel and the importance of dialog between the two \n     nations. Mr. Sharah expressed his concern over the deadlocked \n     talks, and opined that Israeli Prime Minister Rabin may be \n     feeling electoral pressure such that an agreement may be \n     possible only after the Israeli elections. Although the two \n     sides have not completed agreement on any components of the \n     peace talks, there was agreement on the principles of \n     security arrangements between the two nations.\n       On the issue of the Golan Heights, Mr. Sharah stated his \n     belief that if the Israelis did not intend to withdraw from \n     the Golan Heights, then they would not have entered the peace \n     discussions to begin with, and that a full peace can be \n     achieved only by a full withdrawal from the Golan.\n       With respect to terrorism, we discussed the importance of \n     ending support for terrorism. Mr. Shara denied any complicity \n     in the acts of terrorism by Hamas and the Jezbollah, or any \n     training by these groups in Syria.\n       We also discussed Saddam Hussein and the situation in Iraq. \n     Mr. Sharah noted that King Hussein's recent speech in which \n     he condemned the Iraqi dictator apparently had been favorably \n     received by Saddam, since the speech was transmitted in its \n     entirety on Iraqi television. When I asked Mr. Sharah if \n\n[[Page S 14437]]\n     he believed it is possible to bring Saddam back into the family of \n     nations, he responded that he did not believe it is possible.\n       After meeting with Mr. Sharah, we had a very instructive \n     meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad. He stated there will be \n     peace between Syria and Israel and advised us not to be too \n     impatient about the current peace negotiations. He noted that \n     he thinks Mr. Rabin should move forward on these peace talks \n     and accomplish something before the elections because of his \n     platform for peace.\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n       We left Damascus and flew to Tel Aviv on the evening of \n     August 29th. The next morning, we had several meetings with \n     Israeli officials, commencing with a breakfast meeting with \n     Yaacov Frenkel, the Governor of the Bank of Israel, in which \n     we discussed Israel's efforts to expand trade and tourism \n     between Israel and its Arab neighbors. We also discussed the \n     importance of U.S. aid on Israel's economy. Mr. Frenkel \n     remarked that this aid is critical to Israel because of the \n     statement it makes to the Israeli people about the American \n     government's continued support of Israel and because of \n     Israel's costs of pursuing peace and financing the tremendous \n     inflow of immigrants, which total 80,000 to 90,000 yearly.\n       We were then briefed by U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk and \n     his staff on the status of Israeli-Syria peace talks. The \n     U.S. had previously set the groundwork for the peace talks \n     when our Secretary of State announced an agreement that \n     Israel and Syria would have meetings in three stages; first, \n     between the Chiefs of Staff; second, between senior military \n     staff, and finally between the heads of state. After the 1st \n     stage, but before the meeting of the military officers, \n     President Asad changed his mind and stated that there must \n     1st be agreement on the issue of Early Warning systems before \n     the talks could proceed.\n       We were advised that at this point, then, the Israeli \n     government has turned its attention to its peace talks with \n     the PLO, and away from the Syrian negotiations. The \n     negotiations with the Palestinians have moved at a rapid \n     pace, with the agreement 90% complete.\n       We then had lunch with key Palestinian leaders, including \n     Faisal Husseini and Hanan Ashrawi, to discuss their \n     perspectives on the peace talks with Israel. They expressed \n     optimism about the pace of the negotiations. However, they \n     also expressed their deep concerns about the situation in \n     Jerusalem and the rights of Arabs and Palestinians in the \n     city. They suggested that Jerusalem become the capitol of two \n     states, with the provision that Jerusalem would be under the \n     exclusive sovereignty of NO state.\n       We also discussed the problem of terrorism. Mr. Husseini \n     stated that the best way to stop terrorism is to stop factors \n     which lead to terrorism--by allowing people greater control \n     over their lands. He also stated his belief that the Israelis \n     cannot keep 400,000 Palestinians hostage in Hebron to \n     resolution of the peace process, and that there must be \n     prompt resolution of the situation in Hebron.\n       Later on the afternoon of August 30th, we met with former \n     Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. We discussed the status of the \n     current peace talks with the PLO and his concerns over \n     terrorism and internal security. He noted pointedly that the \n     difference between the peace talks between Israel and Egypt \n     and the talks with the Palestinians is that the peace talks \n     with the Egyptians were with an external entity, whereas the \n     negotiations with the Palestinians are internal, insofar as \n     they involve people currently living in Israel.\n       On Wednesday evening we met with Israeli Prime Minister \n     Yitzhak Rabin. In our meeting with Mr. Rabin, he declared his \n     dedication to utilizing this unique moment in history, which \n     began with the dismantlement of the former Soviet Union, to \n     bring about peace in the Middle East. He noted in particular \n     the advantage to removal of the Soviet umbrella over the \n     heads of Arab leaders.\n       In response to my question on the peace talks between \n     Israel and the Palestinians, Prime Minister Rabin expressed \n     optimism about the prospects for peace. He noted that he \n     wishes to see Israel as a Jewish state, without bilateral \n     governance. However, Mr. Rabin clarified that he does not see \n     Israel as a Jewish state if racism will be the governing \n     policy. Instead, he prefers peace within Israel with rights \n     for Palestinians. As part of this peace, Prime Minister Rabin \n     talked of new priorities, under which Israel will no longer \n     expend resources on settlement of the West Bank, where only \n     3% of Israeli Jews live.\n       I asked him if there is any way to control terrorism. He \n     commented first about the recent bus bombing, noting that \n     although the bombing was carried out by Hamas, it was done in \n     an area under Israeli control. The elements supporting this \n     terrorism, he continued, are seeking to bring down the \n     Israeli Labor government because the peace process will \n     certainly come to an end under a Likud government. According \n     to Prime Minister Rabin, many of these same forces of \n     extremism are seeking to assassinate PLO Chairman Yassir \n     Arafat because of his overtures to Israel. The acts of \n     terrorism are difficult to control--over 70% of these \n     terrorist acts since 1994 have been carried out by suicide \n     missions which are virtually impossible to prevent.\n       Regarding peace discussions with Syria, Mr. Rabin stated \n     that Israel stands ready to negotiate, but that the Syrians \n     want the U.S. to remain involved as a third party mediator to \n     these talks. He expressed his concern over the breakdown of \n     talks over the issue of Early Warning systems.\n       The next morning, August 31st, we had breakfast with \n     Israeli opposition party leader Benjamin Netanyahu. In \n     response to my question about whether the PLO is complying \n     with the conditions for U.S. aid, he stated that Arafat is \n     not doing all that he can to stamp out terrorism. In \n     particular, Mr. Netanyahu pointed to speeches by Arafat in \n     which he has said that Palestinians should be patient but \n     that the ultimate way is the way of a ``Jihad''. He further \n     noted that Arafat has taken minor steps to crack down on \n     terrorists, but that he has refused to extradite known \n     terrorists in his own police force.\n       When asked if reports were true that he was willing to meet \n     with Arafat, Mr. Netanyahu said that these reports were not \n     true. He said he would furnish us with a list of known \n     terrorists that are wanted for murder, whom Arafat has \n     refused to extradite to Israel, so that I could bring up \n     these names with Arafat personally. In particular, he \n     highlighted the Abu-Sita cousins, who are suspects in the \n     murder of Uri Megidish. According to Mr. Netanyahu, these \n     individuals are currently serving in the Palestinian \n     intelligence service and the Palestinians have refused \n     repeated requests to turn them over to Israeli authorities \n     for trial.\n       After meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, we spoke with Israeli \n     President Ezer Weitzman about the importance of peace with \n     the Palestinians and the Syrians. Mr. Weitzman agreed that, \n     in general, a peace agreement between Israel Syria would be \n     good for both nations.\n       We asked President Weitzman whether the U.S. should \n     continue giving aid to the PLO if Arafat is not complying \n     with the conditions attached to that aid. He responded that \n     the U.S. should stick to the requirements set forth in the \n     law and force Arafat to comply with the conditions attached \n     to that aid. Mr. Weitzman also commented that he would not go \n     to the U.S. to sign an interim agreement between Israel and \n     the PLO because in its current form this agreement is not the \n     final agreement.\n       After meeting with President Weitzman, we drove to Gaza for \n     a meeting with PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat. Chairman Arafat \n     emphasized again and again the importance of a resolution of \n     the situations in Hebron and Jerusalem as critical factors in \n     ensuring peace and the success of the peace talks with \n     Israel.\n       We asked Arafat if it is possible for the PLO to exert more \n     pressure on Hamas to renounce acts of terror. He responded \n     that pressure must be brought to bear on Iran and Syria. He \n     noted, however, that the PLO has stopped 11 attempted acts of \n     terror, with the latest coming just 2 days prior to our \n     meeting. He also noted that as a result of his peace efforts, \n     he has received death threats by Hamas groups operating out \n     of Syria.\n       In response to allegations that he only condemns terrorism \n     when speaking in English, but not Arabic, Arafat denied the \n     charge, noting that since his English is not good, he \n     typically speaks in Arabic, and that he had condemned \n     terrorism in Arabic on numerous occasions, including at the \n     University. Arafat explained that his speeches in Arabic are \n     being misunderstood, and that when he calls for a ``Jihad'' \n     he is actually using a term used by the prophet Mohammed when \n     he called the building of a state the ``grand Jihad''.\n       When we pressed Arafat on why he is refusing to extradite \n     known terrorists, including the Abu-Sita cousins, he deferred \n     to his Security Minister, who responded that the Palestinians \n     cannot turn over any suspects until there is evidence they \n     committed an extraditable crime and then, only after \n     receiving a court order authorizing the extradition.\n\n\n                                 EGYPT\n\n       That evening we flew to Cairo, where we met with Egyptian \n     President Hosni Mubarak. We asked President Mubarak if he \n     believes Arafat is doing all that he can do to combat \n     terrorism, pursuant to the conditions established on \n     receiving U.S. aid. He responded that Arafat is working \n     practically and on the ground level to stop terrorism, and \n     that forces such as Iran are the ones supporting Hamas and \n     Jezbollah.\n       We also discussed our concerns about Saddam Hussein and the \n     situation in Iraq. President Mubarak related that he has \n     worked hard to try to influence Saddam to relinquish power \n     and leave Iraq, including his offer to grant Saddam asylum in \n     Egypt if Saddam promises to leave Iraq peacefully, but his \n     efforts have not been successful.\n\n\n                                BULGARIA\n\n       On September 1st, we departed Egypt en route to Sofia, \n     Bulgaria, where we had meetings with the President of the \n     National Assembly, Blagovest Sendov, and the President of \n     Bulgaria, Zhelyu Zhelev. Both Mr. Sendov and Mr. Zhelev \n     expressed an interest in NATO membership if the Parliament \n     supports such membership, with Mr. Zhelev stating his firm \n     desire that such membership should occur.\n       We also discussed at length the current situation in the \n     former Yugoslavia, and its implications on Bulgaria. Finally, \n     both Mr. Sendov and Mr. Zhelev discussed the importance of \n     foreign investment in Bulgaria and U.S. support for \n     Bulgaria's membership in the World Trade Organization and \n     GATT. \n\n[[Page S 14438]]\n\n\n\n                                BELGIUM\n\n       From Bulgaria, we travelled to Brussels, Belgium, where we \n     were briefed by the U.S. representatives to NATO on the \n     situation in Bosnia, including the recent bombing raids on \n     Serbian positions. They advised us of the negotiations and \n     cooperation between our NATO allies and the UN command in \n     orchestrating the military operations after the Serbian \n     mortar attack on Sarajevo. Significantly, they noted that \n     these air strikes were focused on the Serb heavy weapon \n     positions and on all lines of support for those weapons, \n     including communication and control centers.\n       We also discussed the negotiation strategy for NATO, \n     including the status of talks with Serbian strongman General \n     Ratko Mladic. They expressed hope that these talks will be \n     productive, although they noted that Mladic does not appear \n     terribly cooperative. They also noted NATO's intention to \n     proceed with the air strikes if Mladic and the Serbs do not \n     remove their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo.\n       We returned to the United States on September 2, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 28, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your \n     personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator \n     Hank Brown and I have had in the last two days with Indian \n     Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto.\n       Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested \n     in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen \n     years including renouncing first use of such weapons. His \n     interest in such negotiations with Pakistan would cover \n     bilateral talks or a regional conference which would include \n     the United States, China and Russia in addition to India and \n     Pakistan.\n       When we mentioned this conversation to Prime Minister \n     Bhutto this morning, she expressed great interest in such \n     negotiations. When we told her of our conversation with Prime \n     Minister Rao, she asked if we could get him to put that in \n     writing.\n       When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last \n     talked to Prime Minister Rao, she said that she had no \n     conversations with him during her tenure as Prime Minister. \n     Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had initiated a \n     contact through an intermediary but that was terminated when \n     a new controversy arose between Pakistan and India.\n       From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime \n     Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     respective to discussions initiated and brokered by the \n     United States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     system.\n       I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus as that you will have it at the earliest moment. I \n     am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of \n     State Warren Chistopher.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14433-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14438-S14456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n\n                           Motion to Proceed\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished majority \nleader and pursuant to the consent agreement, I move to proceed to the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill, H.R. 2127.\n  Under the unanimous-consent agreement, at 10 a.m. there will be a 15-\nminute vote on a motion to proceed. If there are not 60 votes in the \naffirmative on the motion to proceed, there will then be a second vote \nat 11 a.m. on a motion to proceed. If there are not 60 votes on the \nsecond vote, the Senate will be recessed until later in the day to \nallow the Finance Committee to meet.\n  Remaining appropriations would be the State, Justice, Commerce \nappropriations bill and the continuing resolution.\n  Therefore, according to the instruction of the distinguished majority \nleader, a late night session is expected with rollcall votes throughout \nthe day.\n  Now I do move to proceed, on behalf of the majority leader, to the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I spoke at some length yesterday afternoon on the \nimport of this bill. It is my hope we would proceed to debate this \nbill. It is a very important piece of legislation, containing in excess \nof $62 billion in discretionary appropriations for the Departments of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education. It contains an \nadditional $200.9 billion in nondiscretionary expenditures. It is \nwithin the 602(b) allocations given to the committee according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  I, frankly, would have liked to have seen more funds allocated to our \nsubcommittee so we could have had more for very vital services under \nthis bill. As it was, the allocation to the Senate subcommittee was \nalmost $1.6 billion above the House of Representatives, and those \nadditional funds were placed significantly in the education account.\n  With the cooperation of Senator Harkin, with whom I have worked for \nmany years--last year Senator Harkin was chairman, I was ranking; this \nyear our roles are reversed--we made the best allocation we could, \nassisted by very able and competent staff, allocating funds in a very, \nvery complex bill.\n  We have maintained funding for Goals 2000, which is in response to a \n1983 report about the shambles in education, where sufficient actions \nhave still not been taken. These goals are voluntary on the States. The \nStates can accept the Federal standards and goals or can adopt \nstandards and goals on their own as they choose.\n  We have made provision for LIHEAP, low-income fuel assistance, which \ngoes principally to the elderly who are without sufficient funds to buy \ntheir fuel. It is really a proposition, as the expression goes, of \nheating or eating that plagues those individuals.\n  We have made allocation for funding for violence against women. With \nthe House figure being at $32 million on the shelter issue--the full \nauthorization was $50 million--in our subcommittee allocations, we have \nfound the funding for the full $50 million.\n  We have presented a bill which has taken care of key issues of plant \nsafety. We have stripped the bill of provisions relating to legislation \nbecause of our conclusion that legislation ought not to be included on \nan appropriations bill, a policy adopted by the full committee as a \ngeneral matter on all appropriation bills under the leadership of our \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Hatfield.\n  On biomedical research, Mr. President, we have for the National \nInstitutes of Health nearly $11.6 billion, an increase of some $300 \nmillion over the fiscal year 1995 appropriations. These funds will \nboost the biomedical research appropriations to maintain and strengthen \nthe tremendous strides which have been made in unlocking medical \nmysteries which lead to new treatments and cures. Gene therapy offers \ngreat promise for the future. In the 15 years that I have been in the \nSenate, all those years on the appropriations subcommittee dealing with \nhealth and human services, where cuts have been proposed by Presidents, \nboth Democrat and Republican, we have increased funding for medical \nresearch, which I think it is very important.\n  Two years ago, I had a medical problem and was the beneficiary of the \nMRI developed in 1985, after I had come to the Senate, a life-saving \nprocedure to detect an intracranial lesion. So I have professional, \npolitical, and personal experiences to attest to the importance of \nhealth research funding.\n  On Alzheimer's disease, Mr. President, this last year the United \nStates spent over $90 billion to care for Alzheimer's patients. This \ndevastating disease robs its victims of their minds while depriving \nfamilies of the well-being and security they deserve.\n  We have been working to focus more attention and more money into the \ncauses and cures of Alzheimer's. To address this problem, the bill \ncontains increased funding for research into finding the cause and \ncures for Alzheimer's disease. The bill also includes nearly $5 million \nfor a State grant program to \n\n[[Page S 14439]]\nhelp families caring for Alzheimer's patients at home. The statistics \nare enormously impressive, Mr. President, that if we could delay the \nonset of Alzheimer's disease, we could save billions of dollars.\n  On women's health, in 1995, 182,000 women will be diagnosed as having \nbreast cancer and some 46,000 women will die from the disease. The \ninvestment in education and treatment advances led to the announcement \nlast year that the breast cancer death rates in American women declined \nby 4.7 percent between 1989 and 1992, the largest such short-term \ndecline since 1950.\n  And while this was encouraging news, it only highlighted the fact \nthat the Federal Government investment is beginning to pay off. While \nit was difficult in a tight budget year to raise fundings levels, the \nsubcommittee placed a very high priority on women's health issues. The \nbill before the Senate contains an increase of $25 million for breast \nand cervical cancer screening, increases to expand research on the \nbreast cancer gene, to permit the development of a diagnostic test to \nidentify women who are at risk, and speed research to develop effective \nmethods of prevention, early detection, and treatment.\n  Funding for the Office of Women's Health has also been doubled to \ncontinue the national action plan on breast cancer, and to develop and \nestablish a clearinghouse to provide health care professionals with a \nbroad range of women's health-related information. This increase has \nbeen recommended for the Office of Women's Health, because of the very \neffective work that that office has been doing.\n  On Healthy Start, Mr. President, children born of low birthweight is \nthe leading cause of infant mortality. Infants who have been exposed to \ndrugs, alcohol, or tobacco in utero are more likely to be born \nprematurely and of low birthweight. We have in our society, Mr. \nPresident, thousands of children born each year no bigger than the size \nof my hand, weighing a pound, some even as little as 12 ounces. They \nare human tragedies at birth carrying scars for a lifetime. They are \nenormously expensive, costing more than $200,000 until they are \nreleased from the hospital.\n  Years ago, Dr. Koop outlined the way to deal with this issue by \nprenatal visits. The Healthy Start Program was initiated, and has been \ncarried forward, to target resources for prenatal care to high \nincidence communities; it is funded as well as we could under this bill \nwith increases as I have noted.\n  On AIDS, the bill contains $2.6 billion for research, education, \nprevention, and services to embattle the scourge of AIDS, including \n$379 million for emergency aid to the 42 cities hardest hit by this \ndisease.\n  When it comes to the subject of violence against women, it is one of \nthe epidemic problems in our society. The Department of Justice reports \nthat each year women are the victims of more than 4.5 million violent \ncrimes, including an estimated 500,000 rapes or other sexual assaults.\n  But crime statistics do not tell the whole story. I have visited many \nshelters, Mr. President, in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh and have seen \nfirst hand the physical and emotional suffering so many women are \nenduring. In a sad, ironic way the women I saw were the lucky ones \nbecause they survived violent attacks.\n  The Labor-HHS-Education bill contains $96 million for programs \nauthorized by the Violent Crime Reduction Act. The bill before the \nSenate contains the full amount authorized for these programs, \nincluding $50 million for battered-women shelters, $35 million for rape \nprevention programs, $7 million for runaway youth, and $4.9 million for \ncommunity demonstration programs, the operation of the hotline and \neducation programs for youth. These funds have been appropriated, Mr. \nPresident, after very, very careful analysis as to where the \nsubcommittee and the full committee felt the money could best be spent.\n  On the School-to-Work Program, the committee recommends $245 million \nwithin the Departments of Labor and Education, which is maintenance of \nthe level provided in 1995. We would like to have had more money, but \nthat was the best we could do considering the other cuts.\n  On nutrition programs for the elderly, for the congregate and Home-\nDelivered Meals Program, the bill provides almost $475 million. Within \nthis amount is $110.3 million for the Home-Delivered Meals Program, an \nincrease of $16.2 million over the 1995 appropriation because there are \nsuch long waiting lists, so many seniors who really depend upon this \nfor basic subsistence.\n  On education, we have allocated the full amount of the increase that \nour subcommittee received, some $1.6 billion. The bill does not contain \nall of the funds we would like to have provided, but it is a maximum \neffort on this important subject.\n  As to job training, Mr. President, we know all too well that high \nunemployment means a waste of valuable human resources, inevitably \ndepresses consumer spending, and weakens our economy. The bill before \nus today includes $3.4 billion for job training programs. And again, \ncandidly, I would like to see more, Mr. President, but this is the \nmaximum that we could allocate.\n  As to workplace safety, the bill contains an increase of $62 million \nover the amount recommended by the House for worker protection \nprograms. While progress has been made in this area, there are still \nfar too many work-related injuries and illnesses, and these funds will \nprovide programs and inspect businesses and industry, weed out \noccupational hazards, and protect worker pensions within reasonable \nbounds.\n  LIHEAP is a program which is very important, Mr. President, to much \nof America. It provides low-income heating and fuel assistance; 80 \npercent of those who receive LIHEAP assistance earn less than $7,000 a \nyear. It is a program which was zeroed out by the House, and we have \nreinstated it in this bill. We have effectively included a total of $1 \nbillion here, $100 million of which is carryover funds, as we \nunderstand the current state of affairs, although it is hard to get an \nexact figure, and an additional $900 million.\n  As the Congress consolidates and streamlines programs, Federal \nadministrative costs must also be downsized. In this bill, with the \nexception of the Social Security Administration, we have cut program \nmanagement an average of 8 percent. Many view administrative costs as \nwaste and others suggest that deeper cuts are justified. It is our \njudgment that any further reductions would be counterproductive.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank the extraordinary staffs \nwho have worked on this program. On the Senate side, Bettilou Taylor \nand Craig Higgins have been extraordinary and professional in taking \ninordinately complicated printouts and working through a careful \nanalysis of the priorities.\n  We received requests from many of our colleagues. And to the maximum \nextent, we have accommodated those requests. We have received many \nrequests from people around the country. We have accommodated as many \nrequests for personal meetings as we could, both with the Senators and \nwith their staffs. And we think this is a very significant bill.\n  There are people on both sides who have objected to provisions of the \nbill. When a motion to proceed is offered, it is my hope that we will \nproceed to take up this bill and that we will pass it. We are aware \nthat there has been the threat of a veto from the executive branch, and \nI invite the President or any of his officials to suggest improvements \nif they feel they can do it better.\n  There is a commitment in America to a balanced budget and, that is \nsomething we have to do. We have structured our program to have that \nbalanced budget within 7 years by the year 2002. The President talks \nabout a balanced budget within 9 years. I suggest that our targeting is \nthe preferable target.\n  To the extent people have suggestions on better allocations, we are \nprepared to listen, but this is our best judgment. We urge the Senate \nto proceed with this bill.\n  At this time I yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I inquire of the Presiding Officer, how \nmuch time does this side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 27 minutes 46 seconds remaining on \n\n[[Page S 14440]]\n  your side and there are 18 minutes remaining on the side of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I again thank my colleague, Senator \nSpecter, for his kind and generous remarks on my behalf. I want to \nrepay them in kind. Senator Specter is right, we have worked together \nfor many years. We have switched places, majority/minority, but that \nhas not in any way lessened or in any way changed our relationship. It \nis one of, I think, mutual respect and one in which we have worked \ntogether to try to fashion the best bill we possibly could, having been \ndealt a bad hand. So I commend Senator Specter and his staff for doing \nthe best possible job with the bad hand of cards that was dealt to us.\n  I especially want to draw attention to Senator Specter's efforts to \nrestore funding for rural health care and the health and safety \nprotections for workers, and especially his dogged determination to \nensure that we have funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram.\n  I also credit my colleague, Senator Specter, for stripping the bill \nof its many unnecessary and inappropriate legislative riders, matters \nthat ought rightfully to be taken up by the authorizing committees and \nnot by the Appropriations Committee.\n  Unfortunately, the committee did agree to include in this bill an \namendment on striker replacement, which has resulted in the situation \nwe find ourselves in today. I reluctantly agreed to this procedure \nsuggested by Senator Dole because I am strongly opposed to the striker \namendment and because, on the floor, the bill would have attracted \nscores of additional extremist legislative riders.\n  So, for the benefit of Senators, what we face right now is a vote on \nthe motion to proceed that will take place at 10 o'clock. That vote, \nreally, is a vote on whether or not we will have within this \nappropriations bill a rider that says that President Clinton cannot \nexecute his Executive order which bans corporations--and I will get \ninto the details of it later--bans companies having business with the \nFederal Government, contracts with the Federal Government, from \nreplacing legitimate strikers with permanent replacements.\n  We had a vote on this earlier this year and the vote failed, the \ncloture vote failed on that vote. So this is the same issue we have \nbefore us, whether or not the President can implement his Executive \norder on striker replacement or whether we will have this rider on the \nappropriations bill prohibiting that implementation. So, that is what \nis facing us right now, and that vote will take place at 10 o'clock.\n  Before I yield on the issue of striker replacement to my colleague \nfrom Minnesota and my colleague from Massachusetts, let me just say a \ncouple of words about the bill in front of us. As I said, Senator \nSpecter did a commendable job with the bad hand we were dealt, but I \nthink this chart really points out the problems that we have in dealing \nwith education, with health, with workers protection, with summer youth \nemployment, with low-income home energy heating assistance--all of the \nthings that are in this bill that help advance our country \neducationally, socially, and try to make life a little bit better and \ngive more opportunity to more people.\n  What we say is, over 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, our allocations and \nbudget authority increased by a little over 10 percent--about 15 \npercent--over those years. This year, our allocation has dropped back \nto where we were in 1992 in the House, 1993 in the Senate. So, because \nof this, we have a bill which cuts adult training programs by $167 \nmillion; reneges on our commitment to dislocated workers programs; it \neliminates the summer youth employment program; it cuts by 13 percent \nour efforts to combat waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare; it undermines \nour battle and fight in the war against drugs by cutting money for safe \nand drug-free schools. his bill cuts 48,000 children from the Head \nStart Program. It cuts the Goals 2000 Program well below the level \nproposed by the President. These are just some of the items that we had \nto cut and reduce because of the allocation that we had--all in the \nface of giving the Pentagon, I might add, $7 billion more than they \neven asked for.\n  The Pentagon gets $7 billion more than they even asked for, yet in \nprograms that are necessary for the health, safety, security, and \neducation of the people of this country, we have cut those $8 billion. \nThat is what we are confronted with.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I now want to turn to the issue of \nstriker replacement, the issue that is really before us on the vote at \n10 o'clock. I know the Senator from Minnesota wanted to speak on this, \nbut let me just set the stage for this.\n  The President issued an Executive order regarding the permanent \nreplacement of striking workers for companies that do business with the \nFederal Government. The President's action is fully lawful and within \nhis authority and conforms with the practice of previous Presidents, \nincluding President Bush, who used this authority twice during his 4 \nyears, and this Congress did not try to strip him of that power. And \nyet now this Congress wants to strip this President of his lawful right \nto issue this Executive order.\n\n  I would yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I \nwould also like to thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his \ngraciousness in letting me speak right now. He was first on the floor, \nand I appreciate him letting me have this opportunity.\n  Mr. President, let me follow up on the words of the Senator from \nIowa. Actually, not just President Bush has used such an Executive \norder but Roosevelt did, Truman did, Johnson did, Nixon did, and Bush \nhas. It is unfortunate that this amendment is in this bill, and I rise \nto object to the amendment and I rise to object to our proceeding on \nthis bill. We have had this debate before. We had a vote on this \nbefore, and I fully expect again today that we will have the vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  Mr. President, what the Executive order says is the Federal \nGovernment will no longer purchase goods and services from firms which \npermanently replace their workers in response to a lawful strike.\n  That is in the national and public interest because that has a lot to \ndo with what kind of contractors produce what kind of quality work for \nthis Nation.\n  In addition, it is a basic standard of fairness. It has to do with on \nwhich side is the Federal Government. I cannot understand for the life \nof me why the opposition to this protection for working people in this \ncountry. The pattern is clear. It is a pattern in Iowa, in Minnesota, \nin Massachusetts, in all across the country, and it is a pattern of \nsome companies. Thank goodness, a lot of companies are precisely the \nopposite in their modus operandi. A lot of companies understand that \nyou want to have cooperation between employees and employers, that that \nis the way to have high morale; it is the way to have high levels of \nproductivity. But in all too many cases, some of the bad apples force \nimpossible concessions onto their work force, which means that people \nhave wages on which they cannot support their families or they have to \nwork under conditions that threaten their very health, their life, and \ntheir limb, and therefore what happens is the employees have no other \nchoice but to go out on strike, which is precisely what the companies \nwant them to do because when they go out on strike they permanently \nreplace them.\n  The right to strike, which is part of the leverage of working people \nin this country, which is part of their right to bargain collectively, \nhas become the right to be fired. And so the President of the United \nStates of America has said the Federal Government is going to be on the \nside of working people. We are not going to do business with businesses \nthat force people out on strike and then permanently replace them. That \nis on the part of the President of the United States a positive and \npowerful message.\n  The reason I feel so strongly and am absolutely opposed to our \nproceeding on this bill and hope this amendment will be removed has to \ndo with the context of the times that we are living in, and the context \nis simple. The bottom 75 percent of the population feels the economic \nsqueeze--low wages, wages that are not living wages, working people \nlosing their bargaining power, more and more mergers, banks buying \n\n[[Page S 14441]]\nbanks, pharmaceutical companies buying pharmaceutical companies, more \nconcentration of power in the telecommunications industry, \nconglomerates dominating the economy.\n  Where do regular people fit into this equation? Cutbacks in \noccupational health and safety protection, cuts in Medicare and \nMedicaid and health care, cuts in protection for children. It seems to \nme that somewhere in the equation working families, the majority of \npeople of this country who do not own all the wealth and all the \ncapital and who are not the big players and do not make all the big \ncontributions ought to have some representation in the Senate.\n  I believe the President of the United States has through this \nExecutive order sent a positive and important message that he stands \nwith working families. I think we in the Senate who are opposed to this \namendment to defund this Executive order are sending the same message, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and to vote \nagainst the motion to proceed.\n  I thank both Senators for yielding me time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend and colleague from Iowa for yielding \nthe time, and I would yield myself 13 minutes.\n  On March 8, 1995, President Clinton took a dramatic and long overdue \nstep to put the federal government on the side of fair and efficient \nlabor relations. He issued an Executive order which makes it the policy \nof the executive branch to prohibit Federal contracts with employers \nwho permanently replace workers who exercise their lawful right to \nstrike.\n  It was the right thing to do, not just because it will promote better \nlabor relations among Federal contractors, but because it tells \nAmerica's workers that the Government will not let itself be used to \nhelp grind down their wages, break their unions, or punish them for \nasserting their legal rights.\n  Today, for the second time this session, we are debating a Republican \nattempt to block implementation of President Clinton's Executive order \nthrough a rider on an appropriations bill. Last March, we were \nsuccessful in preventing that effort. The attempt to block \nimplementation of the Executive order has no place on this or any other \nappropriations bill, and I hope the Senate will vote today to block \nthis bill as long as this rider is included.\n  If anything, the case for the Executive order is even stronger now \nthan it was in March. When we debated this issue 6 months ago on the \ndefense appropriations bill, we heard over and over again that we \nneeded to act because the President was usurping his authority, acting \ncontrary to law, even violating the constitutional separation of \npowers.\n  But since that time, those arguments have been heard in court and \nresoundingly rejected. On July 31, Judge Gladys Kessler of the Federal \ndistrict court for the District of Columbia upheld the Executive order \nagainst a challenge by the Chamber of Commerce and various other \nbusiness groups.\n  In her decision, Judge Kessler ruled that President Clinton acted \nwithin his authority over Federal procurement, that there is a close \nnexus between the Executive order and efficient procurement; and that \nthe Executive order does not conflict with the National Labor Relations \nAct. In other words, the court rejected all of the major arguments that \nhave been made against the Executive order.\n  The President has not abused or exceeded his legal authority. He has \nthe power, given him by Congress in the procurement laws, to deny \nFederal contracts to employers who use permanent replacements for \nstriking workers. And as the Federal court specifically found, the \nPresident's action does not change or conflict with the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  There is no merit to the argument that he has done an end run around \nthe Congress by trying to accomplish what the striker replacement bill \nhad failed to do. The Executive order is much more limited than the \nstriker replacement bill. The Order does not make the use of permanent \nreplacements illegal. It deals only with how the Government chooses its \nsuppliers of goods and services. And that, the court has ruled, is a \nmatter within the President's authority over the Government procurement \nprocess.\n  Judge Kessler found clear precedent for the striker replacement \nExecutive order in President Nixon's 1970 Executive order requiring \nbidders on federally assisted construction projects to submit an \naffirmative action plan, President Carter's Executive order requiring \ncompanies seeking Federal contracts to be bound by wage and price \ncontrols which were voluntary for everyone else, and President Bush's \nExecutive order requiring Federal contractors to post notices advising \nemployees of their right not to join a union.\n  Perhaps the most direct analog, she said, was the Executive order \nissued by President Bush in 1992, which required that contractors, as a \ncondition of securing contracts with the Federal Government, refrain \nfrom entering into perhire agreements with labor unions--even though \nthe Supreme Court has held that such agreements are legal and \npermissible under the National Labor Relations Act.\n  So let us hear no more that this is an unprecedented action by \nPresident Clinton and that somehow it exceeds his Executive authority. \nThere is ample precedent and ample authority for the President to take \nthis action. This is no different than the authority exercised by other \nPresidents before him, Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  The requirements imposed on Federal contractors by President Bush--\nbanning perhire labor agreements and requiring employees to be told \nthey didn't have to join a union--were never enacted by Congress. But \nwhen those orders were issued, were there any protests from my \nRepublican colleagues? The answer is no. In fact, many of my colleagues \ntook to the floor to applaud those actions. It is clear that the \nobjections that are now being raised to President Clinton's action are \nnot based on principle, or a consistent view of the President's \nauthority with respect to labor relations or Federal procurement. They \nare part of a persistent and unconscionable Republican attack on basic \nprotections for working men and women.\n  We see it in the relentless efforts by Republicans to repeal the \nDavis-Bacon Act, which helps to assure decent wages for hard-working \nconstruction workers who make, on average, $27,000 a year. We see it in \nthe Republican proposal now making its way through the Congress to roll \nback the earned income tax credit, and raise taxes for 39 million low-\nincome working Americans to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy. We see \nit in the attempt to open gaping holes in the pension laws to allow \ncompanies to raid billions of dollars from workers' pension funds. We \nsee it in the refusal of the Republican leadership to even allow a vote \non increasing the minimum wage, which in real terms is lower now than \nit has been at any time in the past 40 years.\n  Seven times since the enactment of the first Federal minimum wage law \nin 1938, bipartisan majorities of the Congress have reaffirmed the \nNation's commitment to working families by voting in favor of \nincreasing the minimum wage. Increases have been proposed and supported \nby Republican as well as Democratic Presidents. Six years ago, 89 \nSenators--including all but 8 of the Republican Senators--voted for a \nminimum wage increase of 90 cents, an increase identical to that which \nhas been proposed by President Clinton. Yet now we are not allowed to \neven vote on the issue. Republicans are for a minimum wage all right--\nthe minimum wage possible.\n  Republicans are for the right to strike, as well--as long as striking \nworkers can be permanently replaced--which means no real right to \nstrike at all.\n  We are prepared to move forward to consideration of important \nspending issues in this bill, and we should do that. But we are not \nprepared to acquiesce in letting this bill be used as a vehicle for yet \nanother attack on working families. And let us be clear--that is what \nthis vote is all about.\n  The basic principle behind the President's action has strong public \nsupport. \n\n[[Page S 14442]]\n In a recent poll, 64 percent of respondents said that once a majority \nof workers have voted to strike, companies should not be allowed to \nhire permanent replacements to take their jobs.\n  This is a question of simple justice for workers. If it is unlawful \nfor an employer to fire a worker for exercising the right to strike, it \nshould be equally unlawful for an employer to deprive a striking worker \nof his job by permanently replacing him.\n  Today, more than ever, employees need the right to organize to \nimprove their wages and working conditions, and to bargain with their \nemployers over those issues. There is no inconsistency between fair \nprofits for management and fair treatment for workers.\n\n  But the right to organize and bargain collectively is only a hollow \npromise if management is allowed to use the tactic of permanently \nreplacing workers who go on strike.\n  No one likes strikes--least of all the strikers, who lose their wages \nduring any strike and risk the loss of health coverage and other \nbenefits. Both workers and employers have a mutual interest in avoiding \neconomic losses. The overwhelming majority of collective bargaining \ndisputes are settled without a strike. But the right to strike is a \ncornerstone of our labor laws. It helps to ensure that a fair economic \nbargain is reached between management and labor.\n  The opponents of this Executive order plead that if employers do not \nhave the right to permanently replace workers who go on strike, their \nonly alternative is to go out of business. But hundreds of strikes \noccur and are settled every year without workers being permanently \nreplaced, and without businesses being permanently damaged. These \nstrikes are settled through precisely the process that our labor laws \nare designed to encourage--serious, meaningful give-and-take between \nthe parties, to negotiate a solution that both sides can accept. That \nis the kind of outcome that President Clinton is encouraging through \nthis Executive order.\n  The recent experience of workers on strike against the Tiffany Office \nFurniture Co. in Conway, AR--a company with major contracts with the \nFederal Government--is a good illustration of the positive benefits of \nthe Executive order. Members of the Southern Council of Industrial \nWorkers struck the company on June 6 after rejecting a contract that \namong other things, would have cut certain health benefits. \nNegotiations were going nowhere, and the company appeared headed toward \nhiring permanent replacements when an officer of the union learned \nabout the President's Executive order.\n  On July 7, the union officer sent a letter to the company on \nexplaining the Executive order. He told the local newspaper, ``from \nthat point forward there was concentrated settlement discussion.'' \nWithin 2 weeks the parties had reached agreement on a contract that \npreserved health benefits with a reasonable cost-sharing arrangement \nfor coverage of family members and for the first time gave workers a \nretirement program.\n  Instead of the pain, economic hardship and emotional suffering for \nworkers, their families and their communities that inevitably occurs \nwhen strikers are permanently replaced, union officials report that \nwhat has been gained is a mutual respect between the workers and the \ncompany and a resumption of normal relations with a firm foundation for \nthe future.\n  That is a perfect illustration of why it is both important and \nappropriate for the President to use his executive authority to ban the \nuse of permanent replacements by federal contractors. Hiring permanent \nreplacements encourages intransigence by management in negotiations \nwith labor. It encourages employers to replace current workers with \nless experienced workers willing to settle for less--and to accept \nsmaller paychecks and other benefits. Clearly that practice has a \nnegative impact on the efficiency and quality of performance on Federal \ncontracts.\n  The Executive order helps restore the balance that has been lost in \nrecent years.\n  It is particularly distressing for us to be spending this time \ndebating an ill-conceived extraneous rider on labor law, instead of \naddressing the important challenges on issues that belong in this \nappropriations measure. I want to address two of these issues here--the \nunacceptable cuts in education, and the cuts in job training proposed \nby our Republican colleagues in this bill.\n  These are difficult days for children, students, and working \nfamilies. On Tuesday of this week, Republicans slashed college student \nloans by $10 billion over 7 years. Now they propose to cut federal \neducation spending by an additional $2.4 billion next year and $40 \nbillion by the year 2002--all to help pay for a $245 billion tax break \nfor the wealthy.\n  This is no time to be cutting education. Our schools are filling with \nmore students than ever before. Total public school enrollment is \nprojected to rise from 45 million in 1995 to 50 million by 2005--an \nincrease of 10 percent. In the face of this surge in enrollment, it \nmakes no sense to slash funding for education. Increased funding is \nnecessary just to maintain the same level of services, let alone \nprovide the wise investment we need to improve education and build a \nstronger future for the Nation.\n  We should not turn our backs on education just as the nation is \nbeginning to reap the benefits of a better educated work force. More \nstudents are finishing high school, more students are entering college, \nand more students are graduating from college than ever before. The \nBureau of Labor Statistics estimates that about 20 percent of income \ngrowth during the last 20 years can be attributed to students going \nfurther in school. We can build on this record by investing more in \neducation, not less.\n  Slashing education in today's economy is like cutting defense in the \nmiddle of the cold war. To be successful in the years ahead, young men \nand women need communication skills and problem-solving skills. They \nneed a grasp of basic scientific and math concepts. They need a \nfamiliarity with computers, and the ability to work as part of a team.\n  As technology changes and economic competition brings the world \ncloser together, the demand for better-educated workers is growing, and \nthe demand for workers with lower skills is declining. In the last \ndecade, jobs for those with low levels of education grew by only 7 \npercent, while employment in high-skill occupations increased by an \nimpressive 32 percent. These unwise cuts will affect real students in \nreal schools in real communities throughout the country.\n  As States across the Nation recognize the urgency of school reform, \nit makes no sense to reduce Federal funds designed to encourage such \nreforms. Yet 1,600 of the 9,000 schools participating in the Goals 2000 \nprogram will lose funds under this Republican amendment.\n  Drug use by students is on the rise and too many students are victims \nof crime in their schools. Yet Republicans are cutting funds that \nsupport 97 percent of communities and make it possible for 39 million \nstudents to learn in safe and drug-free schools.\n  Preschool enrollment has doubled, giving children a better chance to \nenter school ready to learn. Yet Republicans are cutting $132 million \nfrom Head Start.\n  The achievement gap between students in poor and wealthy schools is \nnarrowing. Yet Republican cuts will deny assistance to 650,000 \ndisadvantaged students.\n  High school graduates are obtaining better job training, finding \nbetter jobs, and earning more in those jobs. Yet Republicans are \ncutting $83 million from vocational education and $867 million from \nsummer jobs to help youths and adults gain job skills and pursue more \nproductive careers in a changing economy.\n  The issue is priorities. It makes no sense to reduce education \ninvestments needed to improve the lives of students and working \nfamilies. It makes even less sense to do so in order to pay for tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society.\n  As was pointed out earlier in the course of this debate, over the \nperiod of the last months there has been a series of attacks on the \nrights of working men and women in this country. First, there was the \nattempt to cancel out the Davis-Bacon Act. That attempt would \neffectively guarantee for construction workers, who work 1,700 hours in \nthe course of a year, that their \n\n[[Page S 14443]]\naverage income of $27,000 will diminish, and attacks their livelihood.\n  There has been a resistance by our Republican colleagues and friends \nto raise the minimum wage so that men and women who work 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, are able to provide bread on their table, a roof \nover their house, the mortgage payments, and clothes for their \nchildren, to make work honorable, respectable, and to make work pay.\n  They not only resist increasing the minimum wage, they want to turn \nback on the earned income tax credit. Who is eligible for that? Those \nworking families that are prepared to work, are working, and they make \nless than $26,000 a year.\n  Attack on the Davis-Bacon Act; attack on the minimum wage; attack on \nthe EITC; and an attack on educating the children of those working \nfamilies, as we saw in the Labor Committee this past week, by putting \nan additional tax on the scholarship assistance that the sons and \ndaughters of working families receive. The more they need in terms of \nstudent assistance, the higher the tax is on them and on their schools. \nThat is fundamentally wrong.\n  We are also seeing an attack on the parents of those working families \nin the Finance Committee by decreasing the coverage of their parents \nunder the Medicare system. That will mean more copayments, more premium \nincreases, and an increase in the deductibles. That is what is \nhappening for working men and women in this country at the hands of \nthis Republican Congress.\n  President Clinton has stood up for them with this particular \nprovision, and now we have the attempt to try to deny these individuals \nwho are trying to provide work for their families their right to be \nable to be included in the job market.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think we ought to recognize what has \nhappened to the Nation's commitment to education in the underlying \nbill. The job done by Senator Harkin and Senator Specter has been \nsuperb in trying to take scarce resources and focus them on the areas \nof greatest need in terms of our national investment.\n  But there is still a serious cutback on the basic Head Start Program, \nwhich tries to enhance the opportunities for young children to develop \nthe kinds of competence and skills to project them into the early years \nof education;\n  Cutbacks on the chapter 1 program that targets needy children for \nspecial help and assistance that was reshaped last year with strong \nbipartisan support;\n  The denial of the 90 percent of the Federal funds that would be \navailable to the States at the local community level to help enhance \nthe academic achievements at the elementary and secondary education \nlevel with Goals 2000;\n  The reduction in the School-to-Work Program to take three-quarters of \nthe kids that do not go on to college, and to give them some additional \nopportunity to get into gainful employment.\n  All of these programs have been reduced.\n  The absolute abandonment of the commitment for the Summer Jobs \nProgram--this is in the wake of the debate on the Welfare Reform \nProgram, where we are talking about trying to get people off welfare \nand into employment. Under President Bush, we had 872,000 summer jobs. \nThey have been zeroed out under the Republican program, zeroed out.\n  How can we, on one day, talk about getting people off welfare, \nbuilding a work ethic, and trying to get them involved in jobs, and on \nthe next day effectively wipe that program out? In the wake of what \nthis Congress did in the welfare debate and the kind of commitment we \nhad to summer jobs under President Bush, how can we zero out this \nprogram now? It makes no sense whatsoever. That is what has been done \nin the appropriations recommendation.\n  So, Mr. President, the issue that is before us is fundamental and \nbasic to working families, to their education, to their own income, and \nto the future, I believe, of this country.\n  It is difficult to exaggerate the short-sighted Republican priority \nthat would short-change education. Education has been the essence of \nthe American dream and the core of the American experience from the \nbeginning of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, there is one wonderful quote that I came across and, \nas a matter of fact, reread yesterday, by the former Senator from \nMassachusetts, Daniel Webster, when he made this extraordinary speech \nin Faneuil Hall to give testimony upon the deaths of John Adams and \nThomas Jefferson. He made this point--I came across it again yesterday, \nand it was appropriate at a time that our Human Resources Committee was \ndenying and making it more difficult for the children of working \nAmericans to obtain a higher education. But it is also applicable as we \nconsider the appropriations bill now that is before us.\n  Over a century and a half ago, Daniel Webster made the point about \nthe importance of education in his famous oration on the lives and \nservice of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Both of those two great \nPresidents died on the same day, on July 4, 1826. On August 2 of that \nyear, Daniel Webster spoke about them in Faneuil Hall in Boston, about \ntheir leadership and example on education.\n\n       But the cause of knowledge, in a more enlarged sense, the \n     cause of general knowledge and of popular education, had no \n     warmer friends, nor more powerful advocates, than Mr. Adams \n     and Mr. Jefferson. On this foundation they knew the whole \n     republican system rested; and this great and all-important \n     truth they strove to impress, by all the means in their \n     power. In the early publication already referred to, Mr. \n     Adams expresses the strong and just sentiment, that the \n     education of the poor is more important, even to the rich \n     themselves, than all their own riches. On this great truth, \n     indeed, is founded that unrivaled, that invaluable political \n     and moral institution, our own blessing and the glory of our \n     fathers, the New England system of free schools.\n\n  That was true for New England schools in the early years of our \nNation. It is true for schools all across America today, and no bill \nthat contains deep cuts in funds for schools deserves to pass.\n  This bill also deserves to be defeated for a further reason. It is an \nunconscionable attack on the dreams and aspirations of millions of \nworking families across the country and their hopes for the future. I \nam talking about the fundamental tools, the building blocks, we have \ncrafted in a bipartisan manner, in good faith, to provide realistic \nhope of the opportunity that comes with a decent job.\n  This bill breaks that faith. For example it proposes drastic cuts in \nthe Summer Youth Program. This program has historically received strong \nbipartisan support. It began in 1964, and has been providing jobs for \nlow-income youth for over 30 years under both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. In fact, it reached its highest level of assistance to \nyoung people under President Bush in 1992, when it provided summer jobs \nfor 782,000 young men and women.\n  Even at this high water mark, we were barely beginning to meet the \nreal need that exists. With over 8 million eligible youth across the \ncountry, deserving participants are far more numerous than we have \npositions for. In recognition of budget constraints, the current \nprogram is already 25 percent smaller than it was under President Bush. \nIn 1995 we are serving 600,000 youth, and we anticipate reaching \n550,000 in 1996 under President Clinton's funding request. That level \nrepresents jobs for only 6 percent of the eligible population. It is a \npriceless opportunity for the few who get to participate. We ought to \nbe doing more, not less. It is unconscionable to do nothing.\n  All Senators know in their States that there are communities, towns \nand cities full of youths looking for this ray of hope. The Summer Jobs \nProgram reaches out and provides their first experience with a job. \nMany have parents who are not working. Many live in areas where there \nare few opportunities to find employment, even for a short time. These \nsummer jobs can make all the differences in their lives.\n  In our recent debate over welfare reform, there were many harsh \ncomments about welfare dependence and lack of responsibility and the \nneed to get these people a job. Everyone agrees that these people, as \nthey are callously described, need employable skills so that they can \nget a job and perform effectively. It is ironic that in one of the \nfirst pieces of legislation we consider after the welfare debate, the \nRepublican majority proposes to tear down a \n\n[[Page S 14444]]\nprogram which can provide the very skills we all agree are needed for \nsuccessful employment. They call their reform tough love--but it would \nmore appropriately be called tough hate.\n  Some of the most virulent and most ideological critics claim that all \nprograms like the Summer Jobs Program are ineffective.\n  They think Government has no business spending tax dollars on welfare \nfor individuals--the only welfare they support is corporate welfare. \nLook at what the Department of Labor's inspector general said after his \noffice analyzed the Summer Jobs Program.\n\n       The work projects are worthwhile. Summer jobs are real, not \n     make-work. Kids were closely supervised, learned new skills \n     they could apply to their school work, and took pride in \n     their employment.\n\n  Westat, Inc., a private research company, reported similar positive \nfindings after undertaking a study of the program. A survey of \nsupervisors involved with the program indicated no serious problems \nrelating to behavior, attendance, or turnover by the youths in the \nprogram. The bottom line is, this program works and yet it is now \nfacing elimination by the Republican majority in Congress.\n  In Massachusetts, we will lose over 13,000 summer jobs. Boston youth \nwill lose over 1,500 job opportunities, Springfield teenagers will lose \nanother 1,200 jobs. Where will they turn? The private sector plays an \nimportant role in providing summer employment--but they are the first \nto tell us they cannot possibly fill the gap for the hundreds of \nthousands of young men and women looking for work and experience. The \nyouth who don't get jobs will more likely turn to the very elements we \nare hoping they can avoid--crime, gangs, drugs, welfare, and \nunemployment.\n  Where is the hope for the youths on the street with nothing to do but \nhang out on the corner and watch the drug buys occur? Where is the hope \nfor the teenager who is fighting the temptations of the gangs but is \nunemployed? Where is the hope for the young men and women who want to \ngraduate from high school and get a job--but have no idea what it takes \nto get a job and keep it?\n  So far in this Congress we have seen the Republican majority turn its \nback on the Nation's youth in many ways. Unprecedented cuts in student \naid, the elimination of funds for the AmeriCorps National Service \nProgram, deep cuts in the School-to-Work Program, deep cuts in \neducation funds for disadvantaged pupils, the elimination of summer \njobs. Again and again we ask, where is the hope? Where is the heart?\n  This bill should be a creator of hope, not a destroyer of hope. It is \na deeply flawed bill that doesn't deserve to pass, and I urge the \nSenate to oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis eloquent remarks and for his longstanding and strong support for \nthe working people of this country.\n  There is no one in this Senate and in this Congress who has stood up \nmore over a longer period of time and who has spoken more forcefully \nand eloquently for the working people than the Senator from \nMassachusetts. What the Senator just said in his closing remarks \nregarding the leadership of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams in \neducation really had to bring it home to us again here today what we \nare doing.\n  Mr. President, again, to repeat for Senators, what we are facing \nright now is a vote at 10 o'clock on a motion to proceed. I am opposed \nto that motion to proceed because of the inclusion in the Labor, Health \nand Human Services appropriations bill of a rider, a rider that says \nthat President Clinton cannot implement his Executive order regarding \npermanent replacement of striking workers.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment restricting the \nimplementation of President Clinton's Executive order regarding \npermanent replacements for striking workers. First of all, the \nPresident's action is entirely lawful, fully within his authority, and \nconforms with the practice of previous Republican Presidents in labor \nissues. And perhaps more importantly, instead of passing such an \namendment we should be saluting the leadership of the President in \nproviding a good degree of protection for workers that Congress failed \nto enact last year in the striker replacement bill.\n  Under the Executive order, American workers in companies doing \nbusiness of over $100,000 with the Federal Government can finally be \nassured that they will not be permanently replaced if they go out on \nstrike. While that represents only 10 percent of all contracts, this \norder will affect 90 percent of Federal contract dollars.\n  The proponents of the amendment to nullify this claim that they are \ntrying to maintain the power of the Congress over this matter. But it \nis clear that Congress has already acted to give the President this \npower, in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. \nWe have spoken on this issue and this amendment is just an attempt to \nsecond-guess the President on an issue that is fully within his \nauthority. President Bush used the same statutory authority to issue \ntwo Executive orders concerning labor. Yet we didn't hear our \ncolleagues on the other side of the isle complaining then.\n  Furthermore, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \nrejected a challenge to the President Clinton's Executive order on \nstriker replacement on July 31, 1995. Specifically, the court held:\n  First, President Clinton acted within his procurement authority;\n  Second, there is a close nexus between the Executive order and \nefficient procurement; and\n  Third, Executive Order 12954 does not conflict with the National \nLabor Relations Act.\n  In other words, the court rejected all of the major arguments that \nhave been made against the Executive order. The President has not \nabused or exceeded his legal authority--he has the power, given him by \nCongress in the procurement laws, to deny Federal contracts to \nemployers who use permanent replacements for strikers.\n  In addition, there is no merit to the argument that he has done an \nend run around the Congress by trying to accomplish what the striker \nreplacement bill had failed to do. President Clinton's Executive order \nis much more limited than S. 55, and deals only with how the Government \nchooses its suppliers of goods and services. The order does not attempt \nto change the National Labor Relations Act or outlaw the use of \npermanent replacements for strikers. It governs their use only with \nrespect to the narrow class of Federal contractors.\n  Nobody has a right to receive a Federal contract. As one contracting \nparty, we can insist on any conditions we choose. The findings of the \nExecutive order state that prolonged labor disputes adversely affect \ncosts of operations. Employers who want to insist on their right to \npermanently replace striking workers can do so--they just can't get \nFederal contracts.\n  The Executive order simply raises the stakes in a company decision, \nand will hopefully convince some companies to rethink their decision to \nhire permanent replacement workers. It is too easy for companies to \nthink that they can help their bottom line by taking advantage of their \nworkers. This only says that there is a price that must be paid.\n  Sometimes I wish the majority would go ahead and propose a law \nbanning strikes entirely--it would be more honest than what they are \ntrying to do here, again, today. A right to strike is a right to be \npermanently replaced. Every cut-rate, cutthroat employer knows they can \nbreak a union if they are willing to play hardball and ruin the lives \nof the people who have made their company what it is.\n  Workers deserve better. Workers aren't disposable assets that can be \nthrown away when labor disputes arise. When we were considering the \nstriker replacement bill last year, the Senate Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources heard poignant testimony about the emotional and \nfinancial hardships that are caused by the hiring of permanent \nreplacement workers. We heard of workers losing their homes and going \nwithout health insurance due to the costs of COBRA coverage, as well as \nthe feelings of uselessness that workers often feel when they are \npermanently replaced after years of loyal, and efficient service.\n  The right to strike--which we all know is an action taken as a last \nresort, for no worker takes the financial \n\n[[Page S 14445]]\nrisk of a strike lightly--is fundamental to preserving workers' right \nto bargain for better wages and better working conditions. And recent \nstudies have shown that the stagnation we have seen in middle-class \nstandards of living is closely correlated with the decline of unions, \nand the loss of meaningful bargaining power.\n  At the same time, workers are losing the benefits that unions were \nable to negotiate. Since 1981, fewer workers have health insurance, \npensions, paid vacations, paid rest time, paid holidays, and other \nbenefits. Without the bargaining power of a union, companies provide \nthese benefits only out of the goodness of their hearts. And without \nthe right to strike--a right that is theoretically guaranteed by law, \nbut that, in fact, is totally undermined by permanent replacements--the \nunions have no bargaining power either. What does it mean to tell \nworkers, ``you have the right to strike,'' when exercising that right \nmeans that you can be summarily fired?\n  This is not about whether a company has to close its doors in the \nface of a strike. This only concerns the permanent replacement of \nstrikers. Permanent replacements are given special priority in their \nnew jobs--placing new hires above people with seniority and experience. \nWe aren't suggesting that replacement workers can't compete for jobs--\nthey just should not get special rights, over and above those of the \nworkers who have devoted their lives to the company.\n\n  As a nation we have a choice--continue down the path of lower wages, \nlower productivity, and fewer organized workers or to take the option \npursued by our major economic competitors, of cooperation, high wages, \nhigh skills, and high productivity. If we want to pursue that high \nskill path, we must do it with an organized work force. We can't do it \nwith the destructive management practices of the past decade such as \nthe threat of hiring replacement workers.\n  Federal contractors must have stable and productive labor-management \nrelations if they are to produce the best quality goods in a timely and \nreliable way. The use of permanent replacement workers destroys \ncooperative and stable labor-management relations. Research has found \nthat strikes involving permanent replacements last seven times longer \nthan strikes that don't involve permanent replacements.\n  Using permanent replacements means trading experienced, skilled \nemployees for inexperienced employees who labor at the bottom of the \nlearning curve. For Federal contracts, we don't want the industrial \nequivalents of rookies and minor leaguers making tires for our next \nDesert Storm.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the Senate to oppose this amendment. I \nthink it is a distraction from this important appropriations bill \nbefore us. I intend to fight this effort every step of the way, to \nreturn the right to strike to at least some of America's workers.\n  Under this Executive order, American workers and companies doing \nbusiness over $100,000 with the Federal Government can finally be \nassured that they will not be permanently replaced if they go out on \nstrike. While that represents only 10 percent of all contracts, this \norder will affect 90 percent of Federal contract dollars.\n  Opponents of the amendment can nullify this, claim that they are \ntrying to maintain the power of Congress. But Congress already gave the \nPresident this power in the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act of 1949. The Senator from Minnesota said every President \nsince President Truman has exercised this authority. President Bush \nused the same authority to issue two Executive orders concerning labor. \nYet, we did not hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ncomplaining at that time.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, the U.S. district court \nrejected a challenge to President Clinton's Executive order on July 31 \nof this summer of 1995. Specifically, the court held, first, that \nPresident Clinton acted within his procurement authority; second, there \nis a close nexus between the Executive order and efficient procurement; \nand, third, that Executive Order 12994 does not conflict with the \nNational Labor Relations Act. In other words, the court rejected all of \nthe major arguments that have been made against the Executive order.\n  The President has not abused or exceeded his legal authority. He has \nthe power, given by Congress, to deny Federal contracts to employers \nwho use permanent replacements for strikers.\n  In addition, there is no merit to the argument that he has done an \nend run around Congress by trying to accomplish what S. 55, the striker \nreplacement bill, tried to do and which did not pass here.\n  I might point out again for the record, S. 55 had a majority of votes \non the Senate floor, enough to pass, to ban the permanent replacement \nof strikers. We just could not get the 60 votes to break the \nfilibuster. Again, this order does not attempt to change the RLA or the \nNational Labor Relations Act, or outlaw the use of permanent \nreplacements for strikers. It is used narrowly affecting only Federal \ncontracts.\n  Mr. President, no one has a right to receive a Federal contract. As \none contracting party, the Federal Government can insist on conditions, \nand that is the condition that President Clinton has insisted on, that \nif you do business of over $100,000, if it is a contract over that \namount, you cannot permanently replace legitimate, legal strikers.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will reserve that minute and a half.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my hope that we will proceed to \ntake up the pending bill. It is obviously difficult procedurally to \ncomplete this bill before the end of the fiscal year, and it is already \na matter of public record that arrangements have been made between the \nexecutive branch and the congressional leaders to have a continuing \nresolution, which is to be considered by the House of Representatives \ntoday and probably by the Senate today, to cover, on a temporary basis, \nthe matters within this appropriations bill. And it is obvious that \neven if we could complete the Senate bill before the end of the fiscal \nyear on September 30, we could not finish a conference in time. So the \ncontinuing resolution is the way that we will have to resolve these \nmatters for now.\n  Still, as a matter of protocol and as a matter of form, we in the \nSenate ought to take up this bill at some point and debate the measures \nand come to a resolution. With respect to the provision on striker \nreplacement, that is a long, complex subject which has been on the \nfloor of the Senate on many, many occasions.\n  My own view is that there is a question as to the Executive authority \non striker replacement in the context that the Congress has refused to \nact. But whatever that situation may be, it is my view that it is not \nappropriate to deal with this matter on an appropriations bill. In the \nfull committee the striker replacement provision was reinstated in the \nbill to prohibit the use of any Federal funds to implement or enforce \nthe President's Executive order. And it is unlikely that there are \nsufficient votes to terminate a filibuster. My own sense is that the \nissue will have to await action on another day. As I say, I think it \npreferable that such legislative matters not be taken up on an \nappropriations bill.\n  It is currently 9:44. We have some substantial time remaining for \nargument. I invite my colleagues on the Republican side to come to the \nfloor if anyone has any arguments which he or she wishes to make.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 15 minutes \n30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, Senator Harkin has about \n1\\1/2\\ minutes, and then there is the time on the other side. I \nunderstand we are going to be voting at 10 in any event. I would like \nto--if there are other speakers, obviously they could speak--but I \nwould like to talk, perhaps enter into a dialog with the Senator from \nIowa just about some of the education provisions of the legislation. \nBut I am more than glad to, if there are other Senators that want to \naddress it----\n\n[[Page S 14446]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield to Senator Harkin and Senator Kennedy 4 minutes \nof my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was just interested in something the Senator from Iowa \npointed out during our markup in the Human Resources Committee on the \nissue of education. In this legislation we are talking about the \nsupport of the Federal Government for elementary and secondary \neducation. This past week we talked about higher education. And the \nSenator, I thought, made a very interesting point about where we were \nin this country in terms of the deficit versus GNP at the time of the \nend of World War II when we went ahead and provided education grants to \nthe sons and daughters of working families under the GI bill. And I \nunderstood from that discussion and debate that we had that every \ndollar that was actually invested in education returned eight times--\neight times--to the Federal Treasury.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator find in his own analysis of the \ninvestment in the kind of programs that we are talking about here in \nthe education programs in this appropriation bill, that we get not only \nthe dollar return for the investment in our young people and raising \nthe academic achievement and accomplishment, hopefully, in our schools, \nthat it is a sound economic investment as well as an investment in the \nyoung people of the country?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely right. You know, we keep \nhearing we have this big Federal debt, that we have to take care of it. \nWe all want to take care of it and reduce the deficit and get a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. President, the point I made in the committee the other day was \nthat, after World War II we had a similar situation. The national debt \nwas 110 percent of our gross national product--110 percent. Today, it \nis about 70 percent. Our debt is about 70, 75 percent of our gross \nnational product.\n  They say we have to reduce our debt. I agree with that. The same \nsituation confronted us in World War II. Did we stick our head in the \nsand and say no, we have to hunker down? No. We have to invest and \ninvest in education. We have got all the GI's. We did not loan them \nmoney. We gave them money. We built student housing all over the \ncountry for them to live in. As the Senator from Massachusetts said, \nthey paid this country back to the tune of 8 to 1. And it spurred the \ngreatest economic growth this country has ever seen.\n  So, you want to get out of debt in this country? We better start \ninvesting in education. We are now reaping the harvest of the seeds \nthat we have failed to plant over the last 30 years. When I first came \nto Congress in the 1970's, the Federal Government's share of elementary \nand secondary education was about 12 percent of the total amount of \nmoney. At that time there was a proposal that we have a one-third, one-\nthird, one-third sharing of the cost of education. The Federal \nGovernment provided one-third, States one-third, and local governments \none-third for elementary and secondary education.\n  The Federal Government, as I said at that time, was about 12 percent \nof total. You know what it is today, Mr. President? Less than 6 \npercent. We are going in the wrong direction. It has been going down \never since. We wonder why? We wonder why our schools are not producing \nbetter students? Why we are not becoming more competitive in the world \nmarkets? Why we are not reducing the deficit? Talk about the dumbing \ndown of America. It is because Congress is not fulfilling its \nresponsibility to invest in the education of this country. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is absolutely right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator agree with me that money is not \nnecessarily the answer to all our education problems, but it is a clear \nindication about where a nation's priorities are? And that every dollar \nthat we cut back, whether it is reaching out to a Head Start child in \ntrying to help and assist them develop confidence and skills or \nreaching out to helping teachers and parents at the local level, or \nproviding the income contingency repayments for college loans, that for \nevery dollar we cut from them, that we will be expending more in terms \nof social services to try to deal with the social problems that are \ncreated?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Iowa that \nthe 4 minutes yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I note the arrival of the Senator from New Hampshire on \nthe floor. I had yielded time earlier, but we do have a speaker. I now \nyield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for yielding time on this issue before \nus which arrives here because of the concern of Members from the other \nthe side of the aisle about the issue of the President's order on \nstriker replacement. That is why we are having this not necessarily \nunique, but certainly not all that common, exercise of the vote coming \nup on the matter to proceed.\n  The amendment in the bill that has generated this activity is an \namendment that I offered in committee and which was adopted in \ncommittee that would essentially not allow the President to go forward \nto enforce his order on striker replacement.\n  Now, the other side has already discussed at some length this issue. \nBut let me make two points which I think need to be made.\n  First, the President's order is clearly in violation, in my humble \nopinion and I think a lot of other people's opinion in this body, of \nthe separation of powers. It does not lie in the President's \nprerogative to step forward into this arena and unilaterally take \naction which is basically a legislative action which is exactly what \nthe President's Executive order has done. Therefore, on that count \nalone, people should be voting in favor of proceeding because, if you \ndo not, you are basically voting to transfer power from the legislative \nbranch to the executive branch.\n  More important, however, is the issue of what is the underlying \nphilosophy of this action taken by the President. We have heard a great \ndeal of representation on the other side that this action was taken out \nof concern for working Americans, that it is an attempt to put working \nAmericans on some sort of level playing field in the area of dealing \nwith management.\n  Nothing could be less accurate, of course. The fact is, this action \nwas a crass political action taken by an administration which had a \ndebt to a special interest group. The special interest group happened \nto be organized labor, in this instance, and as one of the first \npaybacks to organized labor which had given it literally hundreds and \nhundreds of thousands of dollars, not only to the President's campaign, \nbut to the campaigns of Members of the other party, they immediately \ntook an action which abrogated a law and activity in labor which had \nbeen in place since 1938.\n  I guess it may be it is the other party's position that since 1938 we \nhave had laws unfair to labor and they should have been changed for the \nlast 50 years or so since they have been in place. The fact is, those \nlaws have been in place for the last 50 years. Labor has functioned \nrather effectively in this Nation as a force for its organized \nmembership, and management has also been able to function under the \ncloak of the present law as it existed for the last 50-some-odd years. \nTherefore, it seems to me that the playing field was not unlevel but \nhad reached a rather good equilibrium between management and labor.\n  What the administration is trying to do in this unilateral act is to \ncreate an unlevel playing field, not for the purposes of protecting \nsome beaten down group of individuals, but rather for the purposes of \nprotecting its own interest in running for reelection and getting \ncontributions and support from what happens to be a very specific \nspecial interest group in this Nation.\n  So this is purely special interest group pork-barrel politics is what \nit amounts to essentially. So if you want to vote against what amounts \nto labor pork or social pork, as it might be defined here, then you \nshould not be supporting the administration's position \n\n[[Page S 14447]]\non this, you should be opposing it, because that is what this piece of \nlegislation represents. It is a payoff to a special interest group. \nNothing more, nothing less. And it was done in the crassest political \nway.\n  Furthermore, it was done in a way which violates very clearly the \nseparation of powers which are so important, I note, to a couple of \ngentlemen who had been pointed out earlier in the discussion--John \nAdams and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom I suspect, were they here \ntoday, would be rather upset at the idea that the executive branch \nwould be issuing an order which clearly is legislative in nature. It \nwas, after all, they who, along with James Madison, designed the \nconcept of separation of powers in order to have a balance among the \nexecutive and the legislative and, obviously, the judicial branches, \nwhich has been totally usurped by this action taken by the President.\n  So this is not some cause which has any right on its side, it is a \ncause that has special interest on its side and which affronts the \nseparation of powers issue. Therefore, I strongly suggest that we not \nsupport the action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Hampshire has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the other side has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield time to me?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield my 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the provision restricting the President's \npower on issuing his Executive order has no place on this \nappropriations bill. It is legislation on an appropriations bill. The \nproper place is to follow the procedures of the Senate and to legislate \nin the authorizing committee. This is just another effort to \nshortchange and effectively undermine the legitimate interests of \nworkers as protected by the Executive order.\n  The legitimacy of the Executive order has been upheld in the courts \nand follows very careful precedents, which have been outlined.\n  This provision does not deserve to be on this appropriations bill. It \nought to be stripped off the appropriations bill so that the whole \nissue of the education programs that affect the young people of this \ncountry can be fully and adequately debated.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will not move toward the consideration \nof this legislation until we strip this unwarranted, unjustified attack \non workers from the appropriations bill.\n  I yield back the remaining seconds of our time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am a little distressed. I understand we \nare not going to be able to take up some amendments that I believe \nshould be taken up on this bill. I, at least, want to get into the \nRecord, in the hopes some of these things can be addressed in \nconference, my strong feeling about a couple amendments.\n  The Exon amendment, Coats amendment, and the Smith amendments address \nthe same thing, and that is just a modest and overdue measure to get \nGovernment out of the business of promoting and subsidizing abortions. \nIt is my understanding that under section 512, if not enacted, \nobstetrics and gynecology residents' programs will be required to \nperform abortions including late-term abortions. Residents with moral \nor religious objections who wish to opt out of performing abortions \nshould be required to explain why in a way that satisfies stringent and \nexplicit criteria. I am very much concerned about that. We have debated \nthis issue over and over again. However, I am hoping this is something \nthat will be taken up in conference.\n  The second thing is the amendment to defund Goals 2000, the Education \nAct. Under this program, Federal intrusiveness reaches a new height. \nThe Goals 2000 creates tighter and more definite links between State, \nFederal and local levels and makes it easier for the Department of \nEducation to tamper with local schools. The Goals 2000 is the idea that \nthe Federal Government should be involved in creating and certifying \nstandards for education and determining official knowledge.\n  I think if there is anything that has been very evident during the \nelections of November, it was a trend to get Government out of things, \nnot in things, to get the Washington influence out of our lives instead \nof in our lives.\n  I certainly hope that we will be able to take up some measure at some \npoint, perhaps in conference, to do away with the Goals 2000 program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oklahoma has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just by way of brief comment on the Goals \n2000 program, that is a matter which is going to be subject to very \nsubstantial debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate. With my lead, we \nhave funded Goals 2000 because of a view that standards and goals are \nnecessary for education.\n  Way back in 1983, when Terrel Bell was Secretary of Education, there \nwas a report about the crisis of education in America. It may be that \nwe can remove further Federal limitations and Federal restraints within \nthe Goals 2000 bill, but I strongly believe that we need to have goals.\n  The goals which are present are voluntary. The States may put on \ntheir own goals if they choose to do so. That is entirely within the \ndiscretion of the State. But education is an enormous problem in \nAmerica. If we really had a generation of educated Americans, it would \ngo to the cure of many of our very basic problems: Problems of teenage \npregnancy, problems of welfare, problems of crime, problems of job \ntraining. It would all be surmounted if we had adequate education. I \nbelieve that Goals 2000, first adopted under a Republican President, \nPresident Bush, carried forward in this administration, is very, very \nimportant for America. This is not the time to get into extensive \ndebate, but I look forward to an opportunity to discuss this at an \nappropriate time with my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). All time has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to use a few minutes of \nleader time prior to the vote.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senators Specter and Harkin for the \neffort they have made to do what they could with this piece of \nlegislation. At the same time, I think everyone needs to be put on \nnotice that this bill will be vetoed.\n  I believe that there is no other alternative but to veto this \nlegislation. Frankly, while we have given some thought to trying, in as \nmany ways as we could, to improve the legislation, in our view, it is \nbeyond improvement. They have done the best they could. But this \nproblem started when we passed the budget in the first place. This \nproblem started when the allocation to Health and Human Services was \nprovided in the budget resolution and by the Appropriations Committee. \nAs the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Specter, stated, the \nallocation ``is totally insufficient.'' It cuts $9 billion from the \nPresident's request. So there is no other word to describe this piece \nof legislation, in my view, than the word ``extreme.''\n  Cuts in health, education, job training, and all of the cuts that are \nprovided in this piece of legislation will devastate kids, young \npeople, and destroy the opportunities for families and workers, all in \nthe name of providing a tax cut that we do not need this year. The \nmajority has proposed $245 billion in tax cuts. In order to finance \nthose tax breaks that benefit our wealthiest citizens, they have \nproposed the extreme measures in this bill. As I stated, over $9 \nbillion is cut from the President's request in this legislation in \nareas that directly affect the strength, \n\n[[Page S 14448]]\nhealth, vitality and the future of children and families.\n  It deserves a veto.\n  In addition to the cuts that are devastating in all the ways that I \nhave already described, the bill before us contains a legislative \nprovision that has no business in this appropriations bill. We have \nbeen forced to consider, once more, the striker replacement \nlegislation. This legislation was considered in committee and \nconsidered again earlier on the floor that will, without a doubt, \nprovoke extended debate on this bill if it is not removed from the \nbill.\n  Overturning the Executive order banning the replacement of striking \nworkers by Federal contractors is wrong. I believe the vast majority of \nthe Senate knows that it is wrong. It does not deserve to be in this \nbill. It ought to be taken out. And whether or not we ultimately are \nable to come to any conclusion about health and human services \nappropriations legislation directly affecting all of the programs for \neducation, drug-free schools, for summer jobs, for the real heart and \nsoul of what we try to do each and every year to give strength and \nvitality to young kids, will be hung up, in part, because of a minority \nview that striker replacement deserves to be in this legislation. It is \nwrong, it does not deserve to be there, and it ought to be taken out.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill will be vetoed. It will be vetoed \nbecause 50,000 children are going to be cut from Head Start. It will be \nvetoed because 650,000 disadvantaged kids will be denied educational \nopportunities. It will be vetoed because millions of kids all over this \ncountry are going to lose the chance to go to safe and drug-free \nschools, and are going to lose the opportunity to be educated about the \nneed to avoid drugs. It will be vetoed because we are going to deny \n600,000 kids summer jobs. It will be vetoed because 500,000 dislocated \nworkers are going to be abandoned and not given the help they need to \nfind new jobs. It will be vetoed because 96 percent of the funding for \nsubstance abuse prevention is wiped out in this bill.\n  Mr. President, this is an extreme bill. We ought to vote against it. \nBut if, God forbid, it passes, it will be vetoed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second \nvote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2127, originally scheduled to \noccur at 11 a.m., if necessary, now occur at 11:20 a.m., with time \nbetween the end of the 10 a.m. vote and 11:20 a.m. equally divided in \nthe usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Danica \nPetroshius, a legislative fellow in my office, be granted floor \nprivileges during the debate on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 10 a.m. having arrived, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to proceed to H.R. 2127.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 471 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Approximately 25 minutes for each side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I thank \nhim for his leadership on this issue. Mr. President, I oppose the \nprovision added to the fiscal year 1996 Departments of Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriation \nBill in committee that would prevent any funds appropriated in fiscal \nyear 1996 from being used to ``implement, administer, or enforce any \nexecutive order, or other rule or order, that prohibits Federal \ncontracts with, or requires the debarment of, or imposes other sanction \non, a contractor on the basis that such contractor or organizational \nunit thereof has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.'' We \nmust not weaken one of the most fundamental rights of organized labor, \nthe right to strike, by threatening these workers with the possibility \nof losing their jobs. Mr. President, the right to strike is guaranteed \nto workers under the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor \nAct, and is instrumental in preserving an equitable balance in labor-\nmanagement relations.\n\n  On March 8, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12954, which \nprohibits all Federal contractors, with contracts in excess of \n$100,000, from hiring permanent replacement workers in the event of a \nstrike. This Executive Order has already been challenged in court; \nhowever, on July 31, 1995, the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia upheld the Executive Order. An injunction was also \nissued by the court staying all enforcement of the Executive Order so \nthat opponents would have an opportunity to appeal before the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The President \nhas consistently opposed the use of permanent replacement workers, \nbelieving that the practice harms the American workforce and its \nproductivity. By signing this Executive Order, President Clinton is \nseeking to ensure a stable supply of quality goods and services for the \ngovernment's programs by protecting opportunities for cooperative and \nstable labor-management relations, which, he believes, ``is a central \nfeature of efficient, economical, and productive procurement.''\n  Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act [NLRA] in 1935, to \nestablish collective bargaining as the preferred means of resolving \nlabor disputes. The NLRA gives workers the right to join unions, to \nbargain collectively, and to participate in peaceful concerted activity \nto further their bargaining goals--all without fear of employer \ndiscipline. The economic strike is the ultimate form of such activity. \nCongress expressly protected the worker's principal economic self-help \nweapon--the right to strike--because it recognized that this was an \nimportant tool of labor in ensuring a level playing field in labor \nnegotiations. I should point out, however, that for workers, exercising \nthe right to strike means giving up wages and benefits, and exhausting \nany family savings--it is always a last resort. \n\n[[Page S 14449]]\n\n  The NLRA also established unfair labor practices forbidden by \nthe Act. Among other prohibitions, no interference with the formation \nof a labor union was allowed, and employers could not interfere with \nemployees engaged in organizing or bargaining collectively. After the \nNLRA was enacted, union membership grew from 3,584,000 in 1935 to \n10,201,000 by 1941.\n\n  Before the 1930's--some of the Senators may not be able to remember \nwhat it was like before the 1930's. Some of them had not yet discovered \nAmerica. But I remember very well.\n  Before the 1930's, Federal and State laws favored management, and \nunion activity was discouraged. Efforts by the United Mine Workers \n[UMW] to expand their membership in West Virginia during the economic \nsurge brought on by World War I resulted in a level of violence seldom \nseen in the annals of American labor history. In an effort to bring the \nbenefits of unionism to the southern West Virginia region during the \npostwar years, the UMW mounted a determined effort to organize this \nregion. The coal operators mounted an equally determined effort to keep \nthe union out. Employers in some instances used force to prevent unions \nfrom coming into their plants or businesses. In West Virginia, every \nmine operation had its armed guard--in many instances two or more \nguards. Mine guards were an institution all along the creeks in the \nnon-union sections of the State. As a rule, they were supplied by the \nBaldwin-Felts Detective Agency of Roanoke, Virginia and Bluefield, West \nVirginia. No class of men on Earth were more cordially hated by the \nminers than were these mine guards. Seemingly hired to keep the peace \nand guard company property, these guards spent much of their time \nharassing UMW officials and evicting thousands of union sympathizers \nfrom company-owned housing. If a worker became too inquisitive, if he \nshowed too much independence, or complained too much about his \ncondition, he was likely beaten by one of these mine guards.\n  County sheriffs and their deputies were often in the pay of the coal \noperators, and the State government itself was clearly in alliance with \nthe employers against the mine strikers. Scores of union men were \njailed, and Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers, two union sympathizers, were \nshot dead--dead, dead--by Baldwin-Felts detectives on the courthouse \nsteps at Welch, West Virginia, in McDowell County on August 1, 1921. At \nBlair Mountain, in Logan County, a three-day battle was fought. The \nFederal Government moved to end the struggle and President Harding \nissued a proclamation instructing the miners to cease fighting and \nreturn home. Military aircraft and a force of 2,150 regular Army troops \nwere sent to West Virginia. Partly as a result of the military's \nintervention, the UMW's effort to organize that part of the coalfields \nlost most of its momentum. The southern West Virginia coal \nestablishment was saved.\n  This failure of the UMW underscores the long odds organized labor \nfaced at a time when workers' rights to form and join unions had not \nyet been formally recognized. It also underscores the key role \nGovernment involvement played in the efforts of many employers to keep \nunions out of the workplace prior to the passage of the NLRA in 1935.\n  In 1938, the Supreme Court ruled in NLRB versus Mackay Radio and \nTelegraph Co. that employers may ``permanently replace'' striking \nworkers. In effect, this provided a legal way to ``fire'' these \nstriking workers. Owen Bieber, former President of the United \nAutomobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America \n[UAW] echoes this sentiment as follows: ``The permanent replacement of \nprotected strikers is a contradiction in terms. It is pure double talk \nto say that although workers can't be discharged for striking, the \nworker can be permanently replaced. This distinction may have some \nmeaning to lawyers, but all the ordinary worker knows is that he or she \nis not going back to work with the struck employer in the foreseeable \nfuture.''\n  The ability of an employer to convert a narrow limited collective \nbargaining dispute into a prolonged and divisive contest about the \nfuture of union representation and the future of the unionized \nworkforce is reminiscent of the bitter disputes that preceded enactment \nof the NLRA and led to passage of the Act. When striking workers are \npermanently replaced, the strike turns into a confrontation about \nretention of jobs and the right to union representation. Strikes should \nbe about working conditions and wages, not about the fundamental right \nof union representation.\n  Although the hiring of permanent replacement workers was not common \nfor many years, the practice has escalated in recent years, and its use \nor threat of use occurs in one out of every three strikes.\n  More and more, during labor negotiations, union members are fighting \nfor benefits such as health care, pensions, and safety. Wages are not \nnecessarily the big issue. Due to the threat of overseas competition \nand downsizing, unions are fighting for their benefits, many of which \nare not provided by companies overseas. It should be noted, however, \nthat our major trading partners, and competitors--Canada, France, \nGermany, and Japan--all have laws that prohibit the use of permanent \nreplacements. In addition, the newly restored democracies of Eastern \nEurope prohibit this practice as well. The laws in these countries \nreflect the importance of collective bargaining in relation to \nefficient economic performance. Their laws encourage long-term \nbargaining relationships. In these countries, collective bargaining has \nbeen central in building the stable workforces of skilled long-term \nemployees that are critical to success.\n  Although the President's Executive Order only applies to Federal \ncontracts in excess of $100,000, it is important that the United States \nSenate does not back down by supporting the provision to overturn the \nPresident's Executive Order. The Federal Government should set an \nexample not only for all businesses operating in the United States, but \nfor overseas companies as well. We do not want to send a message that \nwe believe it is fair to tip the balance of power in favor of business \nin collective bargaining. Both sides should have tools to work with in \norder for bargaining to be effective. An employer would still have the \nability to continue operation during a strike by using temporary \nreplacements, by subcontracting or transferring the struck work, or by \noperating with management personnel.\n  This provision, which we are debating here today, would return us to \nthe days of widespread practices of unfair and unsafe working \nconditions. More and more is expected of our workers these days, and \nthey deserve to work in a safe environment with health and retirement \nbenefits and job security. The practice of hiring permanent replacement \nworkers has adversely impacted the lives of many people and destroyed \nmany communities and lifetime friendships. Many who have invested years \nwith a company have lost their jobs due to a legal strike and have been \npermanently replaced. Savings accounts have been depleted, college \nfunds have been used up, homes have been lost, health benefits no \nlonger existed, and hope for a secure future has been diminished. \nAdvancing age makes it difficult for many longtime workers to find new \njobs.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about real lives here--real people who \nwant to earn an honest living and provide for their families and their \nfutures. These people are the backbone of our great nation, and we \ncannot afford to toss them aside and replace them with inexperienced, \nunskilled employees.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no once again on the \nmotion.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I may not have consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the motion to proceed to \nconsideration of the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services and Education. I do so because I support the \nPresident's Executive order to ban the use of permanent striker \nreplacement workers on Federal contracts. I strongly oppose the \nprovision in this bill that prevents enforcement of the Executive \norder.\n  Some say that banning of permanent striker replacements will tip the \nbalance toward labor unions. The balance \n\n[[Page S 14450]]\nhas already been tipped against workers. In 1970, only 1 percent of \nstrikes involved permanent replacement workers. By 1992, employers were \nhiring permanent replacements in 25 percent of strikes.\n  If Congress repeals this order, we tell workers that they are \ndisposable. We are telling working men and women that they can be \ntossed out onto a scrap heap of economic indifference.\n  Permanent replacement workers weaken the collective bargaining power \nof unions and that will bring down U.S. wages and living standards.\n  Strikes using permanent replacements last seven times longer than \nstrikes that do not use permanent replacements. Strikes involving \npermanent replacements are more contentious and bitter, and that means \nthat no one wins. Replacing strikers means replacing skilled workers \nwith unskilled workers, experienced workers with inexperienced workers.\n  Some argue that this expands Presidential authority, I disagree. In \n1992, George Bush issued an order that required all unionized Federal \ncontractors to post notices in the workplace informing all employees \nthat they did not have to join the union. President Bush did this even \nthough legislation to include this notification, cosponsored by \nCongressmen Gingrich, Armey and DeLay, was pending in Congress and was \nnot passed.\n  Other Presidents have used their Presidential authority to issue \nExecutive orders. In 1941, Franklin Roosevelt issued an Executive order \nbanning racial discrimination by defense contractors. In 1964, Lyndon \nJohnson ordered an end to age discrimination by Federal contractors, \nand in 1969, the Nixon administration expanded this order to require \naffirmative action programs and goals.\n  President Clinton's Executive order is limited and reasonable. It \nseeks only to level the playing field for workers in Federal contracts. \nThe Executive order applies only to contractors who try to permanently \nreplace workers. It seeks only to protect workers who are engaged in a \nlegal strike; it does not apply to illegal strikes. In addition, the \nSecretary of Labor must conduct a case-by-case review before any \ncontract is terminated, and any order to terminate is subject to the \nreview and approval of the contracting agency.\n  This action is a modest step by the President. It is not an attempt \nto create new Presidential authority. I support this Executive order to \nprotect collective bargaining, unions, and U.S. wages.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this is the second time the Senate will vote \non the President's striker replacement Executive order and, I hope, the \nsecond time the Senate affirms the Executive order.\n  Our Nation's labor laws grant workers the right to strike and ensure \nthat they cannot be fired during the course of a strike. To tell a \nworker who may have given many years of dedicated and loyal service \nthat he or she has not been fired but permanently replaced is no \nconsolation to that worker or their family.\n  In my many years as a businessman, I negotiated numerous labor \ncontracts. I always understood that the workers were negotiating on \nbehalf of themselves and their families. On some occasions, I stood \nfirm. On other occasions, I gave way. On all occasions, I believe, both \nsides made concessions. We reached an agreement and went back to \nbusiness. That was the process.\n  Mr. President, not once during those strikes did it ever occur to me \nthat those workers would lose their jobs for striking. Not once did it \noccur to me that permanently replacing them was an acceptable practice. \nAnd yet today, you can see advertisements for permanent replacement \nworkers even before the expiration of a labor contract.\n  The key to collective bargaining, Mr. President, is balance and good-\nfaith negotiation.\n  The President's Executive order does not deny that labor disputes are \ngoing to occur. But it does acknowledge that such disputes should be \nfairly negotiated.\n  The Executive order is not unprecedented and is justified by helping \nto improve the quality and efficiency of Government contracts. It does \nso by encouraging companies that contract with the Federal Government \nto maintain a fair and stable working environment with their employees. \nAnd stable working conditions lead to increased productivity.\n  Contractors that choose to permanently replace lawfully striking \nemployees during a workplace dispute not only risk damaging labor-\nmanagement relations. They also risk disrupting the quality and \nprogress of their Federal contract.\n  In simple terms, it is just bad business practice to hold the club of \npermanent replacement over the heads of employees. History shows that \nstrikes involving permanent replacements last up to seven times longer \nthan strikes that do not involve permanent replacements. It is common \nknowledge that such strikes tend to be much more contentious, often \nchanging a limited dispute into a broader, more antagonistic struggle.\n  Most importantly, it is common sense that permanently replacing \nstrikers means trading experienced, skilled employees for inexperienced \nones. Inexperienced replacement workers start at the bottom of the \nlearning curve, a circumstance that can sometimes have grave \nconsequences in productivity and quality. With the President's \nExecutive order, we can avoid such grave consequences under federally \nfunded Government projects.\n  I urge my colleagues to remove the restriction on this legitimate \nPresidential Executive order.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we find ourselves today debating once \nagain the use of striker replacements. This morning, we will conduct \ntwo test votes to determine, ultimately, whether or not we will allow \nthe President to enforce Executive Order 12954, which prohibits the \nFederal Government from contracting with firms using permanent \nreplacements in cases of legal strikes.\n  Although many of us have addressed this issue in the past, I would \nlike to briefly outline my position on this important issue.\n  We all know that it is illegal to fire a worker engaged in a legal \nstrike. We also all know that the Supreme Court Mackay Radio decision \nin 1935 made significant inroads into this protection from dismissal by \nallowing the hiring of permanent replacements for striking workers. In \nthe last 15 years or so, the increased use of such workers has been one \nof many factors that have undermined a healthy relationship between \nworkers and employers.\n  I believe that this country is slowly waking up to the idea that we \ncannot continue down a path where employers look only at short term \nprofits, and trade in the prospect of our future for expediency today. \nWe are not making the long term investments in capital and human \nresources that cost now, but will have tremendous payoffs in the future \nin terms of both profits and wages. We are also not creating the sort \nof working partnerships between employees and employers that are \nnecessary for our long-term success in the world economy. We simply \ncannot be competitive in the world if we continue to trade our future \nfor our short term gains.\n  Yet, the use of permanent replacements, I believe, is too often one \nmore step on that path. Rather than address differences with \nlegitimately bargaining representatives, thus developing partnerships, \nemployers too often simply replace these workers. For that reason, I \nbelieve that we must discourage the use of permanent replacements, and \nI support the President's decision to not do business with firms \nemploying this practice.\n  The President has found that the use of permanent replacements erodes \nlabor-management relations, and thus adversely affects the cost, \nquality, and timely availability of goods and services procured by the \nFederal Government. I am confident that the President is taking an \nimportant step to discourage a practice that could have an adverse \neffect on our Nation's long-term economic prospects.\n  For these reasons, I will vote ``no'' on cloture.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the issue before us is not striker \nreplacement, but education. I supported the striker replacement \nprovision in committee and hope it survives.\n  However, I continue to fight to cool the fever to cut education that \nhas gripped this Congress. I want to cool that fever and break it. Both \nparties have supported education funding in the past, but now the \nRepublicans \n\n[[Page S 14451]]\nthink they have a mandate to cut reading and math assistants for kids \nin school. They find a mandate to reduce college student aid while \ntuitions rise faster than inflation. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  Specifically, in May, the Senate debated and passed a budget \nresolution that would cut education by 33 percent over the next 7 years \nwhile delivering a tax cut before the next election. During the debate, \nI, along with Senators Harkin, Kennedy, and others offered an \nalternative that better fits with what the American people want. We \nproposed to protect the 2 percent of the budget now devoted to \neducation by providing a smaller pre-election tax cut.\n  Unfortunately, our proposal to protect education was voted down, and \ntoday we are considering an appropriations bill that takes the first \nstep to implement the wrongheaded budget plan that passed. \nSpecifically, this bill cuts $2.1 billion in fiscal year 1996 from the \ndiscretionary education budget. It cuts Head Start, college grants, \nvocational education funds to help high school students move into \nhigher-wage jobs, subsidies targeted largely to elementary schools with \ndisadvantaged children, and school reform funds. It cuts antidrug \neducation in the schools, magnet schools, adult literacy funds, and \ngrants to improve the academic programs of 2- and 4-year colleges that \nare strapped for funds and that serve many lower-income students \nseeking to improve their economic independence. In short, it takes a \n$2.1 billion step backward while everyone knows we have to press \nforward in the current economic climate. Because of these cuts, I am \nopposing the motion to proceed to this bill.\n  Many of our constituents have felt the sharp edge of economic \ndownsizing. In the government sector, we are cutting the Navy Base in \nCharleston, and the private sector has done even more to downsize and \ncut benefits. Traditionally, Americans have relied on a system of \npublic education and college assistance to prepare them and their \nchildren to weather such transitions and gain economic independence. We \nlearned after World War II that it pays to help people attend college, \nand we have learned for more than the past century that free public \nschools are essential.\n  Congress now seems to have forgotten these lessons of history, \ndespite continuing evidence that education spending has been critical \nfor economic growth. The Department of Labor estimates that 20 percent \nof U.S. economic growth since 1963 has stemmed from increased education \nin our work force. Where would our country be now, relative to Japan \nand Europe, if its economy were that much smaller? Congress should be \nfighting to ensure this kind of growth in the future, not fighting to \ncut education and give families making over $100,000 per year a tax cut \nbefore the next election. After rushing to bail out Mexico and refusing \nrepeatedly to stop exporting American jobs, we should now work hard to \ninvest in the future, not to give away the public store as a political \ngoodie.\n  On the individual level, too, voters know that education makes a \ndifference for the future. A recent study of identical twins found that \nthe more educated twin makes 13 percent more on average. Why is this \nCongress implementing plans to cut back on the long-term individual \nachievement of the 44 million children in U.S. public schools and the \nmore than 6 million college students receiving student financial aid in \norder to quickly provide tax cuts to a smaller set of people who \nalready have made it? No political payoff is worth such a plan that \nwill hurt individual achievement and the economic potential of this \nNation.\n  Aside from denying history and current research, this plan flies in \nthe face of the basic facts about school enrollments. It is not rocket \nscience: The number of children is rising. There will be 5 million more \nchildren in school in the United States 7 years from now. Thus, public \nschool attendance will rise more than 10 percent, but Congress plans to \ncut education funding by 33 percent. At the college level, not only are \nenrollments rising, tuition is going up faster than inflation while we \ndebate $10 billion in cuts to student aid on reconciliation.\n  I do not know what else I have to say to prove that the education \npart of the current budget plan is perverse. We do not need a pollster \nto tell us that it is not the best effort that this Congress should \nmake for the people. The average voter probably would find it hard to \nbelieve that we are really pursuing it. Far from keeping a Contract \nWith America, this bill represents a broken promise to educate our \nchildren.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the motion to proceed \nto the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill until the \nstriker replacement provision is struck from the bill. If included, \nthis provision will block the implementation of the President's \nExecutive Order on striker replacements. This is a matter of \nfundamental fairness for working people in this country.\n  During the course of this century, all Americans--regardless of \nincome level--benefited from our country's economic growth. We grew \ntogether, and an expanding economy meant better jobs for everyone. A \ntypical family could work hard and experience an increased living \nstandard, whether that meant buying a home or putting a child through \ncollege or taking a simple family vacation.\n  But in the past two decades, while our Nation's economy has continued \nto grow, fewer and fewer Americans are sharing in these gains. The vast \nmajority of this growth--97 percent of our real income growth since \n1979--has gone to the top fifth of households. In contrast, the fifth \nof Americans at the lowest income levels--Americans who previously had \nbeen the principal beneficiaries of economic growth--saw there incomes \ndecline by a staggering 17 percent between 1979 and 1993. In short, Mr. \nPresident, the rich have gotten richer and poor have gotten poorer.\n  As 80 percent of our population grapples with economic hardships, \nthey look to each of us to rectify this problem and build a stronger \neconomy that will be shared by all Americans.\n  President Clinton has demonstrated his commitment to doing something \nabout this problem. He has advocated wage increases and skills training \nto help ordinary Americans compete and succeed. Unfortunately, our \nRepublican colleagues have blocked these efforts.\n  In fact our Republican colleagues have denied working Americans a \nseries of advancement opportunities, including summer jobs for youth, \nstudent loan, and child care.\n  What is the Republican solution? Tax breaks. Fifty-two percent of \nthose tax cuts would benefit people earning $100,000 or more per year. \nThat is not a solution for the single mother with a minimum wage job \nfighting to keep her children clothed, fed, and safe. That is not a \nsolution for a factory worker struggling to make his mortgage payments. \nThat is not a solution for the vast majority of working Americans. We \nmust do better for them,\n  The President has done better. His Executive Order directs Government \nagencies not to contract with firms that permanently replace striking \nworkers. In issuing this Executive Order the President recognized that \nworkers have few powerful tools at their disposal. The right to strike \nis one of those tools. Permitting employers to permanently replace \nstriking employees throws the labor system out of balance. The \nExecutive Order redresses that imbalance.\n  The striker replacement provision of the Labor and HHS appropriations \nbill seeks to obstruct implementation of this vital order. Therefore, I \noppose the motion to proceed to the Labor, Health and Human Services \nbill until the striker replacement provision is struck from the bill. \nThere are several reasons why this provision should be struck.\n  First, product quality will be jeopardized if Government contractors \nare permitted to permanently replace striking workers. Firms which \npermanently replace their workers have, by definition, terrible \nmanagement-labor relations. This in turn creates a poisonous atmosphere \nwhich can't help but damage product quality.\n  Second, quality and workplace safety will also be threatened. \nReplacement workers possess fewer skills and less experience than the \nstrikers whose positions they fill. The President has a responsibility \nto ensure that Federal contractors provide a safe working environment \nas well as only the highest quality goods and service. This Executive \nOrder will help achieve those goals.\n\n[[Page S 14452]]\n\n  Third, the President's order sets a high standard for cooperative \nlabor-management relations at a time when the increasingly competitive \nglobal economy demands it. Management and labor must join in a common \nquest to produce a good product at a competitive price. Hopes for that \nkind of cooperation are dashed when management permanently replaces its \nemployees. The President's Executive Order puts the Federal Government \non record opposing such tactics.\n  If our Republican colleagues succeed in blocking the President's \nExecutive Order on permanent replacement workers, they will send a \nmessage to ordinary Americans. And that message will be that after \nyears of losing ground on pay and benefits, they could lose their \njobs--solely for exercising their fundamental right to strike. They \nwill send a message that the Federal Government rewards with Federal \ncontracts employers who create hostile work environments. Basically, \nthey will send a message which tells working Americans, ``tough luck.''\n  That is the wrong message to send. The right to strike has been a \nbasic tenet of American labor policy for six decades. It is illegal to \nfire an employee for exercising that right. Permanently replacing \nstrikers is a loophole in the law. With the striker replacement \nprovision, we would permit the Federal Government to take advantage of \na loophole which allows employers to circumvent the law.\n  What is the right message to send? That the Federal Government \nrecognizes and respects the law. That we want to help American workers.\n  Several labor-related Executive Orders made by Presidents Reagan and \nBush provide ample precedent for President Clinton's action, and I hope \nmy colleagues will support the President and do something positive for \nworking Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to the motion to \nproceed to the Labor, Health and Human Services bill until this \nprovision is struck from this bill.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. If there is no demand for time on the Republican side, I \nyield myself 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me comment on two aspects. One is the \nintrusion of the striker replacement into this, and then on the dollars \nthemselves.\n  What we know from studies, and particularly the Harvard study, is \nthat union workers by and large are more satisfied, and more satisfied \nworkers produce quality work, and that union workers stay at a job \nlonger.\n  This moves us in the opposite direction. What we need in our society \nis balance.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. He has \nseen more of our history and certainly studied it more than I have. But \nover the years, since the 1930's, we have tried to have a reasonably \ngood balance. Frankly, when there is a Republican President, the \nNational Labor Relations Board tilts a little bit in the direction of \nmanagement, and when there is a Democratic President, it tilts a little \nbit in the direction of labor. But when President Reagan came in--and \nhe did many good things--the balance was lost. And while, for example, \nat one point Canada and the United States both had about 33 percent of \nour work force belonging to labor unions, Canada has gone up to 36 \npercent, and in the United States, we are down to 16 percent. And if \nyou exclude the governmental unions, it is down to 11.8 percent.\n  It was very interesting for me to pick up the New York Times and read \nan article by George Shultz, who most recently was Secretary of State \nunder a Republican administration but at one point was Secretary of \nLabor, and George Shultz said things are getting out of balance; we \nhave an unhealthy small percentage of our work force belonging to labor \nunions.\n  Now, part of this balance was self-restraint. Through most of our \nhistory, no industry just permanently replaced strikers. And then we \nhave had a few instances of it. Greyhound did it, and we had \nBridgestone/Firestone, and that came up on the floor of this body. It \nis very interesting because Bridgestone/Firestone is a Japanese-owned \ncorporation today. Permanently replacing workers in Japan is illegal, \nbut they did it with their United States entity. The only places where \nit is legal in industrialized democracies are Great Britain, Hong Kong, \nSingapore, and the United States of America. In all the other Western \nEuropean nations and Japan, it is illegal.\n  I believe the President's Executive order has brought just a trifle \namount of balance here. We need more. We need to be doing a lot of \nthings to provide some balance. And what we also have to do as we \nprovide balance is to try to get labor and management working together. \nI am pleased to say that in the State of Illinois it looks as if \nCaterpillar is moving toward resolving that problem.\n  Let me second, Mr. President, talk about the appropriation and where \nwe are. We have under this proposal said--this is compared to the 1995 \nappropriations, and this is assuming that the Senate bill passes; the \nHouse bill is even worse--in the State of Illinois, 42,395 fewer people \nwill be helped.\n  Let us take West Virginia because West Virginia is like my home \nterritory of southern Illinois--good, fine people but below average \neducation and below average earnings. In West Virginia, 11,413 people. \nLet us take another example, Mr. President, we forget about here \nfrequently. The citizens of Puerto Rico are all American citizens. They \ncontribute in terms of Armed Forces and bloodshed more than almost all \nof our States. In Puerto Rico, 39,924 fewer people are being helped. \nThe average income in Puerto Rico is less than half the average income \nin Mississippi, the bottom of our 50 States. Puerto Rico gets the short \nshrift in legislation after legislation because there is no one in the \nSenate to defend them. We have what we call Commonwealth States. Old \nfashioned colonialism is what it is. One of these days inevitably \nPuerto Rico will either become independent or become a State, and that \nchoice I think should be up to the people of Puerto Rico, whatever \ntheir decision.\n  Let us take dollars now. In the State of Illinois, $84,747,000 less \nthan the 1995 appropriation under this bill; West Virginia, $21 million \nless. This is money for education, for people who need help, for summer \njobs for youth. Puerto Rico --I mentioned $84 million for the State of \nIllinois. Puerto Rico, roughly one-fourth of our population, $70 \nmillion less.\n  These programs, Mr. President, do good for people. Let me just \nmention one--title I. It used to be called Chapter 1. This is for the \nmore impoverished areas. People say money alone is not going to solve \nour problems. There is no question, money alone is not going to solve \nour problems. But without the resources we are not going to do it.\n  What has happened to 9-year-old black males since title I has been in \neffect? An 18-percent increase in math scores, a 25-percent increase in \nverbal scores. Those are good kinds of things.\n  Head Start. I do not know anyone who believes Head Start does not \nhelp these young people. I will never forget visiting the Head Start \nProgram in an impoverished area in Rock Island, IL. Almost every Head \nStart Program, every one I know of, has a waiting list. We are not \nproviding enough help. One group of young people comes in Monday \nmorning; Tuesday morning another group; Wednesday morning a third \ngroup, and so forth. I asked the woman in charge, what would it mean in \nthe lives of these young people if they could be in here every day \ninstead of 1 day a week? She smiled and she said, ``You could not \nbelieve the difference it would make in their future.''\n  Oh, we save money when we do not provide help to them, like you save \nmoney when you build a house and you do not put a roof on it. But you \ndo not save money in the long run. We have to invest in our people.\n  When I was in the fourth or fifth grade, something like that, I read \nin my geography book that the United States was wealthy because of its \nnatural resources, our oil and coal and all these other things. And \nthen all of a sudden about 15 years ago, I got to thinking about it. \nThe countries that were moving ahead relative to how the United States \nwas moving ahead, much more rapidly than we were--Sweden, Japan, \nTaiwan, South Korea--why were they moving ahead? They were moving \n\n[[Page S 14453]]\nahead because they were investing in their people.\n  We need to invest in the people of West Virginia. We need to invest \nin the people of the central city of Chicago. We need to invest in the \npeople of southern Illinois--good, hard, coal mining people, farmers, \nand others who are struggling on topsoil much of which, as in West \nVirginia, is not great.\n  We need to invest in our people. When we do, it pays off. The GI bill \nafter World War II--Senator Byrd and I are old enough to remember \nthat--we thought of it as a gift to veterans. It was an investment in \nour own prosperity. It was a huge, huge plus for this Nation.\n  We have to do that again. I hope one of these days we will have the \nvision and the courage. What we are going through now, because of what \nwe have done--and I am for the constitutional amendment; the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and I differ strongly on that--what we are trying to \ndo legislatively is like a New Year's resolution. We are having a New \nYear's resolution where we are going to balance the budget. But you \nknow what we want to do with this? It is like a diet, a New Year's \nresolution and a diet. We are going to start off with a great big \ndessert, a $255 billion tax cut. That is what we are doing. It is \nridiculous. We ought to be using that money to invest in our people.\n  I hope this appropriation is rejected, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes \nremaining on his side; 25 minutes for the other side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the silence on the other side is really \ndeafening in response to the points that have been raised in the early \npart of this discussion and debate as well as during this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself just 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I think the case has been made about the authority of \nthe President to make this Executive order. The ink on the Executive \norder was not even dry before it was challenged by our Republican \nfriends, in spite of the historic precedents establishing the power and \nthe authority and the constitutional right of the President to act in \nthis regard.\n  The Executive order is well founded and well justified, when we look \nat what is being sought in terms of having an orderly procurement \nprogram for the Federal Government: to ensure that there will be \nquality products manufactured, that they are going to be purchased on \ntime, and recognizing the realities of the striker replacement issue.\n  Mr. President, the issue concerning the cuts that are in the \nappropriations bill in terms of education has been debated and \ndiscussed. I want to just take a few moments here to put into \nperspective this whole issue about undermining the opportunities for \nworkers to be able to gain a decent, livable wage in the context of \nother actions that are being forced on the working families of this \ncountry by the majority Members of this body.\n  We saw the first efforts on March 15 of this year when the attempt \nwas made to undo what the President has done to protect workers' \nhistoric and legitimate right to strike and to prevent their \npermanently replacement by Federal contractors.\n  We have to look at the mosaic that is being created, not only back in \nMarch, but during the period of the summer. What we have seen is a \nbasic assault on working families. We have seen the assault on the \nDavis-Bacon program. Why do Republicans want to attack the Davis-Bacon \nprogram? The average income of the Davis-Bacon worker is $26,000 a \nyear--$26,000 a year for hard work. Why are we denying those men and \nwomen who are in the second or third most dangerous occupation, outside \nof mining and perhaps logging, that work on Federal building projects, \nthe third most dangerous work, the opportunity to be able to gain a \ndecent wage of $26,000?\n  Next came their opposition to increasing the minimum wage. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike have fought for increases in the past. \nThis is not a partisan issue. President Bush signed the last minimum \nwage increase of 90 cents. Nonetheless, we have resistance to help men \nand women prepared to work 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year to be able \nto have a livable wage so they are not in poverty. We heard a great \ndeal about the importance of work in the welfare debate. Here are men \nand women who want to be off welfare, want to work, being denied the \nopportunity to have a livable wage. That is No. 2.\n  No. 3. In the budget, the cutting back of the earned-income tax \ncredit. Who does that affect? Needy workers below $26,000, to help and \nassist them when they saw the increase in the cost of Social Security \nand expanded family obligations so that they could be able to provide \nfor their children--a worthwhile program. And yet we find our \nRepublican friends trying to squeeze that back, effectively squeeze it \nso that working families with less than $26,000 are going to have to \npay more in taxes. A tax increase on the working poor.\n  And what do we have yesterday over in the House? We have the \nRepublican proposal to open up all the pensions again, $40 billion of \nretirees' pension money that will be available to corporate America. We \nsaw what happened in the 1980's when we had the plundering of the \npensions. Those pensions belong to workers, not to corporate raiders. \nThose pensions have been paid in and paid in as a result of sacrificing \nincreases in wages and health benefits. And now under the Republican \nproposal, we would permit the corporate raiders to reach in there for \n$40 billion to increase their salaries, their bonuses and their stock \noptions.\n  This is a continuing effort of assault on the working families of \nAmerica. And beyond that, Mr. President, is the slashing of the various \ntraining programs for workers that have been displaced as a result of \ndefense downsizing, of the mergers that have taken place. We saw just \nthe other day the merging between the Chemical Bank and the Chase Bank, \nand Wall Street go euphoric in terms of that merger. Twelve thousand \nAmericans are laid off. Who is going to speak for them?\n  I yield myself the last minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thought I yielded myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Kennedy may have 1 minute of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Who is going to speak for those kids? You cannot pick up a newspaper \ntoday without finding massive layoffs, not just of needy blue collar \nworkers, but also the white collar workers and men and women who have \nworked in these companies and corporations for years. We have to speak \nfor them.\n  Mr. President, this is just one additional part of that puzzle. This \nappropriations bill should be stripped of the provisions that are \nbasically an attack and assault on the President's statutory and \nconstitutional rights that have been upheld in the Federal courts. And \nthen we should get about the debate on the substance of the \nappropriations issue.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 24 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask my Republican colleagues who may be \nlistening to come to the floor if they wish to speak in support of the \nmotion to proceed.\n  The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin has asked for 5 minutes. I \nyield him 5 minutes at this time, with the request to my colleagues on \nthe Republican side to come to the floor if they wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania very much.\n  Mr. President, I voted ``no'' on the motion to proceed to \nconsideration of the Labor-HHS appropriations.\n  A number of problems in this measure have been highlighted in the \ndebate, but I would like to focus on one \n\n[[Page S 14454]]\nparticular provision, the attempt to override the President's Executive \norder banning the use of permanent replacements for striking workers \nemployed by Federal contractors.\n  We had a long debate about this a few months ago, and I had a chance \nthe speak at length. So I will be brief today. But this is an issue \nthat I feel very strongly about, and I fully support President \nClinton's efforts in this area to halt the erosion of workers' rights.\n  I had a chance to work on this issue for many years when I was in the \nWisconsin State Senate and tried to pass a Wisconsin law on this issue. \nBut throughout the process it was very clear that what had happened in \nthe early 1980's with the PATCO strike led to an avalanche, really, of \nthe use of permanent replacement workers across this country in a way \nthat had never happened before. It has had serious consequences for \nworking people throughout Wisconsin and across the country.\n  Mr. President, earlier this month, just a few weeks ago, I had the \npainful experience of meeting with workers who had just gone on strike \nagainst a large employer in a rural Wisconsin community. These workers \ncame to one of the listening sessions or town meetings that I hold \nevery year in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties.\n  I would like to read, to highlight this issue, from a statement of \nJames Newell, the principal officer for the Teamsters Union, on this \nissue. I can think of no more eloquent testimonial than the words of \nMr. Newell that day, in a small townhall in Wisconsin, just a couple of \nweeks ago.\n  He said:\n\n       Sir, you have entered into a community today that has been \n     infected with a disease that has become much too prevalent in \n     American society over the past few years. Just a few blocks \n     from here, there are more than 100 hard-working men and women \n     engaged in a struggle with this community's largest \n     industrial employer. The flashpoint of this firestorm was not \n     the traditional economic issues of higher wages and \n     benefits--although Lord knows they are desperately needed \n     here and will be at issue before this battle is over.\n\n  He continued to say:\n\n       This controversy was ignited by issues which transcend \n     price tags; the issues of fairness, safety, job security, and \n     basic human rights to self-respect and dignity on the \n     workshop floor.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Newell continued by describing what is happening \nall too often across this country in the use of strike breakers.\n\n       Three (3) years ago, this community faced a major loss of \n     employment at this facility brought on by its intended \n     closure by a national conglomerate which owned and operated \n     it at that time.\n\n      The work force gave tremendous concessions, both in \n     economics as well as job security provisions, to allow \n     present ownership to acquire and build the business and to \n     preserve those jobs in the Owen community. Now, after we \n     have done our part and contributed to the new company's \n     success, we are told that some of our basic requests for a \n     return of rights previously given up is somehow un-\n     American in light of global competition and the employer's \n     interest in maximizing profits.\n\n  Mr. Newell described in his statement about the events that followed. \nHe testified that since the confrontation began,\n\n       We have not been greeted by any desire from this employer \n     to return to the bargaining table and work out these \n     disputes, but rather by the employer's unilateral \n     cancellation of two (2) scheduled bargaining sessions this \n     past week and the veiled threat of canceling a third (3rd) \n     session scheduled for the coming weeks. We have seen our lost \n     wages being utilized to pay for an unnecessary insulting \n     security guard force. We have witnessed safety shortcuts \n     being implemented at the potential peril of those few who are \n     still working in the plant. And, perhaps most outrageous of \n     all, we have witnessed this employer stoop to the level of \n     enticing high school students--\n\n  High school students--\n\n     to cross the picket line and perform the work. We wonder what \n     kind of society we have evolved into when schoolchildren can \n     become pawns to break labor disputes.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Newell concluded with an observation about what is \nhappening across America today. He said:\n\n       What is happening in this community today is a microcosm of \n     what has been slowly eating away at the American fabric for \n     years . . . Progress and efficiency cannot be had at the \n     expense of basic human dignity.\n\n  Over the past few days, the workers became aware that plans were \nbeing made by the company to bring on permanent replacement workers. \nThose hired during the strike are going to be considered permanent. The \nstrike ended. There is little doubt that the threat of hiring permanent \nreplacement workers shifts the balance at the bargaining table. That is \nan unfair leverage that was imposed upon this community. That is not \nwhat bargaining is supposed to be about. When one party is given a tool \nlike this, there is little realistic hope that a fair result will \nensue.\n  It may mean higher profits today, but in the long run, it is a bad \nresult for a community, for America's work force and for our entire \ncountry. America's workers, Mr. President, should not be treated like \ndisposable goods.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 10 minutes \n39 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. NICKLES. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania for \nyielding the time.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote to proceed to this \nappropriations bill. I cannot recall--and it may be that we have done \nit--somebody objecting to a motion to proceed to an appropriations \nbill. Maybe a couple years ago in dealing with an Interior bill, which \nI was actually a manager of, that had on it an issue on grazing, and \nthere was some legislation on that bill. Maybe that happened and we \nwrestled with it for a couple of days. But I do not recall anyone \nobjecting to proceeding to the bill, though.\n  I have heard a couple colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsaying they had problems with one of the provisions in the bill \nrelating to prohibiting President Clinton's Executive order dealing \nwith striker replacements. If they do not like that language, if we \nproceed to the bill, they have the opportunity to amend it and strike \nthat language if they have the votes. That is fine.\n  That is the way we usually handle appropriations bills. There are \nsome things in this appropriations bill I do not agree with and on \nwhich I plan on having an amendment. Not everything done in committee I \nagree with. So I understand that some people on that side of the aisle \nare not happy with the bill or want to see some changes, some \namendments. Other people on this side, would like to see some changes. \nMaybe we can come to an agreement on the number of amendments and \nhopefully pass this bill. We happen to be running out of time. We are \nsupposed to have all appropriations bills done by the end of this \nmonth. We lack two. This is one of them.\n  Let us find out where the votes are concerning this one provision \ndealing with the President's Executive order. The House put in language \nthat denies funding to implement the President's Executive order, which \nprohibits companies from hiring permanent replacement workers during \nstrikes. The Senate kept that language in. I happen to agree with that \nlanguage. Somebody might say, why is that language necessary? Well, the \nPresident, by Executive order, is trying to pass legislation. I really \ndisagree with that. I disagree with the substance of the legislation, \nand I also disagree with Executive orders that try to legislate.\n  In this case, there was legislation introduced that was very high on \nPresident Clinton's priority list. The Democrats controlled Congress \nfor the first 2 years of his administration. They introduced \nlegislation that would state basically that companies could not hire \npermanent replacement workers during a strike. They did not have the \nvotes. They were not able to pass that legislation.\n  So after the change in the control of Congress, President Clinton \nsaid, well, I will bypass Congress and do it by Executive order. \nBasically, it states that if any company or any branch of any company \ndoes any contracting with the Federal Government, therefore, they will \nbe denied access to Government contracts if they hire permanent \nreplacement workers during a strike. That is clearly legislation.\n  Again, I hope that our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nwill \n\n[[Page S 14455]]\ntake exception to the executive branch if they are legislating. The \nConstitution, in article I, says Congress shall pass ``all'' laws. It \ndoes not say ``some'' laws; it says ``all'' laws. It does not say that \nif the President cannot get his legislative program through Congress, \nhe can do it by Executive order. That is exactly what this President is \ntrying to do.\n  He is trying to legislate. I hope and think that people from the \nlegislative branch would take exception to that--even if they agree or \ndisagree with the substance of his Executive order or his legislation \nthat he is trying to enact through Executive order.\n  So, again, I understand and respect that we have differences of views \non this legislation. That is fine. I might say it is not totally \npartisan on this one issue, but we should vote on it. We should \nlegislate on it. If colleagues wanted to pass a prohibition, they \nshould introduce legislation and let Congress work its will. We have \nthe right to pass this prohibition. For Members to say we are not going \nto take up the Labor-HHS appropriations bill because it has an \namendment that we do not like--this bill has total funding, I think, of \n$263 billion in budget authority for the Department of Labor, Health \nand Human Services. That is a big bill. To say we want to totally deny \ntaking up this bill because we disagree with one funding prohibition, I \nthink, is not very mature. I hope that we would not do it.\n  Again, I cannot remember Congress doing it. In my opinion, also, it \nis not a responsible way to legislate. Congress should legislate and we \nshould enact our will. I should have a chance to offer my amendments on \nsome things that I disagree with and find out where the votes are. \nMaybe I will win, and maybe I will lose. I doubt, when you have a bill \nthis large, that everybody is going agree with everything. So we should \nwork our will. We should have a chance to amend this bill, and we \nshould finish this and all appropriations bills by the end of this \nmonth. I think we are being somewhat irresponsible if we do not.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Democratic side, all of whom voted \nagainst the motion to proceed, to allow us to proceed to this bill and \nhave Congress work its will and hopefully pass this and the Commerce, \nState, Justice bill before we adjourn this month.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes 5 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it would be my hope that we would proceed \nto consider this bill. It is, obviously, a party line matter at this \npoint.\n  As I had said earlier, when the bill came out of the subcommittee, we \nstruck all of the legislative provisions, because in my view, and the \nview of the members of the subcommittee, we ought not to take up \nlegislation on the appropriations bill. That was the policy of the \nAppropriations Committee as a general rule on all matters endorsed by \nour distinguished chairman, Senator Hatfield. But it is my hope that we \nwill take up the bill.\n  As a practical matter, it is difficult to proceed to finish this bill \nbefore the end of the fiscal year. Certainly, we could not have a \nconference even if we could finish it on the Senate floor, if this \nsubject is going to be comprehended within a continuing resolution.\n  I invite my colleagues on the Republican side, who wish to come to \nthe floor to speak in favor of the motion, to do so.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I have a minute?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield a minute to my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the membership understands what \nis at stake. As the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, there was a \nstripping away of all the other add-ons onto the appropriations, with \nthe exception of one. There was a refusal to strip that aside. That \nparticular amendment was targeted on the constitutional authority of \nthe President of the United States. And that issue had been resolved in \nthe courts of this country in support of the President of the United \nStates.\n  So it does seem to me that that issue should be stripped off before \nwe get back into the debate on the other priorities. I thank the \nSenator for yielding. I join with others in saying that I think Senator \nSpecter and Senator Harkin did as well as could possibly been hoped for \nin terms of trying to take scarce resources and focus them on \neducation. But I do think that it would be appropriate to have a \nreexamination of where we are as a nation in the course of the \nconsideration of the appropriations to underscore the fact that this \nprovides billions of dollars less in terms of investing in young people \nin this country at a time when their needs are as great as they are.\n  I thank the Senator for the opportunity. I hope that the motion to \nproceed will not be accepted and that the ``no'' vote will carry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest one correction to what the \nSenator from Massachusetts said, and that is, that all of the \nlegislative proposals were stripped by the subcommittee. When they got \nto full committee there was a vote 14-12 to reinsert this with respect \nto the striker replacement.\n  It was my hope we would bring the bill to the floor solely in the \ncontext of an appropriations bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his statements about doing \nthe best we could. It is my hope this bill will yet come up. There are \nmany issues that need to be debated and voted on, a lot of differing \nviews in this body.\n  There are some who plan to offer amendments to try to increase \nfunding for job training--or for education--which I certainly would \nlike to see, if there is any way we could do it.\n  At some point these matters will come to the floor, if not on this \nmotion to proceed. It is my hope we will support the motion to proceed \nand go ahead with this very important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the balance of the time to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to clarify one thing that my \ncolleague from Massachusetts just mentioned; he said the courts have \nupheld the President in this matter.\n  I might mention that the district court upheld the ruling but it is \npending still before the court of appeals, and recognizing this case \nwas unprecedented, the district court judge suspended implementation of \nthe Executive order until the court of appeals acts. The courts have \nnot made a final decision.\n  Many think this is clearly legislation by Executive order, and the \nPresident exceeded that. The President has taken several actions by \nExecutive order. This is one. It is not the only one that is really \nlegislation that many feel very strongly about.\n  We should vote and we cannot vote unless we move to proceed to the \nLabor-HHS bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11:20 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now vote on a motion to proceed on H.R. \n2127.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 472 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg \n\n[[Page S 14456]]\n\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DENNIS, OF LOUISIANA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of James L. \nDennis, of Louisiana, to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to recommit the nomination to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: Does that call for immediate \naction, or is that a debatable motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to recommit is a debatable motion.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am prepared to describe to the Senate \nthe reasons for my motion, and to give other Senators an opportunity to \ndiscuss this. We had undertaken to work out an agreement on the basis \nof time constraints allocating time for one side and the other because \nsome did not want to set a precedent for doing the time agreement on a \nmotion to recommit on the Executive Calendar. We have not reached that \nagreement in any formal way.\n  But, for the information of Senators, it is my expectation that there \nwill be debate on this motion for at least 1 hour on this side in \nsupport of the motion to recommit. I expect that there will be a \ncorresponding amount of time, or at least certainly the availability of \nthat kind of time, on the other side. Then there would be a request for \nthe yeas and nays on the motion to recommit the nomination. We expect \nto be able to get a record vote on that motion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am the one who was reluctant to enter \ninto a time agreement and/or a formal agreement on the motion to \nrecommit. It is fully within the right of the Senator from Mississippi \nto do that. The reason I did not wish to do that is that it sets a \nprecedent. As long as I have been here, I do not recall us moving to \nrecommit a judicial nominee unanimously reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The second point that I make to my friend is that I have no intention \nof doing anything to delay the vote on this motion to recommit.\n  I would like at the appropriate moment to explain why I believe \nJustice Dennis is qualified and should be confirmed and why there is no \nneed to recommit. My colleagues from Louisiana, who have a genuine \ninterest in this nomination, are both here, and I would look to them to \nspeak to the qualifications of Justice Dennis and why a recommittal \nmotion would be in effect a very bad precedent.\n  I wish to make it clear to my friend from Mississippi that the \nSenator from Delaware does not have any other agenda. I do not have any \nintention of slowing up a vote on this. This is a slightly different \nprocedure from the general tradition of the Senate that when a nominee \ncomes up from a committee the Senate debates and votes on the nominee. \nHowever, I will not object to this motion to recommit Justice Dennis \nbecause it seems to me a version of what the North in the War Between \nthe States had hoped for for many years, that is, that two States in \nthe heart of Dixie would fight over an issue that the rest of us think \nis not worthy of a fight.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My response to the distinguished Senator from Delaware \nis I have no problem with his describing the committee's action. I know \nthe chairman of the committee would probably want to do that at some \npoint in this discussion.\n  Let me just say, if I can, in support of the motion that this is not \na fight between two States. This is a question that is being presented \nto the Senate today under this motion to recommit on the basis of newly \ndiscovered information about the fitness of this judge to serve on the \nfifth circuit court of appeals. The motion to recommit is to give the \nJudiciary Committee an opportunity to review the facts, the evidence \nand the investigation that has just recently been concluded by the \nstaff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, at the request of the chairman \nof that committee.\n  I have been briefed by the staff on the findings of that \ninvestigation, and I was advised at the time I was briefed that no \nother Senator had requested a briefing, no member of the committee had \nbeen briefed, other than the chairman had been given information from \nthe investigators. I am convinced on the basis of what I heard that the \nJudiciary Committee should reconvene and reconsider the nomination.\n  That is the reason this motion is being made. If this were just a \ndebate on the merits of the nominee or the fitness of this nominee on \nthe basis of the record as already made by the Judiciary Committee--\nwhether or not one State was being overly represented on the Court--\nthese are all facts that we would debate at that time, and it may be a \nsubject, a proper subject, for discussion at a later time. But this \nmotion is directed to the fact that after the committee reported the \nnomination, information became available which brought into question \nthe fitness of this judge to serve and whether or not he should have \ndisqualified himself from participating in a case before the Louisiana \nSupreme Court and related matters.\n  That is the point we will address this morning. We hope the Senate \nwill agree with us that this is clearly a situation where the committee \nought to reconsider the nomination.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield without losing his right to the \nfloor----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The way the Judiciary Committee has operated for the \nroughly 20 years, I guess, that I have been on it is that the \ninvestigative staffs of the majority and minority work together and \nshare all information. I wish to inform my friend from Mississippi that \nin addition to the Senator from Mississippi and the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Hatch, the Senator from Delaware has also been \nbriefed on all of the investigative matters including the one to which \nthe Senator refers.\n  I will be prepared and am ready to speak to that, but I will yield \nback. I do not have the floor. I thank my friend for his time, but \nassure him that I am aware the committee has been briefed. I see \nabsolutely no need to refer this back to the committee, but I will \nspeak to that in response to my friend's arguments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncomments.\n  Let me just say for the purpose of putting this in some historical \ncontext that Judge James Dennis is a member of the Louisiana State \nSupreme Court. \n\n[[Page S 14457]]\n He was nominated by President Clinton to serve on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. That nomination was made during the 103d \nCongress, the previous Congress.\n  The Judiciary Committee had a hearing. At the hearing Judge Dennis \nappeared. No witnesses appeared other than Judge Dennis, as I am \nadvised. There were four questions asked of Judge Dennis at that time. \nThe committee reported his nomination to the Senate. There was no \naction on the nomination during the last Congress, and this year his \nname was resubmitted to the Senate by the President. No other hearings \nwere held, no other inquiries were held, and he was reported out in due \ncourse to the Senate.\n  One day after the nomination had been reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, a Times-Picayune story revealed that Judge Dennis possibly \ncommitted a serious ethical violation by participating in a court \ndecision involving Tulane tuition waivers. Tulane tuition waivers \ninvolve under Louisiana law the right of a member of the State \nlegislature to bestow a favor on a friend by having the tuition that \nwould otherwise be due and payable to Tulane University waived under an \nexisting authority that goes way back to the last century in that \nState.\n  The issue was that Judge Dennis had a son who was given a judicial \nwaiver by a member of the legislature for 2 years going to law school. \nThen he laid out of law school for a year, and he was going to go back \nto law school, and he contacted the legislator who had given him the \nwaiver in the first instance and asked that he be reinstated. There was \nsome question about the extent to which Judge Dennis may have been \ninvolved in contacting or trying to influence the legislator to grant \nthat waiver for his son.\n  Anyway, Judge Dennis knew this story was being written. He had been \ncontacted by the paper. He had been questioned by the reporter. \nObviously, it was something that was getting a great deal of attention \nin the State of Louisiana.\n  This issue had been in the papers. There was some talk about whether \nthis was a practice that needed to be changed, whether it was sort of a \nbuddy system there in the State where legislators were giving friends \nof theirs tuition waivers. This abuse should be revisited.\n  Well, that is all really beside the point. The point is Judge Dennis \nknew he was right in the middle of this story being written, and he did \nnot bring it to the attention of the Judiciary Committee, which was \nabout to take action on his nomination to the second highest court in \nthe land, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that is based \nin New Orleans. There is an obligation--and I think the chairman and \nthe distinguished ranking member of the committee will acknowledge \nthis--there is an obligation and understanding with all nominees who \ncome before the Judiciary Committee in situations of this kind for \nconfirmation for a lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary that, \nif they know of any circumstance or facts that would affect the \nconsideration of the committee or the action that the committee is \nabout to take to report out the nomination, they are obliged and under \nan obligation to bring such facts to the attention of the committee. \nJudge Dennis did not do this. There is no question in the record Judge \nDennis did not do this.\n  There is a suggestion that Judge Dennis contacted someone in the \nJustice Department. I do not have a copy of any of the transcript, \nwhether it was a letter, whether it was a fax, whether it was a phone \ncall. I do not have the phone log or exactly what was said or to whom. \nBut I am advised that there was contact made.\n  But, nonetheless, the Judiciary Committee proceeded to act without \nany knowledge of the fact that this issue had arisen and certainly not \nof the fact that it was going to be big news in Louisiana the next day, \nafter it acted on the nomination. Judge Dennis knew that his ethics \nwere in question and did not bring that knowledge of this to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The ethics of Judge Dennis were being questioned by the reporters who \nasked the questions. And the reason it was an issue is because the \nSupreme Court of Louisiana had been called upon to rule on a freedom-\nof-information request where a request had been filed by the newspaper \nasking legislators to provide records from their offices to show which \ncitizens of Louisiana had been given these tuition waivers by them \nunder the authority of existing Louisiana law.\n  Well, you can imagine some of the legislators did not want to reveal \nthis information. They did not want to disclose the facts. Anyway, suit \nwas filed by the paper, and that was decided in a lower court and \nworked its way up. It finally got up to the supreme court. Judge Dennis \nparticipated in a decision on the issue affirming a lower court \ndecision that the paper had to make that information available.\n  Judge Dennis did not disclose his potential interest in this case at \nthe time the case was decided by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. He \nparticipated in the case. He voted on the case. He did not disclose \nthis information to the Judiciary Committee or the fact that this was \nan issue and a controversy in Louisiana that might be perceived as \naffecting his fitness to serve on the second highest court in the land.\n  He knew--he knew--that he had a continuing obligation to reveal any \ninformation to the committee which might affect his nomination or the \ncommittee's decision in this case. He did not call the committee to \nreport that the story was coming out. He then knew his nomination had \nbeen voted out of the committee. There was some communication after he \nhad been reported out of the committee and the nomination was pending \nhere in the Senate.\n  The significance of this story, I think, can be best described in \nterms of its notoriety and its importance in Louisiana with the \nheadline that was used by the Times-Picayune to call attention to this. \nAs a matter of fact, it had in bold headlines: ``Hall of Shame, Public \nConfidence in Judge Dennis Is Destroyed.''\n  I think loss of confidence in a member of the judiciary, of course, \naffects the judicial system and not just at the fifth circuit, but \nthroughout the country. The question that I think the committee ought \nto properly answer, and has not had an opportunity to address in any \nformal way, is: Was Judge Dennis' conduct an ethical violation? I think \nit was. I think it clearly rises to the level of improper conduct that \nwould affect this committee's decision to report the nomination to the \nSenate.\n  I frankly do not believe after the committee reviews all the facts, \nhears all the evidence, calls witnesses who are familiar with this \nentire situation, I do not believe the committee is going to favorably \nreport this nomination back to the Senate.\n  What I am disturbed about is that there has been pressure to call the \nnomination up, take action on the nomination. I do not want to \npersonally, just because I am from a neighboring State and we have had \ndiscussions about whether this is a seat that should be filled by a \nMississippian or a Louisiana person--I do not want that to cloud the \nreal issue here, and that is the fitness of this nominee to serve on \nthe court. That is why I have decided to move to recommit the \nnomination to the committee.\n  I am prepared to let the committee look further into this in an \norderly way and in a deliberate way to determine whether my suspicions \nare correct, whether the suspicions of many people throughout the \nLouisiana-Mississippi-Texas area, where this court has jurisdiction, \nare correct. We have been getting phone calls and letters; people are \ndisturbed about this. And we think that the committee ought to look \nfurther into the situation.\n  The Judiciary Committee ought to begin the opportunity to review its \ndecision and either decide to report the nomination in light of this \nnew information--I think the information reveals that Judge Dennis, \nfirst of all, failed to recuse himself properly in a case resulting in \nsuch an impropriety as to warrant public disapproval and the \ndisapproval of the committee of his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what the procedure is in terms of being \nable to speak again, but I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nyield the floor to other Senators who want to speak and then to speak \nagain at some point under this motion. I do not \n\n[[Page S 14458]]\nwant to lose my right to the floor by so yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. The Senator has an opportunity to regain the \nfloor at any time under any circumstance, is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Mississippi gives up the \nfloor, he may be rerecognized at the proper time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not want to violate the two-speech rule. You cannot \nunder the rules of the Senate make two speeches on one legislative day. \nIs it because we are in executive session that the legislative day two-\nspeech rule does not apply, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator wants to waive the two-speech \nrule, he can do that affirmatively without keeping the floor. You can \nmake the unanimous consent request at this time, or----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is why I made the request.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I love to hear the Senator speak. If the \ntwo-speech rule applied to this place, I imagine we would have only one \nor two Senators who ever spoke. I will be delighted to hear him again.\n  I would like to make several points to him, and I will not take long. \nI would like to ask him a question, if I may.\n  If I may ask the Senator from Mississippi, is it his--I realize there \nis no unanimous consent in any of this--but just as he postulated what \nhe hoped would happen in terms of procedure here this afternoon, is it \nthe Senator's intention that, if his motion to recommit fails, that we \nwould go then to a vote up or down on the nominee?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection to proceeding to voting on the \nnomination. As I understand it, though, it would be subject to debate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No. It would.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not want to foreclose any Senator's right by any \nagreement like that. My personal inclination would be to proceed to \nvote in due course whenever Senators--if they want to talk about it, \nthey could, but there is no agreement to proceed to a vote at that \ntime.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know there is no agreement. What I am asking, does the \nSenator know of anyone who would have an interest in not allowing us to \nget to a vote today?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator would yield. I know Senators are \ninterested in this subject. Two or three have come up to me and said, \n``You are not going to let this proceed to a final vote today if this \nmotion is defeated?'' I said, ``I am not going to stand in the way of \nthat. But if you want to speak you can. You have the right to do \nthat.'' So I do not know what other Senators may do. I do not intend to \nfilibuster the nomination, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me make a few points before I respond \nto the specific concerns of the Senator from Mississippi. One, it is \ntrue that, to the best of my knowledge, only myself and Senator Hatch \nhave availed ourselves of the investigative report done by minority and \nmajority staff on the question that has been raised by the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Senator Hatch notified all Republican members on the committee, which \nis our practice, that follow-up work was conducted on a matter that had \ncome up after we had voted and that professional staff who had done the \ninvestigation were there, ready, willing and able to brief people on \nit. My staff briefed the staffs of the Democratic members of the \ncommittee.\n  I will tell you why most people did not think it was so important. \nJustice Dennis has been around for a long time. His nomination came up \nin 1994. There has been, and I am not questioning the motivation of my \nfriend from Mississippi, but let me put it this way, he has not been \nfast tracked. He has not moved very swiftly. The Senator from Delaware \nmay be under the mistaken impression that the failure to move Justice \nDennis had little to do with Justice Dennis' integrity, competence and/\nor forthrightness and ability to be on the bench, but had to do with a \nlegitimate dispute--I guess any dispute between and amongst States is \nlegitimate--about whose seat this should be.\n  It happens all the time. It happens in the first circuit, it happens \nin the second circuit, it happens in the third circuit. We had a debate \nin the third circuit about whether or not a seat should be a \nPennsylvania vacancy or a New Jersey vacancy. I am not saying this only \nhappens in the South. It happens all across the country, and Senators \nfight very hard for the prerogatives of their States to have folks \nrepresented on the circuit courts in numbers that they believe are \nappropriate.\n  That has, up to now at least, been the major impediment, at least \nfrom the perspective of the Senator from Delaware, of Justice Dennis \ngetting a vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Having said that, let me speak specifically to the question raised by \nmy friend from Mississippi.\n  It has been argued that Justice Dennis should have recused himself \nfrom a case that came before the Louisiana Supreme Court involving a \nsuit by a local newspaper against five State legislators.\n  Under Louisiana law, a judge may be recused for five reasons. I might \npoint out that the Federal rules of recusal, and most State rules of \nrecusal, are not designed to encourage judges to recuse themselves \nautomatically. Otherwise, judges would be able to avoid all the tough \ndecisions. So the presumption is that you should not recuse unless you \nmeet a certain standard.\n  Let me tell you what Louisiana law says, because that is the law that \nJustice Dennis, then on the Louisiana Supreme Court, was obliged under \nhis oath of office to follow.\n  Here are the five reasons for which a Louisiana judge may recuse \nhimself or herself: First, he or she is a material witness in the cause \nof action before him or her; second, he has been employed or consulted \nas an attorney in the cause of action prior to being on the bench; \nthird, he has performed a judicial act in the cause of action in \nanother court; fourth, he is related to one of the parties involved in \nthe suit; or fifth, and this is the important piece here, he has an \ninterest in the cause.\n  My friend from Mississippi is making the case that Justice Dennis \nshould have recused himself because of the fifth provision in Louisiana \nlaw--that Justice Dennis had an interest in the case before him. Only \nthis last reason--where a judge is interested in the case--could \npossibly provide grounds for Justice Dennis to recuse himself from the \nTimes-Picayune case. As the nominee explained to the committee, he had \nabsolutely no interest in the case brought by the Times-Picayune.\n  Let me go through the facts, because I think it is very important to \nknow what the specific facts are.\n  For over a century, since 1884, each Louisiana State legislator has \nhad the right to nominate a Louisiana citizen to receive free tuition \nto Tulane University for 1 year. I might note parenthetically, that \nthis is not something in the last several decades that the press has \nthought is a good thing.\n  To the best of my knowledge, and I am certainly not a historian or \nstudent of Louisiana history, no one questioned this practice for a \nlong time. Along comes the Times-Picayune, which is their right, and \nthey wanted to know who had appointed whom to Tulane University under \nthis 1884 law.\n  Again, no one is questioning whether or not the law of Louisiana \npermitted a State legislator to nominate a Louisiana citizen to receive \nfree tuition to Tulane University for 1 year. These tuition waivers \nare, under Louisiana law, as we understand it, privately funded.\n  In 1985, Justice Dennis' son--now, this is 1985, 10 years ago--Steve \nDennis, received a tuition waiver from his legislator, a gentleman \nnamed Representative Jones. At that time, Justice Dennis' son, Steven, \nwas a 26-year-old married man, financially independent of his father, \nand living apart from his father.\n  And, I might add, he lived in Representative Jones' district. Now, \nSteve Dennis received tuition waivers to attend Tulane law school in \nthe years \n\n[[Page S 14459]]\n1985, 1986 and 1988. He did not attend law school during the 1987-88 \nacademic year.\n  In December 1993, 8 years after Steve Dennis was first nominated to \nreceive this tuition waiver by his State legislator, the Times-Picayune \nand one of its reporters sued five legislators for failure to turn over \ncopies of forms they used to nominate people for tuition waivers. The \nfive legislators sued were: Emile ``Peppi'' Bruneau, Jr., Naomi White-\nWarren Farve, Garey J. Forster, Arthur A. Morell, Edwin Murray.\n  The reason I mention their names is that Representative Jones--the \nperson who had nominated Steve Dennis--was not sued. He was not a \nparty. He was not asked to submit the names of people he had, in fact, \nnominated to receive the tuition waiver.\n  There were two issues involved in this case brought by the Times-\nPicayune. First, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the \nnomination forms of these five legislators were public documents, even \nif the forms were currently held by Tulane. Second, the plaintiffs \nsought a writ of mandamus ordering each defendant to produce all \nnomination forms in his or her custody, including those held by Tulane.\n  Now, in January 1994, the trial court, of which Justice Dennis was \nnot a member, determined that the nomination forms were public and \ngranted the writ of mandamus ordering the defendants, the five State \nrepresentatives, to produce all the documents and forms held by them or \nTulane. The trial court also awarded attorney's fees to the plaintiffs.\n  The legislators then appealed from the trial court. In October 1994, \nthe State fourth circuit court of appeals--not the Federal circuit \ncourt of appeals--agreed that the nomination forms were public \ndocuments subject to disclosure. However, finding no indication that \nthe defendants would not comply with the court's declaratory judgment, \nthe court of appeal reversed the grant of the writ of mandamus against \nthe defendants. The court felt that it was premature to subject the \nfive legislators to mandamus, given that its declaratory judgment was \nthe first definitive statement of the rights of the parties. The court \nof appeal also reversed the attorney's fee award.\n  Finally, the case came before the Supreme Court of the State of \nLouisiana. Enter Justice Dennis. There were only two issues that came \nup to the Supreme Court. One, whether a mandamus was appropriate, and, \ntwo, whether the plaintiffs should receive attorney's fees. It was no \nlonger an issue as to whether the nomination forms were public \ndocuments. That was settled. That was not even appealed. The fourth \ncircuit had already established that they were, and that the defendant \nlegislators would have to turn over these documents to the Times-\nPicayune.\n\n  Now, in a 6-1 decision in which Justice Dennis was with the majority, \nthe Louisiana Supreme Court denied the Times-Picayune application for \nreview and refused to consider the untimely application of one \ndefendant who challenged the newspaper's standing.\n  Remember what is being laid out, the predicate: That Justice Dennis \ncommitted some big ethical violation, and he did not tell the committee \nabout it, either. First, he was hiding something from us, the Judiciary \nCommittee, and, second, he was hiding it because it was unethical \nbehavior.\n  I might add, I doubt whether there is a member of either party who \nwould be willing to let his or her reputation be ultimately written in \nthe great book based on only the headlines he or she has received \nthroughout his or her life. I doubt whether there is a single, solitary \nperson who holds public office who has not spoken to an editor and \nheard the editor say, ``I am sorry, Bennett, but I don't write the \nheadlines.'' ``I am sorry, Thad, but I don't write the headlines.'' \nWhat my good friend from Mississippi read was a headline from the \nTimes-Picayune which I do not know means anything, except it is \nunintentionally, in my view, misleading about the character of Justice \nDennis.\n  Now, it is the Louisiana Supreme Court decision from which some argue \nthat Justice Dennis should have recused himself. As I said earlier, \nunder Louisiana statute, there is only one possible reason why Justice \nDennis, may have recused himself--and that is because he had an \ninterest in the case.\n  Justice Dennis, through written and oral statements to our staff, \ngave three reasons why he determined that there were no grounds under \nwhich he should recuse himself.\n  One, he had absolutely no interest in the outcome of the only issues \nbefore the court. The only issues before the court were the writ of \nmandamus and attorney's fees. He had absolutely no interest in that at \nall or in the petition by a latecomer saying that the Times-Picayune \nhad no standing.\n  Second, his son had no interest in the case's outcome. His son was \nlong out of law school. His son was a married man, 26 years old, living \non his own in the district of a legislator who was not named in the \nlawsuit. What possible interest could his son have had in the outcome \nof this case?\n  The third point Justice Dennis makes is that Representative Jones, \nwho nominated Steve Dennis for the tuition waiver, did not have an \ninterest in the outcome of the case.\n  Let me review each of these reasons and then I will sit down. First \nof all, Justice Dennis had no interest in the outcome of the issues \nbefore the court. He had no relationship to either party, the newspaper \nor any of the five legislators.\n  Second, Justice Dennis' son had no interest in the outcome of the \ncase. Steve Dennis was first nominated for a tuition waiver by a Monroe \nlegislator in 1985, 8 years before the suit was filed and 10 years \nbefore it came to the Louisiana court. Steve Dennis had no interest in \nthe Times-Picayune application before the State supreme court because \nthe public record status of the nomination forms had already been \nresolved. The fact that they were public documents meant anybody could \ngo and find out whether or not in 1985 Steve Dennis had been nominated \nby Representative Jones.\n  Further, Steve Dennis had no interest or stake in the remaining \nissues: The mandamus order for the defendants to turn over the \ndocuments or the attorney's fees awarded to plaintiffs.\n  Last, Justice Dennis did not recuse himself because the Monroe \nlegislator who nominated his son had no interest in the outcome of the \ncase. Representative Jones was not a party to the case. He was not \nsubject to the writ of mandamus or the award of attorney's fees.\n  The supreme court's denial of the Times-Picayune writ application was \nsimply a decision not to review the mandamus and attorney's fees issues \nany further. The court did not decide any question of law or fact. It \nestablished no supreme court precedent that could affect future cases. \nNor did the rejection by the court of appeal of the Times-Picayune suit \nfor attorney's fees and mandamus establish any precedent that would \nhave provided grounds for nondisclosure by the Representative Jones, or \nany other nonparty.\n  Once the court of appeal decision became definitive on March 17, \n1995, no custodian of a tuition waiver nomination form could claim that \nthe law was unclear as to whether there was a clear duty to disclose \nthe nomination records. If the custodian refused to respond favorably \nto a request by an adult person for the records, he or she was subject \nto mandamus and attorney's fees awards against him.\n  Justice Dennis has explained clearly why he did not recuse himself in \nthis particular case. He made a thoughtful and reasoned decision, after \ntaking all the facts into consideration. And his record shows that he \ndoes not have a blithe disregard for Louisiana's recusal law. In fact, \nthere were two cases in which Representative Jones was a party, and \nfrom which Justice Dennis did recuse himself. Both cases were bar \ndisciplinary matters against Representative Jones that came before the \nLouisiana Supreme Court under its original jurisdiction over \nproceedings relating to disciplinary matters.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield for a question on the point of \nwhat was at issue in the case before the supreme court? Just a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. One question I have that has not been brought out here \nwas that this suit not only requested a ruling as to these five \nlegislators, but, more important, with respect to Judge Dennis, it \ninvolved all legislators' records, as to whether or not they were \npublic records. And the reason this is important as far as Judge Dennis \nis concerned--and did the committee \n\n[[Page S 14460]]\nknow this?--that he was a legislator before he was a judge, and he had \nawarded scholarships to Tulane and therefore records that he had \ncontrol over, under the ruling of the lower court, made him a party in \ninterest even though he was not a named defendant?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I can respond to my friend, the factual statement he \nmade about Justice Dennis having been a legislator, that this affected \nall legislators, and the writ of mandamus would have affected all \nlegislators, is absolutely accurate except for one big problem. That \nissue was not before the supreme court on which Justice Dennis sat.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It was if they did not overrule the fourth circuit. The \nfourth circuit had reversed the lower court. The lower court ruled that \nwas public property and that all legislators had control over the files \nthat were held by Tulane. And the Tulane custodian of records, Carolyn \nLaBlaime, testified in the lower court that, on the request of \nlegislators, she and Tulane would make those records available. So the \nquestion was whether all legislators would have this responsibility.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I may respond to my friend, he is again partially \ncorrect. That was the issue in the lower court. That was the issue in \nthe court of appeal. But that was not an issue which was appealed to \nthe Louisiana Supreme Court. The supreme court did not speak to, nor \nwas it asked to rule on, or affirm or overrule the question of whether \nor not these were public records.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator answer one other \nquestion?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Certainly.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not want to delay this inordinately. I think there \nis a question that ought to be clarified; that is, at the point when \nthe case reached the supreme court, none of those legislators, except \none, had voluntarily requested Tulane to release the information they \nhad regarding the appointments that legislator made to the scholarship \nprivilege at Tulane. That was Peppi Bruneau. The others--even though \nthe court had ruled at the district court level, and the fifth and the \nfourth circuit, the intermediate court had confirmed were public \nrecords--none of them had acted to respond to the Times-Picayune \nrequest. And, as a matter of fact, is not it true that it was only \nafter all of these cases had been acted on did the paper realize they \nhad won the case but they still did not have the records, and they had \nto sue again to compel delivery of the records? They had to sue Tulane \nbecause none of the legislators, including Judge Dennis or any of his \ncolleagues who had given out these scholarships, had asked for the \nrecords.\n  So the point is Judge Dennis, in my view, certainly, had an interest \nin whether he acted on it in deciding the case and the ruling. He did \nnot disclose the interest, but he went on and acted on it nonetheless. \nIt seems to me--does it not seem to the Senator from Delaware--that \nwould be a proper inquiry for the Judiciary Committee to make.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I can respond, we did make that inquiry \nand reached a totally different conclusion than the Senator from \nMississippi. Again, let me make clear why.\n  First, there was no question. The records were public documents. The \nissue was whether a mandamus should be issued.\n  Second, the fact that only one of the five legislators, turned over \nthese records further underscores the point that they were the only \nfive people involved in this matter. No one was asking for, in this \ncourt, case records from any other legislator.\n  Third, the question that the intermediate court responded to \ndifferently than the upper court was whether or not the vehicle to get \nthese records from Tulane would be a writ of mandamus or a lawsuit. \nThat was the issue; not just how do you get the records. And that issue \ndid not go to whether or not they would have to be produced, but when \nand under what legal document would they have to be produced. And on \nthat score, Justice Dennis affirmed the intermediate court's ruling \nalong with five other justices.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one more \nquestion?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be happy to. But let me finish this point.\n  I respectfully suggest, if the Senator looks at what the law says, \nwhat the court had said and what was before Judge Dennis, the matter \nthat concerns him most, as it should, was resolved.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield, \nthe distinguished Senator said that the committee had looked into this \nissue and had come to a conclusion different from the one I came to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. How could you have done that if the information about \nthis nomination to Tulane and the scholarships did not come to the \nattention of anybody until the day after the Judiciary Committee \nreported the nomination to the Senate?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, that is a legitimate question. Let me \nrespond to that--the way we do in every such case. The standard \noperating procedure is, if we get something that even has the potential \ncolor of conflict, the majority and the minority get together. The \nstandard procedure is they go back and investigate. Sometimes we call \nthe FBI back in. ``Would you take a look at this? Is it specious? Is \nthere anything to it? Is it real or not real?''\n  Staff may also call the person making the allegation. And the staff \nmakes a judgment as to whether it is specious, whether it warrants \nfurther investigation, or whether or not they have enough information \nto make a recommendation to the committee.\n  The third thing we may do is call the nominee. We call the nominee \nand say, ``OK, look. This was raised. Here is the deal. These are the \nfacts as we know them. Explain yourself.''\n  That is what we did here. The explanation was given. The nominee \nwrote a letter to the committee and he was interviewed by staff. We \nread the briefs that were filed and the newspaper accounts.\n  The staff concluded that Judge Dennis made the right decision, that \nhe did nothing unethical.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I think the staff has now concluded in another way. I do \nnot know whether there is any evidence that the Senator can give the \nSenate about what the staff has concluded. But in today's Times-\nPicayune, there is a statement from a reporter who called and talked \nwith staff members of the Judiciary Committee.\n  And it says, ``At issue is Dennis' vote in a 6-to-1 Supreme Court \ndecision in March to deny'' the newspaper's ``request for access to the \n. . . forms.'' And it says one staff member says that there was nothing \nnew discovered. Another says there are questions raised about whether \nhe should have recused himself.\n  So the paper has discovered that committee staff has a difference of \nopinion. I was briefed and I can say that my impression was there is a \nserious question and that is why this motion is being made.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me respond to the Senator, if I may. I have not seen \ntoday's Times-Picayune. However, it is not unusual for staff, as well \nas Member of the Senate, to have different perceptions of a given \nsituation but I am not sure that is relevant.\n  Let me explain the procedure. What happens is the majority staff goes \nto a gentleman named Manus Cooney, who has been on the staff for a long \ntime, first-rate lawyer. He goes and speaks to the chairman of the \ncommittee. Karen Robb, a seasoned lawyer, who has been here a long \ntime, comes to me and says now this is what the facts reveal. I then \nask what I expect Orrin also asks: What do you think? My staff shows me \nthe information. I look at it, and I say I think there is nothing here.\n  The next step in the procedure is to make this information available \nto committee members directly or through staff. Again, this is standard \noperating procedure. And I am the one who as chairman initiated this \nrule. Orrin has followed the precedent--whatever investigative \ninformation we have, from the FBI, from any source, where there is any \nquestion raised. We notify members of the committee, and we say, hey, \nfolks, there was a new issue raised or an old issue reraised. We have \nlooked at it. If you want to know about it, come here, look at the \ninformation.\n  A lot of this information is FBI-related material on which we only \nbrief \n\n[[Page S 14461]]\nSenators. And a lot of it is non-FBI material, like this on which we \nbrief staff. This is all non-FBI stuff here. It's not confidential.\n  And so I say to my friend there is nothing unusual about this case. \nThere has not been a single time since I have been on this committee \nthat I can think of where we have not voted somebody out and after \nhaving voted on it received new information. The most celebrated case? \nA Supreme Court nominee.\n  Were we to reopen a full committee hearing and a full committee vote \nevery single time after we voted anybody raised an allegation, we would \neffectively shut down the nominating process. Every single time, if we \nhad to reopen a hearing, have a new public hearing and have a vote, we, \nthe Democrats, would effectively be able to keep nominees from being on \nthe bench. And the Republicans could do the same. It is just not a way \nwe could possibly operate. Now, let me say one other point. If, for \nexample, we came forward and the information received after we voted we \nbelieved was of such a consequence, Senator Hatch and I, or any member \nof the committee, that it warranted further hearings, we would have \nthem. Case in point: a Supreme Court nomination.\n  They have to be issues where the staff, Senators, or the ranking \nmember and chairperson, somebody says, ``This is a big problem. We \nbetter take a look at this thing.'' Nobody said that here because \nnobody that I am aware of believes that here. So that is why we did not \nopen up a new hearing.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If a member, who is a senior member, of the Judiciary \nCommittee staff tells a Senator like I was told during the briefing on \nthis issue that if the committee had had the information that came to \nlight after the nomination had been reported, the committee would not \nhave reported the nomination, does that not seem to the Senator to be \nsufficient grounds to request reconsideration of the issue by the \ncommittee?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The answer is no, if in fact the chairman of the \ncommittee, the ranking member of the committee and other members who \nhad that information made available to them did not reach that \nconclusion.\n  I am confident that I could find in the Agriculture Committee, in \nevery other committee here, a staff member who would say after we voted \nsomething out, if they knew all of that information they probably would \nnot have voted that way. If we operate with that as the basis for \nwhether or not it is worthy to refer back to a committee a nomination \nor a piece of legislation, we are not going to get very far.\n  Again, I am not in any way--please let my colleague understand and \nthe record show--I am not in any way questioning the motivation of my \ncolleague from Mississippi. What I am suggesting is that a close look \nat the facts and the law makes an overwhelming and compelling case that \nJustice Dennis did exactly the right thing when he concluded that there \nwas no need to recuse himself.\n  I see my other friend from Mississippi and my two colleagues from \nLouisiana, who are very interested in this, are here. I will be \navailable if they want to ask me any more questions.\n  So I will in the meantime yield the floor and stand ready to answer \nquestions if anybody has them.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have looked into this matter in great \ndetail, and I think the Senator from Delaware is exactly correct. I \nhave read the decisions and read the letters. I think he is exactly \ncorrect. I must say that it is a very fine legal point. Even with what \nmy friend from Mississippi said, it is hardly the kind of matter that \nis so serious as to deny a person a role on the court.\n  The question of whether or not this issue was really at issue before \nthe supreme court--it had not been appealed on actually what we call a \nwrit of certiorari. So this question was not really before the supreme \ncourt. What was really before the supreme court was whether the Times-\nPicayune was entitled to its attorney's fees and whether or not the \nwrit of mandamus was premature.\n  But, Mr. President, I daresay, if we gave our colleagues a pop quiz \non this question nobody, save those at least on the floor, could answer \nthe question, it is such a complicated legal matter.\n  Suffice it to say the matter has been, I believe, effectively and \nthoroughly decided by the Judiciary Committee. This matter was pending \nfor a long time. I really do not think that is the real issue behind \nwhether Judge Dennis ought to be on the fifth circuit.\n  Mr. President, the real question is should Judge Jim Dennis be on the \ncircuit court of appeals? Mr. President, I have known him for over 30 \nyears. We served in the State legislature together. He is one of the \nmost distinguished jurists the State of Louisiana has ever produced. \nHis life has been marked by excellence in everything he has done. In \nlaw school, he was in the Order of the Coif; that is, a top scholar. He \nwas on the Law Review, again a top scholar.\n  He was in the State legislature, where he made an outstanding record. \nHe has been on the bench in every level--the district court, the court \nof appeals, and the supreme court--for many years. He is one of those \ngifted legal scholars who can write things in ways that are clear and \nhe can marshal up the English language and make it march, as someone \nsaid about Winston Churchill. He is that good, and recognized as such. \nHe is a great favorite of both the bench and the bar in Louisiana. Mr. \nPresident, he would be an enormously popular judge.\n  Now, he has certainly come within the cross hairs of the Times-\nPicayune, no doubt. I must say, he is in very good company in that, Mr. \nPresident. You see, Paul Tulane, when he made his bequest to Tulane \nUniversity, went to the legislature and said, ``We want people from \nevery parish in the State. And we want a little financial help. Will \nyou pass a law that says legislators are entitled to name people to \nTulane tuition free?''\n  The legislature passed that law over 100 years ago. For over 100 \nyears, it was in place in Louisiana and never questioned. I think my \ncolleague said for 80 or 90 years. No, it was for over 100 years. But \nit has to be a real hot issue with the Times-Picayune. They have gotten \nMembers of Congress in both Houses, in both parties--some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the other party are \nalso in these cross hairs--and a former Republican Governor, one of the \nmost honest and best we ever had, in my view. I liked him a whole lot. \nAll of you know him and served with him. He is one of those in the \ncross hairs. Also a State treasurer and State legislators of both \nparties. I submit to you not all those folks are ethically deficient. \nThat was a legal, ethical, proper thing. That is really what is \ninvolved.\n  The Times-Picayune, though, has a great story, and they are pursuing \nit. This judge ruled against them, denied them attorney's fees. I do \nnot know whether that has anything to do with it, but I will tell you \none thing: If this were an opinion, rather than a newspaper story, they \nwould certainly be recused because they certainly had an interest in \nthis matter.\n  Be that as it may, Mr. President, this is a good judge. He is a good \nman.\n  This is a complicated legal question. The staff has looked at it, \nmajority and minority. Look, it is not something where Joe Biden is our \nDemocratic head of this thing, and sort of squelched this matter. That \nis not it at all, Mr. President. That is not it at all.\n  This is a good man. He is not ethically deficient, I can guarantee \nyou that. He ought to be confirmed to the fifth circuit. He deserves \nit.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will rise in support of the motion to \nrecommit the nomination of Justice James Dennis to be a member of the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals back to the Judiciary Committee for \nfurther review. And I also am going to go ahead at this time and \nexpress my opposition to Judge Dennis for other reasons. I think \nclearly this nomination has not been sufficiently and properly reviewed \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n  There has been information that has been revealed since that \nnomination was approved by the Judiciary Committee back in July that \nhas not been reviewed by the full committee, by many members of the \ncommittee. \n\n[[Page S 14462]]\n\n  As a matter of fact, I understand from what was said a few moments \nago, that while the Senator from Delaware reviewed the accusations with \nregard to the Tulane matter, and perhaps the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Hatch of Utah, reviewed it, as a matter of fact, what happened \nafter this information was given to the Judiciary Committee, I \nunderstand, is the staff sent a letter to Judge Dennis asking him to \nrespond. Then there was a conversation by telephone regarding the \nallegations here without ever actually having an opportunity to \ninterview him in person.\n  He did not come back before the committee. And, as a matter of fact, \nthe staff members on the two sides of the committee do not agree on \nwhat we should have done or how this matter was handled by Judge \nDennis.\n  So I do think there is very good reason to recommit this nomination. \nBefore I talk about the specifics of the case, I want to take note that \neven the Judiciary Committee, I think, perhaps gave this nomination \nonly cursory consideration. When the hearings were held, only five \nquestions were asked of this nominee, and only one member asked the \nquestions.\n  So I really would have thought since there have been questions raised \nabout this nominee almost from the beginning--in fact, I think from the \nbeginning--that there would have been a fuller hearing and more \nquestions would have been asked. And the questions certainly did not go \ninto much probing detail. So I think just on that basis there is \njustification to ask the Judiciary Committee to review the matter \nfurther.\n  The committee staff that conducted the investigation in this case, as \nI understand it, determined that Judge Dennis should have recused \nhimself in this matter. Now, at least on the majority side, that is the \ninformation I received. So maybe there is disagreement by the staff on \nthe other side. But I wonder, when you have staff coming to that \nconclusion that he should have recused himself in this case involving \nTulane University and the scholarships, should not the full committee \nhave reviewed their recommendation?\n  This matter was reported by the Judiciary Committee on July 20, 1995. \nIt was 3 days later that this matter appeared in the Times-Picayune. I \nbelieve Senator Cochran has already asked that this be printed in the \nRecord. He has not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Times-Picayune article of Thursday, \nJuly 23, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Times-Picayune, July 23, 1995]\n\n                 Judge Defends His Tulane Records Vote\n\n                           (By Tyler Bridges)\n\n       State Supreme Court Justice James Dennis, whose son \n     received Tulane tuition waivers, later voted to deny a \n     request by The Times-Picayune for review of a lower court \n     decision in the newspaper's suit seeking access to five New \n     Orleans legislators' Tulane scholarship nomination forms.\n       The newspaper eventually received the scholarship \n     nomination forms of all Louisiana legislators by filing a \n     subsequent lawsuit against Tulane.\n       The records obtained from that suit show that Stephen \n     Dennis was awarded Tulane tuition waivers for three years in \n     the late 1980s by then-state Rep. Charles D. Jones, D-Monroe.\n       An associate justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court since \n     1975, James Dennis last year was nominated to a federal \n     judgeship by President Clinton. That nomination, to the 5th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, was approved by the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee Thursday night and now goes to the Senate \n     floor. Dennis, however, continues to face strong opposition \n     from Mississippi's two senators, who argue that an appointee \n     from their state deserves the judgeship and that Dennis is \n     soft on crime. The appeals court hears cases from Texas, \n     Louisiana and Mississippi.\n       Prior to his election to the Louisiana Supreme Court, \n     Dennis, 59, a native of Monroe, was a state district judge, \n     an appellate judge, and a state representative.\n       The Tulane scholarship that Dennis' son received is awarded \n     under a century-old program that permits every legislator to \n     award a tuition waiver every year.\n       Jones, now a state senator, declined to explain why he \n     nominated Stephen Dennis.\n       In a written statement to the newspaper, Dennis said that \n     his son in 1985 had sought the scholarship on his own, \n     ``without my suggestion or help . . . At that time, Steve was \n     26 years old, married, and a resident of (Jones') district. \n     He and his wife were struggling but fully self-supporting and \n     financially independent of me. I was unable to assist Steve \n     in going to law school because of my obligations of support \n     owed to my wife and three younger children. I did not ask \n     (Jones) to nominate Steve for the waiver. I believe that the \n     nomination was made on the basis of Steve's academic record, \n     his financial need of educational assistance and his \n     outstanding extracurricular and other achievements.''\n       Dennis in March 1995 voted in the majority of a 6-1 \n     decision to deny The Times-Picayune's request that the \n     Supreme Court review an appeals court ruling in the \n     newspaper's suit against the New Orleans legislators.\n       In a written statement to the newspaper, Dennis said the \n     case did not pose a conflict of interest for him because the \n     appeals court already had upheld The Times-Picayune's primary \n     contention that the nominating forms were a public record. \n     Dennis said further review of the ``collateral issues'' \n     raised by The Times-Picayune's request for review was not \n     warranted.\n       While the appeals court upheld the newspaper's position \n     that the forms were public records, it also had ruled that \n     legislators were not required to get their scholarship \n     nomination forms from Tulane if they did not have the forms \n     in their possession. This issue was important to the \n     newspaper because numerous legislators had declined to \n     identify their recipients, no longer held the forms \n     themselves and had declined to get the forms from Tulane. In \n     fact, even after the appeals court ruling, four of the five \n     defendants refused to obtain their forms from Tulane and make \n     them public.\n       ``I did not have any interest in the outcome of the only \n     issues to come before the Supreme Court,'' Dennis wrote the \n     newspaper. He would not answer questions beyond his written \n     statement.\n       Under the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, a judge may \n     recuse himself when he ``is biased, prejudiced or interested \n     in the cause or its outcome or biased or prejudiced toward or \n     against the parties . . . to such an extent that he would be \n     unable to conduct fair and impartial proceedings.''\n       After the Supreme Court denied The Times-Picayune's request \n     for review, the newspaper filed suit to force Tulane to \n     release the scholarship nomination forms of all Louisiana \n     legislators. Civil District Judge Gerald Fedoroff ruled in \n     the newspaper's favor in June, and Tulane released the \n     records this month.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, so it was 3 days after the committee had \nacted when this whole issue started coming to the forefront and \nquestions were being raised about Judge Dennis and his involvement in \nthat ruling on the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n  Clearly, while you can argue that it came to the supreme court in a \nvery narrow way, I think clearly this is a question of judgment. That \nis very key here. We are fixing to put a nominee on the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, a Federal court, for life, and a nominee's judgment \nis very critical in whether we vote for or against him.\n  He knew about the practice in Tulane. He knew about the Times-\nPicayune investigation. He had, in fact, participated in this process. \nI do not judge it, prejudge it, or condemn it. I know it went on. What \nwas really involved here was a decision about whether or not this \ninformation should be made available, as I understand it. Clearly, he \nhad had an involvement as a legislator and his son had been involved. \nIt appears to me judgment would have dictated that he would have \nrecused himself.\n  As a matter of fact, the Louisiana rules of court, canon 2 says:\n\n       A judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of \n     impropriety in all activities.\n\n  Surely there was at least an appearance of impropriety in this \nmatter.\n  I have experienced some unusual things with regard to this judge. In \nthe 7 years I have been in the Senate, this is, I think, maybe only the \nsecond time I have spoken against a judge, the only time where I have \ngotten into it to the degree that I have on this one. So it is unusual \nfor me, and I do not take great pleasure in it. I am sure he is a fine \nman with a good education. Obviously, he is a good friend of the senior \nSenator from Louisiana and Senator Breaux from Louisiana. They are both \noutstanding Senators and good personal friends. I do not take any \npleasure in raising questions about a judge that they are recommending. \nThere is nothing personal involved with them. In fact, I will always \nbend over to try to be cooperative with these two fine Senators.\n  But in this case, I think there are many reasons why this nomination \nshould be recommitted to the committee and, furthermore, why this judge \nshould not be approved for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The second thing that is unusual about this one is I have been \ninundated with correspondence from people in \n\n[[Page S 14463]]\nLouisiana from all stations in life saying that this nominee should not \nbe confirmed--small business men and women, executives of corporations \nin Louisiana, just private citizens, prosecutors. We have a file that \nis probably 6 inches thick of letters from people raising questions \nabout the qualification of this nominee.\n  I have been struck by that. I started off, quite honestly, being \nopposed to this nominee because it did damage to the proper balance on \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. But as I got into the merits, or \ndemerits, of this nomination, I found that there were a lot of \nquestions that surrounded this nominee.\n  I am just going to read some of the excerpts from some of the letters \nI received. One says:\n\n       As a Justice on the Louisiana Supreme Court he has been \n     notorious for writing law from the bench. His actions have \n     had a serious negative impact on the Louisiana economy.\n\n  This is a person who apparently is in the printing business.\n  Another one from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. \nJust one sentence from this letter:\n\n       In the area of expansion of government, taxation and tort \n     law, he is far out of touch with both legislative intent and \n     the sentiments of most Louisiana citizens.\n\n  From a college official, it says:\n\n       Judge Dennis is an enemy of not only small business, but \n     Louisiana's workman's compensation program.\n\n  From an attorney:\n\n       Justice Dennis is the type of judge who is not content with \n     following and applying the law to the facts of the case \n     before him. Rather, he is the kind of judge who desires to \n     bring about a specific result, and then conjures up dubious \n     theories of law to reach that result. Justice Dennis is not \n     the kind of judge who hesitates to ``make law'' when existing \n     law does not suit his philosophy.\n\n  I think one of the most striking things came from an assistant \ndistrict attorney in Louisiana who has had, obviously, a great deal of \nexperience in criminal law practice in Louisiana. His letter was \nlengthy and gave example after example, citing specific cases where \nthis is a judge that he felt should not be moved to a higher court. I \nwill read two paragraphs from his letter:\n\n       I have been a violent crimes prosecutor for the past 20 \n     years, beginning as an assistant district attorney in Baton \n     Rouge, Louisiana, in 1974. Also for 2 years, I was dispatched \n     all over our State prosecuting as an assistant attorney \n     general. For the last 12 years, I have been the chief felony \n     prosecutor in the rural but large parish of St. Landry, which \n     lies between Baton Rouge and Lafayette. I wholeheartedly \n     agree with statements that I have seen ascribed to you that \n     James Dennis ``has a record of court activism inconsistent \n     with the views of the majority.'' He has consistently crafted \n     judicial decisions, while intellectually forceful, that are \n     wrongheaded and unresponsive to the crime problems from which \n     our communities are suffering.\n\n  So you see, this is not just a matter of a disagreement whether this \njudge should be from Mississippi or from Louisiana, and this is not a \ncase where I have gotten a lot of mail from my own State about this \njudge. This is a case where I have been flooded with letters and calls \nand correspondence from elected officials, of people throughout \nLouisiana in all walks of life saying this nominee should not be \nconfirmed.\n  One other thing before I go to this next part. Just a couple of weeks \nago, I had another call from a State official who raised questions \nabout another court action involving gaming versus gambling. I have \nsubmitted this material to the Judiciary Committee staff. I do not know \nwhether it is a serious matter or not, but when a State official calls \nand says this is something the Judiciary Committee should consider, I \nthink they should take a look at it. Maybe they have at the staff \nlevel. There is clearly enough question here surrounding this \nnomination that the committee should take another look at it.\n  Let me go to these other points that I think I must make. I generally \nerr on the side of giving the President the benefit of the doubt on \nnominations in his administration. I think Presidents should have great \nlatitude in selecting individuals for service in their administration, \nincluding Federal judicial appointments, especially the circuit courts. \nSo barring character flaws or illegality or extreme policy positions \nwhich are inconsistent with American values, I generally am inclined to \ngo along with him. But in this case, I do think there are some \nquestions about character and judgment, and I think clearly some of the \npolicy positions here are out of order.\n  After reviewing this nominee and his rulings, I reached two \nconclusions: He is clearly a judicial activist predisposed to create \nlaw from the bench instead of interpret it, and, second, his rulings \nfail to support severe and harsh punishment for convictions for violent \nand wanton criminal acts.\n  Last, I do not believe the nomination of Judge Dennis is fair or \nappropriate given the makeup of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The \nfact of the matter is, this position is vacant because the chief judge \nretired, Judge Charles Clark from Mississippi, and has been vacant \nsince then.\n  If a Mississippian is not appointed to this position, our State will \nhave only two members on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, not nearly \nenough to try to stop a circuit court of appeals nomination. But this \nis a question that is affecting Senators and the circuit courts all \nover this country. I hear--and I believe this is true--a growing \nconcern about disparity in the various circuits. So I think this is a \nquestion that should be reviewed by the Judiciary Committee. I know \nthat several of the members of the committee were concerned about that \nand came to me and asked questions about it. I acknowledge that that \nalone certainly is not enough to oppose this nomination. But as a \nSenator from my State, I do have to put on the record the fact that I \nthink that our State is not going to be properly represented in this \ncircuit court.\n\n  So I invite Senators from other circuits in other States to be aware \nthat if this pattern begins to develop, we will get to a situation \nwhere the big States--California, Texas, or New York--will not only \nhave the margin of the majority, but dominate or have total control of \nthese circuits. I think that we need to think about that.\n  Now, I want to cite my biggest concern, and that is the way this \nsupreme court judge has been ruling. I think that is the real reason \nwhy he should not have been confirmed. Over the last several months, I \nhave reviewed many of Justice Dennis' writings and opinions issued by \nthe Supreme Court of Louisiana.\n  In two areas, I am particularly concerned with the views of this \nnominee. I urge my colleagues to take a look at his rulings on crime \nmatters and on business. There is no question that James Dennis is \nintellectually a bright jurist, and you will see it in his opinions. \nThey are very interesting in the way they are written. However, the \nintellectual energy he devotes to the law fails to lead to consistent \nrulings of justice and compassion for the victims of crime. You do not \nneed to look far to see that when it comes to ruling on violent crimes, \nJudge Dennis is not the victims' judge.\n  So I would like to cite some of the cases that I think are really \nimportant.\n  At 5 a.m. on July 2, 1977, the defendant, Dalton Prejean, and three \nother people left a nightclub in a stolen 1966 Chevrolet. They had been \ndrinking heavily for the entire evening in Lafayette Parish, LA. \nPrejean was driving. The vehicle was stopped by State Trooper Donald \nCleveland--the car's taillights were not working.\n  Prejean, who was driving without a license, attempted to switch \nplaces with an occupant in the front seat. Trooper Cleveland saw the \ndriver attempt to switch places and ordered the driver out of the car. \nDalton Prejean emerged from the car with a .38 caliber revolver and \nshot Trooper Cleveland twice. Trooper Cleveland later died from his \nwounds.\n  Prejean was convicted of first-degree murder in the Fourth District \nCourt of Louisiana and was sentenced to death. Prejean appealed on four \nissues, including his claim that he was due a new trial because one \njuror had failed to disclose his relationship with law enforcement \nofficers on the voir dire. Justice Dennis dissented from the court's \nrefusal to grant a rehearing, arguing that a ``proportionality rule'' \nshould be applied. That is, Judge Dennis argued that before the death \npenalty should be imposed on the defendant, the sentence should be \ncompared to sentences in all similar cases throughout the State of \nLouisiana. The \n\n[[Page S 14464]]\nintellectual foundation of Judge Dennis' argument was found not to be \nproper and it was reversed.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed the use of the death \npenalty, and the U.S. Congress has repeatedly voted to support the \ndeath penalty, particularly on crimes of wanton and reckless violence, \nparticularly against law enforcement officers.\n  So I thought this was an extreme stretch to try to say that we should \nhave an overruling of the death penalty based on some sort of \nproportionality rule. We have heard that theory discussed, but it has \nnever been accepted as one we should go forward with.\n  Now, going to the business area. In a case entitled Billiot versus \nB.P. Oil, Billiot, while working in a B.P. Oil refinery, was burned \nwith a valve when it failed and sprayed a hot substance on Billiot. His \nsubsequent injuries were not the result of exposure to the substance, \nbut to the heat of the substance. He sued the oil company, seeking \ncompensatory relief under the workers compensation law, and punitive \ndamages under a law allowing punitive damages to individuals injured by \nthe storage, transportation, or handling of hazardous substances.\n  On September 29, 1994, Judge Dennis wrote a majority opinion for the \nLouisiana Supreme Court on the case. In his ruling he, in effect, \nreinterpreted two State laws--the workers compensation law and the law \nallowing individuals injured by hazardous materials to seek punitive \ndamages.\n  Dennis breathed new and fictional life into a 1914 workers \ncompensation statute by postulating that the exclusive remedy provision \nof the Louisiana workers compensation law did not apply to punitive \ndamages. In addition, he interpreted that Billiot could sue for \npunitive damages under the hazardous materials damage law--even though \nthe injury was not caused by the hazardous material.\n  The impact of this ruling was disastrous for business in the State of \nLouisiana and equated to the mother lode of case opportunities for \nlawyers in that State. The landmark ruling did not crack the dike of \ntort litigation--it blew it wide open, and thousands of small business \nowners stood downstream of these flooding waters. That ruling was a \nshining example of judicial activism at work, one where two laws were \ninterpreted anew from whole cloth, creating this new area for \nlitigation.\n  There are a whole series of cases where Judge Dennis has ruled in \nways that can be of great concern to those who are interested in \ngetting fair rulings and doing business. We have a whole list of these \ncases. I will submit these as part of the Record. I think we have about \n15 cases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of cases be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nAnti-Economic Development Decisions Authored or Concurred in by Justice \n                                 Dennis\n\n       Billiot v. B.P. Oil Company, No. 93-C-1118 (La. Sup. Ct. \n     Sept. 29, 1994) (Authored by Justice Dennis.):\n       This decision is a double-whammy against the business \n     community. First, it is an absolute assault on the exclusive \n     remedy provision of workers' compensation that says an \n     employer cannot be sued in tort for a work-related injury of \n     an employee. Justice Dennis reasoned that since the Workers' \n     Compensation Act (enacted in 1914!) did not specifically \n     provide for inclusion of punitive damages in the tort \n     exclusion, it doesn't exist. Further, he argues that, \n     although the statute that triggers the punitive damages \n     refers to the transportation, handling or storage of \n     hazardous substances, the hazardous nature of the substance \n     does not have to cause the injury! Trying to assess risk \n     under this decision is going to be a nightmare--but one thing \n     is sure; your insurance (or your liability exposure if you \n     are self-insured) is going to go up!\n       B.P. Oil Company v. Plaquemines Parish Government, 642 \n     So.2d 1230 (La. 1994) (Sales Tax) (Concurred in by Justice \n     Dennis.):\n       This decision would extend the state sales tax on utilities \n     and other items to the local level where the law currently \n     prohibits it from being collected. This decision--if not \n     reversed when the Supreme Court rehears it--will cost \n     businesses and all utility customers hundreds of millions of \n     dollars. LABI has joined over 60 other businesses and \n     associations--including the NAACP and the Public Service \n     Commission--in filing amicus briefs to ask the court to \n     change this disastrous decision.\n       Halphin v. Johns Manville Sales Corp., 484 So.2d 110 (La. \n     1986) (Products Liability) (Authored by Justice Dennis.):\n       This case was one of the worst assaults on economic \n     development ever handed down by a court in Louisiana. Prior \n     to Halphin, liability in products liability cases was \n     determined by looking at alleged design defects, failures to \n     warn properly or manufacturing defects. Halphin added a new \n     category by saying that some products were ``unreasonably \n     dangerous per se.'' Under Justice Dennis' decision, even \n     though a product that caused an injury had no design or \n     manufacturing defect and had proper warning labels, the \n     manufacturer could be forced to pay damages because the \n     machine was ``unreasonably dangerous per se.''\n       The case sent a shock wave through the manufacturing and \n     retail communities in Louisiana and throughout the United \n     States. The decision was so radical that, in spite of strong \n     trial lawyer opposition, the state legislature overturned the \n     decision in 1988.\n       Ross v. La Coste, 502 So.2d 1026 (La. 1987) (Strict \n     Liability) (Authored by Justice Dennis.):\n       In this case, which expanded the doctrine of strict \n     liability, the owner/lender of a ladder was successfully sued \n     for damages by the borrower for injuries caused when the \n     ladder collapsed. The owner had no knowledge of the ladder's \n     defects, yet was held liable.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will conclude with these three points. I \nthink that Justice Dennis' judgment in the Tulane matter clearly should \nbe questioned and should be reviewed by the Judiciary Committee as a \nwhole. I think there is no question that this is a judge who has been \nan activist, and there are many decisions that back up just the two \nthat I cited that raise questions about his activism. I think that \nshould cause real concern in the Senate in confirming his nomination.\n  I urge that this nomination be recommitted to the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I think, first of all, it is a little \ninteresting to note that if this issue was of such monumental \nimportance that it should be recommitted to the Judiciary Committee for \nfurther consideration, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch, would be here advocating \nthat. He is not. In fact, he does not support the motion to recommit.\n  The distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nBiden, spoke here on the floor about this very issue and said that, as \nthe ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, he, too, felt \nthat the committee had exercised their responsibility and looked at \nthis nominee very carefully. After the committee had voted, additional \nmaterial that was submitted to the committee was considered by the \nprofessional staff, by the chairman of the committee, the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, and by the ranking member of the Committee on \nJudiciary, the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden. They and the \nprofessional staff circulated all of that information to all the \nJudiciary Committee members. As I look around to see if there are any \nof these members here who are saying they somehow have not had an \nopportunity to consider this nominee, I see none.\n  I think it is clear that this case has been carefully considered by \nthe committee. I think that Senator Biden, very eloquently and in great \ndetail, covered all of the allegations we have heard this morning with \nregard to information that the Senator from Mississippi was arguing was \na reason to recommit this to the committee. I think Senator Biden's \ncomments were right on target. There is no basis whatsoever to send it \nback to the committee. The only allegation I heard that supported that \nargument was basically the fact that Judge Dennis should have recused \nhimself in a case before the supreme court that he ruled on.\n  Senator Biden made it very clear that he had no conflict in that \ncase, that the supreme court voted 6-1 and he very carefully documented \nwhy not only should he not have recused himself, that it would have \nbeen wrong had he done that, that he had an obligation as a justice to \nrule on the case, that he had no interest in the case whatever. That, I \nthink, has certainly been clearly established.\n\n  If the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee disagreed \nwith that, I think that he would make that opinion known. He does not, \nand neither does the ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I have known Jim Dennis for a number of years, a long \nnumber of years. I have known him personally and known him as a very \n\n[[Page S 14465]]\ndistinguished jurist on the State supreme court. Somehow to argue on \nthe other hand that he is out of touch with our State is to not \nconsider all the number of times he has gone before the people of our \nState and offered himself for election, because we elect judges.\n  If he was out of touch with Louisiana, basically a conservative \nSouthern State, he would not have been elected to the district court \nwhich he has been elected; that he would not have been elected as a \ncourt of appeals judge that he was elected to and subsequently \nreelected; that he would not have been elected to the State supreme \ncourt which he was elected and has served and then reelected without \nopposition to a 10-year term.\n  Louisiana does not elect people that they disagree with. I suggest \nthat his opinions as a judge, his record as a State-elected official, \nas a Member of the House of Representatives, indicates that not only is \nhe acceptable to the people of Louisiana, that he is enthusiastically \naccepted as someone that they have taken great pleasure in having them \nrepresent in legislative bodies and on every court in Louisiana: the \ndistrict court, elected; court of appeals, elected; and the State \nsupreme court, elected and reelected without anybody running against \nhim.\n  I think it is clear that this person fits the mold of the type of \njudges and members of the judiciary that the people of Louisiana like \nto see.\n  Some say that he is not a mainstream jurist. I point out that in the \n20 years he has served on the supreme court, the information that we \nhave by the supreme court itself says that he has sat on 7,655 cases in \nwhich an opinion was published. He voted with the majority in 7,148 \ncases. That is 93 percent of every case they wrote an opinion on, he \nagreed with the majority.\n  All of these judges are elected, from all parts of our State. If he \nwas out of touch with the people of my State of Louisiana, they would \nhave said so. If he was out of touch with the other members of the \njudiciary, he would not have voted with them in deciding the majority \nof the opinions in 93 percent of 7,655 cases.\n  To somehow allege that he is not part of the mainstream I think is \ntotally contrary to the record in the case.\n  Some say that he is not strong enough on crime, and we have some \nletters from some nameless people who write and say that he is weak on \nthe death penalty or not good for law enforcement.\n  I have a letter from the attorney general of the State of Louisiana, \nthe highest elected law enforcement official in our State, Richard \nIeyoub. He says:\n\n       John Dennis is universally regarded as one of the brightest \n     and most effective judges in the State of Louisiana. His \n     opinions are excellent examples of legal scholarship and \n     reasoning. I have carefully monitored the decisions of the \n     Louisiana Supreme Court relative to victims' rights and the \n     operation of the criminal justice system in general, and I \n     feel very comfortable with the decisions rendered by Justice \n     Dennis on these matters. His opinions in the criminal law \n     area have generally benefited law enforcement.\n\n  One of the sheriffs of one of the largest areas in our State, greater \nNew Orleans, Jefferson Parish, a distinguished sheriff, Harry Lee, who, \nprobably more than any other sheriff in Louisiana, is noted for being \ntough on crime and good for victims of crime and tough on criminals. \nHarry Lee, the sheriff, says:\n\n       In my opinion, Justice Dennis has done an excellent job, \n     both from the standpoint of law enforcement and individual \n     citizens. He has faithfully followed the law as written by \n     the legislature. He is generally regarded as a fair-minded, \n     scholarly, hard-working and effective jurist. In short, he is \n     extremely well-qualified, perfectly suited, and well able to \n     serve with distinction as a judge of the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals.\n\n  This is probably the toughest sheriff in the State of Louisiana. \nWould he say a respected jurist on the fifth circuit is an outstanding \nperson and well-qualified if he was weak on crime and weak on the \nrights of victims of crime? Of course not. He has staked his public \nreputation on the fact that this person is just the type of judge we \nneed.\n  My friend from Mississippi, Senator Lott, distinguished majority \nwhip, has cited two cases he says are evidence of his judicial activism \nor taking positions that is not in keeping with what we want in members \nof the judiciary.\n  I respectfully disagree with his conclusion and think that the cases \nthat he has cited give us exactly the opposite result. He cited one \ncase, the Billiot versus B.P. Oil Co. where victims were protected by \nthe law of the State of Louisiana, and there are some who were \npenalized because they violated the law of Louisiana and are now \nraising opposition to Judge Dennis because he interpreted the law as it \nwas written.\n  When someone disagrees with the law, you do not criticize the judge \nfor applying the law. You try and give the law a change if you \ndisagree. That is what legislative bodies are for. In this case, it was \na workmen's comp case. The person was injured and he was injured very, \nvery severely.\n  The law of Louisiana, the State law passed by a majority of the \npeople in the legislature, allows for punitive damages in limited \ncases, in limited categories, involving wanton or reckless conduct or \nreckless disregard of public safety in the handling or transporting or \nstorage of hazardous or toxic substances.\n  In this case, it involved hazardous material that ended up--because \nit was mishandled--injuring a person very severely. In this case, the \nState supreme court said that the law does not preclude a worker from \nbeing able to get punitive damages for the wanton or reckless conduct \nor reckless disregard of public safety. In this case, they applied the \nlaw properly and correctly.\n  It was not a judge's fault, if you will, that the case did not come \nout as some of the defendants would have liked it to come out. That is \nwhat the law said. If Judge Dennis had been an activist judge, he could \nhave said, ``I don't think the law should say that; therefore I will \ncome to a different conclusion.'' The exact opposite was true. Not only \nnot being an activist by trying to rewrite the law, he applied the law. \nFor those that do not like the law, go change the law.\n  Mr. President, it is interesting, that is exactly what happened. They \nput a coalition together in the last session of the Louisiana \nlegislature and they got the legislature to change that law because \nthey made the argument, and a number of the members of the legislature \nagreed with them, that the law was too generous in that opinion--not \nmine, but in theirs. They changed the law.\n  But you do not get mad at the judge for interpreting it correctly. If \nyou do not like the law, you think it is not correct, you change the \nlaw. Do not change the judge who carefully interpreted it. That is what \nhappened in the Billiot case.\n  In addition, the case was decided by a 5 to 2 decision of the supreme \ncourt of the State. Were all the judges wrong? I think not. I think \nthey correctly interpreted the law as it was.\n  The State versus Prejean case that the distinguished Senator Lott \ncited, Justice Dennis voted merely to grant the defendant a rehearing \nbased on a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that set out the \nparameters under which a death penalty can be instituted by court. The \nonly thing that Judge Dennis was saying is that he wanted to have a \nrehearing in light of the new supreme court decision to see if it \naffected this particular case. It has nothing to do with Judge Dennis' \nsupport of the death penalty or being tough on crime.\n  In fact, I point out that Judge Dennis has repeatedly voted in court \nto uphold the death penalty. Since the death penalty was reinstated, \nLouisiana Supreme Court has heard on direct appeal the capital cases of \nsome 98 defendants, affirming 84 percent and reversing 16 percent of \nthose capital convictions on lower court. Judge Dennis sat on 93 of \nthose cases and voted to confirm the convictions 80 times, 86 percent, \njust about the same average of everybody else on the court.\n  In the cases where Judge Dennis has dissented, it is interesting here \nbecause if you say that he is out of step with the majority of the \ncourt, he clearly is not. When he has dissented, however, his dissent \nhas been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Dennis, the facts show, authored the dissenting opinion in six \ncases since he has been on the supreme court. In six cases he dissented \nfrom the majority. In all six cases subsequently reviewed by the U.S. \nSupreme Court, in all six cases, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the \nLouisiana \n\n[[Page S 14466]]\nSupreme Court. It said, ``Justice Dennis, you are right. The supreme \ncourt of your State made an error in all six cases.''\n  I think when you look at this man's record, his distinguished record \nin every court in Louisiana, I think you would have to agree with me \nthat this person deserves a seat on the fifth circuit court of appeals. \nHe would make an outstanding judge, an outstanding jurist, as he has \nall his life.\n  I will not go into an argument as to whether it should be a \nMississippi judge or a Louisiana judge for this vacant seat because I \nthink the record is clear. You determine what area justices come from \nbased on the caseload. I think the caseload between Texas and Louisiana \nand the State of Mississippi is very clear; very, very clear. I do not \nthink there is even an argument. This vacancy should be from the State \nof Louisiana.\n  In 1993, the last year we had numbers, there were 1,309 appeals filed \nfrom district courts in Louisiana to the fifth circuit court of \nappeals. There were only 450 appeals filed from district courts in the \nState of Mississippi. That is a 2.9-to-1 ratio--essentially a 3-to-1 \nratio. If the present vacancy is filled with Justice Dennis, Louisiana \nwould have six seats on the fifth circuit; Mississippi would have two \nseats, a 3-to-1 ratio. The ratio is as close to being proper, when you \nlook at the caseload, as is humanly possible to reach.\n  Louisiana has 34 active and senior district judges in our State. \nMississippi has only 10 district judges, a 3.4-to-1 ratio.\n  So, when you look at very objective numbers on where should this seat \ncome from, I think it is very clear that the caseload and the number of \njudges clearly indicate that a judge from Louisiana is the proper \nrecommendation.\n  Second, I would argue very strongly, and I think it is very clear, \nthe background, the history of this judge has been carefully, carefully \nscrutinized by the Judiciary Committee, and I think we should all \nsupport the ranking member and chairman of that committee in voting \nagainst the motion to recommit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand there may be one or more \nother Senators who wish to speak to this motion to recommit the \nnomination. For the information of those Senators, and others, I am \ngoing to again point out the reasons why I am filing this motion and \nwhy I think the Senate should approve it. But I do not expect to take \nmuch time in arguing this point further.\n  We have had a pretty full discussion of the issue, particularly in \nthe colloquy on the floor with the distinguished Senator from Delaware, \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I remain concerned about \nthe attitude of the committee concerning the issue involving the case \nthat was filed in Louisiana that made its way to the supreme court, in \nwhich Judge Dennis participated as a member of the Supreme Court of \nLouisiana, wherein legislators, who had provided tuition-free \nscholarships to Tulane University to friends and supporters, were sued \nby the Times-Picayune newspaper to compel the production of documents \nrelating to that scholarship program.\n  I want to be sure the Senate understands exactly what the issues were \nand why Judge Dennis' refusal to recuse himself and his action in \nparticipating in the ruling on that case strikes me as inappropriate \nand a clear violation of the code of conduct of judges, both U.S. \njudges and judges who at the time were serving in Louisiana.\n  The Times-Picayune had tried to obtain, as I understand the facts, \ninformation from legislators, or from Tulane University itself, about \nthe names of those who had been given scholarships by legislators. I am \nnot suggesting this was violative of the law in itself. As a matter of \nfact, there was a specific statute authorizing these scholarships to be \ngiven. I do not know all the history, but, as I understand it, it had \nsomething to do with the fact that Tulane University has certain tax \nbenefits under the laws of the State of Louisiana. The legislators who \nmake the laws of the State of Louisiana were, in the last century, \ngiven the right to name certain scholarship recipients each year to \nattend Tulane without having to pay tuition.\n  Over the years, the tuition at Tulane has become quite substantial. \nAs a matter of fact, Stephen Dennis, who is the son of Judge Dennis, \nreceived 3 years of tuition-free scholarship benefits to Tulane \nUniversity from a member of the legislature in Louisiana, \nRepresentative Jones, that is estimated to have a value of about \n$60,000.\n  The suit involved a refusal of legislators to say or to disclose or \nprovide records of information about who they had given scholarships \nto. Tulane had likewise refused to give this information to the paper. \nTulane took the position that this was information that should be made \navailable by the legislators. They had customarily made it a practice \nof providing that information to legislators who requested it, but not \nto others, third parties.\n  So, the case proceeded to a trial. The legislators refused to provide \nthe information, so a district court judge at the trial level ruled \nthat these records were public documents and public access was a matter \nof right.\n  A second question that had been asked--and relief demanded--was that \nthe legislators be made to turn over those documents to the newspaper. \nThe district court agreed with that and made a part of its judgment an \norder granting a writ of mandamus. A writ of mandamus requires a public \nofficial to do what they ought to do under the law. Having ruled that \nthis was public information, public records to which the Times-Picayune \nwere entitled, the court followed it to the next step and ruled that \nthe legislators who had access to these documents should be required \nand mandated by the law and by the court to turn those documents over.\n  And the third issue was whether or not the Times-Picayune should be \nawarded attorneys' fees, having been forced to file the suit by the \nrefusal of the legislators to turn over these documents. And the judge \nalso ruled that they were entitled to attorneys' fees. So the case, \nbecause the legislators disagreed with the ruling, was appealed to the \nnext step. It was a fourth circuit court of appeals in the State of \nLouisiana.\n  That court decided the district court had ruled correctly in the \nfirst instance, that these were public documents, but they did not \ngrant the writ of mandamus. So they reversed the decision of the \ndistrict court as to the writ of mandamus and they also reversed on the \nquestion of attorney's fees. So in this situation, the Times-Picayune \ndisagreed with that ruling and they appealed, or filed for a writ of \ncertiorari for a hearing before the State supreme court.\n  Enter Judge Dennis. Judge Dennis' son had been granted a tuition \nwaiver. Of course his name would be among those in the records held by \nTulane University. These tuition waivers had a value to his son of \nabout $60,000. Judge Dennis himself had been a member of the \nlegislature and, as such, had the right to grant scholarships himself \nwhen he was a member of the legislature, so the records of his own \ndecisions were also among those records that would be subject to being \ndisclosed to the public, not only as a matter of right that the public \nwould have, but as it relates to the responsibility of each legislator. \nIf the supreme court sided with the district court, it would actually \nrule that the legislators were required to make this information \navailable on request to newspapers such as the Times-Picayune. And, of \ncourse, the issue of attorney fees was also raised before the supreme \ncourt.\n\n  Now the Judiciary Committee, not having had any of that information \nbefore it but simply the nomination from the President--President \nClinton nominated Judge Dennis in the last Congress--had a cursory \nhearing. Judge Dennis was asked five questions. There was no witness \nwho appeared for him or against him to testify to any other matters. \nThe committee did not inquire into any of these issues raised by that \nsuit, by Judge Dennis' participation in the rulings on that suit at \nall. No one had heard about it. Judge Dennis knew about it. He had been \nquestioned by the newspaper about it. He did not tell the Judiciary \nCommittee that. \n\n[[Page S 14467]]\n\n  So the Judiciary Committee reported out the nomination. And after \nthey had done that, then the Times-Picayune wrote this story based on \nthe information they had obtained as a result of this lawsuit and other \nand independent investigations they had undertaken.\n  So the issue, it seems to me, is whether or not Judge Dennis adhered \nto the rulings of the courts, adhered to the standards of ethical \nconduct, adhered to the code of judicial ethics that he had to be aware \nof, that was in effect in Louisiana at the time, and which is in effect \nfor all U.S. courts throughout the land. I am going to read from canon \n1 of the Code of Conduct for Federal Judges.\n\n       An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to \n     justice in our society. A judge should participate in \n     establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of \n     conduct, and should personally observe those standards so \n     that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be \n     preserved.\n\n  In the commentary below it says:\n\n       Deference to the judgments of rulings of courts depends \n     upon public confidence in the integrity and independence of \n     judges. The integrity and independence of judges depend in \n     turn upon their acting without fear or favor.\n\n  And in canon 2:\n\n       A judge should respect and comply with the law, and should \n     act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence \n     in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. A judge \n     should not allow family, social, or other relationships to \n     influence judicial conduct or judgment.\n\n  Mr. President, I submit that the circumstances of this case involving \nthe tuition waivers in Louisiana, the legislators and their rights \nunder the law--this case that was filed asking for information about \nthe records and past practices of legislators was acted upon by Judge \nDennis in disregard of the canons of code of conduct of judges--that \nshould be reviewed and considered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am hopeful that Senators will approve the motion to recommit this \nnomination to the Judiciary Committee to give the committee an \nopportunity, each member of the committee an opportunity, to become \nfamiliar with the facts, to ask questions of Judge Dennis or others who \nmay have information touching on this subject, so that we in the Senate \nwill have a full report and can base a decision about whether or not to \nvote to confirm Judge Dennis on a full and complete inquiry, which, in \nmy judgment, ought to be undertaken by the Judiciary Committee at this \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I understand that Senator Kyl is here and is \ninterested in addressing this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted to yield the floor so \nthat he may speak, and then I will reclaim my recognition without \nlosing my right to continue my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMississippi for yielding. I would like to address this for 2 or 3 \nminutes.\n  I am a member of the Judiciary Committee. But, as is the Presiding \nOfficer, I am a freshman and, therefore, was not present when the \nJudiciary Committee held its meetings on this matter in September 1994. \nThere are five new members of the Judiciary Committee. So roughly one-\nthird of the committee is new and did not have an opportunity to review \nthe application, to question the witness, and to resolve matters that \nmay have been raised at that time.\n  I understand that most of the questions have actually been raised \nsince then. But I suggest that probably raises the question of perhaps \nhaving an additional hearing to deal with these questions.\n  I have the greatest respect for Senators Breaux and Johnston, and I \ncertainly admire their support for this nominee. I know that Senator \nHatch has thought long and hard about this as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, trying to abide by his commitment to the administration to \nmove these nominees along with a minimum of difficulty. But, given the \nfact that about one-third of the members of the Judiciary Committee \nhave not had an opportunity to question Judge Dennis, and, second, that \nthe transcript from the hearing where that opportunity was afforded is \nvery meager to say the least, it seems to me that perhaps the motion to \nrecommit would be the best course of action to consider at least these \nnew allegations.\n  I have a copy of the transcript of the proceedings that were held on \nSeptember 14, 1994. Only one member of the committee was present, the \nSenator from Alabama. He asked five rather perfunctory questions. I do \nnot mean that to demean his questioning. They are the same questions \nthat I have asked nominees after I have satisfied myself that they \npossessed the requisite qualifications for the position. The questions \nwere simply to the point of would he follow precedent, would he abide \nby the Supreme Court law, and so on. Of course, the judge answered yes. \nSo those five minimal questions really do not establish much of a \nrecord upon which to make a decision.\n  Since then we have these allegations--again most recently in the \nnewspaper--that, frankly, pose some very serious questions about \nwhether the judge should have recused himself in an extremely important \nmatter in his own State.\n  I first became aware of this nomination because of the question in my \nmind about whether or not the proper relationship of judges in \nMississippi and Louisiana was being satisfied as a result of the \nnominee from Louisiana as opposed to a nominee from Mississippi. I am \nvery concerned that the proper relationship always exist within the \ncircuits. We are in the circuit of California, and, obviously, \nCalifornia is a very big part of the ninth circuit. We always want to \nmake sure that we have the proper relationship there, and, if there is \nan Arizona position available, that position be filled from within \nArizona.\n  I understand that issue has essentially been worked out based upon \ncommitments that would be made about future nominees, and I may be \nwrong in this. But I also understand that Judge Abner Mikva was the \nperson from the White House who wrote the letter expressing the \ncommitment. Judge Mikva, of course, is no longer there, which \nillustrates the fact that commitments are important between people but \nsometimes circumstances change and it is not always possible to fulfill \nthose commitments. So I thought that was resolved. I am not sure that \nit is. I would like to satisfy myself on that as well.\n  But, Mr. President, in view of the fact that these allegations are \nnew, they were not before the committee at the time, and, therefore, \ncertainly the Judiciary Committee cannot be blamed, but given the fact \nthat a third of the committee has not participated in hearings on this \njudge, it seems to me that we would all be better served by having \nanother hearing allowing the judge to come before us so we may question \nhim about these matters. And I would feel much better about the \ndecision that I would have to make later on as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee having that knowledge before me. Then, when \ncolleagues who are not on the Judiciary Committee ask me what I think \nas a result of the fact that I participated in the nomination process, \nI would be in a better position to with some confidence say to them I \nreviewed it, we had him before us, I am convinced he will be just fine, \nor perhaps I still have some questions about it. But I will not know \nthat unless we have this kind of an opportunity.\n  So I support the motion that has been made to recommit by the Senator \nfrom Mississippi reluctantly because it is more work for our chairman \nand our committee. But I think that is probably the proper thing to do \nwith such an important nomination as a member of the fifth circuit \ncourt of appeals.\n  Again, I appreciate the Senator yielding the time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncomments, and I appreciate the information that he has made available \nto the Senate which has not yet been brought up on the floor; that is, \nthat this is a new Congress, this is a new committee, and there are \nmembers of the committee and their staffs who have not had an \nopportunity to become familiar with this nominee.\n  He was reported out during the last Congress, and, frankly, had not \nbeen on the screen and had not been something that has been on the \nminds of members of the committee. As a matter of fact, I have had \nseveral Senators ask me who the nominee was and what the \n\n[[Page S 14468]]\nissue was. This is just simply something that has not been discussed \naround the Senate this year. It may have been remembered by some \nSenators who were here last year. But it is a matter of first \nimpression, and that is why I think it is important to take a little \nbit of time to explain why the concerns are being raised and why the \nmotion to recommit this nomination to the committee is being made.\n  The Senator from Delaware was good enough to discuss this nomination \nfrom his point of view as a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nand his recollections and his information from his staff about this \ncase, but his attitude about it obviously is different from mine on the \nquestion of whether or not this is a serious issue and should be \ncarefully considered by the Judiciary Committee after the new \ninformation about whether the judge should have recused himself in that \ncase involving the Times-Picayune or whether this leads to a reasonable \nconclusion that this is not the kind of judgment that we want to see \nreflected by judges who occupy the second highest court in the land.\n  The court of appeals is just beneath the supreme court in terms of \npower and position in the hierarchy of our Federal judicial system. \nMost cases are disposed of at the court of appeals level which are \nappealed from the district courts. Very few cases go beyond the court \nof appeals to the supreme court. So this court, for really all \npractical reasons, is the court of last resort for most litigants, and \nso the power and the influence of courts of appeals are immense in our \njudicial system.\n  So those who are nominated to serve on that court should be subjected \nto the most careful scrutiny to determine their qualifications to serve \non that court, their quality of judicial temperament, how they would \napproach the role of court of appeals judge, and, third, their \nadherence to the code of conduct of judges, their own personal judgment \nabout ethical standards and the extent to which they should set a very \nhigh standard and an example, so that persons having business before \nthe courts in our Federal judicial system will have confidence in the \nintegrity of the judges, in their impartiality and in their abilities \nto be able to discharge these responsibilities at a high degree of \nexcellence.\n  That is a pretty tall order when you have clearly laid out here a \nsituation where Judge Dennis refused or neglected to let the Judiciary \nCommittee know about this controversy that had arisen which involved \nhim, not just as a judge on the Supreme Court of Louisiana but as a \nlegislator, where he had actually participated in a decision made by \nthe State supreme court not to grant certiorari in a case being \nappealed to that court from an intermediate court of appeals in the \nState, which involved issues in which he was personally involved and \nhis son was personally involved, not to say that they had, either one, \ndone anything illegal but nonetheless the fact that records of \ninformation involving their activities were at issue, and the question \nwas whether or not there was a duty under the law to make this \ninformation available on the request of the Times-Picayune newspaper.\n  That was the question before the court. He was on the court, and he \nparticipated in ruling that they did not want to hear that case. The \nsupreme court did not want to grant the right of appeal on this case to \nthat court.\n  And so the net effect was to affirm or not disturb the decision that \nhad been made by the intermediate court. And one aspect of that \nintermediate court's decision was not to require legislators to provide \nthat information to the paper. The district court said they had to and \nthey should and granted a writ of mandamus requiring legislators to \nrespond affirmatively to requests and provide that information. They \ndid not have the records in their custody.\n  The testimony at the trial level from the custodian of records at \nTulane University was that Tulane did not give this information to \nanybody who asked for it. They gave the information to the legislators \nwho wanted their records that were kept there about whom they gave \nthese scholarships to, but Tulane was not going to respond to a request \nfrom the paper. And the legislators were not cooperating. They were not \nasking Tulane to give them the information so they could give it to the \npaper. So the question was whether these legislators could be compelled \nby a court of law or under a writ of mandamus to provide that \ninformation to the paper when it was requested.\n  That was the issue. And the distinguished Senator from Delaware says \nthat was resolved before it got to the supreme court. Well, it was \ndecided but it was not resolved.\n  I wish to read from the brief of the appellants who were asking the \nsupreme court to take jurisdiction and to hear this appeal in assigning \nthe errors committed by the intermediate court of appeals on page 9 of \ntheir brief.\n\n       Assignments of error. The Fourth Circuit erroneously \n     reversed that portion of the District Court's judgment which \n     ordered that a writ of mandamus issue directing the \n     respondent legislators to produce to the Times-Picayune those \n     of the legislators' scholarship nomination forms in the \n     possession of the legislators and/or in the possession of \n     Tulane University.\n\n  That puts at issue the interests of Judge Dennis as a legislator. \nForget about the fact that his son has gotten a scholarship from \nanother legislator worth $60,000, and his name is in the records and \nthat will be subject to being produced by that legislator upon request \nfrom the Times-Picayune. Forget that. Set that aside. I am talking \nabout the judge's personal interest is at issue in that assignment of \nerror. For the Senate to be told today that that issue was settled, it \nwas not before the State supreme court, is just not true.\n  I am not suggesting it is an intentional misrepresentation, but I am \nreading from the brief where the assignments of error are laid out, and \nthis is to the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana. And all supreme \ncourt justices reviewed it and decided not to hear the case, and Judge \nDennis decided to vote on that case without revealing his personal \ninterests, without discussing his personal interests with litigants.\n  Now, that is an erroneous view of the responsibilities of a judge, \nunder my state of reference, with the code of conduct clearly spelling \nout here about the duty to remain impartial, the duty to disqualify \noneself in cases where there is a personal interest. That is a personal \ninterest. The Judiciary Committee did not know at the time it reported \nout this nomination that this was even an issue. They did not know \nabout this case. They did not know that it was becoming a controversy.\n  Only after they reported the nomination in the last Congress did this \nissue really become public. And because this new information came to \nlight after the Judiciary Committee has acted, it is incumbent upon the \nSenate, in my judgment, to approve this motion to recommit the \nnomination to the Judiciary Committee and allow Senators like the \nSenator from Arizona, who spoke, who are new members of the committee, \nwho never had an opportunity to look into these issues, to do so, and, \nI suggest, to have a hearing, to have a hearing that goes beyond five \nperfunctory questions that were asked of this nominee when he was \nbefore the committee in 1994.\n  The Senate ought to demand that more be done to satisfy us as to \nwhether or not this nominee has the kind of attitude about judicial \nethics and personal responsibilities of judges in cases in which they \nhave an interest to deserve confirmation to a lifetime appointment on \nthe second highest court in the land.\n  Mr. President, that is just as clear to me as anything can be, that \nto require the Senate to vote up or down on this nomination at a time \nwhen we have not had a full review of this issue by the committee in a \nhearing, if that is the disposition of the chairman and other members--\nand to give them that opportunity, we ought to vote for this motion.\n  I hope that Senators will look on their desks. I have put a copy or \nasked the pages to put a copy of an article that was written today by \nthe Times-Picayune on this issue. I did not know the article was going \nto be written when this was being pushed to be brought up. But it has \nbeen written, and we made available copies. There are other newspaper \narticles that have been published by the Times-Picayune on this issue, \nand they all point to the fact that this is a case of great notoriety \nand importance in Louisiana.\n  I think it is a case that we should take a more active interest in \nthan we \n\n[[Page S 14469]]\nhave up to this point, and hence the opportunity today for the Senate \nto review the situation under this motion to recommit.\n  I hope the Senate will look with favor on the motion, and I urge \napproval of the motion to recommit the nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I had not planned to speak on this, but \nthere have been some issues raised by both sides that I would like to \nclarify and put to rest.\n  One of the most difficult committees in the Congress is the Judiciary \nCommittee. Its work is very important. We handle the confirmation of \nall judges in the Federal courts and confirmation of many, many other \nofficials.\n  Nobody takes this responsibility any stronger or any more \nsignificantly than I do. Since I have been in the Senate, 19 years, a \nhigh percentage of judges who currently sit on the Federal bench have \ncome before the committee while I have been a member. I consider the \nreview of judicial nominees to be one of the most important functions \nof the Senate.\n  The committee has completed its investigation of Judge Dennis and \ninto Justice Dennis' decision not to recuse himself from a lawsuit \ninvolving a Louisiana newspaper. Additionally, we have thoroughly \ninvestigated the nominee's failure to notify the committee of the \nnewspaper's inquiry.\n  In my humble opinion, a case can be made that Justice Dennis should \nhave recused himself pursuant to canon 2 of the Louisiana Code of \nJudicial Conduct. I do not believe that he intentionally violated any \ncode of conduct. But, having said that, a case can be made that he \nshould have recused himself in order to avoid the appearance of \nimpropriety.\n  Now, this is a point Senator Biden and I may disagree on. \nNevertheless, so everyone understands this, the committee has completed \nits investigation. Given the evidence before us, I am not satisfied \nthat this isolated incident warrants Justice Dennis' disqualification \nfrom the Federal bench. In this instance, I do not think it does. \nJustice Dennis has provided answers on these questions to the \nCommittee. It depends on whether you accept his answer or not and \nwhether you will give him the benefit of the doubt. I accept his \nanswer.\n  As chairman, I instructed my staff to offer to brief every member of \nthe committee or members of their staff who wanted to be briefed on \nthis matter prior to it coming to the floor. Additionally, we offered \nto brief anyone else who wanted to be briefed on this prior to the \nfloor consideration.\n  I just want to make it very clear that, if the nominee is \nrecommitted, it is my intention that the committee take no further \naction. I am not going to look into this any further. Everybody knows \nwhat there is to know about this. We are not going to hold any further \nhearings on the matter. If the nomination is recommitted, that is going \nto be it, as far as I am concerned. Accordingly, I am going to oppose \nthe motion to recommit.\n  Now, I understand that the distinguished Senators from Mississippi \nbelieve there is an imbalance on the fifth circuit. I think Mississippi \nhas not been treated as fairly as it should have been. In that regard, \nI have gone to the White House and made it very clear that the very \nnext vacancy that is created, if we pass a new judgeship bill, that \nMississippi is going to get that vacancy. And I will personally try to \ncorrect that deficiency.\n  But let us have nobody miss any bets here. The fact is, there is no \nexcuse for anybody saying that we should recommit this and have \nrehearings and redecide this all over again. We are not going to do \nthat. That decision is going to be made right here, right now. And if \nthe motion to recommit is granted, that is going to be it for Justice \nDennis.\n  I am going to oppose the motion to recommit because we have come a \nlong way. I have seen judge after judge, whether a Republican \nadministration or a Democratic administration, who had some problem in \ntheir lifetime that somebody can find some fault with. Some problems \nare valid to a degree. In this case, the judge claimed to have voted \nthe right way, said that it was an oversight on his part, and basically \nhe has an answer for it. Whether you agree with the judge's opinions or \nnot, this justice appears to be an honorable, decent justice.\n  Frankly, I just want to make that clear so everybody knows as they \nvote here what is going to happen. There were no dissenting votes \nagainst the nominee from the committee. Justice Dennis was favorably \nreported out by unanimous consent. These questions came up afterwards. \nThe committee reviewed this matter, and we offered every Senator or \ntheir staff members an opportunity to be briefed on the findings. I do \nnot think there is any reason for anyone to think that this is \nsomething that is a first impression that has to upset this particular \nnominee.\n  I am willing to abide by the decision of the Senate in this matter, \nhowever I want to make the record clear, I am going to vote against \nthis motion to recommit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the motion?\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I do not intend to prolong the debate. I \ndo want to add to the Record a copy of the newspaper article that has \nnot been printed. I know Senator Lott put a copy of an article from the \nTimes-Picayune in the Record. I think he put in the article dated \nSeptember 25. There is another article, July 23. I ask unanimous \nconsent that both articles, to be sure we have them in the Record, be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Times-Picayune, July 23, 1995]\n\n                 Judge defends his Tulane records vote\n\n                           (By Tyler Bridges)\n\n       State Supreme Court Justice James Dennis, whose son \n     received Tulane tuition waivers, later voted to deny a \n     request by The Times-Picayune for review of a lower court \n     decision in the newspaper's suit seeking access to five New \n     Orleans legislators' Tulane scholarship nomination forms.\n       The newspaper eventually received the scholarship \n     nomination forms of all Louisiana legislators by filing a \n     subsequent law-suit against Tulane.\n       The records obtained from that suit show that Stephen \n     Dennis was awarded Tulane tuition waivers for three years in \n     the late 1980s by then-state Rep. Charles D. Jones, D-Monroe.\n       An associate justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court since \n     1975, James Dennis last year was nominated to a federal \n     judgeship by President Clinton. That nomination, to the 5th \n     U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was approved by the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee Thursday night and now goes to the Senate \n     floor. Dennis, however, continues to face strong opposition \n     from Mississippi's two senators, who argue that an appointee \n     from their state deserves the judgeship and that Dennis is \n     soft on crime. The appeals court hears cases from Texas, \n     Louisiana and Mississippi.\n       Prior to his election to the Louisiana Supreme Court, \n     Dennis, 59, a native of Monroe, was a state district judge, \n     an appellate judge and a state representative.\n       The Tulane scholarship that Dennis' son received is awarded \n     under a century-old program that permits every legislator to \n     award a tuition waiver every year.\n       Jones, now a state senator, declined to explain why he \n     nominated Stephen Dennis.\n       In a written statement to the newspaper, Dennis said that \n     his son in 1985 had sought the scholarship on his own, \n     ``without my suggestion or help * * * At that time, Steve was \n     26 years old, married, and a resident of (Jone's) district. \n     He and his wife were struggling but fully self-supporting and \n     financially independent of me. I was unable to assist Steve \n     in going to law school because of my obligations of support \n     owed to my wife and three younger children. I did not ask \n     (Jones) to nominate Steve for the waiver. I believe that the \n     nomination was made on the basis of Steve's academic record, \n     his financial need of educational assistance and his \n     outstanding extracurricular and other achievements.''\n       Dennis in March 1995 voted in the majority of a 6-1 \n     decision to deny The Times-Picayune's request that the \n     Supreme Court review an appeals court ruling to the \n     newspaper's suit against the new Orleans legislators.\n       In a written statement to the newspaper, Dennis said the \n     case did not pose a conflict of interest for him because the \n     appeals court already had upheld The Times-Picayune's primary \n     contention that the nominating forms were a public record. \n     Dennis said further review of the ``collateral issues'' \n     raised by The Times-Picayune's request for review was not \n     warranted.\n       While the appeals court upheld the newspaper's position \n     that the forms were public records, it also had ruled that \n     legislators \n\n[[Page S 14470]]\n     were not required to get their scholarship nomination forms from Tulane \n     if they did not have the forms in their possession. This \n     issue was important to the newspaper because numerous \n     legislators had declined to identify their recipients, no \n     longer held the forms themselves and had declined to get the \n     forms from Tulane. In fact, even after the appeals court \n     ruling, four of the five defendants refused to obtain their \n     forms from Tulane and make them public.\n       ``I did not have any interest in the outcome of the only \n     issue to come before the Supreme Court,'' Dennis wrote the \n     newspaper. He would not answer questions beyond his written \n     statement.\n       Under the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, a judge may \n     reuse himself when he ``is biased, prejudiced or interested \n     in the cause or its outcome or biased or prejudiced toward or \n     against the parties . . . to such an extent that he would be \n     unable to conduct fair and impartial proceedings.''\n       After the Supreme Court denied The Times-Picayune's request \n     for review, the newspaper filed suit to force Tulane to \n     release the scholarship nomination forms of all Louisiana \n     legislators. Civil District Judge Gerald Fedoroff ruled in \n     the newspaper's favor in June, and Tulane released the \n     records this month.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Times-Picayune, Sept. 28, 1995]\n\n                       Tulane Role May Kill Post\n\n                           (By Bruce Alpert)\n\n       Washington.--Louisiana Supreme Court Justice James Dennis, \n     role in the Tulane University scholarship scandal may kill \n     his dream of winning Senate approval as a federal appeals \n     court judge.\n       Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., believes that the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee ``should reconsider'' its earlier \n     decision to support Dennis' nomination to the 5th Circuit \n     Court of Appeals ``because of information that came to light \n     after the committee acted,'' said Stephen Hayes, the \n     senator's spokesman.\n       Cochran referred to revelations that Dennis voted to deny a \n     request by The Times-Picayune for review of a lower court \n     decision in the newspaper's suit seeking access to Tulane \n     scholarship information; even though his son received one of \n     the tuition waivers.\n       Cochran and fellow Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott, the \n     Senate's second most powerful member, have long opposed the \n     Dennis nomination; arguing that the appointment should go to \n     a resident of their state. But the revelations about Dennis' \n     role in the Tulane case have given their efforts new life.\n       Hayes said Cochran would make a motion to delay a floor \n     vote and return the issue to the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     if Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., bows to pressure \n     from Louisiana's two Democratic senators, John Breaux and J. \n     Bennett Johnston, to move the matter for a yes-or-no vote.\n       Breaux, in particular, was instrumental in getting \n     President Clinton to nominate Dennis for the appeals court, \n     which handles cases from Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. \n     But the nomination, first made in 1994, has never reached the \n     Senate floor.\n       On Wednesday, Bette Phelan, spokeswoman for Breaux, said \n     both her boss and Johnston ``continue to urge Senator Dole to \n     schedule a vote on Judge Dennis' nomination as soon as \n     possible.''\n       Judiciary Committee staff conducted a review of the judge's \n     role in the Tulane scholarship case, a committee spokeswoman \n     said. But she would not discuss the findings, saying only \n     that interested senators can call the committee and get an \n     oral summary.\n       Two people familiar with the committee staff finding offer \n     different assessments of what the committee staff found. One \n     described the findings as ``more critical than positive'' \n     about the judge, while another said the staff simply \n     summarized information previously reported in The Times-\n     Picayune.\n       At issue is Dennis' vote in a 8-1 Supreme Court decision is \n     March to deny The Times-Picayune's request for access to five \n     New Orleans legislators' Tulane scholarship nomination forms.\n       Dennis declined to comment Wednesday. But earlier, in a \n     written statement to the newspaper, Dennis said the case did \n     not pose a conflict of interest because the appeals court \n     already had upheld The Times-Picayune's primary contention \n     that the nomination forms are public records.\n       Charles D. Jones, the one-time state senator who granted \n     the scholarship to Dennis' son, wrote a letter to the \n     committee last week. In it, he supports the judge's account \n     that Dennis had nothing to do with the awarding of the \n     scholarship to Stephen Dennis.\n       ``Stephen contacted me, expressed his need for financial \n     assistance to pursue his education, requested the tuition \n     waiver and I was glad to recommend him for it,'' Jones wrote \n     Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``Justice James \n     Dennis did not participate in any request directly or \n     indirectly in my initial decision to recommend Stephen for \n     the tuition waiver.''\n       Ironically, both Louisiana senators have children who \n     benefited from the scholarship program. Johnston's two \n     children received legislative tuition waivers, and a son of \n     Breaux got a waiver from former New Orleans Mayor Sidney \n     Barthelemy.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it seems to me that the facts that led me \nto file this motion have been fully provided to the Senate. The code, \nthe canons of ethics involving impartiality, the responsibility of \njudges under these circumstances have been discussed.\n  I do want to point out that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe State of Louisiana itself handed down a case in August 1986 in \nwhich the obligation of judges to disqualify themselves in cases in \nwhich they have a personal knowledge is one that the court takes very \nseriously.\n  One of the head notes in that case is as follows:\n\n       Under the disqualification statute, recusal is required \n     even when a judge lacks actual knowledge of the facts, \n     indicating his interest or bias in the case, if a reasonable \n     person knowing all the circumstances would expect that the \n     judge would have actual knowledge.\n\n  It strikes me in reading that and then looking at the underlying \ndecision of the court of appeals--incidentally, this case came out of \nthe State of Louisiana, so it should have been within the knowledge of \nthe judge as to what the law is, not just the canons of ethics, but \nwhat the law is regarding recusal and disqualification.\n  But it strikes me that this clearly applies to this situation. Not \nonly did the judge have personal knowledge about the scholarship \nbenefits that State legislators could award, he had to know that these \nrecords were kept at Tulane, he had to know that legislators did not \nlike to provide information from those records to the general public, \nhe had to know the importance of this to the class to which he \npersonally belonged, the legislators of the State of Louisiana.\n  So irrespective of the fact that his son had been given a scholarship \nworth $60,000 to Tulane by another legislator and that that information \nwould be made available, or arguably could be, under a writ of mandamus \nor would be required to be made available if the court upheld the \ndistrict court's rule, all of this information and the involvement of \nthe judge personally in this program, the benefits that had been given \nto his family as a result of this program, all would become public \nknowledge at a time when he had been nominated to serve on the court of \nappeals and the Judiciary Committee of the United States had his \nnomination under consideration. And were it divulged that this \ninformation was coming to light at that time, this could have had an \nadverse effect on the proceedings to consider his nomination.\n  All of that is clear now, but it was withheld from the Judiciary \nCommittee by his neglect to advise that he had been contacted by a \nreporter at the Times-Picayune. But it is just as clear as it can \npossibly be that this should have been the subject of inquiry by the \nJudiciary Committee at the time. And a senior staff member, when we \nwere getting a briefing in my office about the follow-up investigation \nthat the chairman ordered, said that if the Judiciary Committee had \nthat information at the time they reported out the nomination, they \nwould not have done it.\n  This is an opportunity to give the Judiciary Committee the \nopportunity to make a decision based on the full facts, a full \ninvestigation. If a hearing is required, any member of the Judiciary \nCommittee can ask the chairman to have a hearing. He says it is not the \nintent to have a hearing. Well, I think it ought to be looked into \nfurther. I think closer scrutiny ought to be brought to bear on this \nnomination by this committee so that all members of the committee will \nhave a set of facts on which to base a decision about the fitness of \nthis person to serve on the court of appeals.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve the motion to recommit.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn to the \nconsideration of the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just give my colleagues an update on \nwhere we are on the items to be completed before the recess.\n  The State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill. I understand there is \nsome great progress being made on that bill.\n  The Interior appropriations conference report is coming from the \nHouse on Friday. We did have a rollcall vote on the bill. I am not \ncertain we will need a rollcall vote on the conference report. We have \nhad a request for a vote on one or the other.\n  The DOD appropriations conference report is coming from the House \nFriday. A rollcall vote was taken on that bill, too. If somebody \nrequests a vote, obviously we will have one.\n  The continuing resolution arrived from the House this afternoon. We \nhope to pass that by unanimous consent.\n  Then the adjournment resolution, which I do not think there will be a \nvote on.\n  Then the Senate Finance Committee needs to complete action on their \nportion of the reconciliation package, and I could announce to members \nof the Finance Committee right now we have staff on each side going \nthrough a number of amendments to see if they, staff, can agree, \nRepublican and Democratic staff, and put them in a little ``cleared'' \npile and a ``rejected'' pile and then ``above our pay grade'' pile, \nwhich will be for Members' consultation. We hope to save a lot of time \nthat way. The chairman has indicated that he will call us back to the \nFinance Committee meeting as soon as that has been completed.\n  So it seems to me there is no reason for us to be anything but \noptimistic about next week at this point. Much will depend on the \nleadership of the distinguished Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] and the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings].\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader did not mention the Middle East \nfacilitation bill. Is that on the list?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think that is going to be resolved. I need to talk to the \nSenator about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have before us a very complicated bill, \na very controversial bill. We are attempting to establish a sequence of \nactivity with a goal of trying to expedite its consideration.\n  In order that we might try to get all this to come together in an \norderly fashion, because I know many of our colleagues hope to be gone \nthis weekend--even though, knowing I would be managing the bill, I plan \nto be here tomorrow and Saturday, so I am in no hurry; I want to be \nsure my colleagues understand that--but in order to try to expedite our \nconsideration here, we have put together an amendment that will be \noffered by Senator Hatfield, the distinguished chairman of the full \ncommittee, an amendment that is cosponsored by Senator Hollings.\n  It has to do with adding to our 602(b) allocation; that is, \nallocating additional money to the subcommittee and then disbursing \nthat money in such a way as to deal with some of the concerns that have \nbeen raised against the bill. And so that we could deal with this in an \norderly fashion, I would like to propound a unanimous-consent request \nthat we have opening statements by the distinguished ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, by myself, by any other Senator who would like to \nmake an opening statement; that then it be in order for us to submit \nfor consideration managers' amendments that have been agreed to on both \nsides and any debate there might be on them; and then I would like it \nto be in order for the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator \nHatfield, to offer his amendment with Senator Hollings because it \naddresses numerous issues.\n  If we do not do it in that way, we are probably going to simply use \nup time as we try to deal with those issues one by one. We can \ncertainly proceed without this unanimous-consent request, but I hope \nour colleagues will indulge us since our objective is simply to try to \nexpedite consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this procedure has been agreed to, so I \nhope we can proceed along that line.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from Texas \nyield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be very happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished chairman spoke of a reallocation of \nresources?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, I did.\n  Mr. BYRD. The chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the \nfull committee are authorized to approve such reallocation. Nobody has \nproposed this to the ranking member as yet about such a reallocation of \nresources.\n  Would the Senator inform me as to whether or not I am going to be \ncontacted on that matter?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, if I might say to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, this is not my amendment. There has been a series of \ndiscussions among Members. Basically what the Senator from Oregon has \nbeen doing is trying to find a way through our impasse.\n  As I am sure our colleagues are aware, our appropriations bill has \n$4.26 billion less than requested by the President for our \nsubcommittee. It has $1.9 billion less than a freeze. And it has $870 \nmillion less than the House.\n  Senator Hatfield has been working with Senator Hollings and others to \ntry to allocate funds to this subcommittee. I was unaware, I must say, \nthat that had not been discussed with the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  I have an outline of the amendment. But probably what I should do \nunder this circumstance is simply ask unanimous consent that we be able \nto do opening statements, that we be able to do the technical managers' \namendments we have agreed to, give the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia an opportunity to discuss this with Senator Hatfield, who is \nin a meeting with the Secretary of Energy on something very important \nin his State right now.\n  When the agreement has been reached and the ranking member, Senator \nByrd, is satisfied, then we can proceed with it. And, again, this is \nnot my amendment; I have not been directly involved in it even though I \nhave concluded that this is a prudent thing for us to do.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I certainly thank the distinguished Senator. I know \nthat it is an oversight, an inadvertent one. I want to make clear that \nsuch authorizations of reallocations have to be made by both the \nchairman and the ranking member of the full committee. And we make \nthose after contacting various and sundry subcommittee chairmen. And I \ndo not anticipate any problem along that line. But I thought I had \nbetter make mention of this before it becomes a problem.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, Mr. President, let me just then ask unanimous \nconsent that we have opening statements by Senator Hollings and myself \nand any other Member who would wish to make an opening statement, that \nit also be in order for us to offer managers' amendments where we have \nagreement on both sides of the aisle, and that when an agreement is \nreached between the distinguished chairman of the full committee and \nthe ranking member, Senator Byrd, that at that point it be in order for \nSenator Hatfield to offer his amendment which deals with some 20 \ndifferent subjects. I think by doing it that way, we can expedite \nconsideration.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to have opening \nstatements, that it be in order for me to offer, on behalf of myself \nand Senator Hollings, managers' amendments where there is agreement on \nboth sides of the aisle, and that it then be in order, when Senator \nByrd has agreed, for the distinguished chairman of the full committee, \nSenator Hatfield, to offer an amendment on behalf of himself and \nSenator Hollings.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am not \nsure I heard the entire request. I apologize to the Senator from Texas. \nWe would certainly have no objection to opening statements at this \npoint. Because no one has had the opportunity to see these amendments, \nwe have had requests on our side that prior to the time we agree to any \nkind of unanimous-consent agreement which would \n\n[[Page S 14491]]\ninvolve these amendments that Senators have the opportunity to look at \nthem.\n  So, we would have to object to anything beyond the opportunity to \nmake opening statements at this point.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are certainly narrowing it down to \nopening statements.\n  So with that, I ask unanimous consent that we begin opening \nstatements and that it not be in order to offer an amendment until \nthose opening statements are completed; at that point that--let me \nstate it this way: I ask unanimous consent that it be in order now to \nhave opening statements; that at the conclusion of the opening \nstatements, subject to the agreement of the minority leader, at that \npoint that it be in order for the distinguished Senator from Oregon, \nSenator Hatfield, to offer an amendment on behalf of himself and \nSenator Hollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to give an opening statement on \na very complicated bill without getting into too many of the details \nbut in such a way as to basically cover the issues that are involved in \nthis bill.\n  I think there are many reasons why this is a very complicated and a \nvery controversial bill. One reason is money. This bill, probably more \nthan any other appropriation that we will consider this year, has a \nvery tight budget. It, in fact, provides $4.26 billion less for \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations than was requested by the \nPresident.\n  It provides almost $2 billion less than a nominal freeze in the \ncurrent level of appropriations for Commerce-State-Justice. And I \nremind my colleagues that, compared to some of the larger appropriation \naccounts, this is a fairly small appropriations bill in terms of actual \ndollar outlays. So when we are talking about $2 billion less for fiscal \nyear 1996 than we are spending this year, we are talking about a \nsubstantial reduction in the ability to expend money for the carrying \nout of functions in the Department of Commerce, the Department of \nState, and the Department of Justice.\n  The bill also has almost $900 million less than our counterparts in \nthe House had. And this is the first point I want my colleagues to \nunderstand. When the President criticized this bill for not providing \nfunding for purposes for which he requested funding, it is important \nfor our colleagues--and, quite frankly, it is important for those who \nare following this debate--to understand that we are operating under a \ntotally different budget than the President proposed.\n  Our budget comes into balance in 7 years. Our budget substantially \nreduces discretionary spending. Our budget imposes very real \nconstraints on spending money.\n  The President, in proposing $4.3 billion more for these three \nDepartments of Government than we proposed, does so in a budget that \nwill not be in balance by the second coming. It does so in a budget \nthat will not bring the deficit below $200 billion in a decade.\n  So the fact that the President, in his budget, can request funding \nfor many functions that we do not fund is simply a testament to the \nfact that our budget is a binding budget that is balanced over 7 years \nand the President's budget is not.\n  There are several ways to approach the writing of an appropriations \nbill where you have to cut $4.3 billion. One way--and, quite frankly, \nin no way being critical, but I want people to understand why this is \nsuch a controversial bill--one way is to take the approach which has \nbeen taken in most other appropriations bills, and that is to simply \ntake the level of savings that is dictated, nick a whole bunch of \nprograms a little bit and, basically, take the approach that you are \ngoing to sort of hunker down and not fundamentally change anything.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that this is roughly equivalent to an \naction that a family which is running out of money might take at the \nend of the month when they say, ``Well, we're running out of money and \nwhat we're going to do is spend a little bit less going to the movie \nand spend a little bit less on milk for the children.''\n  As we know, families do not operate that way. Families set \npriorities. Families decide toward the end of the month when they are \nrunning out of money that they are not going to go to the movie, but \nthat they are going to continue to buy their children milk.\n  As chairman of this subcommittee, I decided that if we were shooting \nwith real bullets, if we were going to write an appropriations bill now \nthat set out a path to balance the budget over 7 years, that we ought \nto recognize, to begin with, that we are going to have less money next \nyear than we had this year, less the next, and less in each successive \nyear for the next 6 years.\n  So I made the decision to terminate programs, to set priorities. My \noriginal recommendation terminated some 12 programs outright. It also \nset very strong priorities. It was my decision as chairman of the \nsubcommittee that not all programs in the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations bill were created equally. I believe that the American \npeople have very strong preferences, and what I have tried to do within \nthe monetary constraints that I have had as chairman, and this has been \nsupported by the majority in both the subcommittee and the full \ncommittee, is to try to fund the President's effort in fighting crime. \nI am very proud of the fact that this bill fully funds the FBI and the \nDEA. It fully funds our efforts to incarcerate violent criminals. It \nprovides a strong funding increase for the courts to hire prosecutors \nto provide the system of criminal and civil justice that we need to \ndeal with the problems that we face.\n  This bill provides a substantial increase in funding for the Justice \nDepartment, funding for our effort to fight violent crime, funding for \nour effort to fight drugs.\n  I will come back in a moment and talk about changes in how the \nJustice Department would function, but let me make this point. While we \nprovide, basically, the same level of funding requested by the \nPresident, we have in subcommittee and full committee on this bill \nchanged the allocation of funding. In the crime trust fund, we spend \nless money on social programs, we spend more money building prisons. It \nis a belief of the subcommittee and the full committee that we need to \nget tough on violent crime, and we try to do that in this crime bill.\n  The second area that we fund in this bill has to do with the \nDepartment of State. I have to say, Mr. President, that I have been \nsomewhat disappointed. I visited with the Secretary of State. I \nexplained to the Secretary of State the simple arithmetic of this bill, \nand the simple arithmetic of this bill is as follows:\n  If we provide roughly the level of funding requested by the President \nfor the Justice Department, if we provide funding for half of the \nincrease requested by the Federal judiciary, what that means is, given \nthe amount of money we have left, that we have to cut every other \nprogram by an average of 36 percent. That is the cold reality that we \nare looking at.\n  I tried to explain to the Secretary of State that that was basically \nwhere we were and that that meant that we were going to have to reduce \nthe level of funding for the State Department by roughly 20 percent. \nThat is actually better treatment than we provided for the Commerce \nDepartment in this bill.\n  We have not adopted the authorization bill for the State Department, \nbut a majority of the Members of the Senate have voted for that \nauthorization. It has been filibustered. We have been unable to get 60 \nvotes and, as a result, what I did in writing the appropriations bill \nis I took the authorization bill which has received a majority vote in \nthe Senate on a cloture motion and I used it as the blueprint to write \nfunding for the State Department.\n  The basic reductions that occur in the State Department budget have \nto do with American payments for membership in world organizations. The \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms, in his \nauthorization bill, dramatically reduces the amount of taxpayer funding \nthat goes to world organizations to promote objectives that, at least \nin the minds of the majority of the Members of the Senate, did not \nreflect the will of the American people.\n  I think it is important to note, and I want to be sure that it is \npart of the Record, that despite all of the moaning from the State \nDepartment that somehow not a sufficient account is taken in this bill \nthat representing \n\n[[Page S 14492]]\nAmerica abroad today is a dangerous business, something that I \nunderstand, I appreciate the sacrifice that is made by people who work \nin the State Department.\n  As a result, I have fully funded every penny requested by the \nPresident in his budget for such expenditures. Even though he spends \n$4.3 billion more in his budget than we are allowed to spend in ours, I \nfund every penny the President requests for security abroad for both \nour Embassies and our personnel.\n  So the criticism of the State Department that somehow we are \nunderfunding the State Department and the needs of its people is simply \nverifiably false.\n  This is a tough budget. It does reflect the fact that the American \npeople do not believe that we are getting our money's worth with all of \nthese world organizations where we pay the bulk of the dues and have a \nrelatively small say in what they do and on how our money is spent.\n  I think the plain truth is the American people understand that in the \npostwar period, America has been like a little rich kid in the middle \nof a slum with a cake. The whole world has looked at this cake and \nwanted a piece of it. We literally have run all over the world handing \nout pieces of this cake. Nobody has loved us for it. In fact, in many \ncases, they have not loved us, thinking they should have gotten more.\n  The fundamental philosophy behind this appropriations bill is we need \nto stop sharing the cake, and we need to start sharing the recipe we \nused to bake the cake, which is free enterprise, individual liberty, \nand private property.\n\n  So in the State Department appropriations bill, we provide $4.4 \nbillion. The President requested $5.6 billion. Much of this reduction \nis taken in membership in world organizations. And, quite frankly, \nwhile this can be debated forever, I would be perfectly content to take \nmy appropriations bill, take the President's budget, to tear the title \npage off, to put each of them on the table in every kitchen of every \nworking American and let them decide whether they want money spent \nfunding the war on violent crime in America, the war on drugs, gaining \ncontrol of our borders, or whether they want the money spent paying \ndues to organizations around the world where the United States is now a \nmember of these organizations and, in many cases, is paying the bulk of \nthe dues.\n  I do not think there is any doubt that the American people would \nchoose the position that I have chosen. It seems to me that is why the \nState Department has not wanted to debate the real issue here.\n  In terms of the Commerce Department, let me remind my colleagues that \nthe budget that we adopted in the Senate was a budget that called for \nthe elimination of the Commerce Department. I have listened to my \ncolleagues talk about eliminating departments, and I then look at their \nwillingness to vote to actually cut the programs, and I often see a \ngulf between the rhetoric and the reality. It is almost as if when \npeople are talking about eliminating departments, they want to go down \nand take down the flag and take down the plaque off the wall, but they \nwant the Government to keep doing the things the Department has been \ndoing.\n  When we adopted a budget that called for the elimination of the \nCommerce Department, when the Government Operations Committee reported \na bill to eliminate the Commerce Department, I, as chairman of this \nsubcommittee, believed that they were serious. And, as a result, we \ndramatically reduce spending in the Commerce Department. We set up a \nprocedure to provide funds for current employees, and we provide the \nmechanism that would allow us, if in fact we pass the authorizing bill, \nto terminate the Department, and to do it in an orderly fashion.\n  Now, many of the people who voted for the budget to eliminate the \nDepartment want to preserve some of its programs and, obviously, we are \ngoing to have votes on those. There are many programs within the \nCommerce Department that this bill eliminates outright. But, basically, \nit is a bill that begins the process of dramatically reducing the level \nof expenditures for activities where the Government is attempting to \npick winners and losers in the American economy. There is a fundamental \nphilosophical difference between the two parties on this issue. The \nparty which I represent--the philosophy I believe in--believes that the \nmarket system ought to be the basic determining factor of who gets \nmoney to invest; that Government does not have the wisdom to make that \ndecision and, quite frankly, even if it had the wisdom to make that \ndecision, since it is inherently a political decision, it would not \nmake that decision very well.\n  That is an outline of the expenditures of the bill. As I said, the \nbill eliminates some dozen programs from the Minority Business \nDevelopment Agency to the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, to \nthe Technology Administration, to the information infrastructure \ngrants, to the Death Penalty Resource Centers, to the Competitive \nPolicy Council, the Ounce of Prevention Council, and the bill \neliminates Legal Services as a Federal program.\n  Now, let me talk about the language changes in the bill, because \nalmost every one of these provisions is controversial. So let me try to \ntick through basically what the bill does.\n  The House appropriations bill appropriated to their crime bill, which \nwas part of the Contract With America. The Senate has not passed a \ncrime bill. The crime bill passed in the House contemplated and, in \nfact, provided a dramatic change in the President's program to provide \nfunds to State and local governments. We had no corresponding bill pass \nin the Senate, but we do have a bill that has been introduced by \nSenator Hatch in conjunction with Senator Dole. To make the House and \nSenate crime bills conformable, it was decided by the subcommittee and \nthe full committee to write in the allocation formula from the Dole-\nHatfield proposal, so that both appropriations bills are moving in the \nsame direction toward block grants. Needless to say, with Senator \nBiden, this has been a very controversial subject, and we have worked \nout an agreement where Senator Biden will offer a substitute for this \nprovision.\n  Senator Hatch and Senator Dole would like to change their proposal, \nwhich was written into the bill, and so they will basically put the \nball in the air. Each will submit alternatives, and we will determine, \nbased on a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate, what direction we move \nin.\n  But let me be sure that everybody understands what the bill before us \ndoes in this area. The bill before us would allow communities to carry \nout the community policing program exactly as the President proposed, \nif they choose to. In the bill before us, we would allocate funds to \nlocal police departments, and they would have the ability to do \ncommunity policing exactly as the President has proposed, if they \nchoose to do it. The objection that has been leveled against this block \ngrant is not that they cannot do what the President has proposed we do, \nbut that they have the option of doing it in a different way. The \nobjection to our language is not a dispute about the President's \nprogram so much as it is a dispute in the ability of local government \nand local chiefs of police to decide to use the money in a different \nway if they think that will work better for them.\n  We have set out a guideline on how the money could be used. If people \nchose to do community policing, to put more policemen on the beat, as \nour crime bill last year proposed, and as the President supports, they \ncould do that. If they decide that they want to have more policemen on \nthe beat, but they want to use the funds for training, they could do \nthat. If they decide that they want to work overtime to get better \ntrained police officers on the street now while they bring new trainees \ninto the police academy, they could do that. If they decide they need \nto use the funds to buy equipment to make their system more efficient, \nthey could do that. But they have the capacity to carry out the program \nas the President has proposed, if they choose to.\n  The second change in language has to do with the Legal Services \nCorporation. It is not news to any of my colleagues that I am not a fan \nof the Legal Services Corporation. I believe that is has some \nlegitimate functions. But I think that, in many cases, they have not \ncarried those functions out. \n\n[[Page S 14493]]\n Legal Services Corporation today has a lawsuit underway against every \nState in the Union that has tried to reform welfare. Every time any \nState in the Union has had a mandatory work requirement, the Legal \nServices Corporation has filed a lawsuit against them. Any time any \nState in the Union has tried to deny additional benefits to welfare \nrecipients who have additional children on welfare, the Legal Services \nCorporation has filed a lawsuit against them.\n  The Legal Services Corporation has a long history of using taxpayer \nfunds to promote causes which are not taxpayers' causes. My view is, \nMr. President, that if someone wants to file a lawsuit against the \nState of New Jersey saying that they cannot have a mandatory work \nrequirement for welfare recipients because it violates the \nconstitutional rights of welfare recipients to have to work, people \nought to have a right to file that lawsuit. But they ought not to use \ntaxpayers' money to do it.\n  In any case, after many years of battling on this issue, this year I \nproposed--and was successful--in the initial mark to eliminate the \nLegal Services Corporation outright.\n  I did not have the votes in subcommittee to do that. An agreement was \nreached where we eliminate the Federal Legal Services Corporation. We \ntake roughly half the money that it is now spending and we give that \nmoney in a block grant to State governments. Then State governments, \nwithin a set of guidelines which limit the ability of organizations \nthat take Federal taxpayers' money to engage, basically, in the \npromotion of class action suits, opposing welfare, and a series of \nother restrictions based on past concerns--have block grants to spend \non legal services. It provides roughly half the funds that the existing \nprogram provides.\n  Another controversial area of language in the bill has to do with \nprisoners' work. This is an issue which I feel very strongly about. I \ndo not have much doubt in my mind that when the votes are counted on \nthe floor of the Senate, I am going to lose on this issue. But I want \nthe American people to know about it. Part of my reward for being \nchairman is that now people have to take this provision out.\n  Let me define the problem. To keep someone in the Federal \npenitentiary this year is going to cost the Federal taxpayers $22,000. \nWe could send somebody to Harvard for what we are going to pay to keep \nthem in the Federal penitentiary. We are paying more to keep someone in \nthe Federal penitentiary than they would make if they could earn twice \nthe minimum wage working.\n  Now, why is that so? Part of the reason is because of the way we \nbuild prisons. I have tried in this bill to begin moving us in the \ndirection of stopping the building of Federal prisons like Holiday \nInns, taking out the air conditioner, the color television, the weight \nroom. The key ingredient in this direction is requiring Federal \nprisoners to work.\n  Now, this is where we run headlong into greedy special interests. \nThis is not just the greedy special interests of organized labor. It is \nalso, quite frankly, the greedy special interests of corporate America. \nIt is the greedy special interests of big business, and it is the \ngreedy special interests of small business.\n  We have three laws in effect that basically criminalize working \nFederal prisoners. It is basically criminal in America for prisoners to \nwork in any conventional sense of working. Most Americans have not the \nfoggiest idea this is true, and they would go absolutely berserk if \nthey understood it.\n  These three laws basically go back to the Depression era when we took \na criminal justice system where prisoners were working, where they were \nto a substantial degree paying the cost of their own incarceration, and \nin the Depression era we started eliminating their ability to work.\n  Now, some people could argue--though I would never make the \nargument--that it may have made sense in the Depression because by not \nhaving prisoners do something, someone else could do it and it would \ncreate a job. If one could have made that argument in the Depression, \nthey cannot make that argument today.\n  We have one Federal statute that makes it illegal for prisoners to \nwork in producing anything sold in interstate commerce. We have a law \nthat makes it illegal for a prisoner to produce anything that is \ntransported in interstate commerce. We have another law that makes it \nillegal for prisoners to produce anything that is sold within the State \nin which it is produced. Then we have another provision that sets out \nguidelines where, if prisoners did produce something that was sold in \nthe private market, they would have to be paid union scale.\n  Let me translate all of those amendments and what they mean. What \nthat means, in essence, is you cannot make prisoners work in producing \nanything to sell in the private sector of the economy.\n  All over the country we have 100,000 people in the Federal \npenitentiary. We have 1 million people incarcerated in America. By and \nlarge, except for producing a handful of things that are relatively \ninsignificant in value as compared to the total economy, they cannot \nwork.\n  Now, we have a bunch of programs in States where prisoners produce \ncar tags. We have a Federal program where they produce furniture for \nthe Federal Government. But by and large these laws prevent us from \nputting prisoners to work. I would like prisoners to work 10 hours a \nday 6 days a week. I would like to turn our Federal prisons into \nindustrial parks.\n  What I have done in this bill is I have overturned these three laws, \nand I have set out a simple guideline. What the bill says is that it is \nlegal for prisoners to be required to work so long as the President \ncertifies that what they produce is not sold in such a way as to glut a \nlocal market or to glut the national market.\n  What I foresee under this provision, if it becomes law, is that we \ncould turn our Federal prisons into industrial parks. Many of the goods \nthat are produced abroad, component parts from everything from air \nconditioners to wheelbarrows to automobiles, we could produce some of \nthose component parts with prison labor.\n  If we stopped building prisons like Holiday Inns, we could probably \ncut the $22,000 in half. If we required prisoners to work, we could \nprobably cut the $11,000 of net cost in half. I believe that within a \ndecade we could cut the cost of incarcerating people by 75 percent. But \nwe are probably not going to do it. Let me tell you why. Because \norganized labor and because a few industries that do not want any \ncompetition will support the offering of an amendment that will \ncontinue to criminalize prison labor in America.\n  Now, I offered this provision in our bill because I think it is \nneeded. I think when you have 1 million people incarcerated, it is \ninhumane not to have an orderly system where they can work. I will not \ndrag this dead cat across the table too many more times here, but I \nwant to remind my colleagues that when Alexis de Tocqueville came to \nAmerica in the 1830's and went back home and wrote ``Democracy in \nAmerica,'' one part of American life that he commented on was our \nprison system and how enlightened it was because we worked prisoners \nhard. Prisoners at that time were working 12, 14 hours a day 6 days a \nweek, and de Tocqueville noted how enlightened it was because by making \nprisoners work it made life in prison bearable.\n  If we made prisoners work today, not only would we save money, but \npeople when they got out of prison would have a skill that they learned \nworking in prison. If we made them go to school at night, they would \nknow how to read and write, and having worked 10 hours a day 6 days a \nweek, go to school at night, serve their full term, when they get out \nof prison they would not want to go back.\n  That is not going to happen because this provision is going to be \nstricken out by special interests. I know it, but I want people to have \nto vote on it, and I want people to be able to look at their vote. \nPrisoners in America should be required to work. They should be allowed \nto work in producing things that we can sell.\n  Every year our dear colleague, Senator Helms, offers an amendment to \nban trade with countries that make prisoners work. Every year I wonder \nwhy we cannot make our prisoners work. How is it that we have people \nwho are working two and three jobs, \n\n[[Page S 14494]]\nstruggling to make ends meet, and we are paying $22,000 a year to keep \nsomebody in prison, and then we cannot force them to work to produce \nsomething of value to pay for their own incarceration?\n  It is called greedy, petty, special interests. The world ought to \nknow about it. I hope to awaken them by putting this provision in this \nbill that somebody has to take out.\n  Now let me talk very briefly about two other language provisions in \nthe bill. One has to do with the 8(a) program. The 8(a) program is \ndesigned to help disadvantaged businesses. The basic idea of the 8(a) \nprogram was that there are some businesses that are disadvantaged and \nthat we want to try to help them get on the playing field and be more \ncompetitive.\n  The problem is that over the years, disadvantaged has come to mean \nminority or female. You cannot be disadvantaged, under the 8(a) \ncontract, if you are not a minority and if you are male. So what I try \nto do is open up the 8(a) contract and say, no matter what your gender \nis, no matter what your race is, if you are operating in a depressed \narea, if you are a small, struggling business and you are hiring people \nwho live in a distressed area, you ought to be treated in exactly the \nsame way as someone doing exactly the same things you are who is from a \ndifferent ethnic group or from a different gender.\n  We do not eliminate the 8(a) program, we simply open it up to people \nwho are disadvantaged because they are small business people in \ndepressed areas with high unemployment and they are hiring people from \nthose areas.\n  This is a controversial subject. I understand that. But I believe, \nagain, if we could put this proposal on the kitchen table in every \nkitchen in America and ask, if somebody is a small business person, if \nthey are operating in an area of high unemployment, if they are hiring \npeople who are from a high unemployment area, why should they be \ndiscriminated against based on race or gender? I think America has \nasked that question and I think America has answered it. They are \nwaiting for the U.S. Senate to answer it and I want to give them a \nchance to answer it today.\n  The final provision I want to talk about in the bill, in terms of \nlanguage, has to do with quotas and set-asides. I understand where the \nSenate stands on this issue. Of all people here, I understand it. I \noffered an amendment earlier this year to ban set-asides, to open up \ncompetition, and to say that in bidding on a Government contract you \nhave to be judged on merit; that you cannot be judged based on gender \nor race. The American people say, by an 80-percent margin, that they \nsupport the merit system. America was built on it. Discriminating \nagainst people is fundamentally un-American, but the Senate supports \ndiscrimination and proved it on that night in that amendment.\n  This is my bill, as chairman of this subcommittee, and I am very \nproud of the fact that we have, in this bill, in the jurisdiction of \nCommerce, State, Justice under this bill, we say that it is illegal to \ndiscriminate against anybody in hiring, promotion, and contracting, and \nit is illegal to discriminate in favor of anybody. It is simple \nlanguage. In fact, it is the language which the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole, has worked out. I had worked out similar language \nbut, frankly, I thought his language was better so I included it.\n  It is basically a commitment to merit. I have to believe, based on \nour past vote, that this provision will be stripped out. But, again, \nAmerica ought to know who is and who is not for quotas; who is and who \nis not for set-asides. Let me make it clear that the language in this \nbill preserves our total effort of outreach. It preserves our ability \nto go out and recruit people to apply for jobs. It gives us the full \nability to work, to see that everybody gets on the playing field. But \nit requires that, once people are on the playing field, when it comes \nto being hired, being promoted, or getting a contract, that must be \ndone by merit.\n  So this is a very controversial bill. It is no accident that we have \nkept it to the end. I am quite proud of the bill. Obviously, others \noppose it. And the way democracy works is that we propose and we \ndebate, and I accept the outcome of it. But I think this bill \nrepresents a dramatic change and, quite frankly, I have been \ndisappointed in the other appropriations bills in that we have \ncommitted to a budget that calls for a dramatic change but everybody \nseems to be waiting until next year or the next year or the next year \nto make these changes. I wanted to make them now. I may not be here 2 \nyears from now. I do not know. I may not be on this committee next \nMonday--I do not know that either. But I do know that I believe this \nrepresents a dramatic break with the past.\n  This bill terminates programs. This bill dramatically changes the way \nwe operate the Federal Government. And I think it gives people a very \nclear choice. It defines a movement in the direction that I would like \nto see us go. I am proud that the subcommittee and full committee \nsupported the effort to bring the bill to this point. I know there are \nsome people on the subcommittee and full committee who, now that we are \non the floor, will abandon us on some of these issues. But I think we \nhave before us a good bill and, Mr. President, I appreciate the \nindulgence of the Chair as I outlined the bill.\n  Let me yield the floor for the distinguished ranking member, a man \nwho has served on this subcommittee as both chairman and ranking \nmember, a man for whom I have very great respect, the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against H.R. 2076, \nthe fiscal year 1996 Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill. \nFor me, this is unprecedented. Never in my 25 years on the \nAppropriations Committee--or my 18 years as serving as either the \nchairman or ranking minority member of this subcommittee--have I \nopposed this bill. And never in my career here have I seen an \nappropriations bill prepared in such a partisan manner and voted out of \ncommittee on straight party lines.\n  I am against this bill because I simply cannot go along with its \nrecommendations and because of its extreme nature. This bill represents \na 180-degree departure from the way we on this committee have \napproached our job when senators Rudman, Weicker, Pastore, Laxalt, and \nDomenici and I were chairman or ranking member. In the past, we focused \non the business of governing. We worked together to ensure that the \nagencies under our jurisdiction are well-run and appropriately funded. \nOur job always was to see to it that the taxpayers' dollars were well \nspent. If a program was worth it, we sought to fund it adequately. At \nthe same time, we conducted budget scrubs to ensure that we achieved \nsavings from delayed contracts, program changes, and other technical \nmatters.\n  But Mr. President, that is not what today's bill is about. It is not \nabout governing. It is about politics and making philosophical policy \nstatements. It is about picking winners and losers. It is about \nthrowing money at one part of this bill, the Department of Justice, and \nabout wreaking havoc on the rest of the bill. In many ways, this bill \nseems more like a budget resolution than an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, government is not a dirty word. I know that there are \nsome who have come to Washington intending to have a fire sale. Well, \nthose people will probably like this bill because it is a bonfire. \nAgency after agency is eliminated or subjected to unprecedented \nreductions of 20 percent or more. This bill slashes programs with \nlittle description or detail of what is being cut. For example, the \nInternational Trade Administration is cut by $47 million below a \nfreeze. But the report does not direct how the reduction should be \nmade. Should it be from the Import Administration that protects U.S. \nindustry from foreign dumping? Or should it come from the foreign \ncommercial service that promotes U.S. industry overseas or from trade \nand industry sector analysis? This bill just does not say.\n  So, we have wholesale elimination of agencies. And we will have \nwholesale reductions in force and office closures. They are not being \nhighlighted in this report, but mark my words on that. \n\n[[Page S 14495]]\n Take the Small Business Administration. My friend SBA Administrator \nPhil Lader tells me that his appropriation for salaries and expenses \nmeans that the SBA will have to lay off 1,200 of their 3,100 employees.\n  Mr. President, maybe I am old fashioned, but I will not join in this \nfad that denigrates public service. In the 25 years I have worked on \nthis bill, I have learned that much of it supports what we in the \nbudget game call salaries and expenses. What that means is that most of \nthis bill funds people. And I have come to have great respect for the \ndedicated public servants who work hard to serve the people of this \ncountry.\n  I think of Emilio Iodice, of the International Trade Administration, \nour senior commercial officer in Madrid, Spain, who is hustling day in \nand day out to get contracts for American business. I think of Dr. Neal \nFrank and Bob Sheets, of NOAA, who have run the hurricane center in \nMiami, FL, and who worked around the clock to warn us of killer storms. \nI think of Ambassador Princeton Lyman in South Africa who is helping \nthat nation build a lasting democracy and of the many foreign service \nofficers I have met. In my view, these State Department and USIA \nforeign service officers truly are the best and the brightest. I \nsometimes wonder how many of us could pass their stringent entry \nrequirements. And of course, I think of the many professional \ncomptrollers who with us on a day-to-day basis--people like Mike Roper \nat Justice, Mark Brown at Commerce, and Stan Silverman at USIA.\n  With this bill, I worry about the message that we are sending to \nthese dedicated public servants and young people who might want to \nenter government service. I think we should be praising these people \nfor their service, not denigrating them.\n\n\n                           Justice Increases\n\n  In the Commerce, Justice and State hearing room in the Capitol, there \nis a painting of Edmund Randolph, our first Attorney General. I think \nabout him when I look at what is happening to this Justice budget in \nthis bill. We are throwing money at a problem without being \nresponsible. Do my colleagues know when funding for the justice \ndepartment hit the $3 billion level? It was 1983. In other words, it \ntook 194 years for the Justice Department's budget to reach $3 billion. \nAnd that is how much the increase is for Justice in this bill for just \n1 year. That is nothing short of amazing.\n  I think most of us who were around in the early 1980's realize that \nwe tried to throw too much money at Defense too quickly. And as some \nwill remember, I was one of those who pushed hard to increase Defense \nin 1980. But, I fear that this is exactly what we are doing with \nJustice in the 1990's. This year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nis unable to spend almost $50 million that we gave it last year to hire \nmore agents. Of course, the bureau will find other uses for the money. \nBut this bill before us plans to give the FBI an increase of almost \nhalf a billion dollars above this year--an increase of 20 percent in \none year. I am all for my good friend Judge Freeh and the dedicated \nagents who serve us. But a 20-percent increase in 1 year? And when I \nlook at the Immigration Service, we are adding 1,300 border patrol \nagents per year, which again, is more than a 20-percent annual \nincrease.\n  Now I stand second to none in my support for the Justice Department. \nDuring the span that I last served as subcommittee chairman of this \nappropriations subcommittee, the Justice Department grew from $3.9 \nbillion in 1986 to $13.7 billion in 1994. In the Senate, Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno probably does not have a bigger fan than me. But we \nhave got to slow down and take a look at where all this money is going. \nWe have got to stop the bidding war to see who can throw more money at \nlaw enforcement to rack up political points.\n  Mr. President, this bill is largely the story of two bills. For \nJustice and judiciary, it represents increases and for the remainder of \nthe bill it will cause destruction. It did not have to be done this \nway. I would urge my colleagues to look at how much more reasonable and \nmoderate the bill is that the House sent to us. The Contract With \nAmerica crowd developed a much more responsible bill.\n  I would like to describe some of the recommendations for my \ncolleagues.\n  For the Commerce Department, the bill: Eliminates entirely several \nCommerce technology programs: the Technology Administration, new \nAdvanced Technology Program and manufacturing extension program grants. \nIt eliminates previous funding to modernize National Institute of \nStandards and Technology laboratories.\n  The bill eliminates the Minority Business Development Agency, a \nprogram created during the Nixon administration to empower minority \nentrepreneurs, and to expand minority-owned businesses.\n  The bill eliminates the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration.\n  The bill cuts the International Trade Administration by $45 million \nor 17 percent below a freeze. This would result in office closures \naround the country and overseas, and debilitate our trade promotion \nefforts for U.S. industry.\n  It cuts the Economic Development Administration [EDA] from its \ncurrent level of $410 million to $100 million. It reduces one of the \nonly programs with a direct charter to assist communities impacted by \ndefense base closures and realignments.\n  It severely reduces the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration [NTIA] operations, the public broadcasting and \nfacilities program, and it terminates the information infrastructure \ngrant program and the children's educational television program.\n  Mr. President, the bill authorizes and appropriates funds for a new \nCommerce Reorganization transition fund which finances personnel \nseparation costs and termination costs for the various agencies \nproposed for elimination.\n  It provides $395 million for economic statistics and the Census \nBureau, an increase of $84.5 million above the House bill, and $70.4 \nmillion above this year.\n  It provides $1.867 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration [NOAA], a decrease of $45 million below the current \nyear, but $92 million above the House bill. Like the House, the NOAA \nfleet modernization program is terminated.\n  For the State Department and international affairs agencies, the bill \nseverely cuts State Department operations funding $340 million below \nthis year's level. This will result in the closing of many embassies \nand consulates around the world and the layoff of 1,100 foreign service \nand civil service employees.\n  The bill rescinds $140 million in prior year appropriations for \nembassy construction, repairs and maintenance. This will likely result \nin the cancellation of our new embassy in Ottawa, Canada, and the \nelimination of repairs, maintenance and security improvements around \nthe world.\n  The bill assumes S. 908, Senator Helms' authorization, which never \nproceeded in the Senate because of its controversial provisions. This \nbill, however, provides $890 million less funding for the State \nDepartment than Senator Helms proposed to authorize.\n  The bill authorizes and funds a new Foreign Affairs reorganization \ntransition fund and provides $26 million for this account. Bill \nlanguage directs the director of OMB rather than the Secretary of State \nto consolidate programs under State, USIA and ACDA.\n  Funding for international organizations is cut by 37 percent below \ncurrent levels. This year the United States paid $873 million to the \nUnited Nations, the Organization of American States and 49 other \ninternational organizations. These assessments are based on treaty \nobligations. In 1996, the administration requested $923 million for \nthese obligations. The bill provides only $550 million. We would have \nto pull out of a lot of international organizations or simply refuse to \npay our bills.\n  The U.S. Information Agency [USIA] is devastated under the \nrecommended bill. USIA is cut $364 million below the current year and \n$53 million below the House bill.\n  This bill cuts international educational exchanges, like the \nFulbright program, by $43 million below the current year.\n  The bill provides $355 million for international broadcasting--the \nVoice of America, Radio Free Europe Liberty, and Radio and TV Marti. It \nis far below last year's level, but above the House.\n  For independent and regulatory agencies, the bill terminates the \nLegal \n\n[[Page S 14496]]\nServices Corporation, current funding of $400 million, and replaces it \nwith a civil legal assistance block grant under the Justice Department. \nThe bill carries 13 pages of legislation including a long list of \nrestrictions on the use of these funds. For example, the block grant \ncould not be used for helping a poor person seek a legal separation \nfrom an abusive spouse.\n  The Corporation was created during the Nixon Administration. I worked \nclosely with Lewis Powell in the endeavor, and I stood with my friend, \nWarren Rudman, in his yeoman efforts to save the LSC. Like the Senator \nfrom Texas, I have had concerns about the LSC being involved in class-\naction suits. But the House bill had already dealt with that, and it \nretained funding for the LSC.\n  The bill cuts all regulatory agencies at least 20 percent below a \nfreeze. In each case, the bill uses fee collections to cut \nappropriations even though these fees often were created to enhance \noperations. The recommended bill will result in significant reductions \nin personnel and operations.\n  The Federal Trade Commission [FTC] is proposed to receive $79 million \ninstead of $98 million as proposed by the House and provided currently. \nThe FTC is charged with consumer protection and anti-trust duties. \nAgain, we are looking at a one-third reduction in staff and \ncancellation of many important programs such as the FTC's efforts to \ncombat telemarketing fraud.\n  The Federal Communications Commission [FCC] is proposed to receive \n$166 million instead of the current level of $185 million. We keep \ngiving new responsibilities to the FCC under the communications bills, \nbut here we are cutting them below current levels.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] is funded at $238 \nmillion instead of the current level of $297 million. Further, the bill \nreduces charges to individuals registering securities and shifts $60 \nmillion in costs to the federal taxpayers. So I guess that says we want \nto combat violent crime in Justice, but white-collar crime by Ivan \nBoesky is fine.\n  The Competitiveness Policy Council is eliminated.\n  The Maritime Administration is funded at $70.6 million instead of \n$94.7 million, the current level, and far below the administration's \nrequest of $309 million.\n  The Small Business Administration [SBA] is funded at $558 million, \n$359 million below this year, and $73 million below the request. SBA \nsays that they will have to reduce over a third of their workforce \nbased on the committee's report language direction to fund grants and \nloans instead of personnel. This ignores many of the streamlining \nefforts that Erskine Bowles and Phil Lader have already accomplished, \nresulting in reduction of 500 positions during the past 2 years.\n\n\n                  Rewriting the Crime bill/legislation\n\n  Finally, I oppose this bill because it proposes to terminate the \nsuccessful Cops on the Beat program and other authorized Violent Crime \nReduction Trust Fund programs. In their place, the appropriations bill \nessentially authorizes a new Crime bill. Talk about breaking new ground \nfor legislation on an appropriations measure.\n  The Cops on the Beat or Community Oriented Policing program is one of \nthe most efficient and effective programs that has ever been created. \nWithin a year of passage, 25,000 additional police are on the street in \nAmerica. We will be debating this program soon, in more detail. But I \nmust say that I simply do not understand why any member would want to \nterminate this program.\n  Drug courts is another authorized program. It was Janet Reno's \ncreation, based on her experience in Miami. This is not a soft \nprevention program. Drug courts work and are getting non-violent \ndefenders off of illicit substances and back into society.\n  This bill is block grant crazy. Legal services--They say, ``Let us \nmake it into a block grant.'' Community policing and drug courts--They \nsay, ``Let us make it into a block grant.'' I guess I do not \nunderstand. I remember the Republican filibuster against the President \nClinton's stimulus package in the spring of 1993. As I recall, the \nprincipal argument against that bill was that it was funding block \ngrants and recipients had a wide discretion of how they could use block \ngrants. In law enforcement in the past, we had a block grant program--\nLEAA--and it was a disaster.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains many other pieces of legislation. \nIt takes the limits off of sales from prison labor, and it changes \naffirmative action and procurement regulations.\n  I hope that my colleagues will carefully examine this bill. Many have \nsaid, ``Yes, it is a travesty, but the President will veto it.'' That \nmay be true. All indications are that it could not be signed in its \ncurrent form.\n  I, for one, hope that the Senate will not go on record by supporting \nsuch an extreme, irresponsible measure. I hope we can make some changes \nto this bill and improve it.\n  Mr. President, obviously I am not disposed to speak at length, but I \nhave to comment about my distinguished colleague and his opening \nstatement on two or three items. Just in closing, he said: This is \nopen. This is the way we do it. It is open to debate. We debate these \nthings, and we vote on them and we make decisions.\n  Unfortunately, having been on this committee for over 25 years, in \nthis subcommittee we did not debate, we did not discuss, and we did not \ndo anything other than vote. That is why the bill comes on a bipartisan \nsplit, so to speak, of 15-13. It reminds me of Mao Tse-tung when he got \na birthday wish. It said, ``From the Central Committee, by a vote of 15 \nto 13, we wish you a happy birthday.''\n  This bill is an atrocity. In my experience in particular measures, it \nis voted that way because, very conscientiously, we did not have a \nchance to debate and rectify certain things. But I do not want to dwell \non that too much at length because the distinguished chairman of the \nfull committee is henceforth coming to the floor to try to give us an \nadditional allocation and correct some things, like the elimination of \nthe Minority Business Enterprise Administration--an entity that started \nout with President Nixon back 25 years ago in 1970--and various other \nthings like that which were eliminated.\n  The bill is called an atrocity because the distinguished chairman of \nthe subcommittee, for whom I have great respect, says we overturned \nlaws. He is dead right in this particular measure. It is not the \nfunction of an Appropriations Committee to overturn laws. On the \ncontrary, we are supposed to conform to the authorized law, or the law \nauthorizing the amounts, and thereupon appropriate within those \nparticular amounts.\n  Here we see a measure that takes a bill that has been debated fully \nand voted three readings in the House, three in the Senate--with \nrespect to cops on the beat--signed into formal law, the law of the \nland, and participated in with enthusiasm by the overwhelming majority \nof the police forces over the entire country. It is a program that is \nworking and working extremely well.\n  Without any authorization, that law, as provided by way of money in \nthis measure, is overturned. It is just repealed. The formal law is \ntotally disregarded, and in its place, we have a so-called block grant \napproach.\n  Similarly, with respect to the Legal Services Corporation, that was \nmore or less created by the distinguished former Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court, Justice Powell, when he was president of the \nAmerican Bar Association. Here is a corporate entity, the Legal \nServices Corporation, worked in by the private sector, by the \nprofessional attorney sector and by the Federal Government in a most \nsuccessful fashion, but it is not within this bill. That endeavor that \nhas been going on successfully for years is totally overturned and \nrepealed. A new program is put in. It is not authorized.\n  Of course, the parliamentary tactic is to raise a point of order. But \nin the spirit of trying to move along, we can have some votes around \nhere on points of order and everything else. But I am not trying to \nturn back anything parliamentarily. I am trying to turn it back on the \nbasis of merit.\n  But if you go through this particular measure, they come down real \nhard on the future of this country with respect to, for example, the \nprograms within the Department of Commerce and the Department of State. \nThe Department of State is not really left with an operating budget. We \nhave been closing consulates and closing down various \n\n[[Page S 14497]]\nendeavors on behalf of the Department of State over the last 15 years. \nSomehow, somewhere, people have forgotten that, after all, we had \nPresident Reagan come to town with spending cuts, and then President \nBush. After 8 years of President Reagan and President Bush for 4 years, \nwe had 12 years of spending cuts. Then we had, of course, President \nClinton come to town and cut out another $500 billion in spending cuts.\n  So what we are on to is the tail end, so to speak, of 15 years of \nvarious spending cuts whereby programs like WIC, Head Start, title I \nfor the disadvantaged, and many others, are only half funded, as are \nmany programs in health research. That is the reason we just rejected, \nby way of extended debate, the Labor, Health, and Human Resources \nappropriations bill. For every dollar we spend over at NIH, we save the \ntaxpayers $13.50.\n  So these money-saving programs have run into a frontal assault of a \nso-called political contract that is devastating to the functioning of \nour society.\n  I almost wish when it comes to the Department of Commerce that \nPresident Clinton had said we ought to get rid of the Department of \nCommerce. If President Clinton said we have to get rid of the \nDepartment of Commerce, the whole business community--all of that crowd \nthat runs under the white tent for NAFTA and for GATT, and all the \nRepublican crowd, all of those executives, that Business Round Table--\nwould come running up here: ``What do you mean this Democratic \nPresident is trying to do away with the voice of business at the \nCabinet table?'' You cannot find them today. Why? Because the \nRepublicans thought of that idea.\n  Yes, labor is to have a voice at the Cabinet table, but not commerce, \nthe business leadership. Agriculture is to have a voice at the Cabinet \ntable, but they want to do away with the Department. You will not find \nagriculture in the Constitution. You will not find the Labor Department \nthere. But you will find, under article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution, that the Congress is hereby authorized to regulate \nforeign commerce. We are doing away with constitutional \nresponsibilities in a willy-nilly contract fashion. Now with the fall \nof the wall, we really look upon the State Department to promulgate our \nvalues the world around and capitalism the world around along with the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  Very interestingly, that is exactly what they are doing. Secretary \nChristopher and Secretary Brown have been doing an outstanding job, but \nthere is no acknowledgment or recognition of it whatever in this \nparticular appropriation. Rather, they tried to do away with the \ntechnology, the advanced technology program, the manufacturing centers, \nthe Office of Technology and all, as we go on down the list--these \nvarious endeavors to keep America competitive.\n  Our foreign policy, our security as a nation, our success in this \nglobal competition, rests like a stool on three legs. We have, on the \none leg, the values of a nation which are very strong and are \nunquestioned. America voluntarily will try to feed the hungry in \nSomalia, voluntarily will try to set up democracy in Haiti, and now is \ntrying to help, of course, in Bosnia and in the Mideast where they are \nmeeting right now. With respect to our values, it is very strong, and \nwith respect to our military leg, it is unquestioned. But with respect \nto the economic leg, over the past 45, almost 50 years, it is fractured \nand willingly so.\n  We set up the Marshall plan. We sent our money and our technology and \nour expertise to countries abroad in the conflict between capitalism \nand communism, and capitalism has won out. And we are all very grateful \nfor that. But during that 50-year period, what we had to do was sort of \nsacrifice our economy and give up markets with the assault on market \nshare. We had to give up markets to our friends in the Pacific rim, in \nEurope, and otherwise around, with a sort of nudist trade policy--\nrunning around here like ninnies hollering ``free trade, free trade''--\nwhen there was not any such thing, and it is not now. We all understand \nthat.\n  But now with the fall of the wall comes the opportunity to rebuild \nthe strength of the economy. Yes, in many instances, that means more \ngovernment. I want a Senator to say that on the floor of this U.S. \nSenate. What we need is more in education, more in the inner-city \nrestructuring, more in transportation, more in science and technology, \nand more in medical research. That is exactly what we are not doing in \nthis particular measure here.\n  Let me go right to the point about the President's budget for which \nwe get a gratuitous statement from our distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee. He said again that the President's budget would not be in \nbalance at the second coming, and had $200 billion deficits as far as \nthe eye can see. If you want to read the gratuitous statement, you just \nlook at the committee report of State, Justice, Commerce, and on page \n4. I will quote this one sentence:\n\n       The administration's request in a budget that made no \n     attempt to balance the budget, not in 7 years, not in 10 \n     years, not ever.\n\n  Here comes a committee report from a crowd that we could not get a \nsingle vote from to cut $500 million in spending and raise revenues to \npay for some of these programs. Yes, we raised taxes on Social \nSecurity, and $25 billion of the increased revenue on Social Security \nwe gave to what? To Medicare. They are running all over the Hill. ``It \nis going broke. It is going broke.'' Last year they said, ``What is the \nmatter? Nothing is wrong with America's health programs. It is the best \nhealth system in the world. What is the matter?\n  I can show you the same crowd that they quote now as saying it is \ngoing broke in the year 2002. Last year, that same entity reported it \nwas going broke in the year 2001. At least we got one year's grace out \nof the discipline that we set for spending cuts and revenue increases \nand foregoing programs.\n  Let me qualify. I speak about this budget because I can tell you here \nand now they act like they have a budget that we have to conform to so \ntheir budget balances in the year 2002. Absolutely false. For one, this \nparticular Senator voted against that silly Reaganomics which at the \ntime was called by the then majority leader a ``river boat \ngamble,'' the then Vice President as ``voodoo,'' and now we have \n``voodoo'' all over again--going on all over this Hill. We do not have \na sense of history whatever. I opposed that voodoo and proposed instead \na budget freeze like the mayor of a city or the Governor of a State. \nWhat they do is just take this year's budget for next year. We would \nsave billions. We could not succeed.\n\n  I then joined with the distinguished chairman of our subcommittee in \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings, and we said let's have not only freezes, but we \nare going to have automatic spending cuts across the board. And that \nworked. Mr. President, it worked, until 1990, when they repealed it. \nAnd at 12:41 a.m., October 19, 1990, I raised a point of order against \nthe repeal. And let the Record show who voted to repeal it.\n  Now they are running around and saying it did not work. They repealed \nit because it was working. It was going to cause cuts across the board. \nI went along in 1988 with tax reform in order to close loopholes.\n  So we had budget freezes, we had budget cuts, and we had loophole \nclosings. And then, if you please, Mr. President, I came with increased \ntaxes, a value-added tax proposed in the Budget Committee where I got \neight votes, and I got Republican colleagues to go along. And we had a \ndiscipline trying to offset this deficit and an end of increased \ndeficits as far as the eye can see.\n  Right now, the deficit that is projected--we will get it --but it is \nnot 100 something, not 200. It is near $300 billion. I will enter the \nexact figure in the Record. All you need do is figure out how much the \nGovernment takes in and how much it spends and find the difference.\n  I do know that as a result the interest costs for the fiscal year \nbeginning on Sunday, October 1, fiscal year 1996, the interest costs on \nthe national debt--as a result of that voodoo and that riverboat \ngamble--is $348 billion. We only have 365 days a year, so that is $1 \nbillion a day practically that we go down to the bank the first thing \nin the morning and borrow--$1 billion a day.\n  None of these plans, neither the Republican nor the Democratic plan, \nsaves $1 billion a day.\n  I try my best to keep pointing this out to get level so we all speak \nthe same language. Only this past week, I \n\n[[Page S 14498]]\nwrote the Congressional Budget Office. I said that my friends on the \nother side of the aisle continued to talk in terms of a balanced budget \nby the year 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may include the letter in the Record \ndated September 25 from the Congressional Budget Office, June E. \nO'Neill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: This is in response to your letter of \n     September 20 concerning CBO's scoring of the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 adopted by the Congress. \n     Because a budget resolution represents a general plan for \n     future Congressional action rather than specific legislative \n     proposals, CBO cannot provide estimates for a budget \n     resolution in the same sense that it estimates appropriation \n     bills or bills that provide changes in direct spending or \n     revenues. CBO has compared the spending, revenues, and \n     deficits proposed by the budget resolution with those \n     projected by CBO in Chapter Three of its August 1995 report, \n     The Economic and Budget Outlook: An Update. A copy of that \n     report has been enclosed.\n       If you wish further details about this comparison, we will \n     be pleased to provide them. The staff contact is Jim Horney.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                                            (For June E. O'Neill).\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Republican budget, the Kasich budget, the Gingrich \nbudget, or whatever budget you want to call it that they are talking \nabout balancing, has never been scored.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee is here and we \nworked together when he was ranking member and I was chairman. I can \ntell you here and now, after we passed that budget in May, we sent over \nthe assumptions so that the Congressional Budget Office could score it. \nThose scores have never been sent over. From time to time they have \nasked questions: If we do this, we save that; if we do this, we save \nthat.\n  But we do not have a CBO-scored figure for President Clinton's budget \nand we do not have a CBO figure for the Republican budget.\n  Watching all of this as it occurs, at this particular time, I can \nguarantee you that it will not be balanced in the year 2002. And \nanybody who wants to bet me, pick out the odds and the amount. I will \njump off the Capitol dome if this budget is balanced by the year 2002. \nI can tell you that here and now.\n  What happens is exactly what happened, as the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer and I viewed it this morning in the Committee of Commerce. We \nwere allocated $15 billion. What did we do? We took $8.3 billion that \nwe have already allocated in the telecom bill. So we double-counted \nthat already. Talk about smoke and mirrors. We are not going to have \nsmoke and mirrors. I understand, of course, that in the Finance \nCommittee they were $80 billion shy last week.\n  Someone said, no, they got up, meeting last night, to about $15 \nbillion, and they are still trying to find it. But if they go through \nwith the contract and do away with the Social Security tax increase, \nthey will have to find another $25 billion. They are shy there.\n  I can go to welfare reform. We passed welfare reform. It was a $63 \nbillion savings. The budget that they say is going to be balanced \ncalled for a $113 billion savings. That is $50 billion shy there. The \nagricultural and everything crowd said, no, we had not met our figure. \nIt is smoke and mirrors.\n  So what you see now is the moment of truth. And I only mention this \nto get that moment of truth out. We ought to level with each other. You \ncannot get on top of this cancer of interest costs on the national debt \nunless you do all of the above. All of the above includes spending \ncuts, spending freezes, loophole closings, tax increases, and denying \nnew programs.\n  We just voted earlier this week--I hated to vote against the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, and her \nAmeriCorps Program--but I can tell you now that that program was going \nto cost billions and billions. I did not think we ought to start new \nprograms that we could not afford and specifically not start an \nAmeriCorps Program for education whereby in order to get 25,000 \nscholarships we had to do away with 346,000 student loans.\n  That is what we did. We took the money from the student loans and put \nit into a new program and talked about voluntarism. I happen to have \nbeen down there the Sunday after Hugo hit us in our own backyard in \nSouth Carolina. There was the mayor and me and we had 1,500 to 2,000 \nvolunteers that were working in the rain. We asked for a show of hands \nand we had them from 38 States. People volunteer.\n  When little Mr. Segal called me about this particular program and \nsaid we already have 2,000 out there working in the flood year before \nlast, I said, ``Young man, you have 2 million out there working without \nthis program. You do not need a program at the Federal Government level \nto start voluntarism.''\n  So the pressures brought on this particular budget are really \npolitically manufactured where we are not going to balance anybody's \nbudget. We are just going to get rid of the Government. That has been \nthe cry of the contract--that the Government is not the solution, the \nGovernment is the problem, the Government is the enemy.\n  So what you have here is a $283 billion estimated deficit for 1995. \nThat is the accurate figure as between what we will take in and what we \nwill spend. So let us not get high and mighty and start criticizing \nabout how I got a balanced budget 7 years from now when people will be \nlucky to be around 7 years from now and they will know good and well \nthey will come again.\n  I remember when we used to balance the budget year to year. In fact, \nPresident Reagan said, ``I'm going to balance that budget in a year.'' \nHe got into Washington and said, ``Whoops, this is going to take me 3 \nyears. I did not realize it was so bad.''\n  Here was a gentleman who was going to do it in a year. Then we got to \n3 years. Then under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings we got to 5 years. Now, this \ncrowd comes with 7 years. And I can tell you within the next election \nwe will come and have--excuse me, President Clinton has already gotten \nto 10 years. Now he has come back to 9.\n  We are going up, up, and away; 15 years. Say anything except to do \nthe job and tell the American people that we have to deny programs and \nwe have to raise taxes. We have to cut spending. We have to freeze \nspending. We have to close loopholes. We have to do all of the above to \nsave $1 billion a day. This particular budget that we have that we are \nworking on at this particular time does not come near to saving $1 \nbillion a day to get us really rid of any kind of deficit at any time \nduring that 7-year period.\n  Now, Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee \ntalks about philosophy--and I must touch on that and then we can go to \nthese amendments--the philosophy here that they are trying to justify \nthese programs to get things back to where they can do it as they \nplease.\n  They said, if they really want to buy equipment, then they can do \nthat. If they want to put policemen on the beat, then they can do that. \nIt is the old adage that the best government is that closest to the \nAmerican people, the Jeffersonian philosophy. And I generally adhere to \nthat except through hard experience.\n  Within the field of law and law enforcement, we have had our \nexperience. We had what you call the legal assistance enforcement \nprogram, LEAA, and that particular program gave block grants back to \nthe States and communities. And when we looked around, we had--please, \nmy gracious--down in Hampton, VA, they bought a tank and put it on the \ncourthouse lawn and thought the courthouse was going to be attacked. \nThe sheriff down in Alabama, he bought a tank because he was going to \nhave crowd control. The Governor in Indiana, he bought an airplane so \nthey could fly to New York and buy clothes. And they had all kinds of \nembarrassments where the money never got through to the policemen on \nthe beat.\n  Now, there is no education in the second kick of a mule. We learned \nfrom hard experience. So we came around with community policing and \npolicemen on the beat and said, in order to qualify, you have to come \nwith a match of 25 percent. And it is working extremely well.\n  Now they come with the philosophy of getting the grants back, which \nreminds me--and I have, of course, a memory that is resented many, many \n\n\n[[Page S 14499]]\ntimes. But I am referring to the stimulus bill where when President \nClinton came to town, we were going to stimulate the economy. And the \ndistinguished chairman of my subcommittee, now who believes in block \ngrants, said, heavens above, ``We are going to use it for cemeteries, \nfor whitewater canoeing, for fisheries, atlases, for studies of the \nsickle fin chub,'' and all these different other programs back at the \nlocal level. And the Senator slaughtered President Clinton's stimulus \nprogram--just killed it dead in its tracks here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Now we come with the philosophy: Whoopee, let us get the money back \nto the Government; we are not smart enough to do anything here in \nWashington; only the people back home are smart enough. So here we go \nagain. Here we go again, changing the formative law and making it into \nblock grants. Taking working programs like policemen on the beat and \nthe Legal Services Corporation. Abolishing these laws in that sense and \nproviding monies for a program that has already been derided in the \nmost expert fashion by my distinguished chairman.\n  I can tell you now that we could not possibly go along with the block \ngrants. I think the President said he is going to veto that particular \napproach. Maybe we can reconcile it. I hope some of the defects of this \nparticular bill can be cared for in Senator Hatfield's and my \namendment. We worked until 1 in the morning on this particular \namendment. I think it will meet generally with the approval of the \ncolleagues.\n  And a reallocation here, I am grateful for that help. Of course, \nthere are fundamentals still involved. And I will say it right to the \npoint. We will be debating these things, as the distinguished chairman \nsays. What we have done is really savaged Commerce and its programs, \nthe State Department, and, more or less, force-fed a goose in Justice. \nWhen I say ``force-fed a goose in Justice,'' I look at the particular \nfigures.\n  I can see that it took us from 1789 to 1983 or 1984 to get to a $3 \nbillion Justice Department budget. But it has only taken us the last 15 \nyears to quadruple, quintuple--excuse me--and go up, up and away to \n$16.95 billion in this particular 1996 appropriation. I know we have \nhad various crime bills. I know we have had the problems and everything \nelse of that kind. But I can tell you now that we have, with all the \nbudgetary constrictions, to get a little bit better balance in this \nparticular measure.\n  And in some of these, I am definitely of a mind where the Senator \nfrom Texas and I agree that you should not abuse the use of legal \nservices money to sue the State and Governor and Legislature of New \nJersey over welfare reform. We agreed that we could work the prisoners. \nI have worked prisoners as a Governor. I put in a laundry program. I \nput in a furniture repair program. I even had a Jaycee chapter as well \nas our educational programs behind the wall.\n  We agree on many, many things. But generally speaking, we did not \nhave a chance to debate these things. Unfortunately, we had not \nconformed the appropriations to the basic statutes, whatever. We have \njust run willy-nilly through the programs trying to abolish departments \nand the working programs that have done so much for our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is considering the appropriations bill for \nthe Commerce, Justice and State Departments. It would be tempting to \naddress this bill in the same fashion as I have other measures during \nthis session which have contained drastic--indeed, draconian--spending \ncuts. The natural inclination is to talk about how the cuts will affect \nspecific programs or policies, many of which are vital to the security \nof our Nation or the well-being of our people.\n  In this context, I would be led to talk about how the CJS \nappropriations bill, as reported by the committee, lops off more than \n$1 billion--I repeat, more than $1 billion--from the President's \nrequest for the foreign affairs agencies. There will be dramatic \nreductions in spending for the administration of foreign affairs, for \nthe acquisition and maintenance of buildings, for the U.S. assessed \ncontributions to the United Nations, for U.S. contributions to U.N. \npeacekeeping, and for international exchange programs.\n  I understand that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee may \noffer an amendment which may add additional funds to the foreign \naffairs account--which I applaud and will support. I must speak now, \nhowever, to the bill as reported by the committee.\n  Many of my colleagues know that these are programs and functions that \nare extremely important to me. When I recently announced my intention \nnot to seek reelection to the Senate, some of my fellow Senators \ngraciously came to the floor to say some very kind things about me. For \nthat I am deeply grateful, and indeed humbled. One thing that struck me \nthat day was how many of my colleagues mentioned my support for the \nUnited Nations, and the fact that I have carried a copy of the charter \nwith me for many years.\n  I have not carried it with me all of this time just for show and \ntell. I carry it because I believe in it, and I think that it has \nrepresented--and continues to represent--one of our best hopes for \ninternational peace and security. If we proceed with the reductions in \nfunding for the U.S. contributions to the regular and peacekeeping \nbudgets, however, the charter will become nothing more than pretty \nwords. There will be no point, and no joy, in carrying it in my pocket.\n  I have also been a consistent advocate of the U.S. Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency [ACDA]. More than three decades ago, President \nKennedy and the Congress decided to create by statute the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency--which was then and remains now the only \nseparate agency of its type in the world. If the Congress eviscerates \nACDA and perversely rewards its employees by discharging them, we will \ndo grievous damage to our ability to lead the world in effective arms \ncontrol, to verify compliance of often hostile nations with their arms \ncontrol obligations to us, and to deal effectively with new arms \ncontrol and proliferation threats.\n  As I said moments ago, it would be tempting to continue at length \nabout the impact of this and other bills on programs such as arms \ncontrol, the United Nations and U.N. peacekeeping. Today, however, I \nwant to discuss this bill in broader and more far-reaching terms. \nWhether or not the Senate cares to admit it, our decisions and actions \nthis year are going to have a direct and negative impact on America's \nplace in the world, and on our fundamental relationships with other \nworld powers.\n  I am very proud of the U.S. record of leadership, achievement, and \nengagement in international relations. Twice in the 20th century, our \nNation stood with its allies to fight on a global scale against \naggression. During the cold war, the United States took the lead to \ncontain the hegemonistic designs of the former Soviet Union. In the \nearly 1990's, the United States led an international coalition of \nforces in turning back Iraq's illegal grab of Kuwait.\n  Equally as important, however, are the battles we did not fight--the \nconflicts that we avoided, the crises that we averted through \ndiplomatic discussion and pressure. Even if we made mistakes from time \nto time, we were successful in all of these endeavors because of our \nbelief in principles, our commitment to do what we thought right and \nour willingness to be actively engaged. Our decisions, policies, and \nprograms were often costly in both human and material terms, but they \nmade our world a safer place, and our Nation a better and more \nprofitable place to live.\n  Our motivation sadly seems to have changed. Decisions are being made \nout of political expediency rather than sound judgment. Our impulse as \npoliticians--particularly this year--is to rush willy-nilly to make \nbudget cuts for their own sake, without regard to the consequences. \nInstead of using reason and analysis to construct a foreign policy, we \nare using calculators.\n  We must stop, think, and take a good hard look at how the United \nStates can expect to project its power and influence under the \ncircumstances now proposed. The State Department and the foreign \naffairs agencies--our Nation's eyes, ears, and voice to the world--\ncannot carry out its mission if they haven't the personnel, resources, \nand infrastructure required by the times. \n\n[[Page S 14500]]\n\n  It is not just a matter of doing more with less. I know the fiscal \nimperatives of our time, and appreciate that we are required to spend \nless and consolidate functions and responsibilities. The spending \nreductions in this bill are so severe, however, that the United States \nwill be forced to close dozens of critical posts overseas, to renege on \ntreaty commitments, and simply disengage from diplomatic activity. That \nis not sound fiscal policy, and it is certainly not leadership. It is \nisolationism. We are shutting ourselves off from the world, and our \nNation's security and economy will suffer.\n  I do not use the term isolationism lightly. It is a serious charge, \nbut one that I think is accurate. We must acknowledge the impact of \nthis bill on our ability to work with other nations, and understand \nthat by violating our international commitments, we will undermine our \nown national security. And make no mistake, this bill will force us to \nviolate our international commitments and will have an adverse impact \non virtually every aspect of the quality of life of our citizens.\n  Allow me to give some examples. In 1990, the Bush administration \npledged that the United States would meet its treaty obligation to pay \nits U.N. dues in full, and that we would pay off our arrears. This bill \nwould violate that pledge, and we will become the world's biggest \ndeadbeat. At a certain point--which is fast approaching--we will lose \nour vote in the U.N. General Assembly because of the size of our \narrears. This bill will also affect our obligations to NATO, to the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, to the International \nTelecommunications Union, and to the World Health Organization. In \nother words, we will have a diminished role to play in the critical \nfields of international security, nuclear nonproliferation, global \ncommunications, and international health.\n  We also would hamstring the work of lesser-known but important \norganizations such as the Hague Conference on Private International Law \nand the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law. \nBoth of these are making vital contributions to simplifying and \nunifying the international legal system. How many times have we \ninterceded on behalf of constituents in international adoptions, or in \ncases of parental abduction, or in the enforcement of legal judgments? \nThis bill will afford our constituents less protection in such matters, \nand we will be responsible.\n  As a broader, practical matter, American citizens will be far less \nable to rely on U.S. Government support abroad as a result of this \nbill, whether it be in consular, commercial, or political matters. My \nguess, and it pains me to say this, is that the Congress will try to \nduck its responsibility for such an outcome. Instead of facing up to \nour constituents and explaining why they cannot find support or relief, \nMembers will try to shift the blame to the State Department and our \noverseas employees.\n  Recently, some have found it fashionable--and even humorous--to \ncharacterize the Foreign Service as a coddled group of elitist \nintellectuals who shun hard work. As a former Foreign Service officer, \nI reject the characterization and am compelled to pay tribute to the \ndedicated and capable men and women who comprise our diplomatic corps. \nI know how hard they work, and how dedicated they are to serving our \nNation's interests. Some of them, as we have just seen in Bosnia, have \nmade the supreme sacrifice of giving their lives in service to the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, we should honor these men and women and give them our \nfull appreciation. At a minimum, we should see that they have a basic \nlevel of support to handle their ever-increasing responsibilities. We \nwould never send our soldiers to war without support in depth; why \nwould we send our diplomats--whose service is no less noble or \npatriotic than that of any soldier--to do political battle with \nvirtually no support at all?\n  Mr. President, we are forsaking the lessons of history for political \nopportunism. The proponents of this bill will insist that they are not \nisolationists, but they must realize that their proposals will lead us \ninto isolationism. We cannot influence the decisions of international \nbodies if we are not there to participate. And if we try to participate \nwithout paying our bills, no one will listen to us. That is isolation \nin the truest sense of the word. Mark my words: if we continue down the \npath we are now heading, our children will be left with one of two \nchoices. The first is to accept that their forebears let their country \nbecome a xenophobic, second-rate power with a shrunken and insulated \neconomy. The second is to re-fight the battles for which our generation \nalready has paid so dearly. Neither, in my view, is an acceptable \nchoice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise for a couple of minutes. First, I \nask unanimous consent, if Senator Gramm and Senator Hollings will \nconsider this, that the Domenici-Hollings amendment on legal services \nfollow the amendment to be offered by Senator Hatfield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We have no objection.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I have been talking to \nseveral other Members. We are trying to work out an agreement where we \nmight actually reduce it down to four amendments that we would have on \nthe bill. The Senator's would be one of those amendments, but it may \nvery well be--as you know, there is competition for these offsets. \nBefore I can accept that unanimous-consent request, I have to go back \nand talk to the people that I am talking to on the other side of the \naisle.\n  So if the Senator will withhold, I will go back and talk to them and \nmaybe look at these offsets and see if we can work it out. I want to be \nsure that the same resources are not being promised to two or three \ndifferent places.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw his unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, I reserve it for a moment. I will just stay here in \nany event, I say to the Senator. If we do not agree to it, I will be \nhere until Senator Hatfield's amendment is disposed of and then seek \nthe floor. I withhold my request.\n  Mr. President, might I just comment to my good friend Senator \nHollings, I want to share a thought with him. He was talking about \njumping off the Capitol at the end of this year if we do not have a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, when you say it is going to be balanced.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What I suggest to my good friend, maybe in the \nmeantime, there are those hang gliders. Our Governor does that.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You go off and learn how to jump off mountains and you \ndo not crash.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Since I am so sure we are going to get one, I would not \nwant the Senator to fall off the Capitol. I would like him to get \ntrained a little so when he jumps off, he will be all right. It is just \na constructive idea because I have so much respect and admiration for \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will put you in there with me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you are good, I will join you.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to comment on Senator \nHollings's rather lengthy and, clearly, from his standpoint, a very \nimportant speech about a balanced budget.\n  I first want to say, if we accomplish in the next 45 days what was in \nthe budget reconciliation instruction, and if we stick to the caps on \nappropriations, which we have done, I understand even points of order \nhave been sustained on the floor without even the thought of exceeding \nthe caps, my guess is the unexpected result will be the Congressional \nBudget Office will tell us that we are on a path to a balanced budget, \nand we will get there.\n  In fact, I would not be surprised if when we finish that exercise \nthat they do not tell us that there is, indeed, some kind of a small \nsurplus. And I just want the Senators who are voting for all of that to \nknow they did price out that budget resolution. They priced it out so \nthat they could tell us that, in fact, there was going to be a rather \nsubstantial economic dividend that put us in the black. I know my good \nfriend does not agree with that. He did not vote for it and does not \nsupport it. I \n\n[[Page S 14501]]\nthink it is a very historic budget resolution. In all respects, it does \nwhat the Senator suggests, save one. In all respects, it does the kinds \nof things we said we ought to do. It just does not raise taxes. The \nrest is there--the reform and the elimination of programs, the \nsuggestions, the freezes--they are all part of this very difficult \neffort.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record at this point the actual record of the gross Federal debt \nbeginning in 1945 going right on down to the estimated 1996 debt, and \nthe real deficit going from 1945 down to 1996 with the gross interest \ncosts, which has only been computed to be included since 1962.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Gross                                 \n                                 Federal     Real      Change     Gross \n             Year                 debt      deficit     (in     interest\n                               (billions)             percent)          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1945.........................      260.1   ........

Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is talking and the Senator from South Carolina is talking, \nbut the facts speak more loudly than each of us. For example, the \ngentleman talking then was the President when he came to town. In 1980, \nwe were paying interest costs of $74.8 billion on a national debt of \nover 200-some years of history, with all the wars from the \nRevolutionary War up to and including World War I, World War II, Korea \nand Vietnam. Now, it is estimated to go to $348 billion just in \ninterest costs. That was the crowd that came and talked and said they \nwere going to save us from waste, fraud, and abuse. In fact, I got an \naward from the Grace Commission, working with them. By 1989, we had to \nreport it, and 85 percent of the Grace Commission recommendations had \nbeen implemented.\n  However, wanting to do away with waste, as we talked--look what \nactually occurred. It has gone to the greatest waste in the history of \nthe Government--from $74.8 billion to $348 billion. Over $200 billion \njust in increased in costs for nothing. If we had the two-hundred-\nseventy-some billion dollars here now for these things, you would not \nhave extended debate on labor, health and human resources. We would \nhave the money for those programs. You would not have an amendment on \nLegal Services. We would have provided for it and for cops on the beat \nand for the State Department, and the strengthening of our technology, \nand all.\n  My point is that we keep on talking, and we get estimates from the \nCBO and all of these econometric models and all the economists that we \nkeep following and, as old Tennessee Ernie said, we are another day \nolder and deeper in debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I simply want to acknowledge that the \nperson who educated me on gross interest over against net interest was \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  Administrations like to put net interest into their budgets. We do \nnot do that with any other function of Government. We do not say the \nJustice Department took in so many dollars in fines and everything, \ntherefore, their budget is that much less. It is the gross expenditure \nof the Justice Department. But because administrations like to fuzz \nthings up a little bit, they were using net interest. The real figure \nis gross interest. I want to acknowledge Senator Fritz Hollings for \nhaving educated me on this. And I hope he is educating a lot of other \npeople, too.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in a moment we will have an amendment by \nthe distinguished chairman of the full committee, which is going to \nshift the allocation among the subcommittees providing additional \nfunding for Commerce, State, Justice and in the process solving many of \nthe problems that hold this bill up.\n  While we are waiting on that--and I understand the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia has now signed off on that amendment--I want \nto say, as the new chairman of this subcommittee, that I have had an \nopportunity, for the first time, to work with the distinguished Senator \nof the full committee, Senator Hatfield, in that capacity. I think it \nis fair to say that the success that I have had in bringing the bill to \nthis point is, in no small part, due to the assistance that I have had \nfrom the distinguished Senator from Oregon. I simply want to say that \nthe Senator from Oregon has not only been very helpful to me in this \nbill, but I think he epitomizes what the skilled and dedicated \nlegislator is all about.\n  I had a great deal of respect for Senator Hatfield before we started \ntrying to put together this very difficult bill. I have even more \nrespect for him now. In case we have the miracle of miracles and we \nwork out an agreement and this bill quickly becomes law and everybody \nscatters to the far ends of the continent, and maybe in some cases to \nthe far ends of the world, I just wanted to say how much I appreciate \nthe distinguished chairman for the personal help and council he has \ngiven to me. He certainly is deserving of our thanks and our \nappreciation.\n  Let me, in waiting for the amendment to be ready, simply suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside for the purpose of considering a technical \namendment which has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2813\n\n            (Purpose: To make certain technical corrections)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send a technical amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2813.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 15, line 23 strike ``148,280,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``168,280,000''.\n       On page 15, line 24 strike ``and''.\n       On page 16, line 2 after ``103-322'' insert ``; and of \n     which $2,000,000 shall be for activities authorized by \n     section 210501 of Public Law 103-322''.\n       On page 20, line 8 strike ``$114,463,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$104,463,000''.\n       On page 115, line 9 strike ``$40,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$22,000,000''.\n       On page 123, line 1 strike ``$3,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``300,000''.\n       On page 151, line 16 strike ``(1)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 151, line 18, strike ``(2) and (3)'' and insert \n     ``(3) and (4)''.\n\n[[Page S 14502]]\n\n       On page 151, line 19 strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(3)''.\n       On page 152, line 13 strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(4)''.\n       On page 153, line 14 strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(5)''.\n       On page 154, line 21 strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(6)''.\n       On page 155, line 3 strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(7)''.\n       On page 155, line 9 strike ``(7)'' and insert ``(8)''.\n       On page 155, line 19 strike ``(8)'' and insert ``(9)''.\n       On page 151, line 16 after ``Sec. 614.'' insert ``(1) This \n     Act may be cited as the ``Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.''\n       On page 161, line 25 strike ``$115,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$140,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the bill that is currently before the \nSenate, H.R. 2076, fiscal year 1996 Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations bill, as reported by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, contains several inadvertent errors. This amendment is \npurely technical in nature and is intended to accurately reflect the \namendments which were adopted in both subcommittee and full committee.\n  This amendment has been cleared by the distinguished floor manager on \nthe other side. It is simply necessary to straighten out all of the \ndrafting errors that have been created in getting the bill to this \npoint.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2813) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncorrections to the committee report that I send to the desk be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Errata: Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and \n                    Related Agencies Report 104-139\n\n       Page 20, paragraph 2, sentence 2 should read:\n       ``Of these funds, $275,000,000, including $107,720,000 in \n     program increases, are derived from the violent crime \n     reduction trust fund [VCRTF], as authorized in section 521 of \n     Senate bill 735.''\n       Page 27, under Border Control Systems Modernization, the \n     first sentence should read:\n       ``A total of $158,500,000 is recommended, of which \n     $104,453,000 is provided from the violent crime reduction \n     trust fund, to continue the border system modernization \n     effort started last year.''\n       Page 30, last paragraph, delete the following report \n     language:\n       ``The Committee recommendation assumes that the 300 agents \n     relocated to the front lines of the border will include the \n     agents noted by the Department as well as agents currently \n     assigned to the San Clemente and Temecula checkpoints in \n     California.''\n       On page 37, the entry for the Committee recommendation for \n     State and local block grant/COPS should be $1,690,000.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the committee amendment beginning on page 2, \n     line 9, insert the following:\n       The amount from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for \n     the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement \n     Assistance Programs is reduced by $75,000,000.\n       The following sums are appropriated in addition to such \n     sums provided elsewhere in this Act,\n       For the Department of Justice, Edward Byrne Memorial State \n     and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs, $75,000,000.\n       For the Department of Commerce, International Trade \n     Administration, ``Operations and Administration'', \n     $46,500,000; for the Export Administration, ``Operations and \n     Administration'', $8,100,000; for the Minority Business \n     Development Agency, ``Minority Business Development'', \n     $32,789,000; for the National Telecommunication and \n     Information Administration, ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $3,000,000; for the Patent and Trademark Office ``Salaries \n     and Expenses'', $26,000,000; for the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology, ``Industrial Technology Services'', \n     $25,000,000; for the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology, ``Construction of Research Facilities'', \n     $3,000,000; and the amount for the Commerce Reorganization \n     Transition Fund is reduced by $10,000,000.\n       For the Department of State, Administration of Foreign \n     Affairs ``Diplomatic and Consular Programs'', $135,635,000; \n     for ``Salaries and Expenses'', $32,724,000; for the ``Capital \n     Investment Fund'', $8,200,000.\n       For the United States Information Agency, ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'', $9,000,000; for the ``Technology Fund'', \n     $2,000,000; for the ``Educational and Cultural Exchange \n     Programs'', $20,000,000 of which $10,000,000 if for the \n     Fulbright program; for the Eisenhower Exchanges, $837,000; \n     for the ``International Broadcasting Operations'', \n     $10,000,000; and for the East-West Center, $10,000,000.\n       For the United States Sentencing Commission, ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'', $1,460,000; for the International Trade \n     Commission, ``Salaries and Expenses'', $4,250,000; for the \n     Federal Trade Commission ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $9,893,000; for the Marine Mammal Commission, ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'', $384,000; for the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, ``Salaries and Expenses'', $29,740,000; and for \n     the Small Business Administration, $30,000,000.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, first I want to express my deep \nappreciation for the kind words expressed by the chairman of our \nsubcommittee, Senator Gramm of Texas, and to say in response that it \nhas been one of those wonderful occasions and experiences that \nsometimes happen in the Senate, and that is when we get down together \none-on-one to negotiate and to try to find out the other person's \nperspective, the other person's viewpoint, the other person's \npriorities, and come to a new appreciation that this indeed, is one of \nthe strengths of this institution--its \n\n[[Page S 14503]]\ndiversity. And at the same time there is diversity in this institution, \nit does not mean that it means stalemate. It does not equal stalemate \ndiversity.\n  I could find no person with greater sensitivity and words indeed than \nthat personified by Mr. Gramm in working out the differences and also, \nat the same time, working for the same goal.\n  I come to appreciate, from time to time, the strength of diversity. I \nsometimes also think that if I listened more, spoke less, I would hear \nwhat the other person might be saying a little more clearly than \ndepending upon imagery or upon labels such that we oftentimes use in \nshortcut methods. That also does not build for personal relationships.\n  Mr. President, I have sent to the desk an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Hollings, myself, and on behalf of the Appropriations Committee \nin general.\n  I filed an amended application for the Commerce, Justice and State \nbill that allows an additional $500 million in budget authority and \n$325 million in outlays to be spent on the bill.\n  Now, this begs for, again, a quick description again of our process. \nI know beyond the beltway that is not necessarily perhaps a very high \nitem of interest. For our own colleagues to understand that at the \nbeginning of any appropriations cycle that the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, along with consultation and along with staff \nand so forth, creates what we call the 602(b) allocations.\n  Now, we do not follow the House of Representatives. In other words, \nwe have our own methods and our own priorities and so forth. So that \nreflects basically, once the committee has adopted the chairman's mark, \nthat represents basically a committee action.\n  In this particular case, we had $1 billion--I am talking now in round \nnumbers--$1 billion in a 602(b) allocation to this subcommittee headed \nby Senator Gramm and with the former chair of the committee and now the \nranking member, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, $1 billion under \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Now, there were obvious problems just from that allocation. These \npeople had to work within that framework once adopted by the committee. \nThey did so. That meant that they had to not just reduce and diminish \nsome of the expenditures that have been built up over a period of time, \nbut they also had to select between agencies and between programs \nwithin agencies.\n  Now, when we go to the House of Representatives for a conference \nultimately as we do with each bill, the chairman of the House \ncommittee, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, and I have the \nresponsibilities under the Budget Act that we have to find a way to \nbring those two committees together on an agreed target figure.\n  Normally, what we do is to strike the difference. We say, all right, \nthat is $500 million for the Senate in this case and $500 million less \nfor the House. You take that as your target figure to make your \nadjustments.\n  In this particular case, probably one of the most severely hit of all \nsubcommittees in the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee, and they \nhad an extraordinarily difficult time in the Senate to even get in the \nballpark of meeting with the House floor conference.\n  Why wait until that moment when Congressman Livingston and I have to \nget together to fix that target, why not do it now? That is all this \namendment represents. We are saying, in effect, we had the previous \nbill, HUD, independent agencies. We had to adjust that downward in \nterms of meeting a figure to the House figure for HUD, independent \nagency, the Senate HUD, independent agency, to get together for \nconference.\n  What I have done at this point is to advance that moment of time and \ndecision that would have to take place with Congressman Livingston and \nmyself, taking from the HUD bill we have just completed on the floor \nand transferring that budget outlay figure that we have just announced \nhere this afternoon at $325 million.\n  I had a reserve fund in the so-called BA that we could draw from in \nthe full committee, and we drew from that, to create now this \namendment. In other words, this amendment does not add a single penny \nto our overall commitments under the budget resolution.\n  What we are doing is making a fine adjustment that has to occur \nanyway, and we are doing it in advance of the time in order to make \nthis bill more acceptable and to be a broader base of support for the \nbill, but also to be more equitable and fair in the bill.\n  My phone has been ringing off the hook for the last 3 weeks since the \ncommittee reported the bill. I know that it has been so in the case of \nSenators Gramm and Hollings, as well, and probably many others who \nserve on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Now, this small increase of funds, we have made a printout of each \naccount to which we are adding funds in the Commerce Department, the \nState Department, and some of agencies funded under this bill. We also \nhave reiterated our commitment for the Byrne-formula grants in the \nJustice Department. Each member has before him or her the full \namendment in detail. I will only refer to that.\n  Now, what this overall amendment does is to keep the spending levels \ncloser to a freeze and closer to actions taken by the authorizing \ncommittees.\n  So this is not just trying to get an adjustment for this bill here in \nthe Senate, and for the conference to come with the House, but also to \ntie in with the authorized levels provided by Senator Helms in the case \nof Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department.\n  You will find on this printout such examples, if you look at the \ncolumns where this so-called outlays and this adjustment takes place in \nthe last two columns of the figures. As an example, we are taking \ndomestic and counselor programs and funding them with replacement of \nmoney at about $115.8 million at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nauthorizing level. That is how you work these charts back and forth.\n  The amendment provides additional funds for six independent agencies. \nThose six independent agencies are U.S. Sentencing Commission, \nInternational Trade Commission, Federal Trade Commission, Marine Mammal \nCommission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Small Business \nAdministration.\n  Now, in the case of the Federal Trade Commission and the \nInternational Trade Commission and all of these, what we have done is \nto have a freeze minus 10 percent in the amendment. That contrasts to a \nfreeze minus 20 percent which was in the bill that is now before the \nSenate. That, again, is representative of another type of handling of \nthese additions.\n  In the case of the Small Business Administration, we propose to add \nan additional $30 million, which should be sufficient funding to \nadministrator the loan volume recommended in the committee bill.\n  Again, we refer back to not only our previous work but to authorizing \ncommittees as well. There are many competing demands in this bill and \nit makes it very difficult, even with this amendment.\n  Let me make very clear, this amendment does not solve all of our \nproblems. But I do think it can solve sufficient problems to get this \nbill wrapped into the CR, down to the White House, eventually to be \nvetoed. I have to be straightforward. My impression, maybe this \namendment is going to help in some way alleviate that probability that \nis now very clear that the President intends to veto this bill.\n  Maybe we can again, hopefully, make that a lesser possibility than it \nis under the bill that we have before us.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not going to go on about these changes. I am \nvery happy to respond to specific questions that people may have, but I \ndo want to say that it has been through the cooperative spirit of the \nleadership of this subcommittee and the leadership of the full Senate \nthat we are hoping, today, to offer this amendment, have it adopted, \nand thereby move on to address other issues in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me rise in gratitude to our \ndistinguished full committee chairman and also the subcommittee \nchairman for allowing us to proceed, and to note a softening and \nthawing on behalf of the distinguished subcommittee chairman, which is \nvery becoming.\n  Senator Hatfield has really saved us. I read Mary McGrory this \nmorning, and she said Ross Perot had given \n\n[[Page S 14504]]\nPresident Clinton oxygen. I feel like, in this amendment, which I am \nproud to cosponsor, we are getting oxygen. It keeps some very important \nprograms alive.\n  The distinguished full committee chairman, Senator Hatfield, has been \nvery sensitive and very understanding and very realistic. There is none \nof this kind of pork or any of these other kind of things. This \namendment adds back funds to high priority commerce programs--$46.5 \nmillion for the International Trade Administration--we just had lunch \non yesterday with the Special Trade Representative. We are trying to \nget more competitive and more realistic in a trade policy in this \ncountry, and we need these additional funds to just bring them up to \nwhere they would be at a freeze.\n  There is $32 million for the Minority Business Development Agency; \n$25 million for NIST--the National Bureau of Standards, manufacturing \ncenters, the information technology centers; $8.1 million for the \nExport Administration; and finally for the front line--after the fall \nof the wall--namely, our State Department, which the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Pell, has just addressed. $177 million is added \nto their operating accounts to bring them back to the level proposed in \nS. 908, Senator Helms' Foreign Relations Authorization Act.\n  For the USIA, we are adding back $20 million for the international \neducation exchanges, including $10 million for the Fulbright program. \nWe also add back funds for the USIA operations, international \nbroadcasting, and technology modernization. And for the independent \nagencies like the Federal Trade Commission, the Small Business \nAdministration and others, we have added back certain funds that could \nbe available now with this new allocation.\n  I thank particularly the staffs on both sides, Scott Gudes, Mark Van \nDer Water, David Taylor, Scott Corwin, and Steve McMillen, who worked \nuntil about 2 o'clock this morning, trying to bring this about.\n  I am very much appreciative to Senator Hatfield, and I hope we can \nadopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to the chairman of \nthe full committee and to the Senator from South Carolina for \naddressing a concern I have been discussing with them for many months, \nthe East-West Center. It is a very important national asset, and I \nthank them very much.\n  For those not familiar with the East-West Center, it is a world-class \nAmerican institution dedicated to promoting better understanding and \nrelationships with the countries of Asia and the Pacific.\n  It was created by a bipartisan government 35 years ago that foresaw \nthe need for a better understanding between the United States and the \nAsia-Pacific region. The importance of the East-West Center is \nimportant now more than ever.\n  The Asia-Pacific region is the fastest growing region in the world. \nToday, over half of the population of the world is in Asia. This region \nhas about 20 percent of the land mass and over 60 percent of the gross \nproduct of the world.\n  For every jumbo jet that flies over the Atlantic Ocean, four fly over \nthe Pacific Ocean. Our trade with Asia is four times larger than our \ntrade with Europe.\n  It has become the fastest growing economy. Trade with Asia provides \nnearly 3 million jobs to Americans and, by the year 2003, our exports \nto Asia will be more than double those to Europe.\n  I would like to share two concrete examples of the East-West Center's \nsuccess in the Asia-Pacific. There was a time when our relations with \nIndonesia were next to nil. Our Ambassador was recalled. There were no \nexchanges or any formal conversation.\n  Indonesia cut off all ties with the United States. It would not \npermit any of its citizens to become Fulbright scholars, but it \ncontinued to send men and women to the East-West Center.\n  The same thing with Burma. Our relationship with Burma over the years \nhas been hot and cold. At one time, Burma sent our Ambassador home and \nclosed our consulates. But Burma sent students to the East-West Center.\n  It was convinced that this was a unique spot on the globe where men \nand women could freely discuss issues of the day.\n  The East-West Center now has 42,000 alumni globally; a network of \ndistinguished colleagues in government, business, the media, academia, \nand the professions.\n  The student degree program, with 4,000 graduates, is a major \ncomponent of cultural and technical interchange at the Center.\n  As you can see, the East-West Center is a national resource that must \nbe funded at a responsible level. I ask my colleagues to support this \nnational institution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii, the senior Senator from Utah, the senior Senator from \nAlaska, the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, and the \nchairmen of the subcommittee and full committee, in offering this \namendment to restore funding for the East-West Center.\n  Over the past 35 years, the East-West Center has established its \nreputation as one of the most respected and authoritative institutions \ndedicated to the advancement of international cooperation throughout \nAsia and the Pacific. The Center plays a key role in promoting \nconstructive American involvement in the region through its \neducational, dialogue, research, and outreach programs. The Center \naddresses critical issues of importance to the Asia-Pacific region and \nUnited States interests in the region, including international \neconomics and politics, energy and natural resources, population, the \nenvironment, technology, and culture.\n  The achievements of the East-West Center bear repetition. Since its \ncreation by Congress in 1960, the Center has welcomed over 53,000 \nparticipants from over 60 nations and territories to research, \neducation, and conference programs.\n  Scholars, statesmen, government officials, journalists, teachers, and \nbusiness executives from the United States and the nations of Asia and \nthe Pacific have benefited from studies at the Center. These government \nand private sector leaders comprise an influential network of East-West \nCenter alumni throughout the Asia-Pacific region. I continually \nencounter proud Center alumni in meetings with Asian and Pacific island \ngovernment officials and business leaders.\n  The success of the Center as a forum for the promotion of \ninternational cooperation and the strength of the positive personal \nrelationships developed at the Center are reflected in the prestige it \nenjoys in the region. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Fiji, Papua New \nGuinea, Pakistan, and other American allies in the region--over 20 \ncountries in all--support the Center's programs with contributions. The \nCenter has also received endowments from benefactors in recognition of \nits contributions and value.\n  Mr. President, the countries of Asia and the Pacific are critically \nimportant to the United States and our political and economic interests \ninto the next century. By the year 2000, the Asia-Pacific region will \nbe the world's largest producer and consumer of goods and services. The \nmarkets for energy resources, telecommunications, and air travel are \nfast becoming the world's largest.\n  Future economic growth and job creation in the United States is \nclosely linked to our ability to identify and secure opportunities in \nthe world's fastest growing economies. The East-West Center provides \nleadership and advice on economic issues, including APEC [Asia Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation] and the U.S.-Pacific Island Joint Commercial \nCommission.\n  Mr. President, given the strategic and economic importance of the \nAsia-Pacific region to U.S. interests, and the credibility and trust \nenjoyed by the East-West Center in the region, I believe it is unwise \nto slash funding for the Center. We have closed, or are in the process \nof closing, AID offices in the region. These actions are sending \nsignals to our friends and others in the region that our interest is \nwaning.\n  For over 3 decades we have invested in the East-West Center, creating \nan important resource that promotes regional understanding and \ncooperation, provides expertise on complex regional issues, and advises \nU.S. foreign policy decisionmaking. If we fail to provide \n\n[[Page S 14505]]\nthe Center adequate funding and a reasonable transition period to self-\nsufficiency, we will discard a valuable resource--a first-class \ninstitution that has earned an international reputation for its \nresearch scholarship and academic programs. Given the increasing \nsignificance of Asia and the Pacific islands to our interests and \nsecurity, such action is short-sighted and ill-advised. I urge my \ncolleagues to support our amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one of the things that is deficient, in my \nview, about the legislation before us--and I will shortly send an \namendment to the desk about it that I think we have worked out--and \nthat is, in fairness to my friend from Texas, the chairman of the \ncommittee, in his, if I have this correct, 602(b) allocation, initially \nhe got less money in that allocation. I am not being critical of the \nchairman. He got less money in that allocation than was needed to fund \nsome of the things I think he believes should have been funded, and I \nstrongly believe, along with Senator Hatch and a number of my \nRepublican as well as Democratic colleagues, should be funded.\n  In this case the present appropriations bill before us funds the \nViolence Against Women Act law at $75 million less than is needed. It \nis funded at $100 million. I am going to shortly send an amendment to \nthe desk to increase that funding. I ask to be corrected if I am \nmistaken here, but I will, on behalf of Senator Gramm and myself, send \nto the desk, along with Senators Hatch and Wellstone and others, an \namendment that would restore the $75 million in this account.\n  I understand the reason we have been able to work this out is a \nconsequence of the generosity of the distinguished chairman of the full \ncommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee, this \nsubcommittee, who have come up with this agreement that, in turn, has \nhad the effect of providing an additional $75 million for the violent \ncrime trust fund. It is that from which this is funded.\n  Of all the legislation I have ever worked on here in the Senate, this \none, the Violence Against Women Act, has been, in my case, my first \npriority and proudest accomplishment. When it passed the Senate with \noverwhelming bipartisan support I was hopeful that support would be \nmaintained. Frankly, I lost faith there for a little while when the \nappropriations bill first came out.\n  I am actually waiting for the amendment so I can send it to the desk. \nI will explain the rest of it while I am waiting.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield for an observation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not raise this officially, but I do not believe \nthe Senator can offer an amendment at this point. I do not believe this \namendment is amendable at this point.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New Mexico, I have \noverwhelming confidence in his parliamentary skills. If he says it, \nthere must be a likelihood he is correct, in which case I make a \nparliamentary inquiry: When is it appropriate for the Senator from \nDelaware to introduce an amendment that would, in fact, restore the $75 \nmillion to the violence against women account?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When we dispose of the Hatfield amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is a very useful piece of information, Mr. President. \nI thank him very much, and, if it is appropriate, I ask unanimous \nconsent that, upon disposal of the Hatfield amendment, I be recognized \nto offer my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I will not object if I \ncan add my unanimous consent to it that immediately thereafter we have \na Domenici amendment on legal services.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will just take a moment, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from New Mexico, I will just \ntake a minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No problem.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to just emphasize what the \nSenator from Delaware said, including being an original cosponsor to \nthis amendment. I will wait. I am very pleased an agreement has been \nworked out. I will wait until the Senator from Delaware introduces his \namendment. My understanding is we have a good agreement here. At that \npoint in time I would like to talk about the importance of what we have \ndone.\n  So I just ask unanimous consent I be included as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Hatfield, \nthe sponsor of the amendment, a clarification question.\n  First of all, I strongly compliment my colleague on the amendment. I \ncertainly intend wholeheartedly to support it. Under Small Business \nAdministration you have an overall $30 million add-on. Am I correct \nthat in the specifics, that for women's outreach programs, you have \nincreased that to $4 million?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And for the information centers, women's counselling, \n$200,000. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Those are within the overall 30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for his answers. I want to commend \nhim for that.\n  I want to suggest that, if there is any area that we are being \nsuccessful as a nation in encouraging new entrants into the business \nfield, it is women ownership of business. It is skyrocketing in \nAmerica, and some of it has to do with very effective programs when you \nare bringing women in and they are talking about what they might want \nto do in business, and providing a lot of information about how to \nobtain loans and the like. I think we ought to maximize that effort at \nthis point.\n  I thank the Senator for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The amendment (No. 2814) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm, and Senator \nHollings particularly for his cosponsorship.\n  I also want to thank Scott Gudes, Scott Corwin, David Taylor, and \nMark Van de Water, four members of our respective staffs who sat up and \nworked this out in detail until about 2 a.m. this morning.\n  They certainly deserve the accolades and appreciation of the whole \nSenate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I want to particularly thank Mark Van de Water of \nSenator Hatfield's staff. We really appreciate it very, very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent that \nanyone who wishes to be added as a cosponsor on this amendment be able \nto do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2815\n\n  (Purpose: To restore funding for grants to combat violence against \n                                 women)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n\n[[Page S 14506]]\n     Gramm, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2815.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, line 19, strike ``$100,900,000'' and insert \n     ``$175,400,000''.\n       On page 25, line 22, strike ``$4,250,000'' and insert \n     ``$6,000,000''.\n       On page 26, line 1, strike ``$61,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$130,000,000''.\n       On page 26, line 7, strike ``$6,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$7,000,000''.\n       On page 26, line 10, insert after ``Act;'' the following: \n     ``$1,000,000 for training programs to assist probation and \n     parole officers who work with released sex offenders, as \n     authorized by section 40152(c) of the Violent Crime Control \n     and Law Enforcement Act of 1994; $500,000 for Federal \n     victim's counselors, as authorized by section 40114 of that \n     Act; $50,000 for grants for televised testimony, as \n     authorized by section 1001(a)(7) of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968; $200,000 for the study of State \n     databases on the incidence of sexual and domestic violence, \n     as authorized by section 40292 of the Violent Crime Control \n     and Law Enforcement Act of 1994; $1,500,000 for national \n     stalker and domestic violence reduction, as authorized by \n     section 40603 of that Act;''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to restore $75 \nmillion in funding for the Justice Department programs contained in the \nViolence Against Women Act, and I am pleased that many of my \ncolleagues, including Senator Gramm of Texas and Senator Hatch of Utah, \nare cosponsors of this amendment.\n  Of all the legislation I have ever worked on here in the Senate, this \none--the Violence Against Women Act--has been my first priority and my \nproudest accomplishment. When it passed the Senate with overwhelming \nbipartisan support, I thought we were well on our way to making a \nsignificant commitment to the women of America. I though we made more \nthan a paper commitment. But passing the law, without following through \nand providing the funding is meaningless.\n  For too long, we have looked the other way when it comes to this kind \nof violence. For too long, we have turned our back on the women injured \nby men who say they love them. For too long, we have considered this \nkind of violence a private misfortune rather than a public injustice.\n  Last year, we took a historic step in the right direction when we \npassed the Violence Against Women Act. We made a commitment to the \nwomen and children of this country. We said: We will no longer look the \nother way--the violence your suffer will no longer be yours alone. Help \nis on the way.\n  And just in case my colleagues have forgotten, let me once again \nremind them of the dimensions of this problem:\n  The No. 1 threat to the health of America's women is a violent attack \nat the hands of a man. It is not breast cancer, it's not heart attacks, \nit's not strikes. Its violence against women by men.\n  These attacks have many names. They are called rape, assault, \nfelonies. And the attackers have many faces. They are friends, \nrelatives, spouses, and strangers.\n  The statistics are terrifying:\n  Every 18 seconds, a woman is beaten by her spouse, boyfriend, or \nother intimate partner.\n  Every 5 minutes, a woman is raped.\n  Nearly two out of three female victims of violence are related to, or \nknow, their attackers.\n  As many as 35 percent of all women who visit emergency rooms are \nthere because of family violence.\n  This violence also takes a tragic toll on our children:\n  Three million children each year witness violence in their homes. \nStudies show that these kids are more likely to drop out of school; \nabuse alcohol and drugs; attempt suicide; and, sadly, grow up to be \nabusers themselves.\n  The violence women suffer reflects as much a failure of our Nation's \ncollective moral conscience as it does the failure of our Nation's laws \nand regulations.\n  How else can we explain the results of a study of junior high school \nstudents conducted in Rhode Island a few years ago?\n  In the study, the students were asked: When does a man have the right \nto have sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent?\n  It seems like an outrageous question doesn't it? but 80 percent of \nthe students said that a man had the right to use force on his wife, 70 \npercent said he had the right to use force if the couple was engaged, \nand 61 percent said force was OK if the couple had already had sexual \nrelations, and 30 percent said force was justified if the man knew that \nthe woman had had sex with other men.\n\n  And the appalling answers do not stop.\n  About 25 percent of the boys said it was OK to force sex on a girl if \nthe boy had spent $10 on her--and, astoundingly, 20 percent of the \ngirls who were interviewed agreed.\n  If these are the attitudes we have communicated to our youth, it is \nhardly surprising that we tolerate a level of violence against women \nunprecedented in our history.\n  Somehow, we seem to forget that a society suffers what it tolerates.\n  That's why we cannot retreat from the commitment we made last year \nwith passage of the Violence Against Women Act. The act, let me remind \nmy colleagues, has four basic goals: To make our streets and homes \nsafer for women; to make the criminal justice system more responsive to \nwomen; to start changing attitudes--beginning with our kids--about \nviolence against women; and to extend to women the equal protection of \nour Nation's laws.\n  The Senate, the House, and the President--we all agreed last year \nthat Federal dollars should be committed to these goals. Specifically, \nwe authorized funding to:\n  Hire more police and prosecutors specially trained and devoted to \ncombating family violence;\n  Train police, prosecutors, and judges in the ways of family \nviolence--so they can better understand and respond to the problem;\n  Implement tougher arrest policies, including mandatory arrest for \nanyone who violates a protection order--so that the burden of seeking \nan arrest does not fall on the women who may fear further violence;\n  Expand and improve victim-service programs and provide specially \ntrained family violence court advocates;\n  Fund rape crisis centers and open more battered women shelters; and\n  Fund family violence education courses in our schools.\n  In the past 12 months, the Violence Against Women Act has already \nbeen put into action. In States and communities all across the county, \nFederal dollars are helping coalitions of police, prosecutors, judges, \nand victim service organizations work together--to make arrests, win \nconvictions, secure tough sentences, and offer women the information \nand practical resources they need.\n\n  As many of you may already know, the first conviction and sentencing \nunder the act took place recently in West Virginia.\n  It is a case about Christopher Bailey and his wife, Sonja, and it is \nenough to take your breath away. Christopher Bailey severely beat \nSonja, forced her into the trunk of his car, and drove aimlessly across \nWest Virginia and Kentucky for 6 days.\n  Sonja suffered massive head injuries and severe kidney and liver \ndysfunctions. Her face was black and blue, and her eyes were swollen \nshut. She had burn marks on her neck, wrists, and ankles.\n  Today, Sonja remains in a coma.\n  Christopher Bailey was convicted under a new provision in the \nViolence Against Women Act, and for kidnapping. Early this month he was \nsentenced to serve the rest of his days in prison.\n  Obviously, Bailey's conviction won't bring Sonja out of her coma. But \nit does send a clear message all across our land: violence against \nwomen will not be tolerated--it will be punished, and it will be \npunished severely.\n  Today, we here in the Senate must send that same message. We must \nkeep the promise we made last year, and restore funding for the Justice \nDepartment programs authorized by the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Last year, the Congress authorized over $176 million for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act Justice Department programs. This bill as reported by \ncommittee cut more than $76 million from these programs.\n  The most devastating cut was made to the grant program at the heart \nof \n\n[[Page S 14507]]\nthe act: The program to bring together State and local police, \nprosecutors, and victims advocates to target family violence and rape.\n  Last year, we authorized $130 million for that program. This bill \nonly allocates $61 million--so $69 million dollars were cut from the \npolice, prosecution, and victim services grants--that means more than 1 \nout of every 2 dollars were cut.\n  This is money for more police and prosecutors to crack down on \nviolence against women; to train police, prosecutors, and judges so \nthey can understand better and respond more effectively to violence \nagainst women; and to develop, enlarge and strengthen programs for \nvictims of violence--like rape crisis centers, battered women's \nshelters, and special victim advocates.\n  This bill also cuts $1 million earmarked especially for rural areas \nto combat family violence, and the bill completely eliminated the $1.5 \nmillion targeted to combat stalking against women.\n  In restoring $75 million in funding for the Violence Against Women \nAct, this amendment does not take any new money out of the taxpayer's \npockets. Instead, the money comes out of other places in the bill--\nwhere there's much more money appropriated than was requested by the \nPresident.\n  These cuts would have had a devastating impact on the lives of women \nand children in America. I am pleased that so many of my colleagues are \njoining me in restoring virtually all of the funding for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  Let me also point out: the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education, chaired by my distinguished \nfriend and colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, has \nrecommended full funding for the Violence Against Women Act programs \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services \nfor rape education and prevention, domestic violence community \ndemonstration projects, a domestic violence hotline, and battered women \nshelters.\n  In fact, recognizing the urgency of this problem, the subcommittee \nwrote in an additional $2.4 million for battered women shelters--\nshelters which serve as a refuge for women and their children when they \nare hurt and most vulnerable--and in greatest need of our compassion \nand support.\n  I applaud the subcommittee's efforts to honor the commitment that we \nmade last year to the women and children of America. And I hope that \nwhen the HHS appropriations bill comes to the floor, the full Senate \nwill honor that commitment as well.\n  But right here, right now, we must not retreat on the bill at hand. \nWe cannot--we must not--turn back now. For too long, our society has \nturned its back on the nightmare that is violence against women.\n  Obviously, we cannot legislate humanity and kindness. And we cannot \noutlaw hatred and ignorance.\n  But we can help make America a safer place for women--and I call on \neveryone here to help do just that.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in restoring full funding to \nthe Violence Against Women Act programs. The women and children of \nAmerica are counting on us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hollings be added \nas an original cosponsor, and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator \nGramm of Texas is already the original cosponsor, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Boxer, Senator Wellstone, and others who will come to the floor \nI am sure who wish to be part of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the interest of time because there are \nother amendments and a lot more to do on this bill, let me briefly \nexplain this amendment and then yield to the chairman of the \nsubcommittee for any comments that he would like to make, and he surely \nknows the mechanics of this better than I.\n  Mr. President, in order to restore every single piece of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act funding, there is a requirement that would be \nrequired that we would have to have had $76.7 million.\n  Just to give my colleagues an idea what I mean about that, the \nviolence against women grants; pro-arrest policy; rural domestic \nviolence, court-appointed special counsel, national stalker reduction, \ntraining programs, Federal victims counselors, grants for televised \ntestimony, State databases, national baseline study for campus sexual \nassault, equal justice for women in courts, training grants for State \ncourts, training for Federal and judicial personnel, Federal Judicial \nCenter, and Administrative Office of the Courts, are all recipients of \nsome portion of the violence against women funding.\n  Unfortunately, all we have available is $75 million, not $76.7 \nmillion to make this account totally whole.\n  So my amendment lays out which portions of all of those functions \nthat I have just read are fully funded and which are not able to be \nfunded with this addition of $75 million.\n  I want to put this in context. We are going to be funding $175 \nmillion out of $76.7 million. This is a $75 million increase. I wish it \nwere a $76.7 million increase, but then again, as my friend, the \nchairman of the full committee is saying, I am being a little greedy in \nthat regard. I realize every program has to take a little bit of hit.\n  So what we do in a nutshell is we add $75 million in the accounts \nthat we may call the violence against women grants, pro-arrest policy, \nthe rural domestic violence, court-appointed advocate programs, \nnational stalker legislation, training programs, Federal victims \ncounselors--we are not able to fully fund the grants for televised \ntestimony. That was originally in our legislation--$250 million. It is \nfunded at only $50 million. We are able to fund fully the State \ndatabase. We are not able to fund the national baseline study on campus \nsexual assault at this moment. We are not able to fund equal justice \nfor women in State courts, training for Federal judicial personnel, \nFederal Judicial Center, and Administrative Office of the Courts.\n  So that is what the additional $75 million goes to make whole.\n  I would be delighted to yield to the chairman of the committee for \nany comments, and thank him, by the way, for keeping--as he always does \nwith me and with everyone else I know--a commitment. He told me that if \nhe had the money he would make this account at least mostly whole. He \ngot the money, and he did just that. And I thank him for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Biden for working with \nme on this amendment. We had provided in the appropriations bill a \ntripling of funding for violence against women, which represented our \nlargest increase in expenditure in the bill. Our problem was that, \ngiven the overall financial constraint we had, there was no way we \ncould fund the authorized level of the program.\n  So Senator Biden and I were in a position that we both wanted to \nprovide more money. This has been one of the top priorities of the \nbill. But yet we were still short of the full program that the Senate \nhad authorized.\n  When the distinguished chairman of the committee allocated additional \nfunds to the subcommittee, as he did in his amendment that was just \nadopted a moment ago, it allowed us to go ahead and to fully fund this \nprogram.\n  I am, therefore, very happy to join my colleague from Delaware in \nthis amendment. I think given the funds that are now available that \nthis represents a wise expenditure of money.\n  I join my colleague in supporting this amendment, and urge our \ncolleagues to adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to thank both of my \ncolleagues, the Senator from Delaware, and the Senator from Texas and, \nof course, the Senator from Oregon, Chairman Hatfield.\n  I also see the Senator from Utah whom I think has been a real leader \nin this area. I am really pleased that we have come together in a \nbipartisan way on this issue. \n\n[[Page S 14508]]\n\n  Mr. President, I could take a tremendous amount of time. But I think \nthere are other Senators who want to make some brief comments on this \nas well. So let me just try to summarize several hours worth of what I \nwould like to say on this issue.\n  In my State of Minnesota I think a lot of people are lighting a \ncandle in this area. The statistics nationally are really grim. I think \nthe FBI statistics is something like every 15 seconds a woman is \nbattered in our country.\n  Mr. President, I think that we are taking this seriously now in a way \nthat we have not before as a country, both as a crime and also in terms \nof the kind of things that we need to do to prevent it.\n  Mr. President, I think what this Violence Against Women Act funding \ndoes--I am so pleased that we were able to go up from $100 million to \n$175 million, is it provides funds to communities who can make good and \npositive things happen.\n  Mr. President, I think this is not bragging to say that Minnesota \nreally is one of the leaders in the Nation--I think I would probably \nargue leader in the Nation. I think the general view that we have in my \nState is we are never going to be able to reduce the violence in our \ncommunities unless we are able to reduce the violence in our homes. It \nspills out into the streets. It spills out into the neighborhoods. It \nspills out into the community.\n  I think the second view that we have in Minnesota--and I think it is \na view around the country--is that, whereas, when I was a kid, if we \nknew something was wrong in another home, whether it be a woman who was \nbattered or a child--sometimes a man, but unfortunately mainly women \nand children, not that I think it is good that men are battered--I \nthink it is awful that so many women and children have to pay this \nprice. I think now we have reached the conclusion, as opposed to a \npoint in time when we said it was no one's business, I think we are now \nseeing it as everybody's business. This is the kind of problem that \ncould be tackled at the community level. It is the kind of problem that \ncould be tackled by the law enforcement community. It is the kind of \nproblem that could be tackled by the clergy. It is the kind of problem \nthat can be tackled by women and others who are down there in the \ntrenches in the battered women's shelters. It is the kind of problem \nthat can be tackled in our schools where children learn alternatives to \nviolence as a way of solving disputes. We really think as a country we \ncan take this problem on.\n  I think this amendment which has been accepted by both sides is an \nextremely powerful, an extremely personal, and an extremely important \nmessage by the U.S. Senate that we are not going to back down from this \nnational commitment.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor. I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis very fine remarks.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I \nthank my colleague, friend, and cosponsor, Senator Biden, for his \nleadership in this area.\n  Mr. President, this really has a dramatic imprint on America. It is \nalready starting to put people in jail that are violating the rights of \nwomen in our society. Frankly, it is a tough law. It is a good law. It \nis one that needs to be fully funded, and I am happy that we have the \ncooperation and the support of the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee in this matter as well.\n  As most of my colleagues are aware, I have long opposed programs I \nbelieved were mere pork projects. In fact, I led the battle against \nlast year's crime bill because I felt that it had ballooned in terms of \nunjustified costs. The Violence Against Women Act, however, is an \nimportant program that deserves to be fully funded. The act provides \nfor: Rape prevention education; battered women shelters; grants to \nencourage arrest policies in domestic violence cases; the investigation \nand prosecution of domestic violence and child abuse in rural areas; \ntreatment and counseling for victims; and for developing community \ndomestic violence and child abuse education programs.\n  These programs are important. Prosecutors and police officers must \nbecome more sensitized to the problem of violence against women. Women \nwho are abused by their spouses must have a place to stay and must have \ncounseling available to repair their shattered lives. Resources need to \nbe channeled to stem the tide of violence directed against women.\n  Mr. President, no matter what anybody said, violence against women is \na problem in America today. According to the Justice Department data, \nnearly half a million women were forcibly raped last year--a half \nmillion, in the greatest society in the world.\n  Some studies estimate that the total number of rapes including those \nnot reported to the authorities exceed 2 million women a year. That is \noutrageous and it has to stop.\n  Indeed, according to a recent report by the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, a woman faces four times the chance of being raped today \nthan in 1960. Similarly, domestic violence strikes at the heart of the \nmost important political unit in America, and that is the family. The \nfamily should be a safe harbor for those tossed about by the storms of \nlife, not a place of abuse or of degradation. It is a sad fact of life, \nhowever, that the reports of domestic violence have been on the rise.\n  To this end, Senator Biden, Senator Specter, and I worked last year \nto see that the Violence Against Women Act was signed into law. \nAccording to both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, \nhowever, the Justice Department has only spent $2 million of the total \n$25 million provided for fiscal year 1995. We have to restore this \nfunding. The act is a small, albeit vital, step toward addressing the \nproblem of family violence and violence against women generally.\n  So I certainly urge all colleagues to be supportive of this \namendment. I am pleased to stand and support this excellent bill, and I \ncompliment my friend and colleague from Delaware for his leadership in \nthis matter, as well as those in the Chamber and others who have \ncontributed to the bill and to the funding of it. And I particularly \nthank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their \nwillingness to fully fund this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saying a few words \nin support of this amendment. I particularly thank the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, for negotiating on our behalf on this side of \nthe aisle, his conversations that he has had with all of us, the dialog \nthat he engaged in an effort to try to achieve a sensible strategy to \nsave some of the programs in a bill that to many of us is still flawed.\n  The Senator from Utah just talked about rape and the problem of \nviolence with respect to rape in particular, but the truth is that \nfamily violence, as we have all learned, is the No. 1 cause of all \nkinds of physical injury to women in this country. And when you \ntranslate the effect of family violence into the impact on several \nmillion young children, that impact plays out in a way that diminishes \nthe capacity of those children to be able to learn, to be able to go to \nschool, to be able to carry on normal relationships, and that flows \ninto their adolescence and subsequent adulthood in ways that simply \ndiminish the capacity of people to be able to participate as good \ncitizens.\n  We all deplore the implosion within a large segment of America's \npopulation with respect to a fundamental structure--the family. \nFinally, with the Violence Against Women Act, we gave people hope that \na particular kind of behavior was going to be properly singled out and \ntreated. To have even thought of doing away with it was astonishing to \nme.\n  We do not need to talk further about that because we are restoring \nit. I am glad that the Senate has come to its senses with respect to \nit.\n  I might mention that the Violence Against Women Act not only speaks \nto the problem of the physical abuse against a woman. We just had a \nvery long debate about welfare and the family cap. And my good friend \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, spoke extraordinarily eloquently in \nthe Chamber about the problem of punishing innocent children and \ncreating further \n\n[[Page S 14509]]\nproblems in the cycle but also about the problem of increased incentive \nto have abortions as a consequence of illegitimate pregnancies.\n  Mr. President, when you consider violence against women, the truth \nis--and it has been ignored by prosecutors across America and by State \ngovernments across America--a large percentage of those unwanted \npregnancies in America are the pregnancies of 13- and 14- and 15- and \n16-year-olds by virtue of the actions of 24- and 25- and 26-year-olds. \nThe last time most of us looked, that constituted statutory rape in \nthis country.\n  A Congressman has just been tried on the basis of actions of an adult \nwith a teenager, and the truth is that here in America a large \npercentage of preying on the young is taking place. The unwanted \npregnancies that we see in this country are in fact criminal actions. \nSo this act in effect allows us to also focus on that totally ignored \naspect of illegitimacy.\n  And the truth is, if there was a stronger capacity within the welfare \nsystem to identity those people, we might begin to hold people \naccountable for their actions, but not do it in a way that creates a \nhuge problem for the totally innocent child born as a consequence of \nthose actions.\n  So, Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Delaware. I think \nthis is a very important outcome. And I thank the Senator from Texas \nfor acknowledging that this act that only recently went into effect is \nworking, it is having a profound impact and it is healthy for this \ncountry to allow it to continue to work.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Biden amendment \nto increase by $75 million the appropriation for enforcement of the \nViolence Against Women's Act. As an original cosponsor of the \namendment, it is vitally important that Congress does not waiver in its \ncommitment to ensure that women in America are free from the \ndevastation of domestic violence.\n  Domestic violence is a social sickness, and women and children are \nits most common casualties. Violence against women in the home is a \nheinous crime being committed behind locked doors and pulled shades in \ncities and towns across America. By committing this additional funding \nto the Violence Against Women's Act, Congress will give women the tools \nto bring this crime out of the shadows.\n  Mr. President, a policeman recently said, ``The most dangerous place \nto be is in one's home between Saturday night at 6 p.m. and Sunday at 6 \np.m.'' He forgot to add, ``Especially if you're a woman.'' A 10-year \nstudy found that in cases where the identity of the killer is known, \nover one half of all women murdered in America were killed by a current \nor former male partner or by a male family member. Studies have also \nshown that violence against women in the home causes more total \ninjuries to women than rape, muggings, and car accidents combined.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, there were 66,248 domestic violence \noffenses reported by the police in 1993. Overall, women were the \nvictims in 83 percent of all domestic violence offenses. Mr. President, \n41 women lost their lives as a result of domestic violence disputes in \nmy home State in 1993. These are not nameless, faceless statistics, Mr. \nPresident, these are women who endured torture and abuse during their \nmarriages and were violently murdered.\n  Mr. President, I have introduced a bill to create community response \nteams around the country. Community response teams work in tandem with \npolice to help victims of domestic violence right when a crisis occurs. \nBy working together, community response teams and police can provide \nvictims with the services so essential to them after they have been \nbattered or beaten in their home.\n  Mr. President, an increasing number of jurisdictions in the State of \nNew Jersey are employing community response teams. For example, in \nMiddlesex County, which includes South River, there are currently five \njurisdictions with community response teams. South River, with a \npopulation of approximately 15,000, has a community response team \nemploying 7 community volunteers. In Woodbridge, a community response \nteam of approximately 30 volunteers is serving a population of 100,000. \nThese community response teams, serving both large and small \ncommunities, are effectively assisting women who are suffering physical \nand mental abuse.\n  Mr. President, Violence Against Women's Act funding is available for \nthese successful programs in New Jersey to continue to aid victims of \ndomestic violence. In addition, Violence Against Women's Act funding \nwill assist in the fight against domestic violence by providing needed \nresources to prosecutors and police officers.\n  Mr. President, if domestic violence is to be obliterated in our \nsociety, we need to provide communities with the resources they need to \nprevent instances of violence and protect victims from further abuse. \nBy providing additional funding to the Violence Against Women's Act, \nCongress will strengthen the lines of defense in the battle against \ndomestic violence.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Biden \namendment, which restores the $75 million shortfall in funding for \nprograms to prevent violence against women.\n  After years of hearings, reports and statistics we learned that our \nsociety and our criminal justice system has been ignoring violence \nagainst women, often with tragic consequences for women, their \nchildren, and ultimately, for society itself.\n  We learned that one-fifth of all aggravated assaults in the United \nStates occurred in the home; 3 to 4 million American women a year are \nvictims of family violence; one-third of all American women who are \nmurdered die at the hands of a husband or boyfriend; one third of all \nwomen who go to emergency rooms in this country are there because of \nfamily violence; an estimated 700,000 American women are raped each \nyear; children in violent homes are 1,500 times more likely to be \nabused or neglected; over the last 10 years, crimes against women have \nrisen nearly three times as fast as the total crime rate; 98 percent of \nthe victims of rape never see their attacker caught, tried or \nimprisoned; over half of all rape prosecutions are either dismissed \nbefore trial or result in an acquittal; and almost half of all \nconvicted rapists can expect to serve an average of a year or less \nbehind bars.\n  The solution to the problem is not to treat women as victims--it is \nempowerment. And that is what the act does. It allows women to take \ncharge of their lives through such things as rape prevention programs \nor counseling provided at federally funded battered women's shelters.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is the first comprehensive approach to \nfighting all forms of violence against women. The law made a \nsubstantial commitment of Federal funds over a 6-year period to combat \nfamily violence and sexual assault. The commitment we made sends \nresources and support to those devoted to responding to and preventing \nviolence against women.\n  I urge every Senator to support this amendment. Let us not go back on \nour promises made to the women of this country.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Biden's \namendment to restore full funding for the Violence Against Women Act.\n  This amendment would restore $76 million to programs in the Violence \nAgainst Women Act--training for police, prosecutors, and victims \nadvocates to target family violence and rape; programs to reduce sexual \nabuse and exploitation of young people; training for judges and \nprosecutors on victims of child abuse; training for state court judges \non rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence, and programs to address \ndomestic violence in rural areas.\n  Last year, $240 million was promised by Congress for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act [VAWA] programs for fiscal year 1996--$176.7 million \nfor VAWA programs administered by the Department of Justice, and $61.9 \nmillion for VAWA programs administered by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  All of this is funded out of $4.2 billion provided by the crime trust \nfund in 1996. Funding in the crime trust fund comes from eliminating \n123,000 federal jobs and cutting domestic discretionary spending. Full \nfunding of the Violence Against Women Programs has no effect on the \nbudget deficit and requires no new taxes. Now, I want my \n\n[[Page S 14510]]\ncolleagues to clearly understand what this all means. Last year, as a \ncountry we decided that addressing crime was a top priority. We decided \nthat savings from streamlining the Federal Government and cutting other \ndomestic programs would go to fight crime.\n  As a country we made a commitment to breaking the cycle of violence \nand see that a person's home is the safe place it should be. Last year, \nas part of the crime bill Congress passed the Violence Against Women \nAct, we made a bipartisan commitment to address domestic violence. But \nnow, only a year later, we are considering a bill to cut funding for \nthese programs.\n  I must, at the same time, commend my colleagues on the Appropriation \nSubcommittee on Labor/HHS for their efforts and wisdom in more than \nfully funding the Violence Against Women Act Program under their \njurisdiction.\n  But we must remember all the programs in the Violence Against Women \nAct are a package. Senator Biden and others worked for 5 years on this \npiece of legislation. All the pieces of it fit together. They all must \nbe in place for it to work effectively. For example, we can encourage \narrests by police officers but if they are not properly trained to \nunderstand the dynamics of domestic violence, an arrest could make the \nsituation more explosive. Likewise, if more batterers are being \narrested but judges are not trained to understand or take domestic \nviolence seriously batterers are likely to go free or charged with \nlesser offenses.\n\n  Violence Against Women Act programs must be fully funded. Anything \nless would result in a betrayal of the bipartisan promise Congress \nmade. Domestic violence should be a priority for national crime-\nfighting efforts. But without adequate funding we cannot address this \nserious problem.\n  We know all too well that it is the violence in the home that seeps \nout into our streets. If we do not stop the violence in the home we \nwill never stop it in the streets. We knew this when we passed the \ncrime bill last year and it is still true today.\n  Domestic violence is one of the most serious issues we face. It knows \nno boarders. Neither race, gender, geographic or economic status \nshields someone from domestic violence. As a matter of fact, next week \nmy wife Sheila and I are sponsoring the display of 50 photographs by \nDonna Ferrato, an award winning photojournalist. These photographs \nprovide powerful and graphic evidence of this crisis, and I invite my \ncolleagues to view them, I am only disappointed that these photos could \nnot be displayed while we debate this issue.\n  Mr. President, nationwide, every 15 seconds a woman is beaten by a \nhusband or boyfriend, over 4,000 women are killed every year by their \nabuser, and every 6 minutes a woman is forcibly raped.\n  We know that the majority, 70 percent, of men who batter women also \nbatter their children. Or children may be injured during an incident of \nparental battery. We also know that 25-45 percent of all women who are \nbattered are battered during pregnancy. Battering during pregnancy is \nthe most common cause of birth defects.\n  Children are also scarred emotionally by witnessing the abuse of \ntheir mothers. They are traumatized by fear for their mother and their \nown helplessness in protecting her. They may blame themselves for not \npreventing the violence or even for causing it. This can manifest \nitself in aggression, sleeping disorders, or withdrawal.\n  When a woman and her children are struggling to leave violent homes, \nthey face many barriers. Many people ask why she does not leave? Often \nthe response to this question is merely another question: why does he \nbeat her? I feel that particular response ignores the realities of \nwomen's lives. One reason women do not leave is fear. If she leaves, he \nwill find her and kill her. Batterers often threaten to harm or take \nthe children away to force her to stay. Leaving him never guarantees \nsafety for a woman or her children. In almost three-quarters of \nreported spouse assaults, the victim was divorced or separated at the \ntime of the attack.\n  Women are also dependent on the abusers for financial reasons. If \nthey decide to leave, often they can not afford housing or food for \nthemselves and children.\n  Abusers also play on emotions to trap victims into staying. He will \nthreaten to kill himself. This plays on many victims desires not for \nthe marriage to end, just the violence.\n  Domestic violence is a community issue. It is no longer an issue for \nwomen; it is an issue for all women, men, and children. Communities \nneed to work together. It was the Violence Against Women Act that was \nintended not only to strengthen the laws concerning general violence, \nit was to provide some of the necessary resources to communities to \naddress the violence in their own communities.\n  It was intended to help law enforcement officers to make responsible \narrests and understand the dynamics of domestic violence--to learn not \nask her what she did to make him mad. It was to help train judges to \ntreat domestic violence as a crime and hold the abusers accountable for \nthe violence.\n  How ironic it is that last year around this time we were celebrating \nthe passage of the Violence Against Women Act. We were celebrating \nbecause, finally, the Federal Government had taken a very bold step to \nmake the protection of women in their homes a top priority for this \nNation. And now, 2 days before the beginning of Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month we are considering a bill that cuts the funding for \nthese important programs.\n  As I travel and meet more and more women and children who are victims \nof domestic violence, I become even more outraged that a woman's home \ncan be the most dangerous, violent, or deadly place she can be; if she \nis a mother, the same is true for her children. It was with the passage \nof the Violence Against Women Act that Congress said loudly and clearly \nit is time to stop the cycle of violence, it is time to make homes safe \nagain, and it is time to help communities across the country deal with \nthis crisis. Without full funding, Congress will turn its back on women \nand their families. And it will turn its back on communities that are \nstruggling to deal with increasing crime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would first like to thank my colleague \nfrom Delaware, Senator Biden, for crafting and offering this amendment \nas well as my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak to you today not just as a U.S. \nSenator, or a citizen of Maine, or even as a Republican. I want to \nspeak to you as a woman, and I want to speak to you on behalf of the \n135 million women of America about an issue that has more likely than \nnot touched each of our lives at some point in time.\n  Let me just say that it is not an uncommon occurrence in Congress for \neither Chamber to authorize funding for a particular program but not to \nfully fund that program at the authorized levels. It happens often, \nand, in some circumstances, there may be justifiable reasons to take \nsuch a course of action.\n  By not fully funding some wasteful programs, we might even save the \ntaxpayers of America some of their hard earned tax dollars and use them \ntowards programs that work and that make a difference in the daily \nlives of America's families.\n  But I think it would come as a great surprise to many Americans--\nespecially to those 135 million women--to know that a program such as \nthe Violence Against Women Act, which was passed as part of last year's \ncrime bill in Congress, has not yet been fully funded.\n  Now, I think it is safe to say that the Violence Against Women Act is \none program that deserves its full funding. It is not wasteful. It is \nnot unnecessary. It is not--and should not be--a target of waste \nwatchers. And it is not to be overlooked. But it has been.\n  Fortunately, today, we have an opportunity to correct this oversight.\n  For those who may be wary of its funding--or who may doubt its \nnecessity in this era of penny-pinching and budget scrutiny--let me \njust take a moment to paint a picture of life in America's streets and \nhomes for some women.\n  It is a picture where more than 2.5 million women annually are \nvictims of violent crimes.\n  It is a picture where an estimated 5,000 women are beaten to death \neach year. \n\n[[Page S 14511]]\n\n  It is a picture where in the 1990's, one out of every eight women \nhave been the victim of a forcible rape.\n  It is a picture where every 15 seconds in America, a woman is \nbattered--and where every 6 minutes, a woman is raped.\n  It is a picture where, between 1989 and 1993, the number of known \nrape offenses increased by 11 percent--despite more awareness of \nviolence against women.\n  It is a picture where a woman in our country is more likely to be \nassaulted, injured, raped, or killed by a male partner than by any \nother assailant.\n  It is a picture where at least a third of all female emergency room \npatients are battered women, while a third of all homeless women and \nchildren are without shelter because they are fleeing domestic \nviolence.\n  And the litany of tragedy and violence goes on to paint an even \nfuller, starker, and more disheartening picture.\n  This is an issue about a woman's safety, a woman's rights, and our \nability as a nation to protect those inalienable rights as guaranteed \nunder the Constitution.\n  But how can we defend a woman's right to ``life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness'' when we cannot protect her from ``rape, battery, \nand the onslaught of violence.''\n  Mr. President, the Violence Against Women Act is a critical tool in \nour fight to combat domestic violence across America. It is an \nessential bill for our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, our \nrelatives, our friends, and our coworkers.\n  It contains provisions that enhance penalties for sex offenders; \nprovides grants to States to improve law enforcement, prosecution, and \nvictims services in cases of violent crimes against women; authorizes \nover $200 million for rape prevention and education programs; provides \nfunds for the creation of a national domestic violence hotline as well \nas battered women's shelters; and does much more.\n  These provisions will help become a shield for women and deliver \njustice to victims of hateful and brutal assaults. Already, within the \npast year, two individuals have been imprisoned for life terms under \nthis act for beating their spouses or girlfriends.\n  While I will be the first to say that violence knows no gender \nbarriers and is clearly a threat to both men and women alike, no one \ncan turn a blind eye to the fact that women are especially to be found \nin the scope of danger and crime.\n  Consider that women are six times--6 times--more likely than men to \nexperience violence committed by an intimate. Consider that women and \ngirls are victimized by relatives at four times the rate of males. And \nconsider that an astounding 95 percent of violence victims are, in \nfact, women.\n  But the men of America have a stake in this legislation as well, \nwhich is why the fight here on the floor has been joined by such men as \nSenators Biden and Hatch. Namely, the fathers, sons, and brothers of \nthe women of America who face the threat of violence each and every \nday. They deserve to know that the women who mean the most to them and \ntheir lives are safe on the streets of our cities.\n  It is for these reasons that I and 29 of my Senate colleagues \nrequested that we fully fund the Violence Against Women Act in an \nAugust 9 letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  The Violence Against Women Act should be fully funded as it is \nsupposed to be fully paid for out of the crime trust fund that Congress \ncreated last year. But the bill before us does not provide for it. \nRather, the moneys within the crime trust fund have been what they call \n``re-prioritized,'' which in English means that the Violence Against \nWomen Act has been short-changed to the tune of about $75 million.\n  In fiscal year 1995, total funding for this program was $26 million. \nThe House Appropriations Committee appropriated $125 million for the \nprogram for fiscal year 1996, and the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee funded $100 million--a threefold increase over current \nfunding, but still far short--woefully short--of what American women \nneed and deserve to combat violence and domestic abuse.\n  Today, we are proposing a remedy to meet this crisis of funding head-\non.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Delaware and the Senator \nfrom Texas provides the additional $75 million needed to fully fund the \nViolence Against Women Act.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that--as a former Cochair of \nthe Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues--I understand and know \nfirst-hand the importance of making women's health and women's safety a \npriority for Congress, because we must speak out for the 135 million \nwomen and girls of America.\n  We cannot let them down. We can no longer treat the Violence Against \nWomen Act as a political football and simply fumble away women's needs \nand concerns.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Biden-Gramm amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I was taught by a fellow from South \nCarolina when I first got here 23 years ago that when you won, sit \ndown. I mean, we won in the sense that everyone wins here. Women of \nAmerica win.\n  I would like to ask unanimous consent--I will be very brief--that the \nfollowing Senators be also added as original cosponsors: Senator \nInouye, Senator Akaka, Senator Kohl, Senator Leahy, Senator Harkin, and \nSenator Santorum, the Presiding Officer, from Pennsylvania.\n  Let me just say in closing, and then I will ask for the yeas and nays \nat that point, that there are certain facts people should keep in mind. \nI think of all the facts that affect women in this Nation as a \nconsequence of violence, the thing that surprises me, that surprises \nmost Americans most often are the following:\n  That family violence is the No. 1 cause of injury to adult women in \nAmerica--No. 1, No. 1--not breast cancer, not heart attacks, not \nstrokes. The No. 1 cause of injury to women in America is family \nviolence, in almost every instance the fist of a man, supposedly \nsomeone who loves them.\n  The second point that people should keep in mind and why this is so \nimportant: Every 18 seconds a woman is beaten by her spouse, boyfriend, \nor other intimate partner in the United States, making the home the \nmost dangerous place in the world to live for being a women in a \ndemocracy. As many as 35 percent of all the women who will visit an \nemergency room in any of our cities tonight, one-third of all the women \nwho will walk into an emergency room in Washington, DC; Wilmington, DE; \nBoston, MA; Butte, MT, one-third of them tonight who walk in will be \nthere as a consequence of the fist of a man. They will be there because \na man has injured them.\n  Three million children a year witness family violence in their homes. \nAnd as a consequence, the statistics are overwhelming. I will not bore \nyou, but those children significantly have a greater likelihood of \ndropping out of school, becoming alcohol and drug abusers. They are the \nhighest percentage of suicide attempts, and, most frightening of all, \nthey become abusers--abusers. They become the abusers.\n  So, for these and 1,000 other reasons we could all speak to, I think \nthis is a very, very important error we are correcting in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we are going to decide to stack \nvotes. So what I would like to do, unless someone else wants to speak \non this amendment, is to suggest the absence of a quorum until we can \ndecide if we are going to do that, in which case we would simply make \nthis the first vote when we do the stacked votes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator suggests the absence of \na quorum, I want to make it clear it is perfectly fine with me whatever \nway the Senator wishes to proceed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask if it would be permissible then to \nproceed \n\n[[Page S 14512]]\nsimply to speak on some issues with respect to the crime bill instead \nof putting in a quorum call.\n  I know, Mr. President, that discussions are going on now. We are \nnegotiating, and Senator Biden is representing our side, with respect \nto the issue of cops, police. I would like to talk for a few minutes, \nif I may, Mr. President, about this issue of cops. It is one that I \nhave been deeply involved in and concerned about for all the time I \nhave been in the Senate. And in the last few years we finally have been \nable to elicit a response to try to meet one of the great needs of the \ncountry.\n  There is not one of us who has not been touched at one time or \nanother in one way or another and sometimes very personally. I remember \nlistening to the Senator from North Dakota in his own personal tale of \nwhat happened to his wife right here over on Capitol Hill. There are \ndozens of other examples. We have had a Senator randomly shot in the \npast here in Washington. We have had countless citizens in this city \nright around us shot. It is a war zone. It is the murder capital of the \ncountry. And it ought to have set a better example for what response \nshould have been from the U.S. Congress.\n  Such a random act of violence occurred just a couple days ago in \nMassachusetts to a young prosecutor, Assistant Attorney General Paul \nMcLaughlin, the son of a friend of mine, former Lieutenant Governor and \nU.S. attorney. But this young assistant attorney general, himself \ninvolved in working to fight the problem of gang warfare and gang \ncriminal activity, was simply gunned down going to his car coming home \nin the evening after his normal 12-hour day in a prosecutor's office. A \nhooded young person walked up and blew him away.\n  I talked this afternoon with his father. And there is no way to \nexpress the sorrow that he and his family feel and no way for us to \nexpress our sorrow on their behalf.\n  But I can say, Mr. President, with clarity that what the State and \nlocal entities have been doing over the course of the past years and \nthe Federal response to that is truly unconscionable because we have \nliterally been disarming in the face of an increasing threat on an \nannual basis, a threat that is measurable. And all of us have come to \nunderstand, I hope finally, that nothing is more important in terms of \nreally fighting crime than to put police officers on the streets of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I have quoted the statistics before, but somehow they \ndo not always seem to break through. But 15 years ago in this country \nwe had 3.5 police officers per violent crime. Today we have, depending \non the statistics, a range of 3.5 to 4.6 violent crimes per police \nofficer. You can go into any of the major criminal activity communities \nin this country and you will find they are operating with less police \ntoday with a greater threat than they were 10 or 15 years ago with a \nlesser threat.\n  Ask anyone in those communities about the relationship between the \ncommunity and police. By and large the police come in, they drive \nthrough in a cruiser, they are gone. People do not know them. It is a \nsign of transient authority, not the sign of a present authority that \nmakes an impact on people's lives. The word ``cop'' came from the \nBritish concept of ``constable on patrol.'' And it meant on patrol on \nfoot, walking within a community. We used to do that in America. That \nwas the nature of policing originally. The police officer knew the \ncommunity, the people knew the police officer. There was a relationship \nwith the police officer. The police officer was a role model. So, \nindeed, criminal activity rarely took place right under the nose of a \npolice officer on patrol.\n  Now, in recent days, we have sent a message to people in this country \nthat most crimes are very difficult to trace, very difficult to make \narrests. In fact, one of the most startling statistics that I have come \nacross is the fact that out of the 200,000 murders that occurred in \nthis country in the last decade, fully 100,000 of them were murders \nthat occurred by total strangers. Americans are being killed, not, as \nthe FBI once told us, in these family disputes or lovers' quarrels, but \nthey are being murdered randomly by people they have never seen and \nnever met. And what is more frightening is fully two-fifths of those \nmurders are committed by people who will never walk through the \nthreshold of a police station or a courthouse.\n  Fully two-fifths of the murderers in America will never even come to \njustice. And 100,000 of our citizens in the last decade were gunned \ndown by utter strangers. So when people say, well, violent crime is \ngoing down in America because there were 200 murders in your city last \nyear and this year there were only 190, how are you supposed to feel \nsafer? What greater safety is there in knowing that instead of 200 \nmurders, 190 of your citizens were blown away?\n  Mr. President, 100,000 police officers is an inadequate response. I \nsay to my colleagues today that 100,000 police officers is an \ninadequate response. And what is really bizarre in this new equation we \nare debating in Washington, the two greatest public crises in America \ntoday--education and public safety--are already today 100 percent and \n95 percent controlled at the local level.\n  So here we are with an implosion of capacity to resolve these \nproblems at the local level, and we are busy saying we are going to \nsend back to the local level more responsibility with less resources. \nIf that does not underscore the need for more than the 100,000 police \nofficers, I do not know what does. Here we are, for the first time in \nAmerican history the Federal Government is paying for local police \nofficers.\n  Now, I hear some people around the country say, ``What a fakery. You \nare only going to provide 20,000 police officers because you are not \npaying for the whole thing.'' Since when was it the responsibility of \nthe Federal Government to pay for the whole thing? Every time we have \nhad a Federal grant program, it would be with a matching grant where we \nhave required 75 percent, 90 percent, or some percentage. Sometime we \ncontinued the 90 percent-10 percent relationship for 10 years, 15 \nyears.\n  In this particular case, we have decided that this is a sufficient \nnational crisis that we want to ask the local communities and the \nStates to accept what is already their responsibility--to put police \nofficers on the street. We did not say we want to put floodlights on \nthe jail, we want to put computers in the station, we want new cruisers \non the road. We want to put police officers on the streets of this \ncountry because that is what we need to begin to regain and take back \ncontrol over our communities and our streets.\n  Mr. President, in recent weeks and months, I have toured a lot of \nMassachusetts and gone into the communities that, because of our \neffort, have community policing. I can tell you about Northhampton, MA. \nI can tell you about Gardner, Saugus, Lynn, about a host of areas, such \nas Boston and Lowell, where they now have community policing, and where \nthey have been able to put it into effect and literally reclaim the \ncommunity.\n  I was in a housing project where you now have community police \nofficers on bicycles who ride around through the entire community, who \nwalk around and play with the kids, who started basketball with the \nkids. The kids run up to them when they come into the area, instead of \nrunning away from them, which is what they used to do. These officers \nhave helped literally to give that community hope.\n  In Lowell, on Bridge Street in Somerville, as recently as a couple of \nyears ago, druggies and prostitutes had taken over the street. Citizens \nwere afraid to come out of their homes in the street because of the \nvermin that were in the street. I talked to storeowners who said that \nas a result of those druggies and prostitutes, their earnings have gone \ndown and people would not come into the store anymore. Lo and behold, \nwith a grant from the Federal Government, we opened a small storefront \nand police officers went in; they are there all the time. The druggies \nare gone, the prostitutes are gone, the community has been reclaimed, \nand it is coming back to life.\n  Mr. President, in addition to that, the police officers have been \nable to intervene before crimes are committed. They have been able to \nget to know people, to know who the troublemaker is, who identify who \nbelongs in the community, to be able to make determinations about who \nthey need to watch more closely, who needs help. By virtue of their \nintercessions, they have literally directed people into various human \nservice treatment facilities or \n\n[[Page S 14513]]\nfunctions where those people left to their own devices might well have \npulled out a knife, a gun, or been one of the people in the statistics \nthat the Senator from Delaware talked about earlier.\n  So, Mr. President, it works. It is working in America. Countless \npeople have said, ``You are not going to put more than 5,000 police on \nthe street within a year. You are not going to put 15,000; you are \nnever going to get to 20,000.'' Well, more than 25,000 new police \nofficers, additional police officers, are already on the streets. It is \nbecause of the effort of this legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, it is my profound hope that in the next hour, or \nmoments ahead, we will succeed in working out an agreement with the \nSenator from Texas to be able to put back into this bill the original \nconcept of the community policing.\n  Block grants work in some cases. I am not against block grants. I \nhave voted for them. But in this particular case, we have tried to \ntarget a particular national emergency and need, and we have tried to \ndo it in a way that is administratively inexpensive. In fact, it is \nless expensive to implement the direct justice grant program of the \ncrime bill with a cost of about 0.8 of a percent administratively than \nto administer the 2.5- to 3-percent administrative costs that will go \nwith a block grant.\n  Moreover, under the block grant, there is absolutely no guarantee \nwhatsoever that police officers will get to the street rather than the \nfloodlights to the jails or the new cruisers to the station, or the new \ncomputer. And that is not to say those things are not important. It is \nnot to say that people do not have a right to ask for those things and \nthat they do not need them. But when 95 percent of the crime is a local \njurisdiction, and the Federal Government is singling out a particular \nneed and the particular emergency, we have a right to expect that that \nemergency is going to be met. And if one community does not need those \npolice, Mr. President, I guarantee you there are 10 other communities \nin America that will gladly use the money to put police on the streets \nand make their citizens safer.\n  So, again, it is my hope that we will succeed in doing what we have \nalready done, what we voted for in an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nfashion. I hope that will not be undone in this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, unless someone suggests otherwise or to the \ncontrary, I believe that the debate on the pending amendment No. 2815 \nis completed. A rollcall vote has been asked for by Senator Biden.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on amendment No. 2815 \nat 9 p.m. this evening, and that that amendment be temporarily laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator from Arizona who has an inquiry \nto make.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes to propose an amendment, at which time the \namendment be set aside for the purposes of the Senator from New Mexico \nto propose an amendment, and I ask that at least 20 minutes be reserved \nafter the disposition of the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico \nthat 20 minutes be allocated to the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], \nand 10 minutes for the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2816\n\n       (Purpose: To Ensure competitive Bidding for DBS Spectrum)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  I want to thank my friend from New Mexico for allowing me to propose \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] for himself and Mr. \n     Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 2816.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the Pending Committee Amendment, insert the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . COMPETITIVE BIDDING FOR ASSIGNMENT OF DBS LICENSES.\n\n       No funds provided in this or any other Act shall be \n     expended to take any action regarding the applications that \n     bear Federal Communications Commission File Numbers DBS-94-\n     11EXT, DBS-94-15ACP, and DBS-94-16MP; Provided further, that \n     funds shall be made available for any action taken by the \n     Federal Communications Commission to use the competitive \n     bidding process prescribed in Section 309(j) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. Sec. 309(j)) regarding \n     the disposition of the 27 channels at 110 deg. W.L. orbital \n     location.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment, sponsored by Senator \nDorgan and myself, would mandate that the FCC auction the one remaining \nblock of DBS spectrum which it holds.\n  Currently, the FCC is considering how to dispose of the 27 channels \nat 110 deg. west longitude orbital location. If this spectrum is \nauctioned, industry experts state that it will sell for between $300 to \n$700 million. The alternative that is being considered by the FCC would \ncall for the American people to receive much less valuable spectrum and \n$5 million dollars. Clearly, it is in the best interest of the American \npeople that this spectrum be sold at public auction.\n  Mr. President, I want to state at the outset I have no interest in \nany of the companies involved in this issue. None of them to my \nknowledge is represented in my State. I do know that the company that \nseeks to acquire this for $5 million is the largest cable company in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, the spectrum is a finite public resource. It is owned \nby the American people. And it may prove to be the single most valuable \nresource held by the public. In recognition of that fact, in 1993, the \nCongress mandate the first auctions of the spectrum. The still-in-\nprocess wireless telecommunications auction has generated a staggering \n$8 billion dollars and the auctions are only half completed.\n  This amendment recognizes the value of the spectrum and our duty as \npeople's trustees to handle the spectrum in a manner that most benefits \nall the American people.\n  Mr. President, this amendment ensures that the American people \nbenefit from the sale of this spectrum.\n  The amendment does not choose winners or losers. It does not allow \nACC, the corporation that sat on this spectrum for 10 years and did \nnothing to make a profit.\n  The amendment does not change the rules in the middle of the game. \nACC never owned this spectrum, it received a license under certain \nterms--terms it never lived up to. The FCC therefore correctly withdrew \nACC's license and permission for it to construct a DBS system.\n  Most importantly for consumers, this amendment will not prevent new \nservice from being offered to the general public, including service to \nthose who live in Alaska and Hawaii. Those living in rural areas are \nalso not adversely effected in any way by this amendment and the I want \nto note that the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association \nstrongly supports this amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me lay out the facts surrounding this specific \nblock of spectrum.\n\n  In 1984, the FCC divided a segment of the spectrum to be used for the \nbroadcast of direct broadcast satellite [DBS] services. Under the terms \nof the agreement, spectrum would be allocated to the companies at no \ncharge and in return, the companies would proceed diligently toward the \nconstruction of a DBS system.\n  Of all the spectrum allocated, only 3 blocks of spectrum--located at \n101 deg., 110 deg., and 119 deg.--cover the entire continental United \nStates. These blocks are known as full-conus blocks and our considered \nby industry experts to have the highest dollar value.\n\n[[Page S 14514]]\n\n  DirecTV and Echostar were given two of the coast-to-coast U.S. blocks \nof spectrum.\n  Advanced Communications Corporation [ACC] was given the third full \nconus block, which consisted of 16 channels, and was granted approval \nto begin construction of a DBS satellite service at 110 deg. west \nlongitude. ACC paid nothing for the sole use of this spectrum.\n  In November 1991, the FCC altered its spectrum allocation scheme and \ngave ACC at total of 27 channels at 110 deg. W.L., making the block \neven more valuable.\n  DirecTV is currently up and running and available to the consumer. \nEchostar is expected to be operational earlier next year.\n  During this time, ACC was repeatedly warned by the FCC that it was \nnot acting in compliance with the due diligence standard.\n  In the summer of 1994, due to congressional mandate, the FCC began \nthe process of auctioning spectrum. The PCS spectrum auction, which is \nnow about half complete, has generated approximately $8 billion for the \nTreasury and the American people.\n  On September 16, 1995, ACC entered into an agreement with TCI to sell \nits spectrum to TCI for $45 million. Such a sale would have meant that \nACC would actually have profited from warehousing spectrum for 10 \nyears.\n  Only 3 months later, in December 1994, ACC applies for a second \nextension of its construction permit.\n  The International Bureau of the FCC determined that ACC had not \nproceeded with due diligence and issued an order on April 26, 1995 that \nconcludes ``Advanced [Communications Corporation] must now return the \npublic resources it holds to the public so that these resources can be \nput to use by others.'' This decision was based on the fact that up \nuntil 3 months before ACC applied for the extension it had done nothing \nby warehouse the spectrum.\n  The bureau felt compelled to use a new, tougher definition of due \ndiligence due to the congressional mandate regarding spectrum auctions.\n  After the International Bureau decision, the full Commission began \nconsideration of a plan to allow TCI to give up some of its allocated \nDBS spectrum and in return receive the ACC spectrum at a cost of $5 \nmillion. This $5 million is to pay for costs incurred by ACC. The \nspectrum being given up by TCI is valued at a substantially lesser \nvalue than the ACC spectrum. TCI would give up 11 channels at 119 deg. \nand spectrum that allows DBS service to be provided to Latin America, \nthe Pacific rim and China. No industry experts believe at this time \nthat those markets will be nearly as lucrative as the U.S. market. It \ncould be decades if not longer before the spectrum TCI offered up would \nbe worth the value of the full conus U.S. spectrum.\n  Mr. President, the FCC is at a standstill regarding this issue. It is \nlooking to the Congress for guidance. And I believe it is appropriate \nfor us to let the FCC know that the Senate believes that the spectrum \nshould be disposed in a manner that brings about the greatest amount of \nbenefit to the American people. Adoption of this amendment would ensure \nsuch an outcome.\n  Mr. President, let me clarify, this is not about helping one company \nor hurting another. It is not about determining winners or losers. It \nis about protecting the American people's interests. And faced with the \nstaggering debt we have left for our children, we must act in a manner \nthat ensures this spectrum is sold for the highest amount possible.\n  Further, if this spectrum is auctioned, any company, TCI, Hughes, a \ntelephone company, anyone, can bid for the spectrum. The auction alone \nwill determine who is the winner and loser. Not only is it the right \nthing to do, but it is the fairest thing.\n  There will be some issues raised I would like to address quickly.\n  First and foremost, I have nothing against TCI and have every reason \nto believe that it operates in an exemplary fashion. I said, this \namendment is not about TCI or any other company, it is about protecting \nthe people's interests.\n\n  TCI and its subsidiary Primestar have stated that they have spent \nconsiderable money on procuring two satellites and for a signal \ncompression facility.\n  First, TCI chose to purchase these two Space system/Loral DBS \nsatellites in 1990 for use by TEMPO, a cable consortium, for use at \nTCI's high-power DBS system located at 119 deg. west longitude.\n  In 1993, TEMPO asked the FCC to modify its DBS system and disclosed \nthat it had granted Primestar an option to acquire the same satellites \nto enable Primestar to operate with its own DTH system in the fixed \nservice satellite high-power density arc. This is different from where \nmost DBS satellites are located.\n  At this point the same two satellites had been proposed to be used in \ntwo different locations.\n  Now Primestar distributors are circulating a memo that states that if \nthe ACC deal does not go through, that TCI has other options for \nsatellite deployment.\n  Mr. President, we must put aside corporate interests and think about \nwhat action will best serve the American people. In this case, I think \nthere can be no doubt that the public will benefit most from auctioning \nthis spectrum.\n  Mr. President, the Citizens Against Government Waste, Consumer \nFederation of America, the National Taxpayers Union, and the National \nRural Telecommunications Cooperative have all sent letters in support \nof this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Council for Citizens Against\n\n\n                                             Government Waste,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n       Dear Senator, The Council for Citizens Against Government \n     Waste (CCAGW) and our 600,000 members support H.R. 2076, the \n     Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations \n     for FY 1996. CCAGW commends Subcommittee Chairman Phil Gramm \n     and Appropriations Chairman Mark Hatfield for sending to the \n     floor a bill which spends $4.6 billion less than the budget \n     request and $1 billion less than the House version of H.R. \n     2076.\n       The $26.5 billion spending bill prioritizes the budgets for \n     each agency under its jurisdiction. For example, the Justice \n     Department receives $15 billion for FY 1996, almost $3 \n     billion more than in FY 1995, to fight our nation's crime \n     problem. But with a nearly $5 trillion national debt, there \n     is always more to cut from spending bills.\n       CCAGW supports the following amendments:\n       The McCain amendment to mandate the Federal Communications \n     Commission to auction the one remaining block of Direct \n     Broadcast System spectrum. If this spectrum is auctioned, \n     communication industry experts believe it will sell for \n     between $300 to $700 million. It is in the best interest of \n     the American people that the spectrum be sold at public \n     auction.\n       The Grams amendment to eliminate the East-West Center and \n     the North/South Center, saving taxpayers $11 million next \n     year.\n       CCAGW opposes the following amendments:\n       Any attempt to restore or increase funds to the Legal \n     Services Corporation.\n       The Inouye amendment to restore funds to the Federal \n     Maritime Administration.\n       The Bumpers amendment to restore funds for the Small \n     Business Administration.\n       The Bumpers amendment to restore funds to the Death Penalty \n     Resource Centers.\n       CCAGW urges you to support these amendments and H.R. 2076. \n     It prioritizes cuts while ensuring that state and local law \n     enforcement agencies are properly funded. CCAGW will consider \n     these votes for inclusion in our 1995 Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n                                                   Joe Winkelmann,\n     Chief Lobbyist.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Consumer Federation of America, Media Access Project, \n           Center for Media Education,\n                                               September 21, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain, we are writing to urge you to oppose \n     an amendment that may be offered to permit the FCC to \n     transfer the Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) license \n     currently held by Advanced Communications to the largest \n     cable television company in the world, TCI instead of \n     auctioning it off to the highest bidder. At the present time, \n     we are unsure who will offer this amendment. This amendment \n     would strike a serious blow to the development of competition \n     to the cable monopoly and shortchange the American public by \n     giving away a prime piece of scarce radio spectrum for a \n     fraction of its value.\n       The cable industry has been claiming for years that DBS \n     presents a serious competitive threat. While cable \n     competition has not yet arrived, DBS is a strong potential \n     competitor to cable. If given the license to use \n\n[[Page S 14515]]\n     this spectrum. TCI would turn around and lease it to Primestar \n     Partners, a consortium of the nation's largest cable \n     monopolists including TCI. Giving away what is perhaps the \n     single best part of the high powered DBS spectrum to the \n     largest cable monopoly is an entirely wrong-headed policy. It \n     is both anticompetitive and anti-consumer.\n       This proposed amendment would allow TCI and its cable \n     brethren to essentially jump ahead in line. There are a \n     number of non-cable parties who are interested in providing \n     DBS service to compete with cable that would be foreclosed \n     from using this prime slot because of this ``sweetheart'' \n     proposal.\n       In direct contrast, Sens. McCain and Dorgan have circulated \n     an amendment which would auction this valuable spectrum to \n     the highest bidder. This could raised hundreds of millions of \n     dollars for the national treasury and help insure greater \n     competition for cable in the process. It is this competition \n     which will protect consumers.\n       Don't slam the door to cable competition and don't reach \n     into consumers' pocket to enrich a group of the biggest \n     monopolists in America. We urge you to defeat the amendment \n     to transfer Advanced Communications's DBS license to TCI.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                 Bradley Stillman,\n                                   Consumer Federation of America.\n                                                        Gigi Sohn,\n                                             Media Access Project.\n                                                  Jeffrey Chester,\n     Center for media Education.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The 300,000-member National Taxpayers \n     Union (NTU) supports your amendment to require competitive \n     bidding for awarding the last block of Direct Broadcast \n     Satellite (DBS) spectrum held by the Federal Communications \n     Commission.\n       National Taxpayers Union has long supported privatization \n     of many public assets. The onset of the Information Age has \n     created an extremely lucrative market for advanced \n     communications, in turn dramatically increasing the potential \n     value of the spectrum remaining under government control.\n       Given the economic potential of the communications sector, \n     Congress should rely on competitive bidding and other market \n     mechanisms to allocate federally owned spectrum. By providing \n     a competitive auction for DBS spectrum, your amendment will \n     ensure a fair market price for this property, not an \n     arbitrary settlement negotiated by bureaucrats and special \n     interests.\n       Previous spectrum auctions have benefited taxpayers and \n     have allowed dynamic new businesses to develop their cutting-\n     edge technologies. Charges and counter charges from \n     interested corporations aside, a competitive bidding process \n     is the best solution to establishing ownership at a fair \n     price for this DBS spectrum.\n       Enactment of your amendment would allow the market to \n     decide the price for this resource. Many members of the 104th \n     Congress have resolved to end business as usual in \n     Washington, and allow market forces to have a greater impact \n     on government policy. They have the perfect opportunity to \n     demonstrate their resolve by supporting your amendment to \n     auction DBS spectrum.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Keating,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                The National Rural\n\n\n                               Telecommunications Cooperative,\n\n                                  Herndon, VA, September 14, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to let you know that the \n     National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative (NRTC) and its \n     rural electric and rural telephone system members nationally \n     are alarmed about a pending action by the Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC) which would allow the \n     nation's largest cable operators to undermine satellite \n     communications as a true competitor to cable.\n       Today, NRTC and its rural utility system members are \n     actively providing digital satellite service to more than \n     200,000 rural consumers living outside of and within cable \n     service areas. Our ability to do so comes through a major \n     investment in Hughes Electronic's DIRECTV which gave us the \n     right to bring digital satellite services to rural Americans.\n       Today, our rural utility systems provide more than 150 \n     channels of digitally transmitted satellite programming \n     service to consumers who look to them for new services and \n     products. Today, we lease, rent and sell Digital Satellite \n     Systems and we are providing local service and support to a \n     rural subscriber base that grows by more than 1000 new \n     customers a day. And we are doing so in competition currently \n     with PrimeStar and are aware that next year we will have an \n     additional competitor--DBS licensee, EchoStar.\n       We are very concerned that the FCC will give the PrimeStar \n     partnership, led by majority owner TCI/Tempo, a DBS license \n     that had been ``warehoused'' by Advanced Communications \n     Corporation (ACC) for 10 years. As we understand, not only \n     will the FCC give the license away, it appears it will do so \n     without opening this unused spectrum to a competitive bidding \n     process. An FCC give-away of DBS frequencies which are \n     conservatively valued at more than $300 million, will \n     seriously hamper competition inside and outside cabled areas. \n     Further, it will do nothing to decrease the nation's budget \n     deficit while rewarding a company that sat on its DBS license \n     and did nothing to provide service to consumers.\n       NRTC is in full support of your proposed amendment to H.R. \n     2076, the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary \n     Appropriations bill. It is the proper response to heavy-\n     handed efforts by an entrenched industry interested in \n     controlling competition and free-market access to \n     telecommunications services. NRTC has previously endorsed \n     auctioning all the DBS spectrum involved in this FCC \n     proceeding in a letter to the FCC.\n       Thank you for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Phillips,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Also, interestingly, I have received numerous letters \nfrom small cable companies and electric cooperatives all over America.\n  The Williams Cable Services in Phoenix, AZ; Eastern Illinois Electric \nCooperative; the Little OCMUCLG Service in Georgia; Agate Mutual \nTelephone Co. in Colorado; the Volcano Vision Co. in Pine Grove, CA; \nOklahoma Telephone Co., Davenport, OK; Turner Vision in Bluefield, WV; \nKansas DBS, Flint Hills Rural Development Corp.; South Alabama Electric \nCooperative, Adams Telephone Co., and others who are all in favor of \ngiving the American taxpayers $300 to $700 million and make this a \ncompetitive process.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the distinguished Senator has time, let me ask a \nquestion to be sure I have this. Back when we used to give spectrum \naway, we gave spectrum to a company that took it on the agreement that \nthey would use it, that they would initiate construction, that they \nwould begin to broadcast on that signal.\n  The date that they agreed to is now past; is that right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Long past, yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Now, having gotten the spectrum free and having gotten it \nfor a specific purpose free, the date by which it had to be utilized is \npast, and now they are asking permission to sell it for $5 million, if \nI heard the Senator correctly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes, if the Senator will so yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So their time for using the spectrum having expired, they \nare now proposing to sell it for $5 million. But, if I heard the \nSenator right, if we asserted the right of the taxpayer to have the \nspectrum back, since the user has not fulfilled its end of the \ncontract, we could sell that spectrum for how much money?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my friend, first of all, they were going \nto sell it to TCI for $45 million instead of $5 million, and they were \nawarded this license in 1984. Mr. President, 10 years later, in 1994, \nthey had still not done a single thing in order to comply with the \npurposes of the license, in other words set up a DBS system.\n  The estimates are between $300 and $700 million would be the price of \nthis spectrum at an auction. There are several major competitors.\n  The reason why there is such a huge spread, between $300 million and \n$700 million, is because the amounts we have already received from \nspectrum auctions have doubled the original estimates that we received \nfrom other spectrum auctions.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So the request is, having not fulfilled their commitment \nto the taxpayer, they want the right to sell it to somebody for $45 \nmillion, when, if we exercised the contract on behalf of the taxpayers \nand took it back, we would get between $300 and $700 million--million?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Million.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Between $300 and $700 million for it. In essence, the \nSenator's amendment is trying to protect the taxpayer from losing a \nminimum of a quarter of a billion dollars by simply enforcing our end \nof the contract?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my colleague in response, he is correct. \nThat is why the Citizens Against Government Waste, the Consumer \nFederation, National Taxpayers Union, and others \n\n[[Page S 14516]]\nare all in favor of this amendment, because of the enormous benefit, of \n$700 million.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. My friend from New Mexico was kind enough to yield time \nto me. I will be reluctant to use over that time because he has an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The time of the Senator from \nArizona has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no objection if they want to use \nsome additional time.\n  How much time would the Senator like, Senator McCain, another 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Montana wanted to speak.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent I have 1 minute just to ask a \nquestion in response, because I think it is important this body \nunderstand this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I listen to you frequently and you need 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. I need 2 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BURNS. I may need more than that. I think it is important for \nthis body to understand that the spectrum has already been reclaimed \nand is owned now by the FCC. It is available for sale. Is that not \ncorrect, I will ask my friend from Arizona?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct. But the contract that was entered into 3 \nmonths before the license was revoked is still a pending item before \nthe FCC.\n  Advanced had over 10 years, including one 4-year extension, in which \nto construct and launch its DBS system. It failed to do so. It failed \nto meet the Commission's due diligence rules, imposed a decade go to \nensure the public received prompt service therefor, if the channels \nhave gone unused. Only by enforcing the progress requirements of the \nCommission's rules can we ensure that allocated resources will be \nefficiently and expeditiously put into productive use.\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate that. The only reason I ask the question is I \nthink we should be very sure of our grounds here. Who actually owns \nthat spectrum? Is it still in the hands of the original winner in the \nlottery? Or is it owned by the FCC? I think that is a question we \nshould ask before we consider this amendment. I am just trying to \nclarify that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me try to clarify it one more time. Because the \ncompany did not exercise due diligence over 10 years, the FCC reclaimed \nit. Now it is up to the FCC as to how they want to dispose of it.\n  Mr. BURNS. If the Senator is correct, then that clarifies my \nquestion. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator from Arizona yield? I ask unanimous \nconsent to have 2 minutes to ask the Senator from Arizona a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I will ask the Senator from Arizona, he has indicated his \namendment will have a positive revenue impact, save millions of \ndollars. Has the amendment been reviewed by the Congressional Budget \nOffice? And what is their estimate of how much money it raises?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It has been scored as zero because it does not change the \nbaseline. But I can tell my friend, it is patently obvious that if a \nspectrum is going to be auctioned off for somewhere between $300 \nmillion and $700 million, there is going to be an impact.\n  Mr. BROWN. The Senator has indicated--or the literature here \nindicated these channels may be available for auction. Let me ask, has \nthe Commission made a final ruling as to whether or not these are to be \nforfeited?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Commission has not and is looking for guidance from \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. BROWN. I might indicate what my sense of the amendment is. First \nof all, it does not raise anything because CBO has not looked at it. \nAnd, No. 2, it is disposing of property someone else ostensibly has a \ntitle to and the FCC has not cleared it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Brown is here. I do not know \nthat Senator McCain, accurately, Senator Brown, described the time you \nwould need. He suggested 10 minutes? Is that 10 for you and 10 for \nsomebody else?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggested, and I would like to modify it concerning the \ndesires of the Senator from Colorado, 20 minutes for the Senator from \nColorado and 10 minutes for the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. GRAMM. My colleague needs to get some time for himself. And 10 \nminutes for you.\n  Mr. BROWN. My understanding was the discussion involved some \nintermittent time so I might become familiar with the needs of the \nSenator from Arizona. My hope is the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico might go ahead. Obviously, I am agreeable to an appropriate \namount of time for the Senator from Arizona to respond to whatever is \nraised on the floor.\n  The time someone may wish, I would have no problem to work out \nsomething.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator McCain, I assume now from your vantage point \nfrom getting this up things are under control and I can proceed? You \nare all right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy and \npatience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I discussed with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas, the manager of the bill, and the Senator from New Mexico a \nunanimous-consent request I would like to offer; that I be allowed to \nset aside the pending business for 2 minutes, request the yeas and \nnays, and go back immediately to the business of the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2817\n\n   (Purpose: To decrease the amount of funding for Federal Bureau of \n Investigation construction and increase the amount of funding for the \n                  National Information Infrastructure)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, has a unanimous-consent request been \npropounded?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes. The Senator from Nebraska asked to have 1 minute to \npropose an amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Has that unanimous-consent request been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Parliamentary inquiry. This amendment will be, after he \npresents it, it will be set aside and be fully debatable at that point, \nis that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Leahy and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2817.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following: \n     ``The amounts made available to the Department of Justice in \n     Title I for administration and travel are reduced by \n     $19,200,000.''\n       On page 73, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n\n                   information infrastructure grants\n\n       For grants authorized by section 392 of the Communications \n     Act of 1934, as amended, $18,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended as authorized by section 391 of the Act, as \n     amended: Provided, That not to exceed $900,000 shall be \n     available for program administration and other support \n     activities as authorized by section 391 of the Act including \n     support of the Advisory Council on National Information \n     Infrastructure: Provided further, That of the funds \n     appropriated herein, not to exceed 5 percent may be available \n     for telecommunications research activities for projects \n     related directly to the development of a national information \n     infrastructure: Provided further, That notwithstanding \n\n[[Page S 14517]]\n     the requirements of section 392(a) and 392(c) of the Act, these funds \n     may be used for the planning and construction of \n     telecommunications networks for the provision of educational, \n     cultural, health care, public information, public safety, or \n     other social services: Provided further, That in reviewing \n     proposals for funding, the Telecommunications and Information \n     and Infrastructure Assistance Program (also known as the \n     National Information Infrastructure Program) shall add to the \n     factors taken into consideration the following: (1) the \n     extent to which the proposed project is consistent with State \n     plans and priorities for the deployment of the \n     telecommunications and information infrastructure and \n     services; and (2) the extent to which the applicant has \n     planned and coordinated the proposed project with other \n     telecommunications and information entities in the State.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. The amendment I offer on behalf of myself, Senators \nLeahy, and Lieberman, is a very straightforward amendment. It restores \n$18.9 million to telecommunications and information and infrastructure \nassistance programs.\n  This program has been highly successful with thousands of \napplications for this. It is a matching program to get at least 2 for 1 \nfor every dollar that goes out. It is community-based. Community-based \norganizations across the country have used this program to increase the \neducational effort in the telecommunications effort. It has created \njobs. It has created real advancement of understanding of how this \ntelecommunications revolution can produce benefits at the local level.\n  Mr. President, I understand that some of the objections have been \nraised to this program; talked about it being something that has not \nproven up. I urge my colleagues to look at not only the success we have \nbut the backlog coming up. We have enjoyed a tremendous success with \nthis program. It is not a program that is just throwing money out \nthere. It is a program that requires a match from the community level. \nIt is a program that empowers citizens at the local level to make \ndecisions about how they want to increase jobs and education in their \nown communities. It has a fully funded offset.\n  I hope that my colleagues will consider and support a program that \nwill create jobs, and will create more empowerment for the American \npeople at the local level.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we continue to have some problems in that \npeople are trying to find offsets for their amendments. It takes time \nto do that, and they discover that others have used the funds \navailable. It should be hard to spend money. So I am not complaining \nabout it. But to try to sort of bring some order to the process, I \nwould like to ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, Senator Brown, be recognized for up to 10 minutes to offer an \namendment; after the 10 minutes, that the amendment would be set aside \nand would be fully subject to debate or any other relevant motions.\n  Then the Senate would go back to a debate on the McCain amendment \nuntil that debate is completed. If a rollcall vote is asked for on the \nMcCain amendment, then it would be stacked after the rollcall vote, \ncurrently scheduled for 9 o'clock, is completed. At that point, Senator \nBiden would be recognized to offer his omnibus crime amendment. There \nwould be 2 hours of debate equally divided, which would get us to the 9 \no'clock hour, at which point we would have a vote on the pending \namendment. If there is a rollcall vote asked----\n  Mr. McCAIN. It has already been requested.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It has already been requested. We would have a vote on the \nMcCain amendment, and at that point the Biden amendment would still be \npending, and if the debate is completed, we would have that vote at \nthat point.\n  I propound that unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I hope not to object, but to be able to answer the \nMcCain amendment we need a little time, 10 minutes to explain that \namendment--if the Senator will put that in the unanimous consent, that \nwe have 10 minutes to explain it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If I could inquire of the manager, where does that leave \nthe Domenici amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Domenici amendment would then be brought up after the \nvotes had occurred beginning at 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, we were supposed to go after the \nMcCain amendment. Ours would not take a very long time, but I would \nlike to go before we had the 2 hours, if we can. Is it possible to do \nthat, I ask the managers of the bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I just ask that of the manager of the bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I say to the Senator, I \nhave a few inquiries. It is my amendment being set aside here.\n  Mr. President, let me ask Senator Gramm, there is an accommodation we \nare trying to make. I am now prepared to proceed with my amendment. I \ntold the Senator I had been working on it because it is complicated, \nand we did get switched signals in terms of the money we had available. \nBut I am prepared now. So I do not want to delay it the longest \npossible time. I wish to get it up soon. So when would the Senator from \nTexas be ready to discuss the Domenici amendment? Would the Senator be \nready at 8 o'clock?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be perfectly happy to have the Senator bring the \namendment up, offer it, lock in his offsets, if he has them, and I \nthink that is a legitimate concern. What I would like to do, given that \nwe had talked about having the debate on the Biden amendment begin at \n7, is, if the Senator offers the amendment now, to come back to it.\n  This is a very important amendment to me. I am strongly opposed to \nit. And I think it will be something that will be debated at some \nlength. Clearly, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has the \nright to the floor under the unanimous-consent request. So if he wants \nto exercise that now, he can. And perhaps we might look at the \nfollowing potential unanimous-consent request--that he would bring up \nthe amendment and debate it for up to 20 minutes. Then it would be set \naside. Senator Biden would be recognized to bring up his omnibus \namendment, 2 hours equally divided, and at that point we would have \nreached the hour of 9 o'clock and we will have the first vote. We at \nthat point could either go back to the McCain amendment and dispose of \nit or we could go back to the Domenici amendment and debate it. Either \nof those things I would be agreeable to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Texas and \nSenator Hollings, what I would prefer to do--and I ask a parliamentary \ninquiry. What is the agreed upon time for a vote tonight?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A vote has been ordered to occur at 9 p.m. \ntonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On which amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Biden amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be glad to accommodate anybody the chairman \nwants to accommodate, except I would like him to include in the \nunanimous-consent agreement that immediately after the first vote on \nthe Biden amendment, that Senator Domenici is \n\n[[Page S 14518]]\npermitted to offer his amendment; that it be debated in full, whatever \ntime that takes, and that it be voted on immediately following--it be \nthe next vote following the Biden vote. That gives the Senator plenty \nof time, Mr. President, for what he desires.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the distinguished Senator will yield, I have no \nobjection to what the Senator is doing, but it may well be that we \nmight have an extended debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And we might decide for some reason that we might want to \ngo ahead and consider other amendments intervening.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We might do that in due course.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So I am reluctant to lock us into voting on the Domenici \namendment next.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not ask for that. I said the next amendment we \nvote on would be the Domenici amendment. The Senator can have some \nother amendments he wants to bring up. Get unanimous consent for that. \nI think that is fair. I have been accommodating everyone.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from New Mexico agree to have a vote on \nmy amendment following the Biden amendment? The yeas and nays have \nalready been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The problem I have is I very much want to debate \ntonight the Domenici amendment. There are a lot of Senators who want to \ndebate it. Senator Gramm has a lot of people. I have been \naccommodating. The Senator's amendment will get voted on very soon but \nmine would precede that. I just ask that as a request.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would like to get an agreement that allows the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico bring up his amendment now, speak \non that amendment as long as he chooses to, then Senator Biden would be \nrecognized to offer his omnibus amendment, which is a crucial element \nto the completion of this bill, that there be 2 hours of debate equally \ndivided, that would get us somewhere close to 9. We would have the \npending vote. We would have the vote on the Biden amendment. Then the \nSenator's amendment would be the pending business and we would vote on \nit. And we would not vote on anything else until we voted on it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, all I \nwant to do--I do not want to put my amendment down and debate it for 10 \nor 15 minutes. Just change the request so that I bring mine up \nimmediately following the Biden amendment, and it is debated as long as \nnecessary and then you have a deal.\n  Mr. GRAMM. All right.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next amendment to be considered be \nthe Biden amendment; that there be 2 hours equally divided on that \namendment; that if a vote is ordered on that amendment, it occur \nimmediately after the pending amendment, which will be voted on at 9 \no'clock; that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico be recognized \nat that point to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, what does that do to the \nMcCain amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It will simply be pending and will be the order of \nbusiness when the Domenici amendment is disposed of.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Which is what I thought we had in mind when I permitted \nthe Senator to bring up his amendment. I think that is fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I permitted the Senator's amendment to \ncome up.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And we debated it and all we need to do is have a vote on \nit, it seems to me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is all right with me. Get him in, \ntoo. No more debate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask Senator Gramm, there will be no \namendments to the Biden amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am not in a position that I can commit to that, I say to \nthe Senator, because we have not checked on our side. We have not seen \nthe final form of the Biden amendment. What I am trying to do is just \nhave it considered. I assume there will not be--I assume we have the \nvotes, but we want to look at it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We cannot agree to the time limit.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There is not a time. We are just saying it will be debated \nbetween 7 and 9, and that if it is completed, that it would be the vote \nafter 9. If it is not, it would be pending.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. All right. Get it up.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I might \ninquire of the floor managers, I just came to the floor a few moments \nago, so I have not heard the colloquy. I want the managers of the bill \nto know that Senator Burns and I have an amendment concerning USPTA, \nand I just want to make sure that the terms of the unanimous consent \nwould not preclude us from having an opportunity to offer that \namendment and perhaps have a vote. We do not need to do it this \nevening. We can go tomorrow. I want to assure my colleague that I am \nwilling to cooperate and work with him. I do not know the terms of the \nagreement.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, nothing in this unanimous-\nconsent request would in any way limit the Senator's ability to offer \nhis amendment or any other amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Texas, I do not \nremember the word he used--how did he oppose my amendment? Perfectly? \nWhat was the word?\n  Mr. GRAMM. With righteous passion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say I oppose what he is for in terms of doing \naway with legal services with whatever passion he just described. So we \nknow it is all even.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I have a question, Mr. President. And I am sorry, I was \nnot in the Chamber. My question is, Mr. President, has the Senator from \nTexas propounded a unanimous-consent request and has that request been \naccepted at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I may pose a question, I have an \namendment that I would like to offer at some point. It can be done \ntonight, it can be done early in the morning, or any time. I am joined \nin that amendment by the distinguished Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe]. \nIt would be a sense-of-Congress resolution relative to the Economic \nDevelopment Administration. I am just wondering at what point or what \norder we could try to factor this particular amendment into the list?\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the distinguished Senator from Arkansas will yield----\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It sounds to me as if we have a pretty full schedule for \nthe rest of the evening. My guess is that tomorrow morning would be a \ngood time. But it may well be at some time tonight people will decide \nto get finished, at which point obviously the Senator could offer the \namendment.\n  We are basically set now in terms of unanimous consent on two \namendments. One is a fairly comprehensive amendment by Senator Biden \nwhere we will have 2 hours equally divided. Then we are going to \nSenator Domenici on trying to bring back the Federal Legal Services \nCorporation, which will be debated, I would think, pretty extensively. \nWe have an amendment pending by the Senator from Arizona. So I cannot \ntell the Senator that he would not get to offer it tonight, but if I \nwere the Senator, if we are here tomorrow, I would try to do it in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I could respond to my colleague, my \nfriend from Texas, I have no problem offering the amendment tomorrow if \nI have just as much certainty as possible in the time sequence, because \nI have three amendments that I must offer in the Finance Committee \nmarkup on Medicare-Medicaid, and I am just trying to sort of find out \nwhere I should be and which time I should be there. \n\n[[Page S 14519]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am sure that the same is true for Senator \nHollings. We would try to accommodate the Senator in every way we can.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I understand now, in the unanimous-\nconsent agreement, Senator Biden will commence at 7 o'clock. To try to \nsave a little time, I was off the floor momentarily at the time of the \npresentation of the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. The \namendment of the Senator from Arizona as he relates it could be very \naccurate. On the other hand, I have heard different facts.\n  What occurs here is, as the Senator from Arizona has outlined the \namendment, the FCC is asking for guidance. Whenever that occurs, \nbeware, for the simple reason that we have an FCC to have full hearings \nto hear both sides of a particular case and issue and thereupon make a \ndecision.\n  I have heard from both sides spasmodically. I have not called the FCC \nmyself. I wanted to stay out of the case. But right to the point, it is \nmy understanding there is sort of a split down there. And there is a \ndefinite difference of opinion with respect to due diligence being used \non the granting of a particular license to an entity out there, I \nthink, in Arizona.\n  The Arizona folks, it is related, did use due diligence, and came \nback twice to the Federal Communications Commission and were granted on \nboth occasions extensions, because what is involved here is a satellite \nspectrum usage encompassing quite a commitment of financial support.\n  That commitment of financial support was finally obtained and \ncommitted, and there is related $1 billion that has been committed, and \nthere is a launch date for that particular satellite in April of next \nyear.\n  Now, this is in issue. And as the Commission was temporarily making a \nruling, the parties involved appealed that particular ruling. And it is \nnow under appeal. So what happens is that the case comes to the \nCongress, and some of us Senators on the Commerce Committee who are \ninterested, of course, and disposed to Federal Communications matters, \nbut without any hearing, and without knowing what is best to be done, I \nhave always come down, because this occurs every time we get up to a \nparticular bill or something, somebody brings up a fix, if you please, \nMr. President, of a case down at the FCC.\n  I have been very cautious and astute not to join in those particular \nfixes. Specifically, I was asked if I could go along with an amendment \nthat would do as is indicated by Senator McCain. And I said no. I think \nwe ought to leave it with the Commission.\n  Thereupon, I was asked if I would go along with an amendment on the \nother side. Go along with it and allow them to set fees and whatever it \nwas. I said no. We are not giving authority for the FCC to become more \nor less a Congress setting fees. And I withheld my approval of that.\n  I said I simply think, under the circumstances, that it is best that \nthe Congress not be involved in a half-of-a-hair-cut situation here \nwhereby we have not had a single hearing.\n  The Chairman of the Commission has not asked my guidance. If somebody \nsays they are asking guidance, I do not have any written letters or \nanything else like that on this particular matter. Therefore, I am \nopposed to the amendment. I want to talk it out with the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona. I know his intent is sincere. But I think this is \nthe kind of amendment that ought to be tabled.\n  I only state this to use up some of the time. I see others want to \nuse some time prior to 7, but I wanted to say that I am sorry I could \nnot respond at the particular time that the Senator from Arizona \npresented his amendment. I left the floor with the understanding that \nthe Senator from New Mexico was going to present his.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           U.N. Peacekeeping\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am pleased with the negotiations that \nhave taken place with Senator Hollings, Senator Hatfield, Senator \nBiden, Senator Gramm, and others. They have improved this bill.\n  Let me add one concern I do have. This bill authorizes $250 million \nfor U.N. peacekeeping. The request from the President was $445 million. \nThe House figure--in most areas the House is, frankly, worse than the \nSenate--the House figure is $425 million. Again, our figure is $250 \nmillion. The authorization figure from the Foreign Relations Committee, \nchaired by Senator Helms, is $445 million--and we have $250 million \nhere. This is on top of what we have been doing to not pay our dues in \nthe United Nations. We are the No. 1 deadbeat in the world.\n  Yesterday morning's New York Times has a story ``To Pay Some Debts, \nU.N. Will Try Borrowing From World Bank.'' We owe $1.2 billion to the \nUnited Nations. They would not have to be going to the World Bank if we \npaid our bills.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record at \nthis point, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 27, 1995]\n\n       To Pay Some Debts, U.N. Will Try Borrowing From World Bank\n\n                         (By Barbara Crossette)\n\n       United Nations, Sept. 26.--The United Nations, facing its \n     most severe financial crisis in half a century, will try for \n     the first time to borrow money from the World Bank to pay \n     some of its debts, the organization's highest-ranking \n     financial officer said today.\n       Joseph Connor, a former chief executive of Price Waterhouse \n     who is now United Nations Under Secretary General for \n     Administration and Management, said today that a World Bank \n     loan was only one of many ideas being explored ``to lift from \n     our shoulders the burden of debt.''\n       Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in an \n     interview on Saturday that he planned to meet the World Bank \n     president, James D. Wolfensohn, this weekend to discuss the \n     proposal.\n       In the past, the United Nations has borrowed small amounts \n     for specific development projects, Mr. Connor said, but there \n     is no precedent for a loan of this kind, which would go to \n     paying off some of the organization's growing general \n     indebtedness.\n       ``This crisis cannot be solved unless we can borrow \n     money,'' the Secretary General said.\n       The United States, which is at least $1.2 billion in \n     arrears in its dues to the United Nations, is expected to \n     challenge the plan, an American diplomat said.\n       The American opposition to any new idea for raising money \n     surprised diplomats from Europe and elsewhere, whose \n     governments pay their bills regularly. A Western diplomat \n     said today that with the United States the largest defaulter \n     in assessments, it seemed inexplicable that the Clinton \n     Administration would make things worse behind the scenes.\n       An American diplomat said today that the Administration had \n     ``two basic problems'' with the loan plan.\n       ``The United Nations and the Secretary General have no \n     authority to borrow externally,'' the diplomat said. ``And \n     borrowing from the World Bank is restricted to sovereign \n     governments.''\n       The World Bank is technically part of the United Nations \n     system, although the bank and the International Monetary \n     Fund, both based in Washington, operate with considerable \n     independence.\n       The United Nations, which has not capital base and cannot \n     borrow commercially, is owed $3.4 billion in unpaid \n     assessments, of which the United States owes roughly half.\n       The organization is $900 million in arrears in payments to \n     countries that have provided peacekeeping troops and $400 \n     million for purchases of various kinds. Half of the tens of \n     millions of dollars awarded in contracts each year go to \n     American companies.\n       ``Our inability to pay is impacting the willingness of \n     countries to participate in peacekeeping,'' Mr. Connor said. \n     The operation in Bosnia alone is costing nearly $5 million \n     daily, according to the Secretary General.\n       In a speech today to the General Assembly, the British \n     Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, proposed charging \n     interest on late payments as one way of tightening penalties \n     against member nations in arrears. He said 39 nations failed \n     to pay anything at all last year.\n       In June at the meeting of the Group of Seven major \n     industrial nations, Mr. Boutros-Ghali proposed that the \n     United Nations would take bonds from nations owing money and \n     use them to settle debts with other member countries. That \n     idea was also opposed by the United States.\n       Mr. Connor said today that the bulk of the money owed by \n     the United Nations for peacekeeping is in debts to Western \n     European nations, Australia, Canada and other countries close \n     to the United States.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Then I would like to insert two other things into the \nRecord. One is a statement by the Council for a Livable World, whose \ngood work I think many of us acknowledge. This is a statement in \nsupport of U.N. peace operations, signed by a great many people. I ask \nunanimous consent that that be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S 14520]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Statement in Support of U.N. Peace Operations\n\n       The United Nations is playing an increasingly critical role \n     in preventing and resolving conflicts that have broken out \n     across the globe. We welcome this expanded mission envisioned \n     in the original U.N. charter but impeded by the Cold War. \n     While the U.N. has not proved a panacea, it has achieved \n     remarkable successes in countries such as Namibia, in El \n     Salvador and in Cambodia.\n       International peacekeeping is not an altruistic endeavor; \n     it directly serves U.S. security, political and commercial \n     interests. As U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright \n     has stated: ``Whether measured in arms proliferation, \n     refugees on our shores, the destabilization of allies, or \n     loss of exports, jobs or investments, the cost of runaway \n     regional conflicts sooner or later comes home to America. In \n     1993, the U.N. will spend over $3 billion to stem or stop \n     those conflicts, and we will pay one third of that. But \n     without the U.N., both the costs and the conflict would be \n     far greater.''\n       However, the fate of peace operations hangs in the balance, \n     in part due to crippling funding shortfalls and decreasing \n     national political support for the United Nations as it seeks \n     to reform and to meet new challenges. Although the U.N. is \n     often a first line of crisis response overseas, the United \n     States and other nations consistently fall behind in paying \n     dues and peacekeeping assessments. These overdue bills serve \n     to cripple the U.N.'s ability to respond rapidly to crises \n     and implement needed reforms. In addition, Congressional \n     critics have singled out U.N. peace operations as a vehicle \n     for expressing their dissatisfaction with broader issues, \n     from the defense budget and military readiness to U.S. \n     interests abroad, and have sought to curtail already limited \n     participation of U.S. armed forces in U.N. peace operations.\n       We endorse multilateral, burden-sharing approaches to \n     preventing and resolving conflicts. In particular, we support \n     strengthening the United Nations' ability to conduct peace \n     operations. To encourage these approaches, we strongly urge \n     the U.S. and all nations to pay on time their dues and \n     peacekeeping assessments, and to pay all their arrearages to \n     the United Nations. The United States must avoid the costs \n     and dangers of a unilateral role as world policeman.\n       A policy that provides only weak financial and political \n     support for peacekeeping jeopardizes the United Nations' \n     long-term future. If the U.N. is not given the resources and \n     encouragement to improve its capabilities, confidence in it \n     will be undermined. The world community will have sacrificed \n     the chance to establish a truly effective multilateral \n     peacekeeping process, with emphasis on conflict prevention. \n     The world will become more dangerous, to the detriment of our \n     own security.\n       We should take advantage of the post-Cold War situation and \n     apply the lessons of peacekeeping from the past several years \n     to reform and expand U.N. peace operations and make them more \n     effective. Peace operations, which give the U.S. an \n     opportunity to help in reducing the worldwide level of armed \n     violence with minimum risk and cost, are squarely in our \n     national interest.\n\n\nsignatories to statement in support of u.n. peacekeeping--september 5, \n                                  1995\n\n       Ruth Adams, Director, Program on Peace and International \n     Cooperation, MacArthur Foundation (retired).\n       Chadwick F.

But it is the massive delinquencies of the United \n     States that have plunged the Organization into chronic crisis \n     and sapped its capacity to respond to emergencies and new \n     needs.\n       The services provided by international organizations are, \n     objectively, quite cheap--especially in comparison with the \n     sums we spend on other dimensions of national security, such \n     as the military, as backup in the event that diplomacy and \n     the U.N. machinery fail. The annual U.S. assessments for \n     peacekeeping worldwide are less than the police budget for \n     the nation's largest city. Total American contributions, \n     voluntary as well as obligatory, for all agencies of the U.N. \n     system amount to $7 per capita (compared to some $1,000 per \n     capita for the Defense Department).\n       Some object that U.N. peacekeeping costs have exploded over \n     the past decade, from a U.S. share of $53 million in 1985 to \n     $1.08 billion projected for 1995. But the end of the Cold War \n     that sparked that increase, by freeing the U.N. to be an \n     effective agent of conflict management, also allowed for far \n     larger reductions in other U.S. security spending: Over the \n     same decade, Pentagon budgets have fallen $34 billion. \n     Increased reliance on U.N. collective security operations \n     necessarily complements our defense savings. Moreover, U.N. \n     costs are spread among all member states, and constitute a \n     truly cost-effective bargain for all.\n       However, at a time of hard budget choices, many national \n     politicians see U.N. contributions as an easy target. They \n     are misguided. In asserting that national parliaments can \n     unilaterally set their nations' assessment levels, claim \n     offsets from assessed obligations for voluntary peacekeeping \n     contributions, and impose policy conditions for payment of \n     their agreed share of expenses, some Washington politicians \n     jeopardize the institutional underpinnings of the world \n     community. No multilateral organization--whether the U.N., \n     the World Bank, or NATO--can long survive if member states \n     play by such rules.\n       In ratifying the U.N. Charter, every member state assented \n     in law to the financial obligations of U.N. membership. \n     Virtually all of America's allies in the industrialized world \n     fulfill those obligations to the United Nations--in full, on \n     time, and without conditions. Until relatively recently, so \n     did the United States. It must do so again.\n       America's leaders must recommit this nation to full and \n     timely payment of assessed contributions to the U.N. and \n     related organizations, including prompt retirement of arrears \n     accumulated over the past decade. Financial unreliability \n     leaves our institutions of common purpose vulnerable and \n     inefficient. We must sustain--and, where needed, increase--\n     our voluntary financial support of the U.N. system's many \n     vital activities in the economic and social fields as well as \n     peace and security. We should press for assessment scales \n     that fairly reflect nations' relative capacity to pay, and \n     explore other means, including minimal fees on international \n     transactions of appropriate types, to ensure that funds to \n     pay for the U.N. system budgets that member states approve \n     do, in fact, materialize.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                 america's stake in the united nations\n\n       Fifty years ago we, the people of the United States, joined \n     in common purpose and shared commitment with the people of 50 \n     other nations. The most catastrophic war in history had \n     convinced nations that no country could any longer be safe \n     and secure in isolation. From this realization was born the \n     United Nations--the idea of a genuine world community and a \n     framework for solving human problems that transcend national \n     boundaries. Since then, technology and economics have \n     transformed ``world community'' from a phrase to a fact, and \n     if the World War II generation had not already established \n     the U.N. system, today's would have to create it.\n       The founders of the United Nations were clairvoyant in many \n     ways. The Charter anticipated decolonization; called for \n     ``respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all \n     without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion''; \n     and set up the institutional framework ``for the promotion of \n     the economic and social advancement of all peoples.'' In \n     meeting the Charter's challenges, we make for a more secure \n     and prosperous world.\n       Through the U.N. system, many serious conflicts have been \n     contained or concluded. Diseases have been controlled or \n     eradicated, children immunized, refugees protected and fed. \n     Nations have set standards on issues of common concern--\n     ranging from human rights to environmental survival to radio \n     frequencies. Collective action has also furthered particular \n     U.S. government interests, such as averting a widening war in \n     the Middle East into which Washington might otherwise be \n     drawn. After half a century, the U.N. remains a unique \n     investment yielding multiple dividends for Americans and \n     others alike.\n       The U.N.'s mandate to preserve peace and security was long \n     hobbled by the Cold War, whose end has allowed the \n     institutions of global security to spring to life. The five \n     permanent members of the Security Council now meet and \n     function as a cohesive group, and what the Council has lost \n     in rhetorical drama it has more than gained in forging common \n     policies. Starting with the Reagan Administration's effort to \n     marshal the Security Council to help bring an end to the \n     Iran-Iraq war in 1988, every U.S. administration has turned \n     to the U.N. for collective action to help maintain or restore \n     peace. Common policy may not always result in success, but \n     neither does unilateral policy--and, unlike unilateral \n     intervention, it spreads costs and risks widely and may help \n     avoid policy disasters.\n       Paradoxically, the end of the Cold War has also given rise \n     in the U.S. to a resurgent isolationism, along with calls for \n     unilateral, go-it-alone policies. Developments in many places \n     that once would have stirred alarm are now viewed with \n     indifference. When they do excite American political \n     interest, the impulse is often to respond unilaterally in the \n     conviction that only Washington can do \n\n[[Page S 14522]]\n     the job and do it right. Without a Soviet threat, some Americans \n     imagine we can renounce ``foreign entanglements.'' Growing \n     hostility to U.N. peacekeeping in some political circles \n     reflects, in large measure, the shortsighted idea that \n     America has little at stake in the maintenance of a peaceful \n     world. In some quarters, resentment smolders at any hint of \n     reciprocal obligations, but in a country founded on the rule \n     of law, the notion that law should rule among nations ought \n     not to be controversial.\n       The political impulse to go it alone surges at precisely \n     the moment when nations have become deeply interconnected. \n     The need for international teamwork has never been clearer. \n     Goods, capital, news, entertainment, and ideas flow across \n     national borders with astonishing speed. So do refugees, \n     diseases, drugs, environmental degradation, terrorists, and \n     currency crashes.\n       The institutions of the U.N. system are not perfect, but \n     they remain our best tools for concerted international \n     action. Just as Americans often seek to reform our own \n     government, we must press for improvement of the U.N. system. \n     Fragmented and of limited power, prone to political \n     paralysis, bureaucratic torpor, and opaque accountability, \n     the U.N. system requires reform--but not wrecking. \n     Governments and citizens must press for changes that improve \n     agencies' efficiency, enhance their responsiveness, and make \n     them accountable to the world's publics they were created to \n     serve. Our world institutions can only be strengthened with \n     the informed engagement of national leaders, press, and the \n     public at large.\n       The American people have not lost their commitment to the \n     United Nations and to the rule of law. They reaffirm it \n     consistently, whether in opinion surveys or UNICEF campaigns. \n     Recognizing the public's sentiment, the foes of America's \n     U.N. commitment--unilateralists, isolationists, or whatever--\n     do not call openly for rejecting the U.N. as they had earlier \n     rejected outright the League of Nations. But the systematic \n     paring back of our commitment to international law and \n     participation in institutions would have the same effect.\n       In this 50th anniversary year, America's leaders should \n     rededicate the nation to the promise of a more peaceful and \n     prosperous world contained in the U.N. Charter. In that \n     spirit, the United Nations Association of the United States \n     calls on the people and government of the United States, and \n     those of all other U.N. member states, to join in \n     strengthening the United Nations system for the 21st century.\n       In particular, we call for action in five areas, which will \n     be the top policy priorities of UNA-USA as we enter the \n     U.N.'s second half-century: Reliable financing of the United \n     Nations system; strong and effective U.N. machinery to help \n     keep the peace; promotion of broad-based and sustainable \n     world economic growth; vigorous defense of human rights and \n     protection of displaced populations; control, reduction, or \n     elimination of highly destructive weaponry.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. And then the next is a letter, a policy statement by the \nUnited Nations Association of the United States of America, sent to \nme--I am sure to all Members of the Senate--by the former Deputy \nSecretary of State John Whitehead, who many of us had a chance to know \nand respect a great deal. He was the Deputy Secretary of State under \nJim Baker. I ask unanimous consent that his fine statement be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     United Nations Association of\n\n\n                                 the United States of America,\n\n                                                    July 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: I am writing to share with you a policy \n     statement of the United Nations Association of the United \n     States (UNA-USA) on the U.S. stake in the United Nations and \n     U.N. financing, adopted in late June by UNA-USA's national \n     convention on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the \n     signing of the United Nations Charter.\n       It is a serious yet succinct statement on an issue of \n     considerable importance, with major implications for the \n     Congress. We hope you will find it of interest. UNA-USA is \n     eager to make a constructive contribution to the policy \n     debate.\n       We should be pleased to share any reactions with UNA-USA's \n     25,000 members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                John C. Whitehead,\n                                      Chairman of the Association.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am not offering an amendment on this \nbecause, real candidly, I know what the results would be. But I hope \nthat in conference my colleagues will keep in mind that even the House, \nconservative as they are, put in $425 million for U.N. peacekeeping \ncompared to our $250 million. I hope we will go to the House figure on \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments, without any invasion or impingement upon the time \nagreements attendant to those amendments. I will offer an amendment and \nask for 20 minutes, to be equally divided between Senators Pell, \nBumpers, and Dorgan, with the understanding that there will still be a \nvote at 9 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I am happy to withhold.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n   Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have sent an amendment to the desk. I \nwithdraw any further request for unanimous-consent request on time. I \nam just going to utilize the void that exists here on the floor and \ntake up what time I wish.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, if approved, I think would greatly \nimprove our national security. My amendment, which is identical to a \nfreestanding bill, the code of conduct on arms transfers, would place \nrestrictions on arms transfers to nations which pose potential threats \nto the United States or to our allies.\n  I do not want to go into my long drawn-out speech reciting the very \nsorry record of this country in being the biggest arms peddler in the \nworld today. Merchants of death is about what you should more \naccurately title our role in these matters of providing arms to Third \nWorld countries that cannot even develop a subsistence agriculture to \nfeed their own people, and using up to 85 percent of their own national \nbudgets to fill their lust for arms that we have infected them with.\n  At least I think we ought to begin to try to draw some kind of \nparameters around this come-one-come-all big arms sale today in the \nUnited States. Sending out our Secretary of Commerce to hawk arms at \nthe Paris arms show, informing our diplomatic posts around the world \nthat certainly they would help facilitate any arms transfers they can \ncreate in their country.\n  What we are offering here is this amendment to the Justice-State-\nCommerce appropriations bill on behalf of Senator Pell, Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Bumpers, and myself.\n  I acknowledge that this is not the perfect vehicle for a discussion \non the issue of arms transfers. After all, the yearly appropriations \nprocess is virtually the only time Congress provides its input on \nmilitary aid to other countries, and at least some oversight exists in \nthe programs funded by yearly appropriations.\n  My amendment is very easy to explain. It is very straightforward. The \nfocus of the code of conduct on arms transfers is not what may be sold \nor transferred to another nation; but rather who should receive U.S. \narms. The code of conduct says it is generally not in the interest of \nthe United States to send arms to nations which are undemocratic, or \nabuse human rights, engage in illegal acts of war, or refuse to \nparticipate in the U.N. Registry of Arms. In other words, U.S.-built \nweapons should not be provided to nations which are a threat to our \nsecurity.\n  We have had plenty of history where we have faced our own arms in a \nbattle where they are aimed against our own people. I need not go into \na long recitation of that.\n  Our world is awash in conventional weapons. This is conventional \nweapon focus. Even as we celebrate another \n\n[[Page S 14523]]\nmajor victory in nuclear arms control, the permanent ratification of \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and come closer to reaching \nagreement on a permanent ban on underground nuclear testing, we cannot \nignore the death and destruction caused by conventional arms. Over 40 \nmillion people killed by conventional weapons since World War II. That \nis a pretty sizable part of the world's population.\n  More than anything else, we cannot ignore the last four times the \nUnited States sent significant numbers of troops to combat. Our \nsoldiers faced adversaries which had received U.S. arms, training, or \nmilitary assistance. I am talking about Panama, Iraq, Haiti, Somalia.\n  In other words, our arms transfer policy has backfired, particularly \nin those instances. It has created the boomerang effect where U.S.-\nprovided weapons are used against our own military. Clearly, a new \npolicy is needed.\n  The American public has been polled on the question of arms transfers \nand resoundingly--over 95 percent--said that no U.S. arms should go to \ndictators. Yet the United States continues to provide arms to nations \nwhich are not democratic.\n  The Clinton administration undertook to review the arms trade policy \nlast year. That process took many months and the announcement was made \nin February of this year, 1995, that a new policy had been adopted. The \ntruth is there was nothing new about the administration's policy. It \nrepresents no real departure from the arms transfer program our Nation \nhas followed for the past 15 years.\n  We can go back and say this whole idea emanated out of post-World War \nII France when General de Gaulle needed to try to replenish the \nmilitary arms arsenal of plans and found the best way to do it was to \nsell arms to other parts of the world to make money off of them to fill \nhis own arms needs.\n  If we want to go with the President, President Kennedy in 1961 saw \nthat as a policy and began to launch that policy in this country. So, \nconsequently, we have had Democrat and Republican alike, no change or \ndifference in party labels, that have followed this kind of arms \npeddling policy.\n  I think one important and dangerous difference today than previous \nhas been thanks to the new policy that domestic economic considerations \nnow have an important role to play in arms transfer decisions. \nApparently we are willing to trade national security away for a few \njobs. In other words, domestic production. That is foreign trade.\n  I think it is very interesting, we used to have a Department in the \nDefense Department, Department of Munitions. Now we call it the \nDepartment of International Defense Trade. Is that not a nice, sweet \nname for nothing but peddling arms?\n  This position is terribly out of step with the international movement \nto curb arm transfers. Last week I received a letter from Nobel \nlaureate Dr. Oscar Arias, the former President of Costa Rica, who \ninformed me that he is organizing a commission of Nobel laureates to \ndevelop an international code of conduct on arms transfers to be \npresented to the U.N. General Assembly.\n  Dr. Arias has already signed on four additional Nobel laureates in \nthis effort--mind you within this very brief period of time, four more, \nwhich is based in part upon the code of conduct I am presenting here on \nbehalf of my colleagues and myself.\n  In addition, I have heard from members of the European parliament, \nled by Glenys Kinnock. The efforts are underway to develop a \ncomprehensive arms export control policy to be endorsed by the European \nUnion.\n  Mr. Kinnock points out in his letter, this is Mr. Glenys Kinnock, \nthat the United States and the nations of the European Union together \nwill sell 80 percent of the world's weapons this year--80 percent.\n  Clearly, the code of conduct on arms transfers is not a unilateral \nmove which will have only limited effect upon the global flow of arms. \nThis is an international initiative which demands U.S. leadership.\n  Yet the administration refuses to make this pledge. Under Secretary \nof State Lynn Davis also testified before the Appropriations Committee \non the matter of arms transfers. Secretary Davis told me that she \nthought that all components of the code of conduct on arms transfers--\nthis bill or this amendment--democracy, human rights, transparency in \narms transfers and reunification of illegal wars--were all acceptable \nto the administration, and indeed, are all shared goals.\n  Setting goals is not enough. Non-democratic governments received 85 \npercent of the $55.2 billion of American weapons that were transferred \nto developing countries through sales or foreign aid during the past 4 \nyears.\n  With a record like that, I could not disagree more with the \nadministration's assertion that flexibility is the most important \nfactor in arms transfer policy.\n  But I nonetheless have, in my amendment, provided a waiver authority, \nso that the President may come to Congress with a request to provide \narms transfers to a nation who does not meet the criteria when it is in \nthe interest of our own national security.\n  Should dictators be rewarded with weapons? Of course not. Early this \npast summer the Catholic Bishops of the United States approved \nunanimously a major statement calling upon the United States to \nundertake ``more serious efforts to control and radically reduce'' its \nrole in the arms trade.\n  Many of you know that I have been a longtime critic of arms sales to \nthe developing world. As I have indicated earlier, too many poorer \nnations--nations which have inadequate water and food supplies, \ninadequate education, and inadequate housing--have been caught up on \nregional arms races or been subjected to the gross military \nexpenditures of despots. For years the United States has led the way in \nsales to these countries, although I would note that France slipped \nahead of us this past year.\n  Earlier this year I held a hearing on the bill which is the basis for \nthe amendment I offer today. A representative from Human Rights Watch \nprovided testimony to the Appropriations Committee regarding the link \nbetween human rights and conventional weapons transfers. The \nrepresentative reminded the committee that ``the fact of arms does not \nnecessarily create abuse'' but went on to discuss how the tragic \ngenocide in Rwanda a year ago was worsened by the enormous flow of \nweapons the year before the massacres. The influx of grenades and \nautomatic weapons--all available cheaply--not only brought on the \ncreation of militia who left tens of thousands of Rwandans dead. The \nExistence of these weapons also made U.N. efforts to protect refugees \nextremely difficult.\n  If we are to prevent future Rwandas and improve international respect \nfor human rights and promote democracy, we need a code of conduct on \narms transfers. The United States can and should exert its leadership \nby stating explicitly that it does not sell arms to dictators.\n  Mr. President, one closing remark. We have problems today in Bosnia \nand the Balkans. I stood on this floor 2\\1/2\\ years ago and warned \nabout the flow of arms coming in both directions on the Danube. The \nDanube River was literally a river full of arms going into that very \npart of the world, from allies, from friends as well as from people of \ndifferent kinds of relationships to the United States. These are now \ncoming home to roost.\n  People say what else can we do but to send troops? What else can we \ndo but to bomb? If we would choke off the supply of arms into that area \nof the world, we would be saving lives and we would be going to the \nsource of the conflict and the source of the destruction and the source \nof the violence. But, unfortunately, arms have become too big an \neconomic enterprise in our Western World, particularly in the United \nStates. So it is much easier to call out the troops and send them into \ntrouble spots of the world than to choke off arms to the world. We are \nnow, as I say, one of the largest peddlers of such arms in all parts of \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, I made my pitch. I want to say I appreciate being able \nto inject this at this moment. If the time is such that Senator Bumpers \nand other cosponsors of this may have a moment to speak, I will hold it \nin suspension. I am ready to close off and call for a vote. I recognize \nthe ultimate defeat, but nevertheless I feel constrained to make this \npitch at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. \n\n[[Page S 14524]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, is the Senator from Oregon waiting now to \ncall for a vote on his amendment or has he yielded the floor?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, tonight we are going to be voting on some \namendments that are very significant, and I want to take an opportunity \nto express some views concerning those amendments. One is going to be \noffered to refund to its 1995 fiscal year level--I believe it is $415 \nmillion--the Legal Services Corporation.\n  This is a place we should draw the line, go back. In fact, this is \none area where the Senate came out with a better proposal than the \nHouse came out with. It is my understanding the House suggested \nreducing the funding to $278 million. The Senate would reduce it down \nto $210 million and have that block granted out to the States.\n  I really believe the Legal Services Corporation was conceived as a \npart of the Great Society program, understandably, perhaps, at the \ntime, to offer legal services to the poor. However, over a period of \nyears it has turned into an agency that is trying to reshape the \npolitical and legal and social fabric of America. In fiscal year 1995, \nthe taxpayers spent $415 million to operate the Legal Services \nCorporation. However, the cost, the $415 million, is only a very small \npart of it when you consider the extensive class action suits and \nfrivolous litigation that has followed.\n  There are so many examples that have been given here on the floor, \nand that I have given myself, concerning the activities of the LSC. The \nnegative effects of the LSC's attempts to reorder society permeate our \nculture, from the business community to government to homes to \nchurches. Perhaps the most troubling is the role of legal aid in \nchallenging parental involvement statutes, so-called children's rights \nadvocates such as Mrs. Clinton, who served as the chairperson for the \nLSC's board that challenged parental consent laws in several States. \nThe income level of the litigants was often ignored. It really cannot \nbe used as an argument that it was to provide legal services for the \npoor.\n  Parents are attacked in their efforts in keeping drugs out of their \nhomes. In Idaho, the LSC protested when parents voluntarily invited \npolice into their homes to check for drugs. Legal aid asserted privacy \nrights of the violators, who were teenagers who were on drugs at the \ntime.\n  We have had Legal Services also involved in illegal immigration. The \nLSC supported organizations that sued California for its efforts to \nascertain residents' immigration status for emergency Medicaid \nservices. Legal Services promised to take this one to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Legal Services also contributes to our public housing woes. The LSC \ntried to prevent the local housing authority from evicting a woman who \nwas dealing in drugs out of her apartment. Despite overwhelming \nevidence of constant drug-related activity, the LSC lawyers vigorously \nopposed her eviction on the grounds that she was not aware of what was \ngoing on.\n  The examples go on and on and on. I encourage my colleagues to \nseriously consider defeating the amendment that will be offered \ntonight.\n  There is another one coming up I heard articulated on this floor a \nmoment ago by the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm. Although he was \ntalking about his amendment, the Shelby-Inhofe amendment that will be \noffered later on is an amendment to put work back into our prison \nsystem. We have proposed in this amendment that we require work, 48 \nhours per week, along with education pursuits so individuals can go out \nwhen they are once released and work themselves back into society.\n  I know a lot of people are saying these are not country clubs; our \nprison system already is punishing criminals. I suggest that, since the \n1960's, we have grown in this body to be more concerned about the \nviolators than we have the victims.\n  The other day, I ran into a notice that was posted in one of the \nMassachusetts correctional facilities where it stated:\n\n       A third softball field will be made in the west field in \n     order to allow more inmates to play softball. The horseshoe \n     pits will be temporarily relocated near the golf course. The \n     boccie [or whatever that is called] area will be relocated at \n     the site of the new gym. The soccer field will be relocated \n     to the east field behind the softball field.\n\n  It goes on to say, ``We hope that our clients''--they do not call \nthem inmates, do not call them prisoners--``will not be inconvenienced \ntoo much.''\n  I think it is time. If there is one mandate that came with the \nelections of 1994, it was to start to change our prison system, to quit \nspending the exorbitant amounts, and to get involved in punishment as a \ndeterrent to crime.\n  I was very proud when we passed our bill through the Senate, after \nthe disaster occurred in the State of Oklahoma, that calls for real \nhabeas reform and, for the first time, in my opinion, reverses the \ndirection of our attitude in terms of crime and punishment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I believe that I have 2 hours allotted to \nmy amendment that will be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. In fairness to the Senate, I was supposed to be here at 7 \no'clock to start that amendment. So I would suggest that--I have \nchecked this with at least the staff of the minority--the time for my \namendment be cut to an hour and a half equally divided so that we are \nfinished by 9 o'clock with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I withhold the request. I will just begin \nmy statement, and then we can work out the time as we go along.\n  Before Senator Inhofe leaves the floor, I am just curious. That \nprison notice that he read, I would like to ask my colleague, was that \na Federal prison or State prison?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is a State prison. However, our amendment addresses \nnot just Federal prisons but prisons that receive Federal funds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. I was just curious. I would point out \nto him that in the Federal prison system, we stopped fooling around--\nunlike the State of Oklahoma or the State of Delaware and other \nStates--we stopped fooling around like many who served in the State \nlegislature fool around. We passed an amendment that the Senator from \nDelaware offered in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It is called \n``the same time for the same crime.'' You get convicted in the Federal \ncourt, you go to jail for all the time, and I am just sorry the State \nlegislatures are not as we have been and as the Federal Government has \nbeen for a long time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If I could respond, we have been fooling around in some \nStates. That is what this is all about, to try to get some uniformity. \nAnd any time you have a murderer like Roger Dale Stafford, who sat on \ndeath row for 15 years after murdering nine Oklahomans in cold blood, \nit is time that we changed our attitude toward crime and punishment in \nthis country.\n  I would suggest--and I think perhaps the Senator from Delaware would \nagree--that when someone is contemplating a crime, and if he thinks the \ndownside is going to be sitting on death row watching TV in an air-\nconditioned cell for 17 years, that is not much of a deterrent. And \nthat is what I would like to change.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. Maybe he could \nmake that very compelling speech to Mr. Gingrich so we can actually \npass the terrorism bill instead of him holding the terrorism bill up \nthat we--the Senator from Oklahoma and I--worked so hard on. The House \nhas not passed it yet. It is a great emergency.\n  I have not heard any speeches on the floor from my friends who were \ndecrying failure to move quickly on the terrorism bill when we had it. \nI have not heard any speeches about why the Republican House of \nRepresentatives is holding it hostage. God only knows. Maybe it has to \ndo with a line-item veto that they used to be for as well in the House. \nI am not sure. But I think we would all serve the Nation well if we \nconstantly spoke out and asked Mr. Gingrich to let the terrorism bill \ngo instead of turning that into a habeas corpus reform. I would hate to \nhave that sit over there for the remainder of the year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will respond that I have talked to Mr. Gingrich, and he \nis \n\n[[Page S 14525]]\nvery anxious to get to that. However, I think we are all aware that we \nhave some appropriations bills to get out of the way. And, in the order \nof things, I am sure it will be expedited.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to hear that. But he had the bill for months \nand months before we started the appropriations process.\n  I do not stand for that reason. I rise to speak to an amendment that \nI have. Let me very briefly describe it before I send it to up to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. President, the crime bill--which we passed, and is now the crime \nlaw--was in many ways authorized in this appropriations bill. My good \nfriend from Texas, Senator Gramm, for whom I have great respect and I \nhave never underestimated his abilities, was very effectively able to, \nin the appropriations process, essentially change the authorization \nprocess by dealing with a number of the provisions in the crime laws \nthat are in place and functioning.\n  What this amendment essentially attempts to do is go back and undo--\nwhether the Senate will agree is a different story--essentially what \nwas done in the subcommittee on appropriations. I am not speaking to \neach part of the amendment, but I will give you the major points.\n  One, it reinstates money for the drug courts. The Appropriations \nCommittee eliminated the funding for drug courts, something that we \npassed a year ago into law and is now law.\n  Second, it eliminates money for drug treatment in prisons. I might \nnote for those who might think that is sort of a silly, soft-headed \nnotion that the States in the United States of America in the year \n1993, after releasing prisoners from the jail--prisoners who had served \ntheir time in the State penitentiary--as they walked out the gate from \na State penitentiary with the clothes they wore in and a bus ticket and \nfive bucks in their pocket, 200,000 of them in one year walked out of \nthat penitentiary drug addicted, drug addicted, addicted to drugs after \nhaving served their time as they walked through the portal.\n  So what all the evidence shows is that drug treatment in prisons is \nas effective as drug treatment out of prison, and it makes a big \ndifference because you have 154 crimes a year committed by a drug-\naddicted person. If you have 200,000 people, after having walked out of \njail, still drug addicted as they walk out the gate, we have a problem. \nBut unfortunately, the meager amount of money that was in the crime \nbill, in the crime trust fund, which should have been spent and would \nhave been spent in this upcoming year, that also was zeroed out.\n  In addition, there was in the crime law a provision that a vast \nmajority of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, supported when we \ndebated the crime bill 2 years ago, and that was rural drug enforcement \ngrants. I have spent a lot of time with the Presiding Officer, my \ncolleague from Utah. And, as a consequence, I do not pretend to know \nthe State of Utah, but I have become much more familiar with it. I need \nnot tell the Presiding Officer that drug trafficking in methamphetamine \nwith the gangs from Los Angeles moving into rural Utah, drive-by \nshootings occurring in Salt Lake City that never occurred before, the \ninflux into the large intermountain States of drug deals, drug cartels, \nand drug organizations primarily dealing in synthetic drugs and \nmethamphetamine--all of them have put an incredible burden on all of \nthose things and have put an incredible burden on the rural law \nenforcement agencies in the small towns in the State of Utah, in New \nHampshire and in Delaware.\n  I mentioned those States because the three Senators representing \nthose States are on the floor. We represent States where the vast \nmajority of their cities are very small. The largest city in the State \nof Delaware is 85,000 people.\n  Now, I realize Utah is larger than that, and I think Manchester, NH, \nis larger than that. But the point is, we do not have that many big \nmetropolises. We have tens, scores of small, little towns of one \nsheriff or one police officer or two or three. And what every rural law \nenforcement agency said to us when we were writing this bill was that \nwe need help, particularly we need help in the area of dealing with \ndrug enforcement problems, because the problems that are visited upon \nthose small towns are not just the kids selling marijuana in the \nschoolyard; the real problems that have occurred in the last 10 years \nis these drug organizations move into those small towns, or they move \ninto the outskirts of those small towns that in effect are incapable of \nbeing dealt with across State borders by small, rural law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Unfortunately, the subcommittee on appropriations saw fit to zero out \nthat function as well. I attempt in this amendment to restore that \nmoney.\n  In addition, I also restore another thing that was cut totally, and \nthat is the Law Enforcement Family Support Act.\n  Now, most people do not know what that is, but a number of us have \nparticipated, and I expect my colleagues on the floor tonight will \nparticipate in the ceremonies that take place at the law enforcement \nmemorial once a year, where almost every year the President speaks, \nwhether it be President Bush or President Clinton, and where we deal \nwith and hail the slain officers and the families of officers slain in \nthat calendar year who come to Washington. And they come to Washington \nto be recognized and to recognize the contributions of their spouses, \nmothers or fathers, brothers or sisters.\n  A very important part of that, as those of you who have attended may \nknow, is that when that ceremony is over out in The Mall, there are 2 \ndays set up of counseling for the families, the families that come from \nall across America, that come from Idaho, Utah, Montana, Maine, \nFlorida.\n  You speak to the families of those slain officers, and they will tell \nyou this counseling that they get as to how to deal with this and being \nable to deal with other families who have been through it is one of the \nmost helpful things that happens to them. It matters to them.\n  What this $1.2 million we cut does is to provide that very \ncounseling. So I hope when my colleagues vote on this amendment, they \nwill remember that next year when they are invited down to the law \nenforcement memorial ceremony and they see and, God forbid, it will \noccur we know, another 25, 50, 100 families down there where officers \nhave been slain in the calendar year doing their duty, we will realize \nthat in failing to put this money back in the thing that those families \nvalued the most will in fact not be available to them because they \nliterally leave there, go to a luncheon and get on buses to take \nadvantage of these counseling services. So I attempt to restore the \n$1.2 million in the Law Enforcement Family Support Act that was taken \nout by the committee.\n  It also restores--no new money, no change in money--the State option \nthat is presently available under the crime law, under the prison grant \nportion, to allow States to use their prison dollars to build boot \ncamps if they choose to do it. The argument that we heard on the floor, \nDemocrats and Republicans, for the past year is that we want to allow \nmore local control. We do not want the Federal Government telling \npeople what they should do.\n  We passed, with my support and the overwhelming support of the people \nin this body on both sides of the aisle, the mandate legislation saying \nwe should not be mandating to the States what they must do without \nsending the money. But implicit in that is we have also said as a \nmatter of policy that we do not know federally, we have acknowledged we \ndo not know federally as much about the specific needs of the States \nand the localities as the States and localities know.\n  So I find it curious that my colleagues, at least the majority on the \nappropriations subcommittee, decided to tell the States they do not \nhave the option to build boot camps. I do not quite understand that. \nEverybody stood on this floor and talked about how valuable and \nimportant boot camps are. But the language that I have in this \namendment--and I will go back to this in a moment--restores the State \noption. No requirement, no State has to build a single, solitary boot \ncamp. They can all go build maximum security prisons. They can do \nwhatever they want to do with the money as it relates to prisons. But \nthey should have the option of being able to build a boot camp, as my \nState has decided. And there are several other changes that this \namendment contains for the \n\n[[Page S 14526]]\npurpose of making sure that we in effect put the crime law back \ntogether.\n  This amendment is supported, I might add, by I believe every single \nmajor police organization in the country. The legislation relating to \nlaw enforcement and family support is specifically supported by the \nNational Association of Police Organizations.\n  As I said, everyone may remember a year and a half ago there were a \nrash of police suicides across the country including what personal toll \nwas taken on America's law enforcement officers and their families as a \nconsequence of them being shot or wounded or killed. This amendment on \nthe Family Support Act helps deal with that.\n  So let me speak a little more specifically to each of the general \nareas that I try to restore. Again, $100 million for drug courts, $20 \nmillion--and by the way, we authorized $150 million.\n  I should point out one other thing. We are dealing with moneys from a \ntrust fund. These are not any new taxes. What we all decided to do \nunder the leadership of Senator Gramm of Texas and Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia, when the crime law was being debated a year and a half ago, \nwas to say, look, why not make sure this is not funny money. Why not \nmake sure we can pay for what we say we want to do. I wholeheartedly \nagreed.\n  And under the leadership of Senator Byrd, with the strong concurrence \nof Senator Gramm of Texas--and quite frankly, with the ingenuity of \nJohn Hilley, who was then the administrative assistant for Senator \nMitchell--they came up with a unique idea. Never before, to the best of \nmy knowledge, did the Senate ever set up a trust fund for law \nenforcement. And the way that was funded, the Senator from Texas [Mr. \nGramm], insisted that the commitment that we made to reduce the Federal \nwork force by 272,000 people over a 5-year period be written into the \nlaw. It had not been legislated before.\n  And so, as a part of the crime bill we legislated, the President \nwould have to reduce the present work force by 272,000 people. OMB \ncalculated how much the revenue that was now being paid out of the \nTreasury to pay those folks' salaries would be. And we agreed that as \nthat attrition took place--and we have cut now by 170,000 some Federal \nemployees. We have done that. That is real. That has been done. Their \npaychecks would go into this trust fund and that from the trust fund \nthe funding for the crime bill would come.\n  Now, someone could have argued legitimately that when I say, ``No new \ntaxes,'' they say, ``Biden, you could have taken those savings from the \nreduction of the Federal work force and you could have lowered the \ndeficit or lowered taxes.'' That is true. We could have done that. But \nthe majority of us--and I for one strongly felt it was a higher \npriority to fight crime in America and give localities the resources to \ndo that.\n  So I want to make it clear what we are talking about here is trust \nfund moneys. So what I do in this amendment is I reinstate $100 million \nof the $150 million for drug courts, $27 million for drug treatment in \nprison, $10 million for rural drug enforcement, and $1.2 million for \nthe Law Enforcement Family Support Act, and then change other \nlanguage--no reallocation of funds for making sure that States have the \noption dealing with being able to use prison money to build boot camps.\n  Now, let my speak to what I think the single most important piece of \nthis amendment is, first, in more detail, and that is the drug courts. \nThe Federal Government has long focused on the fight against illegal \ndrugs, but few of its efforts have shown the promise already \ndemonstrated by drug courts. The key to the drug court program is to \npunish and control offenders in the most efficient way possible.\n  In fact, it is precisely because of the success of the drug courts \nseen in model States, that I worked with the Attorney General to \ninclude the Federal support for drug courts in the 1994 crime bill \nsigned into law a year ago.\n  Drug courts represent an innovation in how our criminal justice \nsystem deals with low-level, first-time drug offenders. Throughout the \nNation nonviolent drug offenders are simply released back into society \nwith no punishment, no treatment, no supervision. Nationwide, the most \nrecent estimates are that 600,000 such offenders are on the streets; \n600,000 people convicted of abusing drugs and committing crimes sent \nback out into the streets with no reason not to return to more drugs \nand more crime and with no punishment, no treatment, and no \nsupervision--1.4 million of these nonviolent drug offenders are \nconvicted every year, and 600,000 of them get absolutely no treatment, \nno supervision, no punishment.\n  Now, let me tell you how the drug courts work. The drug courts work \nso that what happens is the States, with the money provided by the \nFederal Government as seed money, this $100 million, set up drug courts \nwhere they take these first-time, nonviolent offenders into the court. \nThey adjudicate their cases very rapidly, usually within 30 days. They \nthen sentence that offender to something, including all of the \nfollowing:\n  First, if they are in school they must stay in school.\n  Second, if they have a job they must keep a job.\n  Third, they must be subject to random drug testing.\n  Fourth, they actually must report two times a week to a probation \nofficer and a counselor.\n  Fifth, they are required to enlist in drug treatment and stay in drug \ntreatment.\n  If they violate any of those things, they go straight to jail. They \ndo not pass go--straight to jail. In Dade County, FL, which, \nunfortunately, probably has more experience with drug trafficking and \nillegal drug use than any other county in America, it was put into \neffect several years ago.\n  The rearrest rate prior to the institution of drug courts was about \n34 percent. Thirty-four percent of all the people who were convicted \nthe first time of a nonviolent drug offense ended up rearrested and \nreconvicted and back before the courts. When the drug court program was \nput in place--and it has been there now about 5 years, I believe, maybe \na little longer--the rearrest rate dropped to around 3 percent--3 \npercent.\n  I can say to the Presiding Officer and others who are listening that \nin my State, the State of Delaware, a Republican attorney general named \nRichard Gebelein became a superior court judge and set up a drug court \nsystem like this--strict, strict, strict rules for nonviolent offenders \nonce they are convicted, requirements of treatment, requirements of \npublic service, requirements of random drug testing, requirements \nrelating to keeping a job, very strict requirements. They were \nliterally required to sign a contract. And when they violate any of \nthose provisions, they go to jail. It is amazing what an incentive it \nis. It is amazing what an incentive it is.\n  In my State they are going to be going to boot camps because boot \ncamps cost 40 percent less to run than the prison system does, than \nbuilding bricks and mortar. So they work. I say to my friend from Utah \nand others who are here, they work. And, unfortunately, I know in the \ninterest of trying to find money for other purposes in the bill, they \nwere zeroed out. So what I do in this legislation is I restore $100 \nmillion of the $140 million that has been authorized.\n  Again, drug courts combine a carrot of drug treatment and the helping \nhand with a stick of mandatory drug testing and the gavel of a judge \nthat says you go back to prison if, in fact, you violate any of the \nprovisions.\n  For example, as of about 1 month ago, the Delaware drug court had \nworked on 481 offenders in my small State in what it calls its track \none program. That is, 143 of these 481 people had completed the program \nand were on their way to being productive citizens; 80 were, to use the \nDelaware judge's phrase, ``terminated.'' In other words, they were sent \nback to jail. And the remaining 258 are presently working their way \nthrough the program.\n  But an interesting thing, I say to the Presiding Officer. Guess what? \nOf those 481 people who were in the system, committing an average of \n154 crimes a year, the crime rate has gone down precipitously among \nthose people. And those who could not stay in the system were, to use \nthe phrase of the former attorney general--now judge--Gebelein, they \nwere terminated. They were sent to jail.\n  Absent the drug court system around the country, what happens now is \nthey never get any treatment, they never get any punishment, they never \nget sent to jail; 600,000 of them a year are out there walking around \nafter having been convicted.\n  So I say to my friends, as they look at this, ask their judges in \ntheir home \n\n[[Page S 14527]]\nState, ask their probation officers, ask their police officers, ask \ntheir prison officials, and I can tell you, they will find almost \nwithout exception that the drug court innovation is viewed as one of \nthe best hopes law enforcement has to deal with what is ultimately the \nproblem. And to paraphrase a phrase used in a Presidential campaign \nlast time around, ``It's drugs, stupid. It's drugs.'' Crime is drugs. \n``It's drugs, stupid. It's drugs.''\n  Now, on the point of drug treatment in prisons, I will again merely \nmake the point that it works. Last week the Department of Health and \nHuman Services released preliminary estimates from the 1994 national \nhousehold survey on drug abuse. And its report is alarming.\n  The survey found that among youth age 12 to 17, the rate of illicit \ndrug use increased between 1993 and 1994 from 6.6 percent to 9.5 \npercent. In the past year, nearly 10 percent of our youth were using \nillicit drugs. Marijuana use among 12- to 17-year-olds has nearly \ndoubled from 1992 to 1994.\n  Perhaps even more frightening than the upsurge in use trends is the \nincrease in the perceived availability of illicit drugs, substances in \nall age groups. The percentage of youth reporting that marijuana was \neasy to obtain increased by over 10 percent. Fifty-nine percent of the \nyoung people in America said marijuana is easy to obtain and they know \nhow to get it. There was an increase in the perceived availability of \nLSD, PCP's, and heroin for all age groups.\n  The percentage of people age 35 and older who claim that cocaine was \neasily obtainable increased from 36 to 41 percent. Clearly, despite the \nprogress we made in drug abuse prevention and treatment and law \nenforcement, there is still a great deal more to be done. And things \nare moving the wrong way.\n  Given the need for more and greater efforts in the war on drugs and \ngiven their call for a strong stand on the drug issue, I cannot \nunderstand why my colleagues in this body employ the decision to \nabandon the key antidrug initiative in the 1994 crime law. \nSpecifically, I would like to mention the three programs they have \neliminated. One I have spoke to--the drug courts; second is drug \ntreatment in State prisons; and the third is rural drug enforcement \ngrants. I do not quite understand why, as we talk about drugs, we in \nfact find ourselves with legislation that cuts our effort in fighting \ndrugs.\n  Last year, the 1994 crime law took a strong stand against drug abuse \nin rural areas, against drug abuse throughout the court system and in \nthe prison system. But this bill zeros out those functions.\n  So it always surprises me, when we talk about being tough on drugs, \nwhy more of our colleagues do not go home and talk to their police, why \nthey do not talk to their prison officials, why they do not talk to the \ntough guys, the law-and-order types, who will tell them. I am telling \nyou they will tell you that in fact they want these programs.\n  What my amendment does, it takes funds from an open-ended, unfunded \nblock grant to make sure that these dollars are targeted to the \nantidrug measures I mentioned. In other words, the amendment allocates \nfunds directly--what we do is we take $117 million in the bill--we do \nnot look for any money anywhere else --and apply it to the three \nprograms I mentioned, and here is how we do it. We increase the fee \ncharges to obtain green cards. A few years back, when the non-U.S. \ncitizen was in the United States and applied for and was authorized to \nobtain a green card, that person would have had to return to their \nnative country and then reenter the United States legally.\n  In 1994, we passed a law that allowed the person in those \ncircumstances to remain in the United States and obtain the green card \nif certain requirements were satisfied. That person paid an additional \nfee of a few hundred dollars. The rationale behind the additional fee \nis that, in paying the fee, the person did not have to leave the United \nStates, return to their home country, reenter the United States, and \nthey saved a round-trip fare ticket. In addition, there is $21.2 \nmillion in offsets from the reduction in the State prison grants.\n  I note that the House funded the administration's request of $500 \nmillion. The bill before us provides $750 million for prisons. We all \nknow that whatever comes out of conference is not going to be $750 \nmillion. So we take $21 million--a mere $21 million--out of the \nadditional $250 million for State prisons that the Senate subcommittee \nput in. And should it be adopted, the bill would still provide more \nthan $725 million for prison grants. And so when my colleagues \nlegitimately ask, OK, Biden, let us assume the three programs that you \nand the cops talk about all the time are as good as you say, and that \nis drug courts, the drug prison money, and drug treatment money in \nprisons and rural drug enforcement--what I did was I found the $117 \nmillion to offset that from the places I just stated.\n  I see my friend from Missouri. I have more to say. How much time \nremains for the Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). There is no time, since the \namendment has not been offered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I did not mean to do that to the body. I was trying to \nsave time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Delaware be inclined to have the \ntime that has been consumed applied to the hour and then have the time \nbegin to run?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, I would. It is not my intention, by not sending up \nthe amendment, to be able to elongate the time that would have \notherwise been allotted to the Senator from Delaware. I will do that. \nThe reason why I have not sent the amendment to the desk is there are a \nfew changes several of my Republican colleagues want, in the form they \nwant it in to be able to send it up. That is the reason.\n  I see my colleague from Missouri on the floor. I am told he would \nlike to speak to the drug court issue. If that is the case, I ask the \npermission of my friend from New Hampshire whether I could ask \nunanimous consent to yield to him 5 minutes of whatever time I have, if \nwe reach an agreement on that time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Would it be possible now to propound a unanimous-consent \nagreement that the time for debate on the Senator's amendment would be \nlimited to not beyond 9 o'clock, that the time consumed up until now \nwould be charged to your time, that the 5 minutes to be used by the \nSenator from Missouri be charged to our time, and that the remainder of \nthe time be divided equally?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, I believe so. I would like to ask, how much time \nwould I have left under such an agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The original informal agreement was an hour \nand a half, from 7:30 until 9, equally divided. The Senator has since \nused 35 minutes out of his 45-minute allocation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to accede to the suggestion of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, if he wishes, that the time on this amendment extend \nuntil 9 o'clock and that the Senator from Delaware would have \napproximately 12 minutes remaining?\n  Mr. GREGG. I have just been advised that if that is the case, we end \nup locking in the offsets here, which is something we would rather not \ndo. Why do we not continue to proceed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is what I thought. On that score, I will be delighted \nto yield to the Senator from Missouri at this time. Then I will seek \nrecognition when he finishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am not going to take up a great deal of \ntime. There are a number of things to work out on this amendment. I \ncould not pass up this opportunity to come and tell this body that the \nconcept of a drug court has been in place in Kansas City, MO, for about \n2 years, and it is too early to say that this is the real solution. But \nthe results, to date, are very spectacular.\n  In Kansas City, drug offenses were clogging up the court system. We \ndid not have the court resources available to provide full trials. We \nwere getting citations. We did not have the prison space for the minor \noffenders. The drug court has been used with, apparently, a great deal \nof success for the nonviolent minor drug offenders in Kansas City.\n  As the Senator from Delaware has already described, this is a program \nin which they go before a judge--and I \n\n[[Page S 14528]]\ntalked at length with a judge--Judge Mason--whom I had the pleasure of \nappointing when I was Governor of Missouri, and the county prosecuting \nattorney, Clara McCaskle, who said this was one of the best ideas they \nhad seen for trying to get people early on in their careers, after they \nstarted taking drugs, off of drugs and off of a life of crime.\n  There have been about 200 people in the program in 2 years, only 10 \nhave been rearrested. Some of them failed. The nice thing about a drug \ncourt is that if you fail the program, that is it, you go into jail. \nThere is no question about it. But 60 people have completed the \nprogram. Only one has been rearrested. That is a significantly higher \nsuccess rate than most of the other programs I have seen for dealing \nwith the minor drug-related offenders.\n  This, obviously, applies only to nonviolent offenders, who have not \nused a weapon in their crime. We think this kind of tough supervision \nby a concerned judge--and it requires a judge who is willing to devote \nhis or her time to these cases, to give the drug offender the attention \nand discipline needed to get them off of the drug habit and get them \nout of a life of crime, offers a great degree of promise.\n  I had asked that the drug court at least be made a permissible use \nunder the block grant program. Frankly, I think making it a permissible \nuse is not enough. Based on what we have seen, I would like to see the \ndrug court procedure in the law in some form.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Delaware and my \ncolleague from New Hampshire to see if we cannot include provisions for \ndrug courts. I can tell you, from the heartland where we have a drug \nproblem, the drug courts seem to be one of the most promising ways of \ndealing with the problem. Anything in this area that holds out a chance \nof working I think should be given a chance.\n\n  At the very least, the drug court program should be made an option \nused under the block grant program. I would like to see us go further. \nI would like to see us say that drug grant programs should be entitled \nto a certain percentage of the block grants.\n  I look forward to working with the managers on both sides.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in keeping with our informality here, let \nme finish up. I thank my friend from Missouri for speaking to the \nefficacy of drug courts.\n  Let me speak to two other pieces of this amendment. One is the rural \ndrug enforcement grants. The latest reports from rural America tell a \nbitter story of violent crime, murder, rape, aggravated assault. It is \nrising faster in rural America. Most of our colleagues from urban \nStates do not realize this. It is rising faster in rural America than \nin urban America.\n  From 1992 to 1993 alone, the violent crime rate in rural areas \nincreased 7.4 percent; violent crime among juveniles in rural areas--\nviolent crime now--rose 15.2 percent in rural areas.\n  Drug trafficking and addiction are also skyrocketing in America's \nrural States, especially among our young people. Drug abuse violations \nhave increased by nearly 30 percent among young people under the age of \n18 in recent years.\n  At the same time, the number of law enforcement employees per 1,000 \ninhabitants in rural areas has not changed, leaving already \nunderstaffed law enforcement teams in rural America to fight \ndevastatingly high increases in serious offenses.\n  In 1993, the most recent year that data is available, 12 percent of \nour population or almost 32 million people were served by rural law \nenforcement agencies.\n  That is 32 million people who have watched their communities become \nfrighteningly dangerous. That is 12 percent of the population that has \nwitnessed their children becoming increasingly vulnerable to becoming \nvictims of violent crime or becoming involved in drugs, crime and \nviolence.\n  Rural drug enforcement grants have, we found, been the best way to \ntarget assistance to rural area law enforcement agencies. I might point \nout that Senator Hatch was one of the leaders in making sure this \nprovision was in the crime bill.\n  These grants, which place a special emphasis on drug enforcement over \nthe 32 million people living in rural areas, give the protection they \nneed and deserve. These dollars can be used for the same purposes State \nand local officials use their Byrne grant money; specifically, funding \nwill support the highly successful multijurisdictional State, local, \nand Federal drug enforcement task forces.\n  These joint efforts have proven that they work. They have a proven \ntrack record of reducing drug trafficking in rural America.\n  Put this in commonsense terms. How can a rural sheriff, a rural chief \nof police in a town of 800 or 1,000 or 1,500 or 5,000 people, with one \nofficer or maybe as many as three or four, how can they possibly deal \nwith the sophisticated drug operations that come into their areas? They \ncannot do it.\n  In the good old days when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nmany of my colleagues, Republican as well as Democrats, would come to \nme and say, ``Joe, can you help me get an extra DEA agent in Montana? \nCan you help me get an extra DEA agent or two of them in Idaho or North \nDakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Maine?'' Small States, but rural States. \nThey are big geographically.\n  The reason they needed them is their local sheriffs, their local \npolice officer coming to them and saying, ``We need some expert help \nand advice.'' We even went so far as to allow for the providing of \ntraining for local law enforcement officers from rural and small police \ndepartments down at the FBI training facility. They need the expertise.\n  These are brave women and men who are outmanned, outgunned and \noutsmarted because they are dealing with something that goes well \nbeyond the town limits or the county limits that they have the \njurisdiction over.\n  Ten rural States are eligible for these grants statewide. These \nStates include Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, \nKansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, \nOklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming.\n  I will note that Delaware is not on that list. These States that I \nmention, these 19 rural States are eligible for statewide grants, \nalthough all the remaining States, the remaining 31 States could \nbenefit in their rural areas. Rural areas of all other States will \nreceive funds, as well. These grants must be removed from the unfocused \nblock grant and funded separately. If they are to remain in the block \ngrant scheme, they will have to compete with a great many programs for \nlimited funds.\n  Let me ask all who are not in the 19 States, what do you think of the \npossibility your rural law enforcement officer is going to get this \nmoney? What do you think the possibility is that your Governor will \nsend it your way? Do you think maybe it will go where the population \ncenters are?\n  I bet it surprises even some of my colleagues here on the floor to \nhear me say that violent crime is rising faster in the rural parts of \nyour State than it is in the urban parts of your State.\n  In the block grant, I very much doubt and I believe you would be hard \npressed to convince me or yourself that this money which was \nspecifically earmarked for rural areas and States that are rural in \nnature, they need the help. So I would like to point out that rural \nareas often come up last when it comes to the so-called funding fight \nin each State. This fact has not escaped my colleagues in previous \nyears.\n  The need for special targets of anticrime funds to rural areas was \nalso expressed by my colleague, Senator Hatch, on February 10, 1994, \nwhile he was speaking in support of the Biden-Hatch rural crime \namendment, when he said:\n\n       We need to get more officers to rural areas where the \n     violent crime problem is increasing at a greater rate . . . \n     drugs, crime, and violence are national problems facing both \n     urban and rural America. Unfortunately, the crime problems \n     faced in rural America have been overlooked by Federal \n     agencies in Washington. They have focused on the crime in \n     urban areas. Yet the problems of rural states need greater \n     Federal attention as well . . . if there is a place where \n     additional Federal expenditures is warranted, it is to fight \n     crime and violence in rural states.\n\n  That was what my colleague said February 10, 1994. In the 102d \nCongress, Senators Adams, Baucus, Bryan, Bumpers, Conrad, Daschle, \nFowler, Harkin, Heflin, Leahy, Pryor all cosponsored the Rural Crime \nand Drug \n\n[[Page S 14529]]\nControl Act which I authored and passed in 1991.\n  I believe areas experiencing growth in violent crime and drugs are \nareas to which enforcement funds should be targeted, especially when \nthose areas are already underfunded and their enforcement efforts such \nas in rural areas are undermanned. That is why I am asking the rural \ndrug enforcement grants receive direct funding, so they can guarantee \nrural areas their fair share of help from the Federal Government in \nridding their communities of drugs and crime related to drugs.\n\n  Again, I daresay if you go ask your rural law enforcement people what \nthey would rather have, what chance they think they have of getting any \nadequate funding out of this when it goes into one big pot and it goes \ninto the State legislature and is distributed by the Governor, I wonder \nif they think they are going to get a fair share. I predict to you they \nwill not.\n  If the Dole block grant is adopted, the block grant amendment \nintroduced by Senator Dole gives targeted aid to urban areas. The \nformula for the block grants is targeted to high-crime areas, weighs \npopulation in its equation for determining crime rates, and the formula \nguarantees that urban areas will receive targeted funds while assuming \nthat most rural areas will not receive such aid.\n  In 1993, the most recent year for which data is available, the murder \nrate grew 3.4 percent in rural America and it decreased 2.8 percent in \nthe Nation's largest cities. Similarly, the violent crime rate rose 1.4 \npercent in rural areas, while it decreased 3.4 percent in the largest \ncities.\n  But the Dole block grant proposal that is in this bill targets aid to \nthe most populous areas. It clearly does not target funds to those \nareas most in need, rural America. While violent crime rates, including \nhomicide, forcible rape and assault, are declining in urban areas, they \nare clearly on the rise in rural America. And rural America does not \nreceive the funds under this block grant proposal. Rural areas have \nhistorically had the hardest time producing funds for law enforcement, \nand it seems to me we should not allow these areas to continue to \nreceive less attention and less antidrug-related money than urban areas \njust because they are less populous.\n  This is just an example of the creative budget games that are going \non. By providing open-ended block grant funds which may be used for \nthis or any other program, while at the same time significantly cutting \nthe amount of total funding available, my friends are limiting programs \nsuch as rural drug enforcement block grants without doing so directly \nbecause of where they will have to compete.\n  The last point I wish to speak to at this moment is the boot camps.\n  Our ability to reduce crime in a manner depends directly upon our \nability to target offenders with the appropriate time of sentence.\n  This means, of course, we have to identify violent offenders and make \nsure they go to prison. But it also means we must separate out the \nnonviolent offenders who can be diverted, potentially, from a career of \ncrime through an intensive cost-effective programs such as military-\nstyle boot camps.\n  That is exactly what we did in 1994 with the Biden crime law. We \nencouraged the States to identify nonviolent offenders and offer them \nalternative, more cost-effective programs while we, in fact, kept them \nincarcerated. We provide $9.7 billion to States to build and operate \nprisons and we gave them the option to use a portion of that money for \nboot camps.\n  This appropriations bill would completely eliminate State flexibility \nto use boot camps for nonviolent offenders in order to free up \nconventional prison cells for violent offenders. My amendment would \nrestore the State option, the State flexibility to use boot camps for \nnonviolent offenders, to use their Federal prison money for boot camps.\n  Let me first tell my colleagues a little bit about boot camps so they \ncan be clear what we are talking about. Boot camps provide a regimented \nprogram of work and exercise for young, nonviolent offenders. And they \nhave shown marked success with young offenders who learn discipline and \nrespect for law and authority.\n  They are put behind barbed wire. They are locked in. They are \nessentially put in Quonset huts. Some argue it is inhumane. I argue if \nit is good enough for a marine to sleep in a Quonset hut, it did not \nhurt him very much, it sure in heck should not be too tough to put a \nconvicted person, a nonviolent person in such a circumstance.\n  At the time we did this in the Biden crime bill just about everybody \nstood up and supported boot camps. It was one of the few things \neverybody agreed on. Now I am a little concerned. I do not know what \nhas happened that we would go contrary to the trend of the last year, \nwhich is to give States more flexibility. I have heard no one argue \nthese boot camps are not worthwhile. I have heard no one argue that \nStates should not be allowed to have them. And I have heard no one \nargue that States should not have flexibility. So, maybe it was an \noversight that States were explicitly prevented from using their prison \nmoney to build boot camps. I do not know. But the bottom line is quite \nsimple. Boot camps work to do one very important thing--I suspect many \nothers, but one. That is, I will end where I started.\n  Two years ago the States convicted--not in Federal court, in State \ncourt--several hundred thousand violent offenders were convicted in the \nState court system. Mr. President, 30,000 convicted, violent offenders \nnever spent a day in jail--30,000, in the States; 30,000 convicted \nState felons, violent felons, never served a day in jail. The reason \nthey did not is because the State legislatures did not want to go back \nto their folks in the State and say to get tough on crime we have to \nbuild more prisons. To get tough on crime we have to raise your taxes. \nTo get tough on crime we are going to increase our spending. Most \nStates did not do that.\n  What this does, it gives the States the option to be cost effective. \nFor 40 percent of cost, they can take the nonviolent offenders, who are \nserving time in a penitentiary, behind bars, in a secure, maximum \nsecurity facility, put them behind barbed wire with folks with guns \nwatching them, in Quonset huts, and free up hard-core prison space for \nthe violent offenders.\n  At a minimum that is what boot camps do. At a minimum. They also do \nmuch more. But in the interests of time I will not belabor the Senate \nwith that argument.\n  So, to sum up, what I do here is I come up with a total of $117 \nmillion in shifting around of how the Appropriations Committee \nallocates the money. I take $117 million and I get it two ways. One, I \ntake a total of $21.2 million from State prisons, which were increased \nby a quarter-billion dollars by this committee over the requested \namount, and over what the House has, still leaving a total of $225 \nmillion for prison grants. And I take money by increased fees on people \nobtaining green cards, because they now would have to go home and spend \nthe cost of going home and back to be able to get the green card and \nnow they do not have to do that. It is not onerous. It is a reasonable \ncharge for that privilege. And that is how I get the $117 million in \noffsets.\n  I take that money and I put it in the drug courts, drug treatment and \nprisons and rural drugs as well as law enforcement, family support.\n  I thank my friend from New Hampshire for his indulgence in listening \nto my amendment and I will be happy to yield the floor for him or \nanyone else to speak against the amendment. But I ask unanimous consent \nto send the amendment to the desk, that no amendments to my amendment \nbe in order, and that my amendment be in order.\n  Mr. GREGG.

I send the amendment to the desk. \n\n[[Page S 14530]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself and Mr. \n     Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 2818.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 26, line 10, after ``Act;'' insert the following: \n     ``$27,000,000 for grants for residential substance abuse \n     treatment for State prisoners pursuant to section 1001(a)(17) \n     of the 1968 Act; $10,252,000 for grants for rural drug \n     enforcement assistance pursuant to section 1001(a)(9) of the \n     1968 Act;''.\n       On page 28, line 11, before ``$25,000,000'' insert \n     ``$150,000,000 shall be for drug courts pursuant to title V \n     of the 1994 Act''.\n       On page 29 line 6, strike ``$750,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$728,800,000''.\n       On page 29, line 15, after ``Act;'' insert the following: \n     ``$1,200,000 for Law Enforcement Family Support Programs, as \n     authorized by section 1001(a)(21) of the 1968 Act''.\n       On page 44, lines 8 and 9, strike ``conventional \n     correctional facilities, including prisons and jails,'' and \n     insert ``correctional facilities, including prisons and \n     jails, or boot camp facilities and other low cost \n     correctional facilities for nonviolent offenders that can \n     free conventional prison space''.\n       On page 20, line 16 strike all that follows to page 20 line \n     19 and insert:''\n       Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255(i)) is amended--\n       (1) in the second sentence of paragraph (1), by striking \n     ``five'' and inserting ``ten''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting before the period at the \n     end the following: ``or, notwithstanding any other provsion \n     of law, may be deposited as offsetting collections in the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'' appropriations account to be available to support \n     border enforcement and control programs''.\n       The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply to funds \n     remitted with applications for adjustment of status which \n     were filed on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       For activities authorized by section 130086 of Public Law \n     103-322, $10,300,000, to remain available until expended, \n     which shall be derived from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust \n     Fund.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I realize this is a mildly backward way of doing it, \nspeaking to it before I send it to the desk, but I did it, and I yield \nto the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the presentation of the \nSenator from Delaware. There is some which I agree with and some which \nI do not agree with. I would like to point out that I agree with his \ncomments relative to boot camp. We have used the boot camp process in \nNew Hampshire, and it has been quite successful. I have to believe that \nthe decision to drop the boot camp was inadvertent. I hope we will \ncorrect it.\n  If the Senator at some point wishes to divide his amendment and bring \nthat up separately, I would certainly be supportive of it. In any \nevent, hopefully we can at least work out that part of his amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Biden \namendment. I ask unanimous consent to be added as an original \ncosponsor. Included in this amendment is a provision to restore the \nCommunity Oriented Police Service Program and the local community crime \nprevention block grant and that is the part to which I would like to \naddress my remarks.\n  The bill the Senate is currently considering: (1) would dismantle the \nCOPS program, (2) would combine the COPS program and the crime \nprevention block grant into one big block grant, and (3) would cut the \nfunding for both.\n  I believe this would, first of all, open the door to funding anything \nunder the sun that a Governor determines is law enforcement or crime \nprevention. And, it effectively would eliminate all crime prevention \nfrom this crime bill that is now law. For when law enforcement is \npitted against crime prevention efforts, law enforcement always wins.\n  This, I say to my colleagues, turns the clock back on the commitment \nwe made last year to help communities fighting as well as prevent \ncrime.\n  Last year Congress passed and the President signed the Violent Crime \nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. A central part of the crime \nbill included money for the hiring, over 5 years, of 100,000 more \npolice officers under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) \nProgram. To date, under this program, more than 25,000 police officers \nhave been hired--in Minnesota alone, 354 new cops have been funded. \nImportantly, each of these officers was hired to be on the beat, not in \nthe office.\n  At a time of very tight budgets, the money for both the COPS Program \nand the crime prevention block grant come from savings achieved by \nreducing the Federal bureaucracy. None of these new police officers or \ncrime prevention programs are adding an additional burden on the \ntaxpayer. We, as a Congress, and indeed a country, made fighting crime \na top priority last year when we decided to use the savings from \nstreamlining the Federal Government and from cutting some domestic \nprograms for fighting crime.\n  The COPS Program is a good program. It is reaching and helping \ncommunities. It is very flexible. Local jurisdictions can work with the \nJustice Department to meet their particular needs. The Justice \nDepartment has acted swiftly, has minimized the paperwork, and has \nstaffed 800 numbers for immediate assistance. It is not surprising, \ntherefore, that approximately 200 Minnesota jurisdictions have \nparticipated in this program. What's more, just a few weeks ago \nAttorney General Janet Reno announced a new effort at the Department of \nJustice to target some of these new cops on the beat to helping address \ndomestic violence.\n  Having more cops involved in community policing fighting crime, means \nless crime. It is as simple as that. In only a short time the COPS \nProgram is already delivering on its promise of providing more police \nofficers in a very cost-effective, flexible manner. Not surprisingly \nthose on the front line in the fight against crime have only praise for \nthis program. Police chiefs, sheriffs, deputies, and rank-and-file \npolice officers all support this effort to put more police in \ncommunities.\n  But now this very successful, popular crime-fighting program is under \nattack by Republicans who want to convert its funding into a block \ngrant. Unfortunately, the Republican block grant plan does not \nstipulate that the money must be spent on hiring cops. Instead, the \nmoney can be redirected to fund restaurant inspectors, parking meters, \nradar guns--and any other of a host of things.\n  The money ought to be spent the way it was intended and the way law \nenforcement officials want it spent: to hire police officers. The \nNation's major police enforcement organizations all agree on this \npoint.\n  We all know that crime is one of the great plagues of our \ncommunities. People in the suburbs and people living downtown are \nafraid--they are afraid to go out at night, they are afraid to venture \ninto the skyways, they are afraid to leave their cars parked on the \nstreet. We also all know that having a larger police presence helps \ndeter the very crimes that people fear the most. Buying more parking \nmeters, radar guns, or hiring more restaurant inspectors does not \naddress this plague nor address peoples' legitimate fears.\n  It is peculiar that the party that claims to be tough on law and \norder is proposing as one of its first steps to change a successful, \ncost-effective ``law and order'' program--one that ought to have broad, \nbipartisan support.\n  Crime prevention was also an essential element of the crime bill. \nDespite the fact that at each step of the way in passing the Crime \nbill, prevention programs got watered down, in the end we decided that \ncrime prevention had to be part of this bill.\n  Two years ago, when Congress began consideration of the crime bill we \nstarted with a substantial portion of the crime bill addressing \nprevention; after all, prevention is crime control, stopping crime \nbefore it ever happens. It, by the way, included something that I think \nis extremely important--supervised visitation centers. A model that I \nbrought from Minnesota to help families with a history of violence.\n\n  Ultimately, we ended up with a crime bill that included a block grant \nto the States for prevention programs--the local community crime \nprevention \n\n[[Page S 14531]]\nblock grant. And, funding was not even authorized until FY 96. We \nhaven't even given it a chance to work and get into communities--one of \nthe few provisions in the crime bill that was intended to prevent \ncrime, one of the few provisions that was not funded until next year \nand some in Congress are trying to cut it off at the knees.\n  The Biden amendment would restore the crime bill structure and ensure \nthat some of the funds that were set aside as part of the Crime Control \nTrust Fund are spent on real prevention programs.\n  The local crime prevention block grant, like the COPS Program, \nprovides a lot of flexibility to the States and communities. Under this \nblock grant, communities can determine what types, within a general \nlist of about 14 different ideas, of prevention programs to fund, what \nprevention plans fit their community the best. But this block grant is \nfor prevention, nothing else. Again, it is one of the few aspects of \nthe crime bill that focuses on prevention, an essential element of any \ncrime fighting effort. And, as I stated earlier, it has not even had a \nchance to be implemented. This coming year would be the first year \nfunding will actually go to help communities.\n  I cannot emphasize enough how important crime prevention is--\nespecially now. And, under this appropriation bill very little, if any, \nfunding would go to prevent crime.\n  If we were to listen to people in the communities that are most \naffected by the violence, they would say to us you have to have the \nmoney in prevention. But how interesting it is that those who would \nessentially eliminate these prevention programs do not come from those \ncommunities, do not know the people in those communities, and I do not \nthink they asked the people in those communities at all what they think \nshould be done.\n  Mr. President, I can just tell you that in meeting with students, \nstudents that come from some pretty tough background--students at the \nWork Opportunity Center in Minneapolis, which is an alternative school, \nyoung students who are mothers and others who come from real difficult \ncircumstances, all of them said to me: You can build more prisons and \nyou can build more jails, but the issue for us is jobs, opportunity. \nYou will never stop this cycle of violence unless you do something that \nprevents it in the first place.\n  Then I turn to the judges, the sheriffs, and the police chiefs, and I \ncall them on the phone in Minnesota, and I ask them what they think. \nAnd they say yes we need community police and yes we need the other \nparts of the crime law, but they all say, if you do not do something \nabout preventing crime, if these young people do not have these \nopportunities, if we do not get serious about reducing violence in the \nhome, do not believe for a moment that we are going to stop the cycle \nof violence.\n  Mr. President, I believe that a highly trained police, highly \nmotivated, community-based, sensitive to the people in the communities, \ncan make a difference. They are wanted and they are needed. But the \nbill we are considering today will do nothing to prevent the criminal \nof tomorrow. And indeed without more cops on the beat it may not do \nmuch to fight the criminals of today.\n  Every 5 seconds a child drops out of school in America. This is from \nthe Children's Defense Fund study. Every 5 seconds a child drops out of \na public school in the United States of America. Every 30 seconds a \nbaby is born into poverty. Every 2 minutes a baby is born with a low \nbirthweight. Every 2 minutes a baby is born to a mother who had no \nprenatal care.\n  Every 4 minutes a child is arrested for an alcohol-related crime. \nEvery 7 minutes a child is arrested for selling drugs. Every 2 hours a \nchild is murdered. Every 4 hours a child commits suicide, takes his or \nher life in the United States of America. And every 5 minutes a child \nis arrested for a violent crime.\n  Mr. President, if we do not continue to be serious about the \nprevention part, we are not going to stop the cycle of violence.\n  All too many young people are growing up in neighborhoods and \ncommunities in our country where if they bump into someone or look at \nsomeone the wrong way they are in trouble, where there is too much \nviolence in their homes, where violence pervades every aspect of their \nlife. And people who grow up in such brutal circumstances can become \nbrutal. And that should not surprise any of us.\n  Prevention and law enforcement--both essential elements of any crime \nfighting effort. These two should not have to compete with each other \nfor funding, nor should funding be cut for either.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment.\n\n\n                     in defense of the cops program\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a program that \nis vital to each and every one of us. It is vital to the safety of our \nStates, of our towns, of our communities. In 1994, Congress passed the \nomnibus crime bill. Among other things, this important legislation will \nput 100,000 more police officers on the street through the Community \nOriented Policing Services Program--or COPS Program.\n  Today, as I stand in this Chamber, there are over 25,000 officers \nthat would not be out there--protecting citizens in communities across \nthis country--if it were not for the COPS Program.\n  If we eliminate this program and turn the fund over to the States in \na block grant, as the Appropriations Committee has proposed, there is \nno guarantee that a single additional police officer will be hired. Not \none. We made a commitment to the American people when we passed the \ncrime bill. all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, made a \ncommitment to the citizens of this country that we would work with them \nto reduce crime. The COPS Program insures that more police officers \nwill be on the beat in towns and communities across the country.\n  Mr. President, of the 100,000 new police officers promised, almost \n26,000 have already been hired--253 in Arkansas alone. Our police \ndepartments are made up of men and women who put their lives on the \nline every day to make our streets safer--not just in big urban areas, \nbut in small towns and rural areas. With a block grant, funds may not \nfilter down to small towns that desperately need the extra help. They \nare being asked to do more with less as crime rates continue to rise \nrapidly. Gangs and drug dealers are migrating out of the larger, more \nsizable cities and into the smaller towns at an alarming rate.\n  It is our duty, Mr. President, to assist the prevention of crime in \nour country. The major law enforcement organizations in my State of \nArkansas, as well as across the country, have united in support the \nCOPS Program. They tell us that this program is working, that it is \ngetting more officers on the streets. So why are we eliminating a \nprogram that is working?\n  I have received phone calls and letters from police chiefs and \nsheriffs in towns, both large and small, throughout my State praising \nthis program.\n  For example, the Danville Police Department in Danville, Arkansas, \nhas, through the COPS Program, been able to hire an additional officer \nto patrol the streets at night. In the month since Mike Pyburn has been \nhired, he has already made a drug arrest. As he was patrolling the \nstreets one night, Officer Pyburn spotted and stopped a person with a \nwarrant out on a misdemeanor. In this person's possession at the time \nof the arrest was 14 individually wrapped bags of marijuana. The COPS \nProgram enabled this officer to be on the job and get these illegal \ndrugs off the streets of Danville. This is one of many arrests this \nofficer has made. Having additional night patrols has not only improved \npublic safety, it has relieved the people's fears. The citizens of \nDanville can now sleep at night feeling a little safer because Officer \nPyburn is on duty.\n  Colonel John Bailey, the Director of the Arkansas State Police, put \nthe importance of the COPS Program into simple terms. He said that \n``This program puts the money where the problem is. In five years, \nanyone in Washington can come down and I'll say, `This is what your \nmoney provided for us. Here he is.' and introduce them to my new \nofficer.'' You can't necessarily say that with block grant funds, Mr. \nPresident.\n  This program is effective, and it is easy for law enforcement \nagencies to \n\n[[Page S 14532]]\napply for the additional officers they so desperately need. Unlike most \nFederal grant programs, there are not pages and pages of complicated \nforms to be filled out, and extensive regulations to follow. For small \ntowns, there is one page to fill out. That's it. One page. And it takes \nless than an hour to fill out.\n  I have a letter from Larry Emison, the Sheriff of Craighead County in \nNortheast Arkansas. They also have used their COPS grant to add an \nadditional deputy to their night patrol. He has been in place since \nApril, but the community has noticed a difference and feels safer on \nthe streets, particularly at night. Mr. President, this feeling of \nsafety is due in large part to this officer made possible through the \nCOPS Program.\n  Chief Wiley White in DeValls Bluff has called this program ``a \nlifesaver for the community.'' He hired David Huggs, a former prison \nguard who he had been working with for years. Chief White told me that \nOfficer Huggs has ``been a miracle for this town.''\n  I have a lot of these stories, Mr. President. Officer Rebecca Hanson \nwas hired in Crittenden County, Arkansas, to investigate criminal \nsexual abuse to children. Officer Hanson has special training in \ninterviewing children about the abuse they have suffered. In her first \n5 months since being hired, Officer Hanson has handled a total of 42 \ncases, resulting in 7 arrests. We can only speculate as to what might \nhave happened to these innocent children if it hadn't been for Officer \nHanson's presence on the police force.\n  The Morning News of Northwest Arkansas reported in July how valuable \nthe COPS Program has been to the Rogers Police Department and the \ncitizens of Northwest Arkansas. Two new officers have been added to \ntheir force. According to the article, Capt. Steve Russell of the \nRogers Police Department said that the grant program has given them the \nopportunity to have additional personnel that they would not have had \notherwise. Captain Russell said the COPS FAST grant program is an \nexample of how the Federal Government can make it easier for local \nagencies to reap the benefits of Federal programs. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the article be printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous \nconsent that a few of the letters I have received on the COPS Program \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From the Morning News of Northwest Arkansas, July 19, 1995]\n\n                    Police Department Receives Grant\n\n                           (By Thomas Sissom)\n\n       The Rogers Police Department will reap the benefits of \n     President Clinton's campaign promise to put 100,000 more law-\n     enforcement officers on the streets with the receipt of a \n     $132,337 COPS FAST grant.\n       ``It certainly is a valuable program to local and rural \n     law-enforcement agencies,'' Capt. Steve Russell, \n     administrative commander of the Rogers Police Department, \n     said Tuesday. ``It's given us . . .the opportunity to have \n     additional personnel we wouldn't otherwise have had.''\n       The COPS FAST program operates under the office of \n     Community Oriented Policing Services of the U.S. Department \n     of Justice. The grant program is designed to help law-\n     enforcement agencies immediately increase their available \n     manpower. The three-year program will allow the Rogers Police \n     Department to add two new officers with the federal grant of \n     $132,337 added to $44,113 in local funds to cover the cost in \n     salaries and benefits of $176,450 over the three years of the \n     grant. After the grant ends, all of the costs will be borne \n     by the local agency.\n       Russell said the COPS FAST grant program is an example of \n     how the federal government can make it easier for local \n     agencies to reap the benefits of federal programs.\n       ``This was one of the fastest programs we've seen, in terms \n     of the time from the application to us getting the money,'' \n     Russell said. ``That just allows us to put more police on the \n     streets faster, which we certainly need. The application \n     process was very simple, unlike most federal grants.''\n       Russell said the Rogers department currently has 59 \n     certified law-enforcement officers, with one approved slot \n     remaining open. The department has four officers who are just \n     completing their 10-week training course at the Arkansas Law \n     Enforcement Training Academy in Camden. Another five are \n     scheduled to start the course Monday. Officers who \n     successfully complete the academy training course still have \n     to complete another 12 weeks of field training with the \n     department, he said, giving new officers about six months of \n     initial training.\n       According to Russell, the Rogers Police Department's \n     staffing levels are below national average for law-\n     enforcement agencies. Rogers has 1.82 officers for every \n     1,000 people. The national average is 2.65 officers per 1,000 \n     people. To reach the national average, he said, Rogers would \n     need 87 officers.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Police Department,\n\n\n                                          City of Bull Shoals,\n\n                                  Bull Shoals, AR, August 1, 1995.\n     Senator David Pryor,\n     267 Russell,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator, I wish to express my sincere thanks for all your \n     work related to the ``Cops'' Programs. As I am sure you know, \n     my Department received a grant to add an Officer to the \n     staff. That hiring has turned out to be a very progressive \n     move. Our citizen contacts have risen markedly, and the \n     results have been very positive.\n       Charles Robert Chapman is the Officer who was hired. Since \n     his employment, which began 04-15-95, Officer Chapman has \n     been very productive. Within the first month Officer Chapman \n     was on the street he developed the information which lead to \n     a search warrant and arrest of a 32 year old male subject on \n     the charge of being a Felon in Possession of Firearm. The \n     subject who was disarmed, had been convicted and jailed on \n     Felonies for Burglary and Drugs. Officer Chapman also \n     developed information from a citizen that led to the location \n     and confiscation of Marijuana plants being grown on Federal \n     Property. I know that in many Cities these cases along with \n     several cases related to weapons, probation violations, \n     domestic batteries and DWI, would not make an Officer stand \n     out. But here in a relatively secure retirement and \n     recreation area these significant arrests go a long way to \n     ease and assure the minds of our citizens. I have been \n     involved in Law Enforcement for over 20 years and have never \n     seen an Officer so well accepted and welcomed into a \n     community. The ``Cops'' program is what facilitated this \n     boost to our Department.\n       Again thank You for all your work. I would also like to \n     compliment a member of your staff, Cynthia Wetmore, who has \n     always been very responsive and made many of the processes \n     much easier.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert R. Wochner,\n     Chief of Police.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Office of \n           the Chancellor,\n                                                    July 20, 1995.\n     Sheriff Dick Busby,\n     Crittenden County Sheriff Dept.,\n     Marion, AR.\n       Dear Sheriff Busby: As Multi-disciplinary Team Project \n     Coordinator for the Arkansas Commission on Child Abuse, Rape \n     and Domestic Violence, I wanted to commend your department \n     for their involvement on the Crittenden County Multi-\n     disciplinary Team. The dedication of local community \n     professionals has had a positive impact upon the child abuse \n     victims in your county. The Commission is particularly \n     pleased with the number of joint investigations being \n     conducted. Crittenden County is one of the few counties \n     involved in joint investigations.

August 2, 1995.\n     Senator David Pryor,\n     Russell Building, Room 267,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Attn: Cynthia Wetmore\n     REF: COPS Grant\n\n       Dear Senator Pryor: We are very pleased to be the recipient \n     of a COPS grant for 1 deputy sheriff. Due to a lack of \n     manpower in the past, our night patrol was lacking. This \n     additional deputy has been placed on the night shift, \n     therefore, giving us at least 2 deputies per night patrolling \n     Craighead county. This has only been in place a short period \n     of time and I can already see a difference with this \n     additional coverage. I have had several comments from \n     citizens within the county, stating that they now see a \n     patrol car at night more than they have in the past.\n       I want to personally thank you, Congress, and President \n     Clinton for making this program available. This will make \n     great difference in the fight against crime in the United \n     States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Larry Emison,\n                                         Craighead County Sheriff.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, putting an additional 100,000 officers on \nthe streets is a promise that this body made last year when it passed \nthe crime bill. It is our duty to continue this vital program that \nrepresents an approximate 20 percent increase in the American police \nforce. What the American people want is to feel safe in their homes and \non the streets of their neighborhoods. They deserve this safety and the \nCOPS Program is delivering it to them. I urge my colleagues to \n\n[[Page S 14533]]\nstand with me in protecting what is important to our country. I urge \nyou to vote to save the COPS Program.\n\n\n                   legal services to Native Americans\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I seek a few moments in order to seek \nclarification from my esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from \nAlaska, with regard to language that is contained in an amendment \nproposed by my colleague. When the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \nState and the Judiciary met to consider H.R. 2076, the appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1996, Senator Stevens proposed an amendment to the \namendment proposed by the esteemed chairman of the full committee, \nSenator Hatfield, relating to the provision of legal services as it \naffects Native American households.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my amendment, which was adopted by the \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary on September 7, \n1995, provides that in States that have significant numbers of eligible \nNative American households, grants to such States would equal an amount \nthat is 140 percent of the amount such states would otherwise receive. \nMy amendment was necessary in order to prevent a serious reduction in \nlegal services to Native Americans. Under current law, there is a \nseparate, additional appropriation for legal services to the Native \nAmerican community. The Legal Services Corporation is also given the \nflexibility to allocate additional resources to States like Alaska, \nwhich experience increased costs due to the difficulty of providing \nlegal services to remote populations, many of which are comprised of \nNative Americans. Given the fact that the Legal Services Corporation, \nincluding the separate Native American appropriation, was eliminated \nthe committee's bill, my amendment was necessary in order to ensure the \ncontinued provision of legal services to the Native American community.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to express my deep appreciation to \nmy colleague from Alaska for his efforts in this area, and for \nrecognizing that the significant needs for legal assistance in Native \nAmerican communities span a broad range of issues, from housing and \nsanitation to health care and education. In my own State of Hawaii, \nNative Hawaiians comprise less than 13 percent of the population, but \nrepresent more than 40 percent of the prison inmate population. Native \nHawaiians have twice the unemployment rate of the State's general \npopulation and represent 30 percent of the State's recipients of aid to \nfamilies with dependent children. Over 1,000 Native Hawaiians are \nhomeless, representing 30 percent of the State's homeless population. \nNative Hawaiians have the lowest life expectancy, the highest death \nrate, and the highest infant mortality rate of any other group in the \nState. Moreover, they have the lowest education levels and the highest \nsuicide rate in Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, in my State, we have the Native Hawaiian Legal Corp. \n[NHLC], a nonprofit organization established to provide legal services \nto Native Hawaiian community. NHLC has a 20 year history of providing \nexemplary legal assistance to Native Hawaiians, and it has long been \naffiliated with the Native American Rights Fund. Fifteen percent of \nNHLC's annual funding comes from the Native American portion of the \nLegal Services Corporation budget. It is my understanding that the \nlanguage proposed by my esteemed colleague from Alaska is to ensure the \ncontinued provision of legal services to Native Americans that are \ncurrently being provided through a separate Native American allocation \nof the funding provided to the Legal Services Corporation. My question \nof my colleague from Alaska is whether it is his intent that Native \nHawaiians would continue to be eligible to receive funds appropriated \nfor the provision of legal services under your amendment, consistent \nwith the current situation under the Legal Services Corporation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for his earlier comments. My \ncolleague from Hawaii, in his capacity as the former chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, has traveled many, many times to my State of \nAlaska, and I know that he has come to appreciate the very difficult \ncircumstances under which the vast majority of our native villages \nlive. I know the challenges the Senator from Hawaii faces in trying to \nmeet the needs of native communities in the State of Hawaii, and I \ntherefore understand full well his desire to clarify the meaning of \n``Native American households''. When I proposed this language, it was \nmy intention to ensure that those Native American communities, \nincluding native Hawaiian households, currently being served by the \nLegal Services Corporation would continue to have access to legal \nservices under the block grant approach proposed by Senator Hatfield. \nHave I sufficiently addressed my colleague's concerns?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues from Alaska, \nfor clarifying this matter for me. I am certain that the native \nHawaiian community will be most appreciative of the Senator's \nclarification.\n\n\n                 ABUSES INVOLVING MICROWAVE INCUMBENTS\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would like to raise an issue that has become of concern \nto several members of this committee on both sides of the aisle.\n  Previously, as chairman of this committee and of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee, the Senator from South Carolina was instrumental in \nestablishing spectrum auctions for new PCS services, and was a guiding \nforce on developing the rules that were adopted by the FCC governing \nrelocation of microwave licensees out of this spectrum.\n  He is aware, as we have discussed, that certain enterprising \nindividuals have recruited a number of microwave incumbents as clients \nand now seem to be manipulating the FCC rules on microwave relocation \nto leverage exorbitant payments from new PCS licensees.\n  I am advised that if this practice continues unchecked, more and more \nmicrowave incumbents are likely to employ these unintended tactics. \nMore importantly, it will reportedly devalue spectrum in future \nauctions to the tune of up to $2 billion as future bidders factor this \nsuccessful gamesmanship into their bidding strategy. Previously scored \nrevenue for deficit reduction will be unfairly diverted instead into \nprivate pockets.\n  Would the Senator agree with me:\n  First, that this type of gaming of relocation negotiations was \nunintended, is unreasonable, and should not be permitted to continue \nunchecked;\n  Second, that the affected parties should attempt to agree on a \nmutually acceptable solution to this problem;\n  Third, that if an acceptable compromise cannot be brought forth by \nthe affected parties within a reasonable time period, then either \nCongress or the FCC should address this matter as quickly as possible \nwith appropriate remedies?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my colleague for raising this issue. As he \nnoted, I offered an amendment on the State, Justice, Commerce \nAppropriations bill in 1992 on this issue. The electric utilities, oil \npipelines, and railroads must have reliable communications systems. The \nFCC initially proposed to move these utilities' communications systems \nfrom the 2 gigahertz band to the 6 gigahertz band without ensuring that \nthe 6 gigahertz band would provide reliable communications.\n  My amendment, which the FCC subsequently adopted in its rules, \nguaranteed that the utilities could only be moved out of the 2 \ngigahertz band if they are given 3 years to negotiate an agreement, if \ntheir costs of moving to the new frequency are paid for, and if the \nreliability of their communications at the new frequency is guaranteed.\n  Now I understand that some of the incumbent users may be taking \nadvantage of the negotiation period to delay the introduction of new \ntechnologies. It was certainly not my intention to give the incumbent \nusers an incentive to delay moving to the 6 gigahertz band purely to \nobtain more money. I agree with my friend that the parties involved in \nthis issue should try to work out an acceptable solution to this issue. \nIf the parties cannot agree to work out a compromise, I believe that \nCongress or the FCC may need to revisit this issue.\n\n\n                       women's business programs\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON, Mr. President, I would like to address an important \nportion of the Hatfield amendment, preservation of Small Business \nAdministration funding for women's business programs.\n  I believe the issue of women in business needs to be placed in the \nclearer context.\n\n[[Page S 14534]]\n\n  The new dynamics of the American economy have brought about a sea-\nchange in society. Thirty years ago, when most women entered the work \nforce, they did so to supplement their families' incomes. Most often, \nwomen working outside the home did so in clerical and support roles.\n  Thirty years ago, a young couple could live on the income of one \nprofessional. On that income, a schoolteacher could buy a nice house in \na good neighborhood. Young families could hope to save, drive a nice \ncar, educate their children, and take vacations. Today many cannot.\n  Economic restructuring and societal changes have accelerated the \nentry of women into the work force, into the professions and into \nbusiness. We see the challenges these changes have generated all around \nus.\n  Nothing has been more exciting and challenging, though, than the \nemergence of women as business builders and entrepreneurs. Without \nexception, every aspect of business offers extraordinary opportunities \nfor women.\n  Women-owned firms are an increasingly dynamic sector of our economy.\n  According to the most recent census data available--1982-87--the \nnumber of women-owned firms increased by 57 percent--more than twice \nthe rate of all U.S. businesses.\n  These businesses employed 35 percent more people in the United States \nthan the Fortune 500 companies employed worldwide, and had a payroll of \nnearly $41 billion.\n  More women-owned businesses have staying power--over 40 percent have \nbeen in business for 12 or more years.\n  Businesses owned by women tend to hire more women. It is not unusual \nto find that two-thirds of their employees are women.\n  In 1993, the Small Business Administration's flagship lending \nprogram, the 7(a) program, guaranteed 25,000 loans totaling $6.4 \nbillion to women-owned businesses. While women-owned businesses \naccounted for nearly one-third of all small businesses, they only made \nup about 10 percent of loan recipients that year. In 1994, that total \nrose to 24 percent.\n  In spite of their successes in getting started in providing \nemployment, one of the biggest impediments that women-owned businesses \nface today is constraints on their growth--they remain small. Women-\nowned businesses average annual sales of $67,000, compared to $140,000 \nin sales for all small businesses.\n\n  That is why, Mr. President, the National Women's Business Council and \nthe Women's Business Ownership Development Program are so important.\n  The National Women's Business Council monitors plans and programs \ndeveloped in the private and public sector which affect the ability of \nwomen-owned businesses to obtain capital and credit. The council also \ndevelops and promotes new initiatives, policies and plans designed to \nfoster women's business enterprises.\n  It has conducted: symposiums on getting access to capital, in \nconjunction with the Federal Reserve; and informational meetings on \nFederal Government procurement contract opportunities for women-owned \nbusinesses.\n  In November, the council plans to initiate a project with \nNorthwestern University's Kellogg School of Management to develop an \nagenda for national research on women's entrepreneurship.\n  The continuation of current funding for this council's salaries and \nexpenses at a level of $200,000 represents a modest--but prudent--\ninvestment in our Nation's business sector.\n  There is an urgent argument to be made for well-thought-out \ninitiatives aimed at encouraging more women to create their own \nbusinesses:\n  Here are some disturbing facts: half of all working women are sole \nsupport for themselves and their families; and women and the children \nthey support comprise more than 75 percent of people who live in \npoverty in the United States.\n  Mr. President, if we as a Nation want to reduce the reliance of women \nand children on welfare and social service programs, these women must \nbecome economically self-sufficient--and the opportunity for self-\nsufficiency will most likely come from women-owned enterprises.\n  The Women's Business Ownership Development Program addresses these \nproblems in constructive ways. It is a public-private partnership whose \ngoal is the creation of new jobs, increasing the earning potential of \nwomen, and forging a larger pool of skilled women entrepreneurs.\n  There are 38 demonstration sites in 20 States, with plans for more. \nMore than 25,000 clients have been served in urban and rural locations. \nEach center tailors its program to the particular needs of the \ncommunity. Training activities include: assistance in accessing \ncapital; management assistance; marketing and procurement assistance; \nand specialized programs that address home-based businesses and \ninternational trade.\n  The North Texas Women's Business Development Center, which is being \ndedicated tomorrow, is a shining example of the promise this program \nholds. It is a collective effort of the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, the North Texas Women's Business Council, the Greater \nDallas Chamber of Commerce, the Dallas-Fort Worth Minority Business \nDevelopment Corp. and the Dallas County Community College.\n  Under the auspices of the Women's Business Consortium, this broad-\nbased, private-sector supported initiative will help start-up and \ngrowing women-owned businesses. One of the areas on which they will \nconcentrate is Government contracting opportunities for women.\n  Four million dollars will help establish demonstration sites like the \none in Dallas in cities all across this country.\n  Programs like the National Women's Business Council and the Women's \nBusiness Ownership Development Program--modest in scope but \nbreathtaking in the possibilities they hold out to those willing to \nwork hard--have the potential to turn America around. I am pleased my \ncolleagues saw their value and agreed to continued funding.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my concern \nabout the programs that are suffering as a result of the appropriations \nin this bill. The programs that I am referring to are critical to the \nfuture of the U.S. economy. Economic security, competitiveness, jobs. \nThat is what is at risk.\n  Technology development is slated to be the victim of our budget axe. \nInvestments in technology are investments in our future and should not \nbe terminated. In our enthusiasm to make cuts to balance the budget we \nare losing sight of the reason we want to balance the budget in the \nfirst place--to make our economy stronger. The irony is that by cutting \ntechnology programs we are cutting programs that are already making our \neconomy stronger. We will be defeating our own purpose.\n  I am particularly concerned about the integration of the technology \nand trade functions in the Department of Commerce. Within the \nDepartment of Commerce there are programs that work with the private \nsector to foster new ideas that may underpin the next generation of \nproducts. This is one of the few places where information channels are \ndeveloped that make sure that the ideas generated in our world class \nresearch institutions find their way into the marketplace. Previous \nAdministrations had the foresight to realize that we are entering a new \nera, an era where economic battles are as fiercely fought as any \nprevious military actions. New kinds of technology programs were begun \nwith bipartisan support to make sure that the United States was well \narmed for these economic battles. I do not want to see us lose our \ntechnology edge in the marketplace, because this edge translates \ndirectly into jobs for our work force, new markets for American \nbusiness, improvements in our balance of trade, and from this economic \nsuccess, desperately needed revenues for our treasury. The home of \ntechnology programs is with our trade programs where they will have the \nmost impact and do the most good for our economy. The Technology \nAdministration is a critical component of the Department of Commerce \nand we need to make sure that its key functions are maintained.\n  Making changes in technology and trade functions at this juncture in \ntime must be done extremely carefully. New markets are emerging in \ndeveloping countries. Conservative estimates suggest that 60 percent of \nthe growth in world trade will be with these developing countries over \nthe next two decades. The United States has a large share of imports in \nbig emerging markets currently, in significant part because of the \nefforts of the Department \n\n[[Page S 14535]]\nof Commerce. While we are making changes in the Department of Commerce, \nour foreign competitors are increasing their investments in their \neconomies. Competing advanced economies are just waiting for us to make \na move that will weaken our economic capacity. We cannot afford to \ndismantle successful programs that are making and keeping the United \nState competitive. We should be sure that changes we make will be \nimproving the Government's efficiency and improving the taxpayer's \nreturn on investment.\n  The kind of technology programs that I am advocating are not \ncorporate welfare or techno pork. I find these terms not only \ninaccurate and derived from ignorance, but offensive. American industry \nis not looking for a handout. Quite the contrary. These programs are \nproviding incentives to elicit support from the private sector for \nprograms that are the responsibility of the Government. Times are tough \nand the Government needs to cut back, so we are looking for the handout \nfrom private industry, not the other way around. Let me explain.\n  Everyone agrees that when markets fail, it is legitimate to have the \nGovernment step in. For example, so-called basic research, the \nGovernment funds, because no one industry can capture the benefits of \nthe investment. Basic research is described as research that is so far \nreaching that it will impact a wide array of applications in a variety \nof different industries on a timeframe that could be quite long. No one \nexpects a single company to make an investment, when it can not capture \na sufficient return on its investment, or when the investment would be \ntoo risky or too long term. That would be bad business. I agree with \nthis definition of basic research and I agree with these criteria for \nthe appropriate role for government investments. These criteria apply \nequally to investment in technology research, as long as the technology \nresearch is precompetitive, high risk, and long term.\n  So-called basic research has also been defined as research that does \nnot have any clear application. This definition is puzzling. One could \nlegitimately ask, why perform research that deliberately has no \napplication? In reality, research is rather fickle and difficult to \npredict. Sometimes one can plot a nice logical progression from basic \nresearch, to applied research, to product development, but this is \nusually not the case. Often what appears to be basic research turns out \nto be product development, or applied research results in a fundamental \nbreakthrough with farreaching results, or as most commonly happens, at \nthe end of an experiment, the research scientist must go back to the \ndrawing board and try one more experiment before she can claim success. \nThus, the research scenario is complicated and trying to make clear \ndistinctions is artificial at best.\n  Our goal should be, not to try and categorize research, but to make \ninvestments that are appropriate, and that strengthen our economy. I \nbelieve that there is an important and legitimate role for government \nto play in technology research. The National Association of \nManufacturers has spoken out strongly in favor of the kind of \ntechnology programs that are run by the Department of Commerce. I would \nlike to read some quotes from their statement about Federal technology \nprograms:\n\n       The NAM is concerned that the magnitude and distribution of \n     the R spending cuts proposed thus far would erode US \n     technological leadership.\n       A successful national R policy requires a diverse \n     portfolio of programs that includes long- and short-term \n     science and technology programs, as well as the necessary \n     infrastructure to support them. The character of research \n     activities has changed substantially in the past decade, \n     making hard and fast distinctions between basic and applied \n     research or between research and development increasingly \n     artificial. R agendas today are driven by time horizons not \n     definitions. In short, rigid delineations between basic and \n     applied research are not the basis on which private sector \n     R strategies are executed, nor should they be the basis for \n     federal R policy decisions.\n       The NAM believes the disproportionate large cuts proposed \n     in newer R programs are a mistake. R programs of more \n     recent vintage enjoy considerable industry support for one \n     simple fact: They are more relevant to today's technology \n     challenges. For example, ``bridge'' programs that focus on \n     the problem of technology assimilation often yield greater \n     payoff to a wider public than programs aimed at technology \n     creation. Newer programs address current R challenges far \n     more effectively than older programs and should not fall \n     victim to the ``last hired, first fired'' prioritization.\n       In particular, partnership and bridge programs should not \n     only not be singled out for elimination, but should receive a \n     relatively greater share of what federal R spending \n     remains. These programs currently account for approximately 5 \n     percent of federal R spending. The NAM suggests that 15 \n     percent may be a more appropriate level.\n       Given the critical importance of R, far too much is being \n     cut on the basis of far too little understanding of the \n     implications. The world has changed considerably in the past \n     several years, and R is no different. Crafting a federal \n     R policy must take stock of these changes; to date this has \n     not happened.\n       As the major funder and performer of the R in the US, \n     industry believes its voice should be heard in setting the \n     national R agenda. The Congress and the Administration \n     should draw on industry's experience and expertise in \n     determining policy choices. For example, as a guide to \n     prioritizing federal R programs, the NAM would favor those \n     programs that embody the following attributes: industry led; \n     cost-shared; relevant to today's R challenges; partnership/\n     consortia; deployment-oriented; and dual use.\n       We believe these criteria provide the basis for creation of \n     a template for prioritizing federal R spending.\n       In sum, the NAM remains firmly committed to a balanced \n     federal budget. But we also firmly believe that the action \n     taken thus far in downsizing and altering the direction of US \n     R spending is tantamount to fighting hunger by eating the \n     seed corn. We urge the Congress to consider carefully the \n     impact of R on US economic vitality and to move forward in \n     crafting an R agenda that will sustain US technological \n     leadership far into the future.\n  I would like to describe two programs in which I have taken a \nparticular interest, the Advanced Technology Program [ATP] and the \nManufacturing Extension Program [MEP].\n\n\n                                  ATP\n\n  Dr. Alan Bromley, President Bush's Science Advisor in 1991, \ndetermined a list of 20 technologies that are critical to develop for \nthe United States to remain a world economic power. There has been very \nlittle disagreement among analysts and industry about the list. No one \ncompany benefits from these technologies, rather a variety of \nindustries would benefit with advances in any one of these areas. These \nare the kinds of areas that form the focus areas of the ATP. The focus \nareas are determined by industry, not by bureaucrats, to be key areas \nwhere research breakthroughs will advance the economy as a whole not \nsingle companies.\n  There is no doubt that industry benefits from partnering with the \nGovernment. The nature of the marketplace has changed, and \ntechnological advances are a crucial component in maintaining our \nstature in the new world marketplace. Product life cycles are getting \nmore and more compressed, so that the development of new products must \noccur at a more and more rapid pace. The market demands products \nfaster, at higher quality and in wider varieties--and the product must \nbe delivered just in time. Innovative technological advances enhance \nspeed, quality, and distribution, to deliver to customers the product \nthey want, when they want it. Ironically, the competitive market \ndemands that companies stay lean and mean, diminishing the resources \nthat are available for R programs that foster the kind of innovation \nnecessary to stay competitive. Because of all of these pressures, \nindustrial R is now focused on short-term product development at the \nexpense of long-term research to generate future generations of \nproducts.\n  The conclusion is clear. This short-term focus will lead to \ntechnological inferiority in the future. Our economy will suffer. Some \nof my colleagues in Congress believe that basic research will provide \nthe kind of innovation necessary to generate new generations of high-\ntechnology products. On the contrary, we have seen historically that \nbasic research performed in a vacuum, that is without communication \nwith industry, is unlikely to lead to products.\n  In this country, we have the best basic research anywhere in the \nworld. There is no contest. Yet, we continue to watch our creative \nbasic research capitalized by other nations. We must improve our \nability to get our brilliant ideas to market. Basic research focuses on \na time horizon of 10 to 20 years. Product development focuses on a time \n\n\n[[Page S 14536]]\nhorizon of less than 5 years, and sometimes much shorter than that. It \nis the intermediate timescale, the 5 to 15-year time-frame that is \ncritical to develop a research idea into a product concept.\n  We have a responsibility to make sure that our private sector does \nnot fall behind in the global economy. Diminishing our technological \npreparedness is tantamount to unilateral disarmament, in an \nincreasingly competitive global marketplace. Government/industry \npartnerships stimulate just the kind of innovative research that can \nkeep our technological industry at the leading edge. These partnerships \nhelp fill the gap between short-term product development, and basic \nresearch.\n  American companies no longer survive by thinking only about the \nnational marketplace. They must think globally. Familiar competitors \nlike Japan and Germany, continue to compete aggressively in global \nmarkets. New challenges are coming from India, China, Malaysia, \nThailand, some of the leading Latin American nations and more. We \ncannot afford to let jobs and profits gradually move overseas to these \nchallengers, by resting on our laurels, complacent in our successes. \nOther countries, seeing the success of the ATP, are starting to imitate \nit, just as we are considering doing away with it. Our competitors must \nbe chuckling at their good fortune, and our shortsightedness. We simply \ncannot afford to cut the ATP.\n\n\n                                  MEP\n\n  The state of manufacturing in this country is mixed. On the one hand \nour manufacturing productivity is increasing, but on the other hand we \nare losing manufacturing jobs by the millions. Manufacturing which once \nwas the lifeblood of our economy is bleeding jobs overseas. We need to \nprovide the infrastructure that insures that our manufacturing industry \nflourishes.\n  As I look at our manufacturing competitors, I am struck by how little \nwe do to support this critical component of our economy. In the United \nStates we are used to being the leaders in technologies of all kinds. \nHistorically, English words have crept into foreign languages, because \nwe were the inventors of new scientific concepts, technology, and \nproducts. Now when you describe the state-of-the-art manufacturing \npractices you use words like ``kanban'' and ``pokaoke.'' These are \nJapanese words that are known to production workers all over the United \nStates. Kanban is a word which describes an efficient method of \ninventory management, and pokaoke is a method of making part of a \nproduction process immune from error or mistake proof thereby \nincreasing the quality of the end product. We have learned these \ntechniques from the Japanese, in order to compete with them.\n  In a global economy, there is no choice, a company must become state-\nof-the-art or it will go under. We must recognize that our policies \nmust change with the marketplace and adapt our manufacturing strategy \nto compete in this new global marketplace. The Manufacturing Extension \nProgram [MEP] is a big step forward in reforming the role of government \nin manufacturing. This forward looking program was begun under \nPresident Reagan, and has received growing support from Congress since \n1989.\n  The focus of the MEP Program is one that historically has been \naccepted as a proper role of government: education. The MEP strives to \neducate small- and mid-sized manufacturers in the best practices that \nare available for their manufacturing processes. With the MEP we have \nthe opportunity to play a constructive role in keeping our companies \ncompetitive in a fiercely competitive, rapidly changing field. When \nmanufacturing practices change so rapidly, it is the small- and mid-\nsized companies that suffer. They cannot afford to invest the necessary \ntime and capital to explore all new trends to determine which practices \nto adopt and then to train their workers, invest in new equipment, and \nrestructure their factories to accommodate the changes. The MEP's act \nas a library of manufacturing practices, staying current on the latest \ninnovations, and educating companies on how to get the best results. At \nthe heart of the MEP is a team of teachers, engineers, and experts with \nstrong private sector experience ready to reach small firms and their \nworkers about the latest manufacturing advances.\n  Another benefit of the MEP is that it brings its clients into contact \nwith other manufacturers, universities, national labs and any other \ninstitutions where they might find solutions to their problems. \nFacilitating these contacts incorporates small manufacturers into a \nmanufacturing network, and this networking among manufacturers is a \npowerful competitive advantage. With close connections, suppliers begin \nworking with customers at early stages of design and engineering. When \nsuppliers and customers work together on product design, suppliers can \nprovide the input that makes manufacturing more efficient, customers \ncan communicate their specifications and timetables more effectively, \nand long-term productive relationships are forged. These supplier/\ncustomer networks are common practice in other countries, and lead to \nmore efficient and therefore more competitive, design, and production \npractices.\n  The MEP is our important tool in keeping our small manufacturers \ncompetitive. We are staying competitive in markets that have become \nhotbeds of global competition, and we are beginning to capture some new \nmarkets. More importantly, companies that have made use of MEP are \ngenerating new jobs rather than laying off workers or moving jobs \noverseas. These companies are growing and contributing to real growth \nin the U.S. economy. For each Federal dollar invested in a small- or \nmid-sized manufacturer through the MEP, there has been $8 of economic \ngrowth. This is a program that is paying for itself by growing our \neconomy.\n  Each MEP is funded after a competitive selection process, and \ncurrently there are 44 manufacturing technology centers in 32 States. \nOne requirement for the centers is that the States supply matching \nfunds, ensuring that centers are going where there is a \nlocallysupported need. In summary, the MEP provides the arsenal of \nequipment, training, and expertise that our small- and mid-sized \nmanufacturers need to keep them in the new global economic battlefield.\n  The ATP and the MEP are critical technology investments. They are \nboth run under the auspices of the National Institutes of Standards and \nTechnology, [NIST]. In addition to these NIST programs, NIST itself is \nat risk. I would like to bring to my colleagues' attention, a recent \nletter sent by 25 American Nobel prize winners in physics and the \npresidents of 18 scientific societies. As the New York Times put it \n``Budget cutters see fat where scientists see a national treasure.'' \nThese scientists are shocked and appalled that we could think of making \ncuts in NIST and its programs. According to the scientists ``It is \nunthinkable that a modern nation could expect to remain competitive \nwithout these services'' and they continue ``We recognize that your \neffort to balance the budget is forcing tough choices regarding the \nDepartment of Commerce, however the laboratories operated by NIST and \nfunded by the Department of Commerce are a vital scientific resource \nfor the Nation and should be preserved in the process of downsizing the \nFederal Government.'' These scientists are the leaders of the \nscientific community and we should not disregard their advice.\n  This amendment restores funding for NIST and its programs at a time \nwhen we cannot afford to be without their contributions to national \ncompetitiveness. Investments in the trade and technology functions in \nDepartment of Commerce are investments in our future economic health, \nin high wage jobs for our workers, in the American dream.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the vote \nscheduled for 9 p.m. this evening be postponed to occur at 10 a.m. \ntomorrow, Friday, and that immediately following the granting of this \nconsent, Senator Domenici be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, is it \nalso understood that we can follow as we originally intended to stack \nthe Domenici vote; namely, after the 10 a.m. vote on the Biden \namendment, we would have the Domenici vote? \n\n[[Page S 14537]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. That, to my knowledge, has not yet been agreed to with \nSenator Domenici. He will be here at 9 to begin debate on his \namendment. And at that time I would hope that such an agreement could \nbe reached with Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would hope so.\n  Pending that, Mr. President, I would have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nscheduled for 9 p.m. this evening be postponed to occur at 10 a.m. \nFriday, and immediately following the granting of this consent that \nSenator Domenici be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m. the Senate resume \nconsideration of the McCain amendment No. 2816 with 60 minutes equally \ndivided, that a vote occur following the Biden vote with 4 minutes \nequally divided between the two votes, and that following these votes, \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, did the Senator say I \nwould offer my amendment tonight or tomorrow?\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Immediately following this, the Senator would do it \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator be kind enough to yield \nfor 30 seconds?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Certainly.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2818, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. In the amendment which I sent to the desk numbered 2818, \nmy omnibus amendment, I made a mistake in two places in it in terms of \nnumbers. They were as described but different than written, and it has \nbeen cleared with the majority and minority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may modify my amendment, and I send \nthe modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to send an unprinted \namendment to the desk in a minute. This unprinted amendment is an \namendment to the committee amendment beginning on page 26, line 18 \nwherein we add the following. I want to state before I send it there \nthat my cosponsors as of now--and I welcome any others that would like \nto join--are Senators Kassebaum, Hollings, D'Amato, Stevens, Inouye, \nHatfield, Kennedy, and Specter.\n  Mr. President, the only thing I want to put in the Record tonight \nafter I have introduced the amendment, I will put in--I did not. I do \nnot have to send it up until I am ready to send it up. Right? I think \nthat is the rule. I will send it up shortly.\n  I am putting a list in of the prohibitions that are found in this \namendment with reference to what the Legal Services Corporation will be \nprohibited from doing. So overnight, if anybody has any concern about \nmy not getting rid of class action lawsuits and the like, I would like \nthem to peruse this list and give me their advice.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, with that explanation, I send the amendment \nto the desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending question will \nbe the amendment on page 26.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), for himself, \n     and Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. D'Amato, \n     Mr. Stevens, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Specter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2819 to the committee \n     amendment on page 26, lines 18 through 20.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment appears in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe the Parliamentarian might have \nhad in mind that I sought unanimous consent that there be cosponsors \nwhen there was no amendment there.\n  I now ask that those cosponsors that enumerated a while ago be added \nas original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send two documents to the desk. One is \na summary of the Domenici amendment, and a separate sheet indicating \nthe prohibitions that will be imposed on legal services, and I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Summary: Domenici Legal Services Amendment, H.R. 2076, Commerce, \n        Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies\n\n\n                               in general\n\n       The amendment restores the Legal Services Corporation, \n     provides $340 million in funding for fiscal year 1996 and \n     adopts House Appropriations restrictions on use of funds. \n     Appropriate offsets will be found throughout the \n     appropriations bill.\n\n\n                                funding\n\n       Provides $340 million in FY 1996, $225 million through \n     August 31, 1996 and $115, to be provided upon the September \n     1, 1996, implementation of a competitive bidding system for \n     grants, as outlined in the amendment.\n\n\n       restrictions on use of funds by corporation and recipients\n\n       Advocating policies relating to redistricting (same as \n     House).\n       No class action lawsuits (stronger than House).\n       Influencing action on any legislation, Constitutional \n     Amendment, referendum or similar procedure of Congress, State \n     or local legislative body (same as House).\n       Legal assistance to illegal aliens (same as House).\n       Supporting/conducting training programs relating to \n     political activity (same as House).\n       Abortion litigation (same as House).\n       Prisoner litigation (same as House).\n       Welfare reform litigation, except to represent individual \n     on particular matter that does not involve changing existing \n     law (same as House).\n       Representing individuals evicted from public housing due to \n     sale of drugs (same as House).\n\n[[Page S 14538]]\n\n       Accepting employment as a result of giving unsolicited \n     advice to non-attorneys (same as House).\n       All non-LSC funds used to provide legal services by \n     recipients may not be used for the purposes prohibited by the \n     Act (same as House).\n\n\n                           special provisions\n\n       Competitive bidding of grants must be implemented by \n     September 1, 1995, and regulations must be proposed 60 days \n     after enactment of the Act.

Funds will be provided on an \n     ``equal figure per individual in poverty.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Legal \nServices Program and in opposition to the pending appropriation bill. \nPursuant to this legislation, and the Legal Services Program--as it has \nexisted for more than two decades--would be abolished and replaced with \na legal assistance block grant program, funded at a level that is \ndrastically less than current funding for legal services.\n  The Legal Services Corporation has been at the forefront of our \nefforts to give real meaning to the words emblazoned in stone above the \nportals of the Supreme Court: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' The Legal \nServices Program has provided critically needed services to millions of \npoor, elderly, and disabled citizens who otherwise would not have \naccess to the American legal system and the protection its affords the \nmany basic rights we enjoy in this country and which so many of us take \nfor granted.\n  The Legal Services Corporation provides funds to State legal aid \nprograms throughout our Nation. It has been described as one of the \nmost effective and worthwhile Federal programs in existence, while also \nbeing one of the least costly. Legal Services programs provided needed \nlegal assistance to approximately 1.7 million clients annually, \nbenefiting about 5 million individuals living in poverty in this \ncountry, primarily women and children. LSC accomplishes this using only \nabout 3 percent of its total funding for administration and management. \nThat means that 97 percent of the appropriation goes directly to the \nlocal programs that provide the services, clearly illustrating the \nefficient operation of this valuable program.\n  Maryland's Legal Aid Bureau, which receives by far the largest \nportion of its total funding from the Legal Services Corporation, has \ndone an outstanding job of representing Maryland citizens living in \npoverty. With the funding received from LSC, the 13 legal aid offices \nlocated throughout Maryland provide general legal services to \napproximately 19,000 families and individuals annually, assisting \nMarylanders in such routine legal matters as consumer problems, housing \nissues, domestic and family cases, and applying for and appealing the \ndenial of public benefits.\n  Because the Republican measure proposes that grants be made to \nindividual attorneys, and appears to exclude current legal services \nprograms from eligibility for funding under the program, the Maryland \nLegal Aid Bureau could lose some of even all of this critical Federal \nfunding. This would leave Maryland Legal Aid unable to provide these \nvital services to the many thousands of clients currently represented--\nwho, in fact, represent only a small percentage of Maryland's poor \ncitizens--unless alternative funding can be provided at the State and \nlocal level.\n  Mr. President, the Legal Services Corporation has operated an \neffective and efficient program in representing citizens, who without \nthis assistance, would never have their day in court. Although most of \nthe cases involve routine legal disagreements related to housing, \nconsumer issues, family and domestic matters, and employment, these \nroutine matters often become insurmountable when coupled with the other \npressures of a complex society that weigh on a family unable to afford \nlegal representation.\n\n  The Republican proposal would replace the Legal Services Corporation \nwith a block grant program administered by the Department of Justice, \nthrough which funds for civil legal assistance would be allocated to \nthe States. The bill severely reduces funding for legal services, \ncutting the funding from the $400 million appropriated to the Legal \nServices Corporation for fiscal year 1995 to $210 million--a reduction \nof nearly 50 percent.\n  Not only does the bill slash funding for legal services for the poor, \nit also establishes severe restrictions on the type of services that \nmay be provided under the new block grant program. This program would \ndrastically limit qualified services to 10 specific causes of action. \nAs a result, low-income individuals would be denied representation with \nrespect to numerous critical--and basic--legal matters.\n  Under the measure, qualified services appear to exclude \nrepresentation in essential legal matters such as applying for or \nappealing a denial of statutory benefits, including Social Security \nbenefits, veterans benefits, unemployment compensation, food stamps or \nmedical assistance; obtaining or refinancing home ownership; housing \ndiscrimination; claims based on consumer fraud or defective products; \ndiscrimination in hiring; wage claims; problems with public utilities; \nimmigration; unfair sales practices; preparation of wills; paternity; \nand patient rights.\n  Most of these excluded causes of action represent legal matters that \nroutinely arise out of everyday problems faced by many Americans. Under \nthe committee bill, legal assistance with respect to these routine \ntypes of cases would be denied arbitrarily to low-income individuals \nand families.\n  Additional restrictions would prohibit legal service providers from \nusing funds under the program for representation in cases related to \nmatters such as redistricting, legislative and administrative advocacy, \nand prison litigation. Class action lawsuits against the Government or \nprivate parties--which, contrary to the myth currently being \nperpetuated, actually encompass less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all \nlegal services cases--would be barred, as would lawsuits challenging \nthe constitutionality of any statute.\n  Another particularly disturbing provision in the bill would require \nthat any qualified client, as a condition for receiving services under \nthe program, waive the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work \nproduct privilege. This clearly interferes with the ethical obligations \nthat all lawyers have to their clients.\n  Mr. President, the drastic cutbacks and restrictions in this bill \nwould strike a devastating blow to many of our citizens who would find \naccess to the courts blocked and would be unable to assert the rights \nto which they are entitled by our Constitution and our laws.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose these attempts to dismantle \nthis vital program and to support the continuation of the Legal \nServices Corporation and the current legal services delivery system, as \nwell as increased funding for legal assistance for the poor over the \nlevel proposed in this appropriation measure.\n\n[[Page S 14539]]\n\n  An editorial appearing in the September 15 New York Times eloquently \naddressed the current Republican attack on funding legal services for \nthe poor and the importance of maintaining the Legal Services \nCorporation. I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 15, 1995]\n\n                      Showdown for Legal Services\n\n       Equal justice for all may be an American ideal but not to \n     the Republican-controlled Congress, where measures advanced \n     ominously this week to abolish the Legal Services \n     Corporation, the federally financed program to help poor \n     people with legal problems.\n       The corporation, which was created in 1974, managed to \n     survive previous attacks on its mandate and financing during \n     the Reagan and Bush Administrations, aided by powerful \n     Democratic friends in Congress and some Republicans, like \n     former Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire. But its \n     continued existence is now in jeopardy. Not satisfied with \n     the disabling funding cut already approved by the full House, \n     or pending provisions in both chambers that would greatly \n     restrict the types of cases that may be handled, the \n     Republicans who control the House and Senate are moving to \n     dismantle the program entirely.\n       The House voted in July to slash the corporation's budget \n     from $400 million a year to $278 million. By an 18 to 13 \n     straight party-line vote on Wednesday, the House Judiciary \n     Committee approved a measure pushed by Representative George \n     Gekas of Pennsylvania that would carry the demolition \n     further. It would break up the corporation and its expert \n     network of poverty-law specialists and replace them with a \n     more bureaucratic, fragmented and inefficient system of small \n     block grants to fiscally hard-pressed states. Some states \n     have shown little interest historically in providing civil \n     legal services that empower the poor, and may not bother to \n     apply for the dwindling amounts of money allotted. In the \n     Senate, meanwhile, a similarly unworthy dismantling scheme \n     proposed by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas has passed the \n     Appropriations Committee and is due to hit the Senate floor \n     perhaps as early as today. It would cut funding even more, to \n     $210 million, and funnel it through block grants.\n       The program's critics complain that the corporation uses \n     the courts to push ``a liberal agenda.'' But, clearly, what \n     is driving the attack is their own ideological opposition to \n     what poverty lawyers do, which is to protect the legal rights \n     of the poor. This mostly entails handling mundane eviction, \n     divorce and installment credit cases. Only on rare occasions \n     do legal services lawyers bring the class action lawsuits \n     that so offend the powerful enemies of the program, but which \n     serve a valuable function in holding government agencies \n     accountable.\n       At a moving news conference, leaders of the bar were joined \n     by religious leaders and Legal Services clients in calling \n     for the presentation of the Legal Services Corporation. The \n     group included two victims of domestic violence, whose lives \n     were dramatically transformed for the better by virtue of \n     having the sort of access to the justice system that \n     Republicans seem determined to foreclose.\n       Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York, and other Republicans \n     whose poor constituents stand to be badly hurt by the latest \n     assault on legal services, should fight for amendments to the \n     pending Senate bill that would prevent the worst from \n     happening. If efforts at moderation do not succeed, President \n     Clinton must stand ready with his veto pen.\n\n\n                Amendment Nos. 2820 Through 2828 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, the amendment at the desk extends the life \nof a program that is essential to thousands of American working \nparents. It extends the operations of the United States Information \nAgency's Au Pair program for another 4 years, through the end of fiscal \nyear 1999.\n  Mr. President, the Au Pair program provides families with two working \nparents a perfect alternative to day care. It allows these families to \ninvite young people from other countries into their homes, for a year \nat a time, to live and work. The families and the au pairs, thus, live \ntogether while each teaches the other about their respective cultures; \nin return, the family's children receive exceptional care and the young \nau pairs experience a year in the United States while living with an \nAmerican family.\n  Earlier this year the members of the Foreign Relations Committee \nadopted a provision that would have extended the life of this program \nfor another 4 years, just as the pending amendment does. The committee-\nadopted provision, however, is still pending in the committee's \nauthorization bill which the Senate has yet to consider fully. Since \nthe authority to continue this program expires on September 30 of this \nyear, the Senate must take immediate action.\n  One may ask why I offer a 4-year extension of this program. The \nanswer is twofold: First, the authorizing committee made the decision \nto extend it for 4 years and, second, so that we can put this issue to \nrest for at least one additional authorization cycle.\n  Our committee has spent countless hours overseeing this program \nduring the last few years. The U.S. Information Agency, which \nadministers this program, has spent many hours on it as well. USIA this \nyear applied new regulations to the administration of the au pair \nprogram and I want to see these regulations implemented for awhile \nbefore a determination is made as to whether the program should be \npermanently authorized.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has \nindicated his support for this measure. I thank him and ask that we \nmove on this simple issue expeditiously.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2822\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on United States-Canada \nCooperation concerning an outlet to relieve flooding at Devils Lake in \n                             north Dakota)\n\n       On page 124, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 6. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON UNITED STATES-CANADIAN \n                   COOPERATION CONCERNING AN OUTLET TO RELIEVE \n                   FLOODING AT DEVILS LAKE IN NORTH DAKOTA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) flooding in Devils Lake Basin, North Dakota, has \n     resulted in water levels in the lake reaching their highest \n     point in 120 years;\n       (2) basements are flooded and the town of Devils Lake is \n     threatened with lake water reaching the limits of the \n     protective dikes of the lake;\n       (3) the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of \n     Reclamation are now studying the feasibility of constructing \n     an outlet from Devils Lake Basin;\n       (4) an outlet from Devils Lake Basin will allow the \n     transfer of water from Devils Lake Basin to the Red River of \n     the North watershed that the United States shares with \n     Canada; and\n       (5) the Treaty Relating to the Boundary Waters and \n     Questions Arising Along the Boundary Between the United \n     States and Canada, signed at Washington on January 11, 1909 \n     (36 Stat. 2448; TS 548) (commonly known as the ``Boundary \n     Water Treaty of 1909''), provides that ``waters flowing \n     across the boundary shall not be polluted on either side to \n     the injury of health or property on the other.'' (36 Stat. \n     2450).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States Government should seek to establish a \n     joint United States-Canadian technical committee to review \n     the Devils Lake Basin outlet project to consider options for \n     an outlet that would \n\n[[Page S 14540]]\n     meet Canadian concerns with regard to the Boundary Water Treaty of \n     1909.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2823\n\n       On page 75 of the bill, line 7, after ``grants'' insert the \n     following: : ``Provided further, That of the amounts provided \n     in this paragraph $76,300,000 is for the Manufacturing \n     Extension Partnership program''.\n\n\n                    manufacturing extension program\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for including in his amendment an additional \n$25 million for the Industrial Technology Services account at the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST]. That funding is \nfor the Manufacturing Extension Partnership [MEP] program, which \nsupports locally run manufacturing extension centers around the \ncountry.\n  I would like to enter into a brief conversation with the chairman to \nclarify that this funding is provided for three purposes. First, $22 \nmillion is provided to support new centers that are now close to be \nchosen, under an ongoing centers competition. The amendment restores \nfunding that had been provided in the fiscal year 1995 Appropriations \nAct for new centers but which the present bill would shift to other \npurposes. This amendment therefore overrides the committee report \nlanguage which says that no funds can be used to open a new center \nduring the coming year.\n  Second, $3 million is provided for fiscal year 1996 support services \nfor the existing 42 manufacturing extension centers. These are services \nsuch as materials for training extension agents, provided to centers \nthrough MEP's National Programs account. This $3 million is in addition \nto funds which the bill already provides for fiscal year 1996 support \nof the existing 42 centers, including the eligible centers originally \nsupported by the Defense Department's Technology Reinvestment Project.\n  Third, with this amendment the amount of new appropriations for the \nMEP program now totals $76.3 million, and the amount of prior year \nappropriations and new appropriations for meeting prior Advanced \nTechnology Program [ATP] commitments totals $109,138,000. The ATP is \nintended to receive $83,838,000 in prior year appropriations and $25.3 \nmillion in new appropriations. I would like to ask the chairman if this \nthree-part interpretation of the MEP portion of his amendment is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2824\n\n       Table the Committee amendment on page 79, lines 1 through \n     6.\n       On page 79, line 22, delete ``$42,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$37,000,000''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2825\n\n       On page 115, line 2 after ``equipment'' insert the \n     following ``: Provided further, That not later than April 1, \n     1996, the headquarters of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting \n     shall be relocated from Washington, D.C. to South Florida, \n     and that any funds available to the United States Information \n     Agency may be available to carry out this relocation.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2826\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n       ``Sec.   . Sections 6(a) and 6(b) of Public Law 101-454 are \n     repealed. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship, Incorporated, may use \n     any earned but unused trust income from the period 1992 \n     through 1995 for Fellowship purposes.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2827\n\n       On page 110, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 405. (a) Subject to subsection (b), section 15(a) of \n     the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. \n     2680(a)) and section 701 of the United States Information and \n     Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and section 313 of the \n     Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and \n     1995 and section 53 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, \n     shall not apply to appropriations made available for the \n     Department of State in this Act.\n       (b) The waiver of subsection (a) shall cease to apply \n     December 1, 1995.\n\n                        waiver of authorization\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment authorizes the Senate \nand House committees on appropriations to waive the requirement in \nsection 15 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act that \nappropriations must first be authorized. This waiver applies through \nDecember 1, 1995.\n  As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which has the \nresponsibility of authorizing the activities of the Department of State \nand its related agencies, I am reluctant to agree to this waiver. \nHowever, because the administration and certain Members of this Senate \nhave refused to allow a vote on the committee's authorization bill--S. \n908, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995--and since Senate \nconsideration of S. 908 bill is still pending, I have agreed to allow \nthe State Department's funding to go forward without authorization \nthrough the first of December.\n  This window will allow adequate time for the President and his \nrepresentatives to advise their friends in the Senate that no further \nefforts on their part should be made to forbid a vote on the \nauthorizing legislation S. 908.\n  Mr. President, I reiterate now what I have asserted on numerous \noccasions since the Democrats' filibuster against S. 908 began; the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee will resume consideration of and \naction upon all nominations, treaties, and legislation pending before \nthe committee once the administration urges Senate Democrats to vote on \nour legislation.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for his \ncooperation on this issue. I thank him also for his continued support \nof our efforts to consolidate three anachronistic Federal foreign \naffairs agencies into the Department of State which, he and I agree, \nwill help balance the Federal budget.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2828\n\n(Purpose: To make available for diplomatic and consular programs funds \ncollected from new fees charged for the expedited processing of certain \n                    visas and border crossing cards)\n\n       On page 93, line 7, after ``Provided,'' insert the \n     following: ``That, notwithstanding the second sentence of \n     section 140(a)(3) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, \n     Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236), not to \n     exceed $125,000,000 of fees may be collected during fiscal \n     year 1996 under the authority of section 140(a)(1) of that \n     Act: Provided further, That all fees collected under the \n     preceding proviso shall be deposited in fiscal year 1996 as \n     an offsetting collection to appropriations made under this \n     heading to recover the costs of providing consular \n     services and shall remain available until expended: \n     Provided further,''.\n\n\n                       machine readable visa fees\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this amendment will permit the Department \nof State to continue to charge and collect a fee for the issuance of \nmachine readable visas in specific countries around the world through \nfiscal year 1996. The Department may collect up to $125 million worth \nof fees this year alone.\n  It also authorizes the Department of State to use the moneys \ncollected to offset the costs of diplomatic and consular activities \noverseas.\n  In the fiscal year 1994-95 State Department authorization bill--\nPublic Law 103-236--the Committee on Foreign Relations authorized the \nDepartment to charge and collect these fees up to a total of $107 \nmillion. The Department almost met that ceiling this past year and \nexpects to exceed that amount this fiscal year in as much as this \nrelatively new program is now being implemented in more countries and, \nis thereby, made available to more people. Therefore, the Department is \nauthorized to collect approximately $18 million more in fees this year.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does not cost the American taxpayer a \npenny. It is, in fact, a tool for sound fiscal management the \nDepartment will be able to utilize this year, especially in light of \nbudget cuts affecting the Department of State.\n  I understand the able chairman of the subcommittee agrees with this \nmeasure and I thank him for his support.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, these amendments have all been cleared on \nboth sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be agreed to en bloc, and that \nstatements accompanying the amendments be printed in the Record as if \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2820 through 2828) were agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on advice from Senator Hollings, who is \nunable to be here at the moment, I understand that these are acceptable \nto him on this side. \n\n[[Page S 14541]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2819\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, while we await our instructions on closing \nout business of the day, I would like to just very briefly, though we \nare going to speak tomorrow at some length about the Domenici \namendment, say that I think it is important tonight to at least to \nbegin to call our colleagues' attention to the fact that the Domenici \namendment is not simply an amendment to reestablish the Federal Legal \nServices Corporation. We can debate the merits of that and the \ndemerits. I believe the demerits outweigh the merits. But the Domenici \namendment has a profound impact on the rest of this bill because it \ncuts other programs.\n  I simply want to leave with my colleagues tonight a very brief \noutline of what the Domenici amendment does in order to fund this \nexpansion in legal services.\n  It cuts $25 million from our efforts in the Justice Department \nrelated to the Criminal Division, to the Civil Rights Division, to the \nEnvironmental Division. It cuts funding for the U.S. attorneys office \nby $11 million. That is money that would have gone to fund U.S. \nattorneys to prosecute drug felons and gun felons. It cuts $40 million \nfrom the FBI budget, funds that would be used to build the new FBI \nacademy, to build infrastructure, which the FBI greatly needs.\n  It cuts the Bureau of the Census both economic and statistical \nanalysis and the census itself in a period when we are getting ready to \nhave the 2000 census, the millennium census. It cuts funding for the \ncourt of appeals, for district courts, and for other courts by $25 \nmillion. Every day we have people waiting to be tried in civil cases \nand criminal cases, and we are cutting funding for our courts to fund \nlegal services.\n  Funding is cut by $21 million for the reorganization/transition fund \nin the State Department. That is a major Republican initiative in an \nauthorization bill for which the majority of Senators have voted in the \naffirmative. The bill cuts funding for the commerce transition fund. \nThe budget adopted by the Senate called for the elimination of the \nCommerce Department. This eliminates transition funds that would be \nrequired.\n  Finally and stunningly, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has \na budget gimmick in the funding mechanism which has a delayed \nobligation of $115 million which becomes effective only on September 1, \n1996, so that we are in fact committing ourselves to a level of funding \nwhich is substantially higher than the funding level which is claimed \nin this amendment.\n  No one needs to give me a lecture on the power of the special \ninterest groups that support the Legal Services Corporation. I \nunderstand that perfectly, and I understand that the majority of the \nMembers of the Senate support funding for the Legal Services \nCorporation. But I want my colleagues to know that in supporting that \nfunding, they are supporting cuts in our criminal activities, our civil \nrights activities in the Justice Department, our Environmental Division \nwithin the Justice Department. They are denying funding for the FBI \nAcademy and in the process cutting funds for courts.\n  So what we are talking about is basically cutting funding for \nprosecutors, for the Justice Department to work in areas that are \ncritically important. We are cutting funding in courts when we \ndesperately need more prosecutors and more courts. I hope my colleagues \nwill look at these offsets.\n  Governing is about choices, and the choices we look at on this bill \nare, basically, do we want to fund courts and U.S. attorneys to \nprosecute violent criminals and drug felons or do we want to fund the \nLegal Services Corporation? To me that is a very easy choice. I wish to \nbe sure that my colleagues understand it, and I thank the Senate for in \nthe closing moments of this legislative day giving me the opportunity \nto make it clear to people what we are talking about.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send a list of the Domenici offsets to \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nPOSSIBLE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2076, AS REPORTED, OFFERED BY MR.

Mr. President, It is with great pleasure and pride that \nI congratulate Miss Shawntel Smith, who was crowned Miss America 1996 \nrecently in Atlantic City on her 24th birthday.\n  Shawntel is the fourth Oklahoman to be named Miss America in the \npageant's 75 years. She joins three other Oklahomans who have won that \nhonor: Norma Smallwood in 1926, Jane Jayroe in 1967 and Susan Powell in \n1981.\n  Shawntel is a native of Muldrow, Oklahoma, a town of about 3,200 \nresidents who are by all accounts very proud and supportive of this \nyoung lady. When she was crowned Miss Oklahoma earlier this year, the \ntown erected road signs along the Eastern Oklahoma roads leading into \nMuldrow.\n  It seems, now, however, those signs are a little outdated.\n  During the next year, Shawntel will represent Oklahoma and all of \nAmerica as she travels to special events and speaking engagements as \nMiss America.\n  Her platform is to raise awareness for the need to prepare students \nfor the job market. Shawntel believes that ``by exposing students to \npotential careers and making them aware of the education needed, \nstudents can make their dreams become realities.'' And Shawntel \nobviously knows a little something about making dreams become \nrealities.\n  Education has been an important part of Shawntel's own life. Through \ncompetition in pageants she has been able to earn enough in scholarship \nmoney to put herself through Northeastern Oklahoma State University, \nwhere she is now working as a marketing director. Shawntel's winnings \nfrom the Miss Oklahoma and Miss America pageants will allow her to \ncontinue her education. Her goal is to obtain a master's degree in \nbusiness administration from Oklahoma City University, and I have no \ndoubt she will. \n\n[[Page S 14542]]\n\n  She already has demonstrated her affinity for hard work and tenacity. \nShawntel competed in three Miss Oklahoma pageants before she won the \ntitle in July of this year.\n  After the pageant, Shawntel's father, Gailen Smith, commented that \nwhen Shawntel speaks to people, her inner beauty shines through. What a \nwonderful and appropriate sentiment. I congratulate Gailen, and \nShawntel's mother, Karen, whose daughter possesses not only physical \nbeauty, but inner beauty and strength of character as well.\n  Mr. President, Shawntel's example rekindles our belief in each \nindividual's ability to accomplish something extraordinary and restores \nour confidence in the American spirit of helping others realize their \ndreams. Our State of Oklahoma, which is home to the finest people \nanywhere, celebrates her achievement.\n  Congratulations, Shawntel. We are pleased for you and look forward \nwith great pride to the year ahead as you represent our State and our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14541-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Requests \n     for this notice in an alternative format should be made to \n     Mr. Russell Jackson, Director, Service Department, Office of \n     the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, 202-244-\n     2705.\n\n                               Background\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 applies the \n     rights and protections of eleven federal labor and employment \n     law statutes to covered Congressional employees and employing \n     offices. The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     established under the CAA invites comments before \n     promulgating proposed rules under sections 202, 203, 204, 205 \n     and 206 of that Act. The above-referenced sections of the CAA \n     respectively apply the rights and protections of the Family \n     and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. 2611 et seq. \n     (``FMLA''); the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \n     201 et seq. (``FLSA''); the Employee Polygraph Protection Act \n     of 1988, 29 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. (``EPPA''); the Worker \n     Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101 et \n     seq. (``WARN''); and the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. Chpt. 43. Each of those \n     sections authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement the section and further states that such \n     regulations ``shall be the same as the substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement * * * [the applicable statute] * * * except insofar \n     as the Board may determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under this section.''\n       Section 304 of the CAA prescribes the procedure applicable \n     to the issuance of regulations by the Board for the \n     implementation of this Act. It furthers requires the Board to \n     recommend in the general notice of proposed rulemaking and in \n     the regulations whether the regulations should be approved by \n     resolution of the Senate, by resolution of the House of \n     Representatives, by concurrent resolution, or by joint \n     resolution.\n       Section 411 of the CAA provides with respect to the \n     aforementioned sections that, ``if the Board has not issued a \n     regulation on a matter for which this Act requires a \n     regulation to be issued, the hearing officer, Board or court, \n     as the case may be, shall apply to the extent necessary and \n     appropriate, the most relevant substantive executive agency \n     regulation promulgated to implement the statutory provision \n     at issue in the proceeding.''\n       The CAA requires that the Office of Compliance be open for \n     business on January 23, 1996. The statutes made applicable \n     under the aforementioned sections of the CAA become effective \n     for covered employees and employing offices on that date.\n       These inter-related provisions of the CAA give the Board \n     various rulemaking options under section 202 through 206 of \n     the CAA. So that it may make a more fully informed decision \n     regarding the issuance of regulations (for each or all of the \n     relevant sections of the CAA), in addition to inviting and \n     encouraging comments on all relevant matters, the Board \n     requests comments on the following:\n     1. General Issues Under the CAA\n       a. Whether and to What Extent the Board Should Modify the \n           Regulations Promulgated by the Secretary of Labor\n       The CAA directs the Board to issue regulations that ``shall \n     be the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of labor (``Secretary'') to implement * * * [the \n     applicable statutes] * * * except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section'' (emphasis added). This \n     provision provides important guidance concerning how \n     employing offices, covered employees and other interested \n     persons should structure their comments in response to this \n     ANPR and related processes in order to be of maximum \n     assistance to the Board. Accordingly, \n\n[[Page S 14543]]\n     the Board requests commentors who propose modifications to the \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary to \n     identify the ``good cause'' justification of such proposed \n     modification by stating how much modification would be ``more \n     effective'' for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections applied under the CAA. In addition, the Board \n     requests commentors to suggest technical changes in \n     nomenclature or other matters that may be deemed appropriate \n     in any regulation that might be issued.\n       Section 304(a)(2) of the Act also requires the Board to \n     issue three separate bodies of regulations which shall apply, \n     respectively, to the Senate and its employees, the House and \n     its employees and all other covered employees and employing \n     offices. Certain employment practices and categories of \n     employees may be unique to one or more of these bodies.\n       The Board invites comment regarding under what \n     circumstances, if any, such differences would warrant a \n     substantive difference in the applicable regulations.\n       The Board further invites comment on whether and to what \n     extent it should modify the regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor.\n       b. Notice Posting and Recordkeeping Requirements\n       The CAA does not expressly make reference to the notice \n     posting and recordkeeping requirements of the various \n     statutes applied to covered employees and employing offices. \n     For example, the notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements of section 106(b) and 109 of the FMLA and the \n     Secretary's regulations thereunder (29 U.S.C. sections \n     2616(b) and 2619; 29 C.F.R. sections 825.300 and 825.500) are \n     not expressly referenced in section 202 of the CAA, which \n     applies the rights and protections of the FMLA to covered \n     employees and employing offices. Similarly, the FLSA \n     recordkeeping requirements, 29 U.S.C. section 211(c), and the \n     Secretary's implementing regulations at 29 C.F.R. sections \n     516.0-516.34, are not expressly referenced in section 203 of \n     the CAA, which applies the right and protections of the FLSA \n     to covered employees and employing offices.\n       It could be argued that notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements are an integral part of the rights and \n     protections of the applied statutes and thus are implicitly \n     included within the requirements of the CAA or that ``good \n     cause'' exists to modify the existing substantive regulations \n     by including some provision for notice-posting and \n     recordkeeping. Notice postings inform covered employees of \n     their rights and protections under the statutes and remind \n     employing offices of their responsibilities. Recordkeeping \n     enables an enforcement authority to determine the extent to \n     which an employing office has complied with applicable law \n     and, even in the absence of such authority, recordkeeping is \n     helpful to an employing office that may be faced with a \n     complaint from one if its employees.\n       Alternatively, it could be argued that the lack of specific \n     reference in the CAA to the notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements of the applied laws evidences congressional \n     intent not to impose notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements on employing offices as part of the CAA. \n     Moreover, there is a concern that strictly-imposed notice \n     posting and recordkeeping requirements might impose a \n     significant and unforeseen costs on employing offices in \n     creating and maintaining records that it does not ordinarily \n     maintain. In addition, there may be constitutional or other \n     institutional prerogatives that notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements could be said to intrude upon.\n       The Board invites comment on whether the notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements of the various laws made \n     applicable by the CAA are incorporated as statutory \n     requirements of the CAA and, if so, whether and to what \n     extent the Secretary's regulations implementing those \n     requirements should be adopted.\n       The Board further invites comment on whether, assuming \n     notice posting and recordkeeping requirements are not \n     incorporated as statutory requirements of the CAA, the Board \n     (a) can and should develop its own notice posting and/or \n     recordkeeping requirements pursuant to its ``good cause'' \n     authority or (b) should propose guidelines regarding the \n     types and forms of records employing officials may wish to \n     keep in order to record the wages and working hours of \n     non-exempt employees. Commentors are encouraged to suggest \n     formats and contents which would be made available to \n     employing offices for their consideration.\n     2. Specific Issues Under Individual Sections\n       In addition to the preceding issues that arise under all \n     five sections of the CAA, the Board also requests comments on \n     the following matters arising under individual sections of \n     the Act.\n       a. Issues Under Section 203 (Fair Labor Standards Act)\n       The Fair Labor Standards Act sets forth requirements for \n     minimum wage and overtime pay (except for exempt employees), \n     equal pay for equal work, and a prohibition on oppressive \n     child labor. With respect to overtime pay, employers must pay \n     all non-exempt employees overtime pay of one and one-half \n     times their hourly rate for each hour worked in excess of 40 \n     hours per workweek. The regulations of the Secretary set \n     forth specific criteria as to whether employees performing \n     particular job responsibilities are bona fide executive, \n     administrative or professional personnel.\n       (i) Employees Employed in a Bona Fide Executive, \n     Administrative or Professional Capacity.\n       Section 13(a) of the FLSA provides an exemption from its \n     minimum wage and overtime provisions for any employee \n     employed in a bona fide executive, administrative or \n     professional capacity as those terms are defined in \n     regulations of the Secretary. 29 CFR Part 541 contains those \n     regulations.\n       In addition to the regulations, the Department of Labor has \n     issued interprestations and opinions which have elaborated \n     upon the statutory definitions. The Board recognizes that \n     these regulations, interpretations, and opinions may create \n     uncertainties regarding the scope or application of the \n     exemptions, particularly as they may be applied to the \n     Congress, and it is often difficult to know in advance of \n     litigation whether a particular employee is exempt under \n     these regulations. As a result, employing offices may incur \n     substantial and unanticipated overtime costs absent a major \n     change in employing offices' manner of operation.\n       The Board invites comments on whether and to what extent \n     the Board should modify the regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary regarding exempt executive, administrative and \n     professional employees. Commentors are reminded that any \n     suggested modification of the Secretary's regulations should \n     be supported with an explanation as to how such modification \n     would meet the ``good cause'' standard of the CAA. See \n     Section 1.a, supra.\n       (ii) Whether The Board Should Adopt the Interprestive \n     Bulletins as Regulations.\n       Various provisions of the FLSA give the Secretary specific \n     regulatory authority; e.g. section 13(a)(1) provides an \n     exemption for executive, administrative and professional \n     employess ``as such terms are defined and delimited from the \n     time to time by regulations of the Secretary . . .'' \n     Regulations pursuant to such specific authorities are \n     codified in 29 CFR Parts 510 to 697.\n       With respect to many of the other provisions of the FLSA \n     for which the Secretary does not have specific regulatory \n     authority, ``Statements of General Policy or Interpretation \n     Not Directly related to Regulations'' codified in 29 CFR Part \n     775 to 794 have been issued. Typically, these parts \n     (generally called Interpretative Bulletins) contain language \n     such as the following in section 778.1: ``This Part 778 \n     constitutes the official interpretation of the Department of \n     Labor with respect to the meaning and application of the \n     maximum hours and overtime pay requirement contained in \n     section 7 of the Act. It is the purpose of this bulletin to \n     make available in one place the interpretation of these \n     provisions which will guide the Secretary and the \n     Administrator in the performance of their duties under the \n     Act until they are otherwise directed by authoritive \n     decisions of the courts. . .''\n       The Board invites comment on the following questions:\n       (1) Are the Department of Labor's Interpretive Bulletins \n     ``substantive regulations'' with the meaning of section \n     203(c)(2)?\n       (2) If the Interpretive Bulletins are substantive \n     regulations, whether and to what extent the Board should \n     modify them?\n       (3) If the Interpretive Bulletins are not substantive \n     regulations, whether and to what extent the Board should \n     adopt them as the Board's regulations or as official \n     interpretations?\n       (4) If the Interpretive Bulletins are not substantive \n     regulations, may an employing office nevertheless defend its \n     actions if it has relied upon such an Interpretive Bulletin \n     in light of the provisions of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 251 et seq.?\n       (iii) Joint Employer Status.\n       In the context of the FLSA, the term ``employer'' has not \n     been construed as limited to a single employer; it may \n     include two or more nominally separate employers of the same \n     employee. Such ``joint employment'' could arise by analogy \n     under the CAA where a covered employee performs work which \n     simultaneously benefits two or more covered employing offices \n     such as a member's personal office and a committee staff or \n     works for two or more covered employing offices at different \n     times during the workweek.\n       A determination of whether employment is to be considered \n     joint employment or separate and distinct employment for FLSA \n     purposes depends on all of the facts in a particular case. \n     The Department of Labor's Interpretive Bulletin lists the \n     following factors in determining joint employment status: \n     whether there is an arrangement between the employers to \n     share the employee's services; whether the employee's \n     services are provided to both employers at the same time; \n     whether one employer is acting directly or indirectly in the \n     interest of the other employer in relation to the employee; \n     and whether both employers are commonly controlled. 29 C.F.R. \n     Ch. V, Pt. 791.\n       Where an individual works for nominally separate employers \n     that are actually ``joint employers'', all of the employee's \n     hours of work are considered as one employment. In that \n     event, all joint employers are liable, both separately and \n     jointly, for compliance with the applicable provisions of the \n     FLSA, including overtime pay.\n       The Board invites comment on whether and to what extent \n     this doctrine is applicable under the CAA.\n       The Board further invites comment on whether it should \n     adopt regulations governing joint employment for covered \n     employees and employing offices, and if so, what the content \n     of those regulations should be.\n\n[[Page S 14544]]\n\n       b. Issues Under Section 202 (Family and Medical Leave Act)\n       The Family and Medical Leave Act generally requires \n     employers to permit covered employees to take up to 12 weeks \n     of unpaid, job protected leave during a 12-month period for \n     the birth of a child and to care for the newborn; placement \n     of a child for adoption or foster care; care of a spouse; \n     child, or parent with a serious health condition; or an \n     employee's own serious health condition. The FMLA and the \n     Secretary's regulations thereunder contain provisions \n     concerning the maintenance of health benefits during leave, \n     job restoration after leave, notice and medical \n     certifications of the need for FMLA leave, and the \n     relationship of FMLA leave to other employment laws including \n     the Americans With Disabilities Act, Workers Compensation, \n     and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n       (i) Previous Application of the FMLA to Certain Employees.\n       The Board notes that Title V of the FMLA made specified \n     rights and protections under the FMLA available to certain \n     employees of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. \n     On August 5, 1993, the House Committee on House \n     Administration of the 103th Congress adopted regulations and \n     forms to implement the FMLA in the House of Representatives.\n       Title V and such House regulations provided different FMLA \n     rights and protections to employees of the House of \n     Representatives and of the Senate than are provided under the \n     CAA. For example, under Title V, ``any employee in an \n     employment position'' of the House of Representatives and any \n     employee of the Senate who has been employed for at least \n     twelve months on other than a temporary or intermittent basis \n     was eligible for FMLA leave. Thus, Title V provided FMLA \n     leave to House employees immediately upon employment and to \n     Senate employees who had worked at least twelve months on \n     other than a temporary or intermittent basis.\n       Conversely, Section 202(a)(2)(B) of the CAA defines an \n     ``eligible employee'' for the purpose of FMLA leave as any \n     employee who has been employed in any employing office for 12 \n     months and for at least 1,250 hours of employment during the \n     12 months immediately preceding the commencement of leave. \n     Consequently, the CAA establishes different leave eligibility \n     requirements than Title V of the FMLA established. The Board \n     further notes that Section 504(b) of the CAA repeals Title V \n     of the FMLA effective January 23, 1996.\n       Section 2612 of the FMLA as applied to the House of \n     Representatives and to the Senate under the CAA entitles \n     ``eligible employees'' to take up to 12 weeks of FMLA leave \n     in a 12-month period. Section 825.200(b) of the regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary provides that the employer may \n     elect to use the calendar year, a fixed twelve month leave or \n     fiscal year, or a 12-month period prior to or after the \n     commencement of leave to calculate the 12-month period within \n     which eligible employees are entitled to take up to 12 weeks \n     leave. The Board notes that the August 5, 1993 regulations of \n     the House Committee on House Administration designated for \n     all employing offices of the House of Representatives the \n     period from January 3 of one year through January 2 of the \n     following year as the FMLA leave year within which eligible \n     employees are entitled to take up to 12 weeks of leave. The \n     Board further notes that, pursuant to sections 504(b) and 506 \n     of the CAA, Title V of the FMLA upon which such regulation \n     was based is repealed effective January 23, 1996.\n       The Board invites comment on the following questions:\n       (1) Whether and, if so, how, the twelve month and 1,250 \n     hours of work FMLA leave eligibility requirements should be \n     calculated for employees employed by more than one employing \n     office? See infra (ii) on ``Employment by More Than One \n     Office''.\n       (2) Whether there is ``good cause'' to believe that a \n     regulation designating a uniform FMLA leave year within which \n     ``eligible employees'' are entitled to take FMLA leave would \n     be ``more effective'' for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections of the CAA than the regulations promulgated \n     by the Secretary which would permit employers to designate \n     the 12-month period appropriate to their office?\n       (3) Whether, assuming that there is not ``good cause'' to \n     designate a uniform FMLA leave year for all employing \n     offices, the existence of non-uniform leave years by \n     employing offices would affect the FMLA leave rights of \n     ``eligible employees'' who are employed by more than one \n     employing office? See infra (ii) on ``Employment by More Than \n     One Office''.\n       The Board further seeks information on whether and to what \n     extent policies and practices of the House of \n     Representatives, the Senate, the Instrumentalities or any \n     covered employing office exist that provide different FMLA \n     rights and protections than would be provided under the CAA \n     if the regulations promulgated by the Secretary were made \n     applicable to such employees.\n       (ii) Employment by More Than One Office\n       In the context of the FMLA, the term ``covered employer'' \n     has not been construed as limited to a single employer; it \n     may include two or more employers of the same employee. \n     Sections 825.106, 825.104(c)(2) and 825.107 of the \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary set forth factors to \n     be considered in making a determination of whether a ``joint \n     employment'', ``integrated employer'', or ``successor in \n     interest'', respectively, relationship exists for the \n     purposes of FMLA leave eligibility, job restoration and \n     maintenance of health benefits responsibilities of employers.\n       The Board invites comment on whether and, if so, how the \n     definitions of ``joint employer'', ``integrated employer'' or \n     ``successor employer'' set forth in the regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary should be applied and/or \n     modified to implement FMLA rights and protections under the \n     CAA with respect to covered employees employed simultaneously \n     or seriatim by more than one employing office during any \n     relevant 12-month period.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 27th day of September, \n     1995.\n\n                                                Glen D.

In general, the CAA \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven federal labor \n     and employment law statutes to covered employees offices \n     within the legislative branch. Section 204(a) and (b) of the \n     CAA applies the rights and protections of the Employee \n     Polygraph Protection Act of 1988, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2001, et \n     seq. (``EPPA'') to covered employees and employing offices. \n     Section 204(c) authorizes the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance (``Board'') established under the CAA to \n     issue regulations implementing the section. Section 204(c) \n     further states that such regulations ``shall be the same as \n     substantive regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsections \n     (a) and (b) \n\n[[Page S 14545]]\n     except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause shown and \n     stated together with the regulation, that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' Section 204(a)(3) provides that nothing in this \n     section shall preclude the Capitol Police from using lie \n     detector tests in accordance with regulations issued under \n     section 204(c) of the CAA.\n       The Capitol Police is the primary law enforcement agency of \n     the legislative branch. The proposed regulations would \n     provide the Capitol Police with specific authorization to use \n     lie detector tests. The limitations on the exclusion of the \n     proposed regulation are derived from the Secretary of Labor's \n     regulation implementing the exclusion for public sector \n     employers under Section 7(a) of the EPPA (29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 801.10(d)), which limits the exclusion to the entity's \n     own employees.\n       The Board issues concurrently with this proposed regulation \n     a separate Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which \n     invites comment regarding a number of other regulatory \n     issues, including what regulations, if any, the Board should \n     issue to implement the remainder of Section 204.\n\n   Proposed Regulation--Exclusion for employees of the Capitol Police\n\n       None of the limitations on the use of lie detector tests by \n     employing offices set forth in Section 204 of the CAA apply \n     to the Capitol Police. This exclusion from the limitations of \n     Section 204 of the CAA applies only with respect to Capitol \n     Police employees. Except as otherwise provided by law or \n     these regulations, this exclusion does not extend to \n     contractors or nongovernmental agents of the Capitol Police, \n     nor does it extend to the Capitol Police with respect to \n     employees of a private employer or an otherwise covered \n     employing office with which the Capitol Police has a \n     contractual or other business relationship.\n\n                     Recommended Method of Approval\n\n       The Board recommends that this regulation be approved by \n     concurrent resolution in light of the nature of the work \n     performed by the Capitol Police and the fact that neither the \n     House of Representatives nor the Senate has exclusive \n     responsibility for the Capitol Police.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 27th day of September \n     1995.\n\n                                                Glen D.

Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to the conveners \nand participants of the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in \nBeijing this September, and the parallel NGO Forum on Women for \npromoting the human rights of women around the world. I would \nespecially commend the members of the U.S. delegation to the Women's \nConference, particularly First Lady Hillary Clinton and Ambassador \nMadeleine Albright, as well as the many others who contributed to its \nsuccess.\n  The goal of this conference was to promote the advancement of women \nby identifying and overcoming the obstacles still facing women. In many \nparts of the world today, discrimination against women results in \nforced abortions, in the trafficking or forced prostitution of young \ngirls, and in the denial of nutrition or health care, even to the point \nof infanticide. Women are also the primary victims of domestic violence \nor rape, and rape is increasingly being used as a tool of war in \nconflicts such as Bosnia, Cambodia, Liberia, Peru, Somalia, and Rwanda.\n  In many parts of the world, women are denied education, job training, \nor employment opportunities. Today, 64 percent of the world's \nilliterate and 70 percent of the world's population that lives in \nabsolute poverty are women. Even when employed, women frequently face \npay discrimination in the workplace. In too many countries, women are \nexcluded from participating in policy-making or prevented by law from \nvoting in elections.\n  Mr. President, the Women's Conference addressed all of these issues \nand called upon governments to commit to specific actions that would \nadvance the status of women. The United States delegation made \ncommitments that continue the long-standing tradition of U.S. \nleadership in the fight for equality for women and men. American \ncommitments include: the creation of a White House Council on Women to \ncoordinate the implementation of the Platform for Action within the \nU.S.; a new Justice Department initiative to fight domestic violence; \nincreased resources for improving women's health; improved access for \nwomen to financial credit; and continued support for the human rights \nof all people.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Clinton administration for its continued \nefforts to promote the status of women at home and abroad. This year \nmarks a historic point in the fight for women's equality. 1995 is the \n75th anniversary of women's suffrage in the United States. It is also \nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, whose Charter \nrecognizes the equal rights of women and men. And of course, the \nsuccess of this year's Fourth World Conference on Women has set a new \nagenda for the advancement of women. In this spirit, Mr. President, I \nbelieve it is time for the United States Senate to give its advice and \nconsent to the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination Against Women.\n  The Women's Convention is the most comprehensive and \ndetailed international agreement that promotes the equality of women \nand men. The Convention legally defines discrimination against women \nfor the first time and establishes rights for women in areas not \npreviously covered by international law. Today, 147 countries have \nratified the Convention. The United States is the only industrialized \ndemocracy in the world that has failed to ratify the Convention.\n\n  Under my chairmanship, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held \nthree hearings on this important convention. On September 29, 1994, \nwith my whole-hearted support, the Committee voted 13 to 5 to report \nfavorably the Convention with a resolution of ratification to the \nSenate for its advice and consent. Despite support for ratification \nfrom many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, from the \nClinton administration, and from the American public, opponents of \nratification succeeded in blocking the Convention from reaching a vote \nin the Senate last year.\n  Mr. President, I believe the U.S. ratification of this Convention is \nimportant to demonstrate American commitment to eliminating all forms \nof discrimination against women both at home and abroad. Equally \nimportant, the United States should ratify the Convention in order to \nunderscore the importance we assign to international efforts to promote \nand protect human rights. By failing to ratify the Women's Convention, \nthe United States has rightfully encouraged criticism from allies who \ncannot understand our refusal to uphold rights that are already found \nwithin the provisions of our great Constitution. The United States \ncannot criticize other countries' violations of women's rights if we \nhave not recognized those rights as international legal standards. The \nWomen's Convention is an important human rights document that is \nconsistent with the existing laws of the United States. Senate advice \nand consent to this Convention will demonstrate U.S. leadership in the \nfight for women's equality.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as we consider the appropriations bill for \nthe State Department budget, I would emphasize the difficulties that \nfunding cuts will produce in the work to promote human rights. Without \nadequate funding, the U.S. will be unable to continue to play a \nleadership role in the international effort to promote women's \nequality. The ability of the State Department to monitor human rights \nabuses, to participate in the work of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, \nto support NGOs in their human rights work, and to gather information \non human rights violations would be severely threatened. Clearly, it is \nin the best interests of the United States to promote human rights and \ndemocracy in every country. Let us not lose our leadership role in the \nprotection of human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14545-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14545-S14546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the extraordinary \nimpact of the National Endowment for the Humanities on my home state of \nRhode Island. Rhode Island has long had a special relationship with the \nEndowments--ever since the President of Brown University, my old friend \nBarnaby Keeney, formed a Commission to investigate the possibility of a \nnational support for study in the humanities. \n\n[[Page S 14546]]\nThe Commission returned with a forceful recommendation for the creation \nof such a program and in 1965 we created the National Endowment for the \nHumanities. Since that time, the Humanities Endowment has supported \nscholarly research, education and public programs concerned with \nhistory, literature, philosophy, language and other humanistic \ndisciplines, and have helped to make the United States a leader in \nthese fields of study. Programs have included both popular and \nscholarly works characterized by their singular excellence, including \nthe Pulitzer Prize winning Slavery and Human Progress and programs such \nas ``The Civil War,'' ``Columbus and the Age of Discovery'' and \n``Baseball.''\n  Barnaby Keeney, a decorated veteran and a medieval historian, left \nBrown University to become the first chairman of the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities. Since then, Brown University has been in the \nforefront of research and study in humanities, recognized for its \nextraordinary excellence with repeated fellowships and grants for \nhumanities research over the last thirty years. Rhode Island and the \nNation as a whole have benefited enormously from this work. Mr. \nPresident, I would ask unanimous consent that two pieces by Edward \nAbrahams, director of government and community relations at Brown \nUniversity--an op-ed article on the importance of the humanities that \nappeared recently in the Providence Journal and remarks delivered on \nHumanities Day--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From The Providence Journal-Bulletin, Mar. 17, 1995]\n\n             Lyndon Johnson, Brown and the Birth of the NEH\n\n                           By Edward Abrahams\n\n       `A great nation (and a great civilization) feeds upon the \n     depth of its scholarship--as well as the breath of its \n     educational opportunity.'' So said President Lyndon Johnson \n     at Brown University in 1964.\n       Today, in sharp contrast, the new Republican majority in \n     Congress has targeted, among many other legislative \n     accomplishments of Johnson's Great Society, the National \n     Endowment for the Humanities. While President Clinton's \n     budget would increase expenditures for the endowment by 3 \n     percent, to $183 million, House Republicans, led by Newt \n     Gingrich, say they intend to kill both NEH and its more \n     controversial partner, the National Endowment for the Arts.\n       Because NEH has not been reauthorized for the past two \n     years, most analysts concur that the effort to eliminate it \n     could succeed. House Republicans have said that they do not \n     intend to fund any programs that remain unauthorized. In \n     fact, NEH will claim victory if it survives in its current \n     configuration with a smaller budget. Indicative of things \n     perhaps to come is the current drive to rescind $5 million \n     from this year's budgets for both endowments.\n       Last year, the NEH spent about $150 million to help support \n     research, education and cultural life in America, including \n     $2.3 million in Rhode Island. Among the larger projects \n     funded by the endowment at Brown in their joint effort to \n     provide public service through education and research, for \n     example, were a summer seminar for college teachers on Piers \n     Plowman and The Canterbury Tales, a summer course for high \n     school teachers on The Tale of Gengi, and the Women Writers \n     Project. The last, matched by contributions from the \n     university, seeks to ensure the inclusion of women's \n     contributions to literature by rediscovering, encoding and \n     sometimes publishing (with Oxford University Press) lost \n     women's writing in English from 1330 to 1830.\n       The project has enabled scholars to study the development \n     of the English language as well as pioneer the writing of \n     computer codes for international transactions of information \n     in business and technology.\n       Brown's relations with NEH have been notably close. The \n     university's leaders were in fact present at the proposed \n     creation of the endowment. In September 1964, President \n     Lyndon Johnson traveled to Brown to receive an honorary \n     degree, and announce that in his view ``national greatness'' \n     required that ``there . . . be no neglect of the \n     humanities.'' Johnson said that he ``look[ed] with the \n     greatest favor upon the proposal [issued earlier in the year \n     by Brown's] President [Barnaby] Keeney's Commission for the \n     National Foundation for the Humanities.''\n       In language suggestive of another era, the Keeney \n     Commission had recommended the creation of a federal \n     foundation to support ``whatever understanding can be \n     attained . . . of such enduring values as justice, freedom, \n     virtue, beauty, and truth.'' Within months of Johnson's \n     address, with the help of Sen. Claiborne Pell (who is \n     regarded as the father of both endowments) in the Senate and \n     John Brademas in the House, Johnson pushed through Congress \n     the act that established both NEH and NEA.\n       In 1966, Keeney, a decorated veteran and a medieval \n     historian, left Brown's presidency to become the first \n     chairman of NEH.\n       After Vietnam and Watergate, few intellectuals on either \n     side of the political spectrum find much firepower in the \n     old-fashioned liberal rhetoric that Keeney and Johnson both \n     used to launch their hope of providing modest federal funds \n     to promote education and research in the humanities. But in \n     1964 most Americans felt that the humanities and the arts not \n     only could enrich their lives, but that they also could \n     contribute to realizing the promise of American life, which \n     they did not then, and perhaps do not today, see only in \n     materialist terms.\n       Without faith in the inherent national significance of the \n     mission of universities like Brown, not to mention the \n     federal government, it becomes difficult to defend, let alone \n     advance, the public commitment Johnson legislatively \n     harnessed only 30 years ago to support scholarship and public \n     programming and, with the passage of the Higher Education Act \n     in 1965, begin to provide universal access to higher \n     education. All have come under considerable pressure for \n     years. They are threatened even more by the new Congress.\n       The attacks on both endowments are serious, far out of \n     proportion to the insignificant amount of federal dollars in \n     a $1.6 trillion budget they channel to such projects as \n     rediscovering lost literature or teaching high school and \n     college teachers medieval literature. They suggest that we \n     have lost confidence in our national institutions to solve \n     collective problems or to give us a sense of identity or \n     direction.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                             Humanities Day\n\n       ``Our cultural institutions are an essential national \n     resource; they must be kept strong.'' So said President \n     Reagan in 1981.\n       For over three decades, one of the most important agencies \n     that has helped keep them strong has been the National \n     Endowment for the Humanities. That is why the Association of \n     American Universities, which I represent here today, \n     unequivocally supports full funding for the Endowment. An \n     association of 60 universities represented in almost all \n     fifty states, the AAU is committed to advancing research and \n     education in America.\n       NEH has more than fulfilled its mission. It has, in the \n     parlance of our budget conscious era, offered an impressive \n     return on the investment of public dollars. Every President \n     and every Congress since 1965 has supported NEH. They have \n     done so because they have understand that a free and good \n     government, in Jefferson's words, depends on an enlightened \n     citizenry.\n       A single controversial project should not blind us from \n     seeing how well NEH has advanced culture and learning in \n     America, while helping us also conserve our nation's heritage \n     and preserve its memory.\n       I have here a list which is also available to you. It is a \n     representative sample of NEH-sponsored projects at America's \n     colleges and universities. Permit me to mention three.\n       At Rice University in Texas, an NEH grant enables scholars \n     there to compile and edit a seven-volume series of Jefferson \n     Davis' papers.\n       At the University of Mississippi an NEH grant facilitated a \n     ``Memories of Mississippi'' exhibit that recorded ordinary \n     citizens' recollections of the Depression era in the northern \n     part of that state.\n       And at Ohio State University NEH funds are assisting \n     secondary school teachers' efforts to integrate Arabic \n     language and culture courses in local high schools.\n       What these projects have in common is that they make our \n     nation stronger through the advancement of knowledge, \n     culture, and education.\n       In brief, we need to understand--and we need to make our \n     elected representatives understand--that if NEH is \n     disproportionately cut, America's cultural institutions will \n     not be kept strong. They will bleed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14545-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby M, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed \nthe following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2288.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, in introducing a \nbill to allow the vessel Sarah-Christen to be employed in coastwise \ntrade of the United States. This boat has a small passenger capacity, \ncarrying up to 12 passengers in a charter business. The purpose of this \nbill is to waive those sections of the Jones Act which prohibit \nforeign-made vessels from operating in coastwise trade. The waiver is \nnecessary because, under the law, a vessel is not considered built in \nthe United States unless all major components of its hull and \nsuperstructures are fabricated in the United States, and the vessel is \nassembled entirely in the United States. This vessel was originally \nbuilt in a foreign shipyard in 1971, but since then has been owned and \noperated by American citizens, repaired in American shipyards, and \nmaintained with American products. The owner of the vessel simply \nwishes to start a small business, a charter boat operation, seasonally \ntaking people out for cruises.\n  After reviewing the facts in the case of the Sarah-Christen, I find \nthat this wavier does not compromise our national readiness in times of \nnational emergency, which is the fundamental purpose of the Jones Act \nrequirement. While I generally support the provisions of the Jones Act, \nI believe the specific facts in this case warrant a waiver to permit \nthe Sarah-Christen to engage in coastwise trade.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to regulate \nthe commercial transportation of horses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n  the humane methods of livestock slaughter act amendments act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last year I introduced \nlegislation amending the Federal Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter \nAct to regulate the commercial transportation of horses to slaughter \nfacilities. After considerable discussion and much mail on this \nimportant issue, I have made several modifications to the original \nbill. Today, I am introducing legislation that will provide greater \noversight and \n\n[[Page S 14548]]\nintegrity concerning the commercial transportation of horses to \nslaughter facilities.\n  I am pleased that my bill is supported by the American Horse Council, \nand the American Horse Protection Association. Other organizations that \nsupport this legislation include the American Association of Equine \nPractitioners, the American Humane Association, the American Society \nfor Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Humane Society of the \nUnited States.\n  Currently, some horses are being transported for long periods in \novercrowded conditions without rest, food, or water. Some vehicles used \nfor transport have inadequate headroom and are not intended to \ntransport large animals. Further, some of the horses transported have \nserious injuries which can be severely aggravated by the journey. This \nlegislation would give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to \ncorrect these practices by regulating those in the business of \ntransporting horses to processing facilities.\n  I want to make it clear that it is not my intention to either promote \nor prevent the commercial slaughter of horses. This industry has been \nin existence for a long time in this country, and I expect that it will \ncontinue to operate long into the future. My purpose in this \nlegislation is to protect horses from unduly harsh and unpleasant \ntreatment as they are transported across the country.\n  Horses occupy a central role in the traditions, history, and economy \nof Kentucky. Thousands of Kentuckians are employed either directly or \nindirectly by the horse industry. Horses have been good to Kentucky; \nand we should try to the maximum practical extent to be good to horses.\n  This bill would require that horses be rested off the vehicle after \n24 hours, with access to food and water. Vehicles used to transport the \nhorses would have to have adequate headroom and interiors free of sharp \nedges. Transporting vehicles must be maintained in a sanitary \ncondition, offer adequate ventilation and shelter from extremes of heat \nand cold, be large enough for the number of horses transported, and \nallow for the position of horses by size, with stallions segregated \nfrom other horses. Finally, in order to be transported, horses must be \nphysically fit to travel.\n  Enforcement of the Act is placed with the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, which presently regulates the slaughter process itself \nunder the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The Department would be \nauthorized to work with State and local authorities to enforce the \nprovisions of this bill. This bill, while correcting abuses that exist, \nwill not be an excessive burden on the processing facilities, auctions, \nor the commercial transporters of these horses.\n  Unlike other livestock, the transportation of horses to processing \nfacilities is often a lengthy process, because there are fewer \nfacilities that handle horses and they are located in only a few areas. \nMoreover, not all of them operate on a full-time basis. The result is \nthat the transporting of these animals requires special protection.\n  There are several States that have passed legislation to regulate the \ntransportation of these horses, but most of the travel is interstate, \nacross wide areas. This is why Federal legislation is needed. The \nshipment of horses over long distances in inappropriate trailers, \nwithout food or water, is unacceptable. This bill would extend Federal \nregulation to the commercial transport of horses to slaughter and \nassure the humane and safe conditions of that transport.\n  I invite all groups that are concerned about these horses to work \nwith me in passing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1283\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 17 to adapt the copyright to the \ndigital, networked environment of the National Information \nInfrastructure, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n    the national information infrastructure copyright protection act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, together with my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, I am introducing the National \nInformation Infrastructure Copyright Protection Act of 1995, which \namends the Copyright Act to bring it up to date with the digital \ncommunications age.\n  The National Information Infrastructure or ``NII'' is a fancy name \nfor what is popularly known as the ``information highway.'' Probably \nmost people today experience the information highway by means of their \ncomputers when they use electronic mail or subscribe to a bulletin \nboard service or use other on-line services. But these existing \nservices are only dirt roads compared to the superhighway of \ninformation-sharing which lies ahead.\n  The NII of the future will link not only computers, but also \ntelephones, televisions, radios, fax machines, and more into an \nadvanced, high-speed, interactive, broadband, digital communications \nsystem. Over this information superhighway, data, text, voice, sound, \nand images will travel, and their digital format will permit them not \nonly to be viewed or heard, but also to be copied and manipulated. The \ndigital format will also ensure that copies will be perfect \nreproductions, without the degradation that normally occurs today when \naudio and videotapes are copied.\n  The NII has tremendous potential to improve and enhance our lives, by \nproviding quick, economical, and high-quality access to information \nthat educates and entertains as well as informs. When linked up to a \n``Global Information Infrastructure,'' the NII will broaden our \ncultural experiences, and allow American products to be more widely \ndisseminated.\n  Highways, of course, are meant to be used, and in order to be used, \nthey must be safe. That's why we have ``rules of the road'' on our \nasphalt highways and that's why we need rules for our digital highway. \nNo manufacturer would ship his or her goods on a highway if his trucks \nwere routinely hijacked and his or her goods plundered. Likewise, no \nproducer of intellectual property will place his or her works on the \ninformation superhighway if they are routinely pirated. We might end up \nhaving enormous access to very little information, unless we can \nprotect property rights in intellectual works. The piracy problem is \nparticularly acute in the digital age where perfect copies can be made \nquickly and cheaply.\n  Protecting the property rights of the owners of intellectual property \nnot only induces them to make their products available, it also \nencourages the creation of new products. Our copyright laws are based \non the conviction that creativity increases when authors can reap \nbenefits of their creative activity.\n  But the NII also promises to increase creativity in a more dramatic \nway by providing individual creators with public distribution of their \nworks outside traditional channels. For example, authors who have been \nunsuccessful in finding a publisher will be able to distribute their \nworks themselves to great numbers of people at very low cost.\n  The bill that I am introducing today begins the process of designing \nthe rules of the road for the information superhighway. It was drafted \nby the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the Information \nInfrastructure Task Force. Chaired by the Honorable Bruce A Lehman, \nAssistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and \nTrademarks, the Working Group labored for 2 years examining the \nintellectual property implications of the NII to determine if changes \nwere necessary to intellectual property law and to recommend \nappropriate statutory language.\n  The Working Group drew upon the expertise of 26 departments and \nagencies of the Federal Government; it heard the testimony of 30 \nwitnesses and received some 70 written statements from all interested \nparties. On July 7, 1994, it produced a preliminary draft (``Green \nPaper''), which opened another period of extensive testimony and \ncomment. The Final Report, containing a draft of the legislation that I \nam introducing today, was unveiled on September 5, 1995.\n  The length and scope of the Working Group's investigation would alone \ncommend its recommendations to serious attention, but I have also \nstudied the legislation and find it an excellent basis for the \nCommittee on the Judiciary to begin its own examination of the issues \nwith a view to fine-tuning the solutions proposed by the Working Group.\n  The bill deals with five major areas:\n  (1) transmission of copies,\n  (2) exemptions for libraries and the visually impaired,\n  (3) copyright protection systems,\n  (4) copyright management information, and\n  (5) remedies.\n  In general, the bill provides as follows:\n  Transmission of Copies. The bill makes clear that the right of public \ndistribution in the Copyright Act applies to transmission of copies and \nphonorecords of copyrighted works. For example, this means that \ntransmitting a copy of a computer program from one computer to ten \nother computers without permission of the copyright owner would \nordinarily be an infringement.\n\n  Exemptions for Libraries and the Visually Impaired. The bill amends \nthe current exemption for libraries to allow the preparation of three \ncopies of works in digital format, and it authorizes the making of a \nlimited number of digital copies by libraries and archives for purposes \nof preservation.\n  The bill adds a new exemption for non-profit organizations to \nreproduce and distribute to the visually impaired--at cost--Braille, \nlarge type, audio or other editions of previously published literary \nworks, provided that the owner of the exclusive right to distribute the \nwork in the United States has not entered the market for such editions \nduring the first year following first publication.\n  Copyright Protection Systems. The bill adds a new section which \nprohibits the importation, manufacture or distribution of any device or \nproduct, or the provision of any service, the primary purpose or effect \nof which is to deactivate any technological protections which prevent \nor inhibit the violation of exclusive rights under the copyright law.\n  Copyright Management Information. ``Copyright management \ninformation'' is information that identifies the author of the work, \nthe copyright owner, the terms and conditions for uses of the work, and \nother information that the Register of Copyrights may prescribe. The \nbill prohibits the dissemination of copyright management information \nknown to be false and the unauthorized removal or alteration of \ncopyright management information.\n  Remedies. The bill provides for civil penalties for circumvention of \ncopyright protection systems and for tampering with copyright \nmanagement information, including injunction, impoundment, actual or \nstatutory damages, costs, attorney's fees, and the modification or \ndestruction of products and devices.\n  The bill provides criminal penalties for tampering with copyright \nmanagement information--a fine of not more than $500,000 or \nimprisonment of not more than 5 years or both.\n  There is widespread support for the general thrust of the bill among \ninterested parties. However, during the hearing process, I am sure that \nissues will arise that no one has yet anticipated. Already, some \npotential discussion points have been identified: the scope of the \nlibrary exemption and the exemption for the visually impaired, the \nabsence of criminal penalties for circumvention of copyright protection \nsystems, the use of encryption as a copyright protection system, the \napplication of the doctrine of fair use, the development of efficient \nlicensing models, and the liability of on-line service providers.\n  In the interest of time, it may be that fuller discussion and \nsolution may \n\n[[Page S 14551]]\nhave to be deferred for those points not covered expressly in the bill. \nThe fully commercial information superhighway is not yet here, and we \nmust resign ourselves to a period of experimentation. We want to be on \nthe cutting edge, not the bleeding edge of new technology.\n  Once again, I would like to commend the Working Group on Intellectual \nProperty Rights of the Information Infrastructure Task Force for \nproviding an excellent model for us to work with. I also recommend to \nall interested parties that they read the full report of the Working \nGroup. Without endorsing any of the specific language of that report, I \nbelieve that it provides useful background material for the recommended \nchanges.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, for joining me in introducing this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1284\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall take \n     effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join today in the introduction of the \n``NII Copyright Protection Act.'' This bill reflects the effort of the \nWorking Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Assistant \nSecretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Bruce \nA. Lehman. The Working Group included key Federal agencies in \nconsultation with the private sector, public interest groups and State \nand local governments. Its examination of the intellectual property \nimplications of the National Information Infrastructure forms a \ncritical component of the Information Infrastructure Task Force, \ncreated in early 1993 by President Clinton and Vice President Gore.\n  This legislative proposal confronts fundamental questions about the \nrole of copyright in the next century. On July 7, 1995, the Working \nGroup released its preliminary draft report. Following additional \nhearings, public comment and consultation, the Administration released \nits long-awaited ``White Paper,'' or final report, on copyright \nprotection in the digital, electronic information age on September 5, \n1995. This 238-page report, ``Intellectual Property and the National \nInformation Infrastructure,'' culminates in legislative recommendations \nthat are incorporated in this bill. This bill takes important steps \ntoward answering questions about the structure of copyright protection \nfor decades to come.\n  Increasing the accessibility to computer networks is of vital \nimportance to our Nation's continued economic health and growth. \nComputers have already been integrated into virtually everything we do \nfrom getting cash at bank ATMs, paying for our groceries at the local \nmarket, and sending e-mail messages to friends, to making a simple \ntelephone call that is directed by the telephone companies' computers.\n  Our dependence on computers only grows. Businesses both large and \nsmall depend on computers to communicate, manage and improve their \ndelivery of goods and services. In fact, small businesses can use \ncomputers successfully to keep up with their bigger competitors.\n  We have to make sure that all of us feel as comfortable with using \ncomputers as we did, in my youth, using a typewriter. We have to make \nsure that we appreciate all the advantages that networked communities, \nsuch as the Internet, have to offer. Computer networks will \nincreasingly become the means of transmitting copyrighted works in the \nyears ahead. This presents great opportunities but also poses \nsignificant risks to authors and our copyright industries.\n  I believe that we can legislate in ways that promote the use of the \nInternet, both by content providers and users. We must and will update \nour copyright laws to protect the intellectual property rights of \ncreative works available online. The future growth of computer networks \nlike the Internet and of digital, electronic communications requires \nit. Otherwise, owners of intellectual property will be unwilling to put \ntheir material online. If there is no content worth reading online, the \ngrowth of this medium will be stifled, and public accessibility will be \nretarded.\n  The Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights put \nit this way:\n\n       Thus, the full potential of the NII will not be realized if \n     the education, information and entertainment products \n     protected by intellectual property laws are not protected \n     effectively when disseminated via the NII. Creators and other \n     owners of intellectual property will not be willing to put \n     their interests at risk if appropriate systems--both in the \n     U.S. and internationally--are not in place to permit them to \n     set and enforce the terms and conditions under which their \n     works are made available in the NII environment. Likewise, \n     the public will not use the services available on the NII and \n     generate the market necessary for its success unless a wide \n     variety of works are available under equitable and reasonable \n     terms and conditions, and the integrity of those works is \n     assured. All the computers, telephones, fax machines, \n     scanners, cameras, keyboards, televisions, monitors, \n     printers, switches, routers, wires, cables, networks, and \n     satellites in the world will not create a successful NII, if \n     there is no content. What will drive the NII is the content \n     moving through it.\n\n  The emergence of the computer networks forming the backbone of the \nNational Information Infrastructure in this country and the Global \nInformation Infrastructure worldwide hold enormous promise. They also \npresent an enormous challenge to those of us in government and in the \nprivate sector to make sure it is accessible and affordable to all.\n  I support a balanced approach to digital communications and have \nalready proposed a series of other bills to foster the continued growth \nof electronic communications while encouraging creativity. Together \nwith this NII Copyright Protection Act, they will go a long way toward \ncreating an environment for growth of digital networks.\n  When we consider information providers we cannot leave out the \nFederal Government. Government databases hold vast amounts of \ninformation that is not restricted by copyright and is legally required \nby the Freedom of Information Act to be available to the public, who \npaid for its collection. Earlier this year I introduced, along with \nSenators Hank Brown and John Kerry, the ``Electronic Freedom of \nInformation Improvement Act of 1995,'' S.1090, to require federal \nagencies to make more information available in electronic form and \nonline so that it can be readily accessible to students and scholars \ndoing research, companies who need the data for business purposes or \nsimply curious members of the public.\n  Government ought to be using technology to make itself more \naccountable and government information more accessible to the public. \nIndividual federal agencies are already contributing to the development \nof the much heralded National Information Infrastructure by using \ntechnology to make Government information more easily accessible to our \ncitizens. For example, the Internet Multicasting Service [IMS] now \nposts massive government data archives, including the Securities and \nExchange Commission EDGAR database and the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice database on the Internet free of charge. Similarly, FedWorld, a \nbulletin board available on the Internet, provides a gateway to more \nthan 60 Federal agencies.\n  The Electronic Freedom of Information Improvement Act would \ncontribute to that information flow by increasing online access to \nGovernment information, including agency regulations, opinions, and \npolicy statements, and FOIA-released records that are the subject of \nrepeated requests. This bill passed the Senate in the last Congress and \nI hope to see it through both Houses of this Congress.\n  Our increasing reliance on networked computers for business and \nsocializing also makes us more vulnerable to hackers and computer \ncriminals. Anyone who has had to deal with the aftermath of a computer \nvirus knows what havoc can be. Having previously been active in \nlegislation to prevent computer crime and abuse, I have this year \nintroduced the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act, \nS.982, with Senators Kyl and Grassley to increase protection for both \ngovernment and private computers, and the information on those \ncomputers, from the growing threat of computer crime. This bill would \nincrease protection against computer thieves, hackers and blackmailers \nand protecting computer systems used in interstate and foreign commerce \nand communications from destructive activity. It also serves to \nincrease personal privacy, a matter on which I feel most strongly.\n  Finally, I note my recent introduction with Senator Feingold of the \nCriminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995, S.1122. This bill is \ndesigned to close a significant loophole in our copyright law and \nencourage the continued growth of the NII by insuring better protection \nof the creative works available online.\n  Under current law, a defendant's willful copyright infringement must \nbe for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain to be \nthe subject of criminal prosecution. As exemplified by the recent case \nof United States v. LaMacchia, this presents an enormous loophole in \ncriminal liability for willful infringers who can use digital \ntechnology to make exact copies of copyrighted software or other \ndigitally encoded works, and then use computer networks for quick, \ninexpensive and \n\n[[Page S 14553]]\nmass distribution of pirated, infringing works.\n  The Report of the Working Group recognizes that the LaMacchia case \ndemonstrates that the current law is insufficient to prevent flagrant \ncopyright violations in the NII context and generally supports the \namendments to the copyright law and the criminal law (which sets out \nsanctions for criminal copyright violations) set forth in S.1122, \nintroduced in the 104th Congress by Senators Leahy and Feingold \nfollowing consultations with the Justice Department. This increasingly \nimportant problem must be solved and the Criminal Copyright Improvement \nAct, S.1122, is a necessary component of the legal changes we need to \nadapt to the emerging digital environment.\n  Today I join in sponsoring a bill that will help update our copyright \nlaw to the emerging electronic and digital age by revising basic \ncopyright law definitions to take electronic transmissions into \naccount. Further it endorses the use of copyright protection systems so \nthat we may take fullest advantage of the technological developments \nthat can be used to protect copyright and provide incentives for \ncreativity. The bill provides graduated civil and criminal remedies for \nthe circumvention of copyright protection systems through the use of \nfalse copyright management information.\n  Finally, it suggests certain limited exemptions for libraries and the \nvisually impaired. In this bill and others we need carefully to \nconstruct the proper balance that will respect copyright, encourage and \nreward creativity and serve the needs of public access to works.\n  I believe that technological developments, such as the development of \nthe Internet and remote computer information databases, are leading to \nimportant advancements in accessibility and affordability of \ninformation and entertainment services. We see opportunities to break \nthrough barriers previously facing those living in rural settings and \nthose with physical disabilities. Democratic values can be served by \nmaking more information and services available.\n  The public interest requires the consideration and balancing of such \ninterests. In the area of creative rights that balance has rested on \nencouraging creativity by ensuring rights that reward it while \nencouraging its public performance, distribution and display.\n  The Constitution speaks in terms of promoting the progress of science \nand useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors \nthe exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. \nTechnological developments and the emergence of the Global Information \nInfrastructure hold enormous promise and opportunity for creators, \nartists, copyright industries and the public. There are methods of \ndistribution emerging that dramatically affect the role of copyright \nand the accessibility of art, literature, music, film and information \nto all Americans.\n  I was pleased to work with Chairman Hatch, Senator Thurmond, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Thompson and others earlier this year to craft a \nbill creating a performance right in sound recordings, a matter that \nhad been a source of contention for more than 20 years. That bill, The \nDigital Performance Rights in Sound Recordings Act of 1995, S.227, \ndeals with digital transmissions, has already passed the Senate and \nshould soon be the law of the land.\n  Senator Hatch and I have also previously joined to cosponsor the \nAnticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1995, S.1136, to add law \nenforcement tools against counterfeit goods and to protect the \nimportant intellectual property rights associated with trademarks. I \nanticipate prompt hearings on that important measure and its enactment \nthis Congress.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Hatch, the Chairman of the \nJudiciary, and others to adapt our copyright laws to the needs of the \nNII and the global information society, as well. The amendment of our \ncopyright laws is an important and essential effort, one that merits \nour time and attention. I hope and trust that we will soon begin \nhearings on this important measure so that we may be sure to understand \nits likely impact both domestically and internationally. We must \ncarefully balance the authors' interest in protection along with the \npublic's interest in the accessibility of information.\n  Ours is a time of unprecedented challenge to copyright protection. \nCopyright has been the engine that has traditionally converted the \nenergy of artistic creativity into publicly available arts and \nentertainment. Historically, Government's role has been to encourage \ncreativity and innovation by protecting copyrights that create \nincentives for the dissemination to the public of new works and forms \nof expression. That is the tradition that I intend to continue in this \nbill, the NII Copyright Protection Act of 1995.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed \ncolleague from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, to express my concern that by voting \nfor final passage of H.R. 2099, we in the Congress are voting to \neliminate funding for the Community Development Financial Institution \nFund [CDFI]. The CDFI fund was established in the Community Development \nBanking and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994--an Act which passed the \nCongress with overwhelming bipartisan support. In fact, this body voted \nunanimously for the measure, which sought to stimulate community \nlending and empower local communities by increasing access to credit \nand investment capital.\n  But Mr. President, I stand before you to offer another perspective on \nthe importance of the CDFI fund, and that is the significant potential \nit holds for improving the economic conditions in Native American \ncommunities. Native American communities face some of the harshest \nliving conditions in this country, leading some to draw comparisons \nwith conditions in Third-World countries. Fifty-one percent of native \nAmerican families living on reservations live below the poverty line, \nwith unemployment rates on some reservations as high as 80 percent. \nMoreover, a recent study conducted by the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development found that over half of American Indian and Alaska \nNative families live in substandard housing, compared to the national \naverage of 3 percent; 27 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native \nhouseholds are overcrowded or lack plumbing or kitchen facilities, \ncompared to a national average of 5.4 percent; and approximately 40 \npercent of Native households were overcrowded, compared to a national \naverage of 5.8 percent.\n  Mr. President, these conditions, under any circumstances, are \nunacceptable. And it is even more unacceptable that we in the Congress \nwould turn our backs on an innovative program which would stimulate \neconomic activity in these communities by leveraging private sector \nresources into permanent self-sustaining locally controlled \ninstitutions. Each $1 million in the fund would have a substantial \nimpact, and could create 65 to 135 new jobs; provide 100 loans to \nmicro-enterprises and self-employment ventures; assist 20 first-time \nhomebuyers; or construct 20 units of low-income housing. It is my \nunderstanding that there are at least 13 Indian controlled financial \ninstitutions which would be eligible for assistance from the fund, and \nan additional 16 tribal entities that have expressed an interest in \nbecoming CDFI's.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Senators Ben Nighthorse Campbell and \nMcCain in sponsoring a bill, the Native American Financial Services \nOrganization Act [NAFSO], which emanated from recommendations of the \ncongressionally chartered Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, \nand Native Hawaiian Housing, and from a multi-agency Federal working \ngroup with tribal input, and was designed to dovetail with the CDFI \nfund, with NAFSO serving as a technical assistance provider to a second \ntier of primary lending institutions, or Native American Financial \nInstitutions. The elimination of funding for the CDFI fund will have \ndevastating ramifications for this NAFSO proposal.\n  Mr. President, I realize full well the climate within which we \noperate today, and that we in the Congress must exercise great fiscal \nrestraint. And I commend the outstanding efforts of my esteemed \ncolleagues, the chairman of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, Mr. \nBond, and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, for producing a bill \nunder these constraints--a bill which attempts in many ways to address \nthe housing needs of Indian country. I only wish to point out that we \nin the Congress must ever be cognizant of our national responsibilities \nto the native people of this Nation, and that we must endeavor to \nimprove the conditions under which the vast majority of our Native \nfamilies live.\n  I feel compelled to take note of the irony that over the last few \ndays, within the context of drastic reductions to funding for Indian \ntribal governments under the Interior Appropriations bill, that one of \nthe justifications offered for these severe reductions was that tribal \ngovernments must become less dependent on Federal resources and more \nself-sufficient. And yet, today, we are poised to eliminate funding for \nthe Community Development Financial Institution Fund--a fund which \ncould have made tremendous strides in enabling tribal governments to \nrealize greater economic independence.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this time, and I thank my colleague \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Leahy, for his leadership on these matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14559-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14559-S14560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEDICATED U.S. SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to thank our brave \nU.S. service men and women who with total dedication serve around the \nglobe, but most importantly to pay tribute to four individuals who \nrecently died in the service of our country. On August 15, 1995, Chief \nWarrant Officer Michael R. Baker, Chief Warrant Officer Donald J. \nCunningham, Specialist Crew Chief Robert A. Rogers, and Specialist Crew \nChief Dale Wood perished when their U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter \ncrashed into the sea off the shores of Cyprus. The crew was on a \nroutine humanitarian mission to bring supplies and mail to the U.S. \nEmbassy in Beirut.\n  U.S. service men and women worldwide are frequently responsible for \nhumanitarian and lifesaving missions which often go unnoticed by the \nAmerican people. These missions are often fraught with danger \nattributable to health concerns or often insurgent occupation. The \nCyprus airlift is just one example where our U.S. service men and women \nare tasked to put themselves in harms way.\n  In addition to Cyprus being needed as a strategic point to support \nour Middle East efforts it has also become a strategic point for United \nStates involvement in several areas of international concern, such as \ncounterterrorist measures, narcotics trafficking, counterfeiting, money \nlaundering, and international bank fraud. The Cyprus \n\n[[Page S 14560]]\nNational Police force has been very cooperative and helpful in our \ninternational law enforcement efforts. I would like to take this \nopportunity to personally thank Assistant Chief of Police Panikos \nHadjiloizou. Chief Hadjiloizou has been noted as being one of the \ndriving forces in the cooperative international law enforcement effort \nbeing conducted within Cyprus. Chief Hadjiloizou has worked in close \ncoordination with the U.S. Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Agency, \nand other U.S. law enforcement agencies in efforts to stem these \norganized criminal organizations. I wanted to take this opportunity to \nthank Chief Hadjiloizou and hope that this cooperative effort continues \nits successful campaign. I also want to thank Chief Hadjiloizou and the \nmen under his command for their extraordinary efforts to locate and \nrecover the remains of the Blackhawk crew in order to return them to \ntheir families.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to a distinguished Marylander, committed environmentalist, and \nmodel citizen--Judith Colt Johnson. Judy recently stepped aside from a \nlong and distinguished career as president of the Committee to Preserve \nAssateague Island. I want to extend my personal congratulations and \nthanks for her many years of hard work and dedication to the \nenvironment and the stewardship of Assateague Island's ecosystem.\n  Judy Johnson founded the Committee to Preserve Assateague Island in \n1970, the year I was first elected to the U.S. Congress, and served as \nits president for the past 25 years. Over the years, Judy worked \ntirelessly to preserve the natural beauty and unspoiled character of \nAssateague Island. Her accomplishments are many and remarkable. Among \nother things she: Led the successful campaign to amend the organic act \nfor the National Seashore to remove provisions calling for construction \nof a road the length of the island and 600 acres of development; \ndeveloped a grass-roots membership of over 1,300 people representing 38 \nstates; blocked construction of a sewage outfall pipe across the \nisland; sponsored an annual beach cleanup marshalling larger volunteer \nefforts each year; and convened the first-ever conference on the \ncondition of Maryland's coastal bays which initiated the current \nefforts to protect these sensitive waters;\n  Judy not only organized and led these efforts, but gave selflessly of \nher time and energy to make Assateague a better place for all of us. \nShe has done this through activities such as cleaning trash from the \nbeach and helping plant stems of beach grasses and seedlings to protect \nvaluable wildlife habitat. She also contributed substantially to the \ndevelopment of the master plan for Chincoteague National Wildlife \nRefuge--now considered a model for other wildlife refuges in coastal \nareas--and actively participated in hundreds of public meetings, \nhearings and workshops on issues affecting Assateague and the \nsurrounding areas. Her monthly newletters have provided invaluable \ninformation on potential threats to the natural habitat and ecology of \nthis fragile barrier island as well as the many noteworthy events and \nspecial values of this area. I have had the privilege of working \nclosely with Judy and her organization on a number of issues affecting \nAssateague Island and can attest that Assateague Island would not look \nas it does today had it not been for all the hard work of Judy Johnson \nover the years. Judy's indefatigable energy, spirit and determination \nare renowned.\n  Mrs. Johnson's activities and interests were not limited to her \ninvolvement with the Committee to Preserve Assateague Island. She also \nserved on numerous national and State conservation organizations \nincluding the Maryland Wetlands Committee, the Maryland and Virginia \nConservation Councils, the board of the Coast Alliance, the advisory \ncouncil to the National Parks and Conservation Association and the \nGarden Club of America. In recognition of her outstanding service and \ndedication, Judy has received numerous awards and commendations \nincluding the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Commander's Award for Public \nService, the Izaak Walton League of America Honor Roll Award, the Take \nPride in America Award given by the U.S. Department of the Interior, \nand the National Parks and Conservation Association's Conservationist \nof the Year Award.\n  The efforts of Judy Johnson over the past 25 years have earned her \nthe respect and admiration of everyone with whom she has worked and the \nvisitors to Assateague Island will benefit from her labors for years to \ncome. I join with her many friends in extending my best wishes and \nthanks for her leadership and commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14560-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14560-S14561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE AMERICAN PROMISE\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about \nan important new PBS series entitled ``The American Promise'', which \nwill premiere on October l, 2, and 3. ``The American Promise'' \ncelebrates community based-democracy--the individual works of countless \ncitizens throughout America who work every day to make their \ncommunities stronger and more vital.\n  There is no question that our actions in this Capitol represent \ndemocracy's most visible work. It is the facet of democracy most \nstudied in classrooms and most reported nationally by the media.\n  But our legislative world, Mr. President, has increasingly, in my \njudgment, become a world of partisanship and competition. The focus too \noften turns to who wins and who loses rather than how we can work \ntogether to reach a positive goal. I believe this partisanship is \nmaking many of our citizens more frustrated and cynical.\n  So we can not forget that our work in Washington is but one form of \nAmerican democracy--and that American democracy is larger and more \ndiverse than the business conducted here in this Capitol.\n  In communities throughout our Nation, in ways both large and small, \ncitizens decide every day to become a valuable part of the democratic \nprocess. They do this by joining an organization; by bringing others \ntogether to improve or expand an existing service; by asking how a \npractice that does not work can be changed; by engaging in a civil and \nrespectful debate; by considering another viewpoint; or by taking \nresponsibility to make a hard decision which will make a community \nbetter.\n  When this happens, Mr. President, everybody in the community wins. \nWhen a community development bank is opened where none existed before, \nwhen individuals cooperate so that dry land can be irrigated, score \nkeeping becomes irrelevant. Through action and energy, participation \nand deliberation, taking responsibility and seeking common ground, \nAmerican democracy comes to life.\n  ``The American Promise'', a new PBS television series, reminds us of \nthe community-based democracy that is alive and well beyond this \nCapitol. And in doing so, it both strengthens our faith in our \ndemocracy and teaches our citizens how they can personally be a part of \nthe democratic process in their own communities. And because ``The \nAmerican Promise'' will be made available to high school and junior \nhigh school classes through the United States, young Americans will be \nable to have it as they study civics and government.\n  In roughly fifty story segments taken from every region of the \ncounty, lessons are offered on the skills and values needed to bring \nour democracy to life. These vignettes illustrate core American values \nsuch as freedom, responsibility, opportunity, participation, and \ndeliberation.\n  Each 3 hour segment contains select historical reenactments, which \nserve to establish important contexts through which the remaining \nvignettes take on new meaning. The first of these reenactments, which \nappears the beginning of the documentary, is set in l769, in the \nstreets of Williamsburg, VA. We watch as a young Thomas Jefferson, \nalong with Patrick Henry, Colonel \n\n[[Page S 14561]]\nGeorge Washington, Peyton Randolph, George Mason, Richard Henry Lee, \nand others, take the first steps toward freedom. In the House of \nBurgesses, on the streets of Colonial Williamsburg, in a local tavern, \nthe group draws up Virginia's plans to boycott English goods.\n  We hear Washington's words, ``How far their attention to our rights \nand privileges is to be awakened or alarmed by starving their trade and \nmanufacturers remains to be tried.'' The viewers of ``The American \nPromise'' see our Founding Fathers starting a rebellion that will \ngather strength for 7 more years before the Declaration of Independence \nis written.\n  Although we sometimes think of our freedoms as a Nation being won at \nConcord, Bunker Hill or Yorktown, these freedoms were also the result \nof years of meetings and debate and consensus building. This serves as \na true reminder of the communal instincts that helped create our great \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues and viewers across the Nation to \nwatch this important program. ``The American Promise'' reminds us what \nis right about America--and challenges us all to be good citizens \nalways working to make our Nation stronger and greater.\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, would the Senator from Missouri, the \nchairman of the VA, HUD, and Indepdent Agencies Subcommittee, yield a \nfew moments for me to address an issue of great important to the people \nof Hawaii and the Pacific?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to yield to the junior Senator from \nHawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am concerned that the disaster needs of \nthe Pacific are not being adequately addressed by the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency [FEMA]. In particular, I am concerned that FEMA lacks \nadequate staffing for its Pacific Area Office, located in Honolulu, to \naddress fully this mitigation, training, and emergency response needs \nof this large and diverse area.\n  As the Senator from Missouri knows, FEMA's Region IX, based in San \nFrancisco, is currently responsible for administering emergency \nmanagement assistance programs and responding to disasters throughout \nthe Pacific--including American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Marianas Islands, the Federated State of Micronesia, the \nRepublic of Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands--as well as \nin California, Arizona, and Nevada. It is by far the largest of FEMA's \nregions, covering an area greater in size than the U.S. mainland. But \nthe current grouping of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands within Region IX \nresults in the Pacific islands receiving less than adequate attention.\n  The Pacific insular states are seven different jurisdictions that are \nculturally, economically, and politically distinct from mainland \nstates. The estimated 110 FEMA employees who staff the San Francisco \noffice are too remote, both geographically and culturally, to provide \nthe full range of disaster-related assistance to the unique Pacific \ninsular states. Quite understandingably, they are preoccupied by the \nvast emergency needs of the populations who live closer at hand, in \nCalifornia, Nevada, and Arizona.\n  The Republic of Palau, for example, is 5,500 miles from San \nFranscisco--a 2-day journey from the continental U.S. by jet. Moreover, \nwhen FEMA officials finally arrive at the scene of a disaster that has \noccurred in the Pacific, they must contend with major differences in \nlanguage, facilities, food, climate, and communications not to mention \nthe idiosyncrasies of local political systems and administrative \npractices.\n  The establishment of the Pacific Area Office in Honolulu 2 years ago \nvastly improved FEMA's ability to respond quickly to disasters in the \ncentral and South Pacific, if only because the facility is located \nthousands of miles closer to potential disaster sites. And, while the \noffice has made a serious effort to maintain ongoing contact with the \nmore remote insular jurisdictions, it is seriously limited in its \nability to provide critical training, technical assistance, and hazard \nmitigation services that could significantly minimize loss of life and \nproperty.\n\n  So, given the foregoing, I might ask the Senator from Missouri if he \nwould consider the Pacific's emergency needs when the pending measure \ngoes to conference.\n  Mr. BOND. What is the Senator from Hawaii's specific request?\n  Mr. AKAKA. After extensive consultation with emergency management \nofficials and representatives of the Pacific insular states, I have \ndetermined that the service limitations I have described can only be \novercome by augmenting the Pacific Area Office with a minimum of twelve \n(12) additional permanent staff. Of these, six, (6) are needed in the \nPacific Area Office itself to support preparedness training, planning, \nmitigation, and logistical functions, and six (6) others are required \nas permanent liaison officers assigned to, and physically based in, \neach of FEMA's insular Pacific jurisdictions.\n  Mr. BOND. So the Senator from Hawaii requests assistance in securing \nconference report language directing FEMA to assign 12 FTEE to the \nPacific Area Office?\n  Mr. AKAKA. That is my request. The vital assistance provided by such \nstaff could save millions of dollars in property and economic activity, \nnot to mention human lives. I would underscore the fact that I am not \nproposing the establishment of a new regional office, only that the \nexisting satellite office in Hawaii be provided with the resources to \nmeet the full range of our emergency management obligations in the \nPacific.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I may interject. My colleagues may recall that as \nchairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Subcommittee in the \n102d Congress, I supported the original establishment of the Pacific \nArea Office. At that time, the subcommittee set aside $500,000 in the \nSenate report accompanying the FY92 VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations bill for this initiative.\n  The subcommittee's action reflected a concern that a permanent FEMA \npresence was needed in the Pacific. Until the office was opened in \nHonolulu in 1993, the agency had no forward-based staff or facilities \nin these jurisdictions; instead, all disaster activities were conducted \ndirectly from FEMA's Region IX office, located in San Francisco, \nthousands of miles from these jurisdictions.\n  While the creation of this office has clearly improved FEMA's ability \nto deal with the many disasters that occur in the Pacific, the agency \nstill falls short of fully providing for the emergency needs of our \ncitizens and friends in the Pacific. I think we need to consider \nseriously making the Pacific Area Office a full-service office, one \nthat can provide robust mitigation, training, and emergency response \nservices in a timely, appropriate fashion.\n\n  So, I would support the Senator from Hawaii's request that we \nconsider taking this matter up in conference.\n  Mr. AKAKA. The Senator from Maryland has ably summarized the essence \nof this issue. I appreciate her comments as well as her key role in \noriginally establishing the Pacific Area Office.\n  Mr. BOND. I also appreciate my colleague from Maryland's helpful \ncomments on this issue. Given her support, and in view of the unique \ncircumstances that exist in the Pacific, I would be pleased to consider \nseriously the Senator from Hawaii's request to raise this issue in \nconference. The Senator from Hawaii should, however, bear in mind that \nany efforts we make, if any, must be made in the context of FEMA's \noverall budget.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the managers of the bill for their thoughtful \nconsideration of this matter. Any accommodation that can be achieved in \nconference regarding the emergency management needs of the Pacific \nwould be very much appreciated. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14560-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14561-S14562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF BERNARD L. BARELA\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe retirement of Bernard L. Barela, District Director for the \nAlbuquerque District after 34 years with the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. Barela is a native of New Mexico whose family has been here for \nover 200 years. His mother, sister, and numerous family members still \nreside in the New Mexico area.\n  Mr. Barela served in the U.S. Navy from 1957 to 1959. Upon receiving \nan honorable discharge he returned to Albuquerque where he was a \ncivilian employee. \n\n[[Page S 14562]]\n\n  Mr. Barela began his IRS career as a grade 3 mail clerk in the \nPhoenix District Office on 1961. He then became an office call \ninterviewer in Phoenix until 1966.\n  After that he transferred to Las Vegas as a revenue officer until \n1969 whereupon he became revenue officer group manager in San \nBernardino, CA. In 1971, he moved to San Diego as chief of office \nbranch and was selected as one of the first grade 13 group managers in \ncollection in the Los Angeles District.\n  Mr. Barela moved to the field branch chief position in 1972 in San \nDiego and in l973 marked his first return to Albuquerque as a \ncollection and taxpayer service division chief. 1973 also marked \nanother promotion for Mr. Barela as the collection division chief in \nNew Orleans District. Mr. Barela served as executive assistant, to \nassistant regional commissioner, central region office in Cincinnati \nfrom 1975 to 1981.\n  In 1981, Mr. Barela entered the executive ranks of IRS, where he has \nserved in several positions of increasing responsibility. Mr. Barela's \nfirst executive assignment was an assistant director, returns and \nprocessing in Washington, DC, during 1981. In 1985 Mr. Barela became \nthe assistant director, service center in Atlanta. In 1989, Mr. Barela \nbecame assistant District Director in Fort Lauderdale where he assisted \nduring the recovery after Hurricane Andrew. In 1993, Mr. Barela \nreturned home to Albuquerque as the District Director, the highest \nState office with the IRS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14561-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14562-S14563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise to address H.R. 4, the \nPersonal Responsibility Act of 1995, a bill to reform the Nation's \nwelfare system.\n  H.R. 4 is a radical departure in Federal welfare policy. This bill \nwould end a 60-year-old Federal entitlement to poor families with \nchildren under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children Program \n[AFDC]. In the place of AFDC, the Senate bill would create a Federal \nwelfare block grant that will give almost $17 billion annually to State \ngovernments over the next 7 years to provide cash assistance, child \ncare, job training, and other services to our Nation's poor. The States \nwill have nearly complete flexibility to design and carry out these \nprograms. The Federal Government requires only that the States impose a \n5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits and begin moving welfare \nrecipients to work as rapidly as possible between now and the year \n2000.\n  Opponents of H.R. 4 have talked extensively about this bill's flaws. \nIt is said that the Federal money contained in the H.R. 4 is \ninsufficient to meet the work requirements. We are told that funds for \nchild care will make it impossible to care for the children of welfare \nrecipients who go to work. Others have argued that States will cut \nwelfare dramatically and set off a reverse bidding war as States reduce \nand eliminate benefits to avoid becoming welfare magnates.\n  Mr. President, I supported amendments to this legislation that \naddress many of these concerns. I voted for Senator Dodd's amendment \nthat would have provided an additional $6 billion in Federal child care \nsubsidies. We reached a compromise to increase Federal child care \nspending by some $3 billion. The Senate also agreed to require the \nStates to continue spending at least 80 percent of their 1994 welfare \ndollars. I believe these amendments have significantly improved H.R. 4 \nand increased the likelihood that it will succeed in reducing welfare \ndependence.\n  The Senate also took up an amendment offered by Senator Domenici on \nthe issue of limiting welfare benefit increases for women who have \nadditional children while on welfare. When H.R. 4 emerged from the \nFinance Committee it allowed States to impose the so-called family cap \nbut did not require it. The Dole substitute amendment made this policy \nmandatory. The Domenici amendment reinstated the state option on the \nfamily cap.\n  New Jersey, Georgia, and several other states have imposed family \ncaps based on the premise that increases in benefits for new births \nencourage illegitimacy. My instincts tell me this is probably true and, \nat the State level, I would have voted for this experiment. At this \npoint, however, there is simply no firm analytical evidence to support \nit. A Rutgers University study published earlier this year found that \nthe New Jersey family cap had no effect on illegitimacy rates and may \nhave increased the State's abortion rate. Until the States have \naccumulated enough experience with the family cap to show it is \neffective in reducing illegitimacy, I believe it should remain a State \noption but should not be mandated by the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the Dole substitute amendment to H.R. 4. I \nunderstand the concerns expressed by those who fear this legislation \nwill not do enough to protect children whose parents have reached the \nend of their welfare time limits. If this bill becomes law, I believe \nits effects on the well-being of children should be monitored \ncarefully. Further steps will likely be needed by Congress and the \nStates to assure that children are adequately cared for.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 4 is unlikely to be the last word in welfare \nreform. The problems we are trying to address in this legislation--\nwelfare dependency and the illegitimacy, violence, and drug abuse that \nit engenders--are probably the most complex, troubling, and intractable \nproblems facing American society. Anyone who believes that they have \nthe single set of reforms to solve these problems is wrong. As UCLA \nsociologist James Q. Wilson argued late last year in an essay entitled, \n``A New Approach to Welfare Reform: Humility,'' what is really needed \nis the kind of State-based experimentation that might yield innovations \nthat could be replicated by other States. I voted for H.R. 4 because I \nbelieve it offers the best opportunity to encourage this kind of \nexperimentation. It is my hope that the conference between the Senate \nand the House will produce a compromise that I can also support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nessay by James Q. Wilson be printed in the Record.\n  The essay follows:\n\n      [From the Wall Street Journal, Thursday, December 29, 1994]\n\n      Firm Foundations: A New Approach to Welfare Reform: Humility\n\n                          (By James Q. Wilson)\n\n       We are entering the last years of the 20th century with \n     every reason to rejoice and little inclination to do so, \n     despite widespread prosperity, a generally healthy economy, \n     the absence of any immediate foreign threat, and \n     extraordinary progress in civil rights, personal health and \n     school enrollment. Despite all this and more, we feel that \n     there is something profoundly wrong with our society.\n       That communal life is thought to be deficient in many \n     respects, plagued by crime, drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, \n     WELFARE dependency and the countless instabilities of daily \n     life. What these problems have in common in the eyes of most \n     Americans is that they result from the weakening of the \n     family.\n       Having arrived at something approaching a consensus, we \n     must now face the fact that we don't know what to do about \n     the problem. The American people are well ahead of their \n     leaders in this regard. They doubt very much that government \n     can do much of anything at all. They are not optimistic that \n     any other institution can do much better, and they are \n     skeptical that there will be a spontaneous regeneration of \n     decency, commitment and personal responsibility.\n       I do not know what to do either. But I think we can find \n     out, at least to the degree that feeble human reason is \n     capable of understanding some of the most profound features \n     of our condition.\n       The great debate is whether, how and at what cost we can \n     change lives. If not the lives of this generation, then of \n     the next. There are three ways of framing the problem.\n       First, the structural perspective: Owing to natural social \n     forces, the good manufacturing jobs that once existed in \n     inner-city areas have moved to the periphery, leaving behind \n     decent men and women who are struggling to get by without \n     work that once conferred both respect and money. Their place \n     is now taken by street-wise young men who find no meaningful \n     work, have abandoned the search for work, and scorn indeed \n     the ethic of work.\n       Second is the rationalist perspective: Welfare benefits, \n     including not only aid to Families with Dependent Children \n     (AFDC), but also Medicaid, subsidized housing and Food \n     Stamps, have become sufficiently generous as to make the \n     formation of stable two-parent families either irrational \n     or unnecessary. These benefits have induced young women \n     wanting babies and a home of their own to acquire both at \n     public expense, and have convinced young men, who need \n     very little convincing on this score, that sexual conquest \n     need not entail any personal responsibilities.\n       Third is the cultural perspective: Child rearing and family \n     life as traditionally understood can no longer compete with \n     or \n\n[[Page S 14563]]\n     bring under prudent control a culture of radical self-indulgence and \n     oppositional defiance, fostered by drugs, television, video \n     games, street gangs and predatory sexuality.\n       Now, a visitor from another planet hearing this discourse \n     might say that obviously all three perspectives have much to \n     commend themselves and, therefore, all three ought to be \n     acted upon. But the public debate we hear tends to emphasize \n     one or another theory and thus one or another set of \n     solutions. It does this because people, or at least people \n     who are members of the political class, define problems so as \n     to make them amenable to those solutions that they favor for \n     ideological or moral reasons. here roughly is what each \n     analysis pursued separately and alone implies:\n       (1) Structural solutions. We must create jobs and job-\n     training programs in inner-city areas, by means either of \n     tax-advantaged enterprise zones or government-subsidized \n     employment programs. As an alternative, we may facilitate the \n     relocation of the inner-city poor to places on the periphery \n     where jobs can be found and, if necessary, supplement their \n     incomes by means of the earned-income tax credit.\n       (2) Rationalist solutions. Cut or abolish AFDC or, at a \n     minimum, require work in exchange for welfare. Make the \n     formation of two-parent households more attractive than \n     single parenthood and restore work to prominence as the only \n     way for the physically able to acquire money.\n       (3) Cultural solutions. Alter the inner-city ethos by means \n     of private redemptive movements, supported by a system of \n     shelters or group homes in which at-risk children and their \n     young mothers can be given familial care and adult \n     supervision in safe and drug-free settings.\n       Now, I have my own preferences in this menu of \n     alternatives, but it is less important that you know what \n     these preferences are than that you realize that I do not \n     know which strategy would work, because so many people \n     embrace a single strategy as a way of denying legitimacy to \n     alternative ones and to their underlying philosophies.\n       Each of those perspectives, when taken alone, is full of \n     uncertainties and inadequacies. These problems go back, first \n     of all, to the structural solution. The evidence that links \n     family dissolution with the distribution of jobs is, in fact, \n     weak. Some people--such as many recent Latino immigrants \n     in Los Angeles--notice that jobs have moved to the \n     periphery from the city and board buses to follow the \n     jobs. Other people notice the very same thing and stay \n     home to sell drugs.\n       Now, even if a serious job mismatch does exist, it will not \n     easily be overcome by enterprise zones. If the costs of crime \n     in inner-city neighborhoods are high, they cannot be \n     compensated for by very low labor costs or very high customer \n     demand. Moreover, employers in scanning potential workers \n     will rely, as they have always relied, on the most visible \n     cues of reliability and skill--dress, manner, speech and even \n     place of residence. No legal system, no matter how much we \n     try to enforce it, can completely or even largely suppress \n     these cues, because they have substantial economic value.\n       Second, let's consider some of the inadequacies of the \n     rational strategy. After years of denying that the level of \n     welfare payments had any effect on child-bearing, many \n     scholars now find that states with higher payments tend to be \n     ones in which more babies are born to welfare recipients; and \n     when one expends the definition of welfare to include not \n     only AFDC but Medicaid, Food Stamps and subsidized housing, \n     increases in welfare were strongly correlated with increases \n     in illegitimate births from the early 1960s to about 1980. At \n     the point, the value of the welfare package in real dollars \n     flattened out, but the illegitimacy rate continued to rise.\n       Moreover, there remain several important puzzles in the \n     connection between welfare and child-bearing. One is the \n     existence of great differences in illegitimacy rates across \n     ethnic groups facing similar circumstances. Since the Civil \n     War at least, blacks have had higher illegitimacy rates than \n     whites, even though federal welfare programs were not \n     invented until 1935.\n       These days, it has been shown that the illegitimacy rate \n     among black women is more than twice as high as among white \n     women, after controlling for age, education and economic \n     status. David Hayes Bautista, a researcher at UCLA, compared \n     poor blacks and poor Mexican-Americans living in California. \n     He found that Mexican-American children are much more likely \n     than black children to grow up in a two-parent family, and \n     that poor Mexican-American families were only one-fifth as \n     likely as black ones to be on welfare.\n       Even among blacks, the illegitimacy rate is rather low in \n     states such as Idaho, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire, \n     despite the fact that these states have rather generous \n     welfare payments. And the illegitimacy rate is quite high in \n     many parts of the Deep South, even though these states have \n     rather low welfare payments.\n       Clearly, there is some important cultural or at least \n     noneconomic factor at work, one that has deep historical \n     roots and that may vary with the size of the community and \n     the character of the surrounding culture.\n       Finally, the cultural strategy. Though I have a certain \n     affinity for it, it has its problems, too. There are many \n     efforts in many cities by public and private agencies, \n     individuals and churches to persuade young men to be fathers \n     and not just impregnators, to help drug addicts and \n     alcoholics, to teach parenting skills to teenage mothers. \n     Some have been evaluated, and a few show signs of positive \n     effects. Among the more successful programs are the Perry \n     Pre-School Project in Yipsilanti, Mich.; the Parent Child \n     Development Center in Houston; the Family Development \n     Research Project in Syracuse, N.Y.; and the Yale Child \n     Welfare Project in New Haven, Conn. All of these programs \n     produce better behavior, lessened delinquency, more success \n     in school.\n       The Manhattan Institute's Myron Magnet (author of ``The \n     Dream and the Nightmare: The Sixties' Legacy to the \n     Underclass'') and I have both endorsed the idea of requiring \n     young unmarried mothers to live in group homes with their \n     children under adult supervision as a condition of receiving \n     public assistance. I also have suggested that we might revive \n     an institution that was common earlier in this century but \n     has lapsed into disuse of late--the boarding school, \n     sometimes mistakenly called an orphanage, for the children of \n     mothers who cannot cope. At one time such schools provided \n     homes and education for more than 100,000 young people in \n     large cities.\n       Though I confess I am attracted to the idea of creating \n     wholly new environments in which to raise the next generation \n     of at-risk children, I must also confess that I do not know \n     whether it will work. The programs that we know to be \n     successful, like the ones mentioned above, are experimental \n     efforts led by dedicated men and women. Can large versions of \n     the same thing work when run by the average counselor, the \n     average teacher? We don't know. And even these successes \n     predated the arrival of crack on the streets of our big \n     cities. Can even the best program salvage people from that \n     viciously destructive drug? We don't know.\n       There is evidence that such therapeutic communities as \n     those run by Phoenix House, headquartered in New York, and \n     other organizations can salvage people who remain in them \n     long enough. How do we get people to stay in them long \n     enough? We don't know.\n       Now, if these three alternatives or something like them are \n     what is available, how do we decide what to do? Before trying \n     to answer that question, let me assert three precepts that \n     ought to shape how we formulate that answer.\n       The first precept is that our overriding goal ought to be \n     to save the children. Other goals--such as reducing the costs \n     of welfare, discouraging illegitimacy, preventing long-term \n     welfare dependency, getting even with Welfare cheats--may all \n     be worthy goals, but they are secondary to the goal of \n     improving the life prospects of the next generation.\n       The second precept is that nobody knows how to do this on a \n     large scale. The debate has begun about welfare reform, but \n     it is a debate, in large measure, based on untested \n     assumptions, ideological posturing and perverse principles. \n     We are told by some that worker training and job placement \n     will reduce the welfare rolls, but we now know that worker \n     training and job placement have so far had only a very modest \n     effect. And few advocates of worker training tell us what \n     happens to children whose mothers are induced or compelled to \n     work, other than to assure us that somebody will supply day \n     care.\n       The third precept that should guide us is that the federal \n     government cannot have a meaningful family policy for the \n     nation, and it ought not to try. Not only does it not know \n     and cannot learn from experts what to do, whatever it thinks \n     it ought to do, it will try to do in the worse possible way. \n     Which is to say, uniformly, systematically, politically and \n     ignorantly.\n       Now, the clear implication of these three precepts, when \n     applied to the problem we face now, is that we ought to turn \n     the task and the money for rebuilding lives, welfare \n     payments, housing subsidies, the whole lot, over to cities \n     and states and private agencies, subject to only two \n     conditions. First, they must observe minimum for fundamental \n     precepts of equal protection, and second, every major new \n     initiative must be evaluated by independent observers \n     operating in accordance with accepted scientific canons.\n       Some states or counties in this regime may end AFDC as we \n     know it. Others may impose a mandatory work requirement. A \n     few may require welfare recipients to turn their checks over \n     to the group homes in which the recipients must reside or the \n     boarding schools that their children must attend. Some may \n     give the money to private agencies that agree to supply \n     parent training, job skills and preschool education. Some may \n     move welfare recipients out of the inner city and to the \n     periphery.\n       Any given state government may do no better than \n     Washington, but the great variety of the former will make up \n     for the deadening uniformity of the latter. And within the \n     states, the operating agencies will be at the city and county \n     level, where the task of improving lives and developing \n     character will be informed by the proximity of government to \n     the voices of ordinary people.\n       Mr. Wilson is professor of management and public policy at \n     UCLA. A longer version of this essay will appear in the \n     Manhattan Institute's City Journal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14562-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14563-S14564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  INVESTIGATION OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT TRAFFICKING--CORRECTION OF THE \n                                 RECORD\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this Senator would always wish to \ncorrect the record of any proceedings of the \n\n[[Page S 14564]]\nSenate, or any of the committees of the Congress, when failure to do so \nmight do an injustice.\n  Today it is appropriate to correct such a record, having to do with \ninformation presented to the Subcommittee on National Security \nEconomics of the Joint Economic Committee, meeting at 10 a.m. on \nWednesday, December 21, 1988. The record of the hearing was published \nin a collection of hearings of subcommittees of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, Senate Hearing 100-1059 beginning at page 559.\n  The hearing in question concerned trafficking in classified documents \nof the Department of Defense, and how the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Justice dealt with those problems during the period 1983-\n88.\n  A staff report prepared by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee \nSubcommittee on National Security Economics and the investigative staff \nof my office was included in the hearing. The staff report contains \nsome information, supplied by officials of the Defense Criminal \nInvestigative Service, which is not correct.\n  It has been brought to my attention that some of that information may \nhave cast an undeserved cloud upon one of the persons named in the \nreport. Two individuals are named in this information, on page 2 of the \nstaff report, in the following paragraph:\n\n       The Ohio investigation revealed evidence of widespread \n     trafficking in classified documents, involving at least ten \n     contractors and 30 Pentagon officials, including high level \n     civilian and military officials. The investigation resulted \n     in the indictments of two officials, John McCarthy, who was \n     then director of NASA Lewis Research Center, and James R. \n     Atchison, an Air Force employee at the Wright-Patterson Base \n     in Dayton, Ohio. McCarthy plead guilty in 1983 to a charge of \n     filing false claims in connection with travel to Washington, \n     D.C. Atchison resigned from the government and was not \n     brought to trial.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to correct several of the statements \nabout Mr. James R. Atchison.\n  Mr. Atchison has never been indicted on any charges. This is \nconfirmed in a letter to the Joint Economic Committee of October 6, \n1992, from Mr. Derek J. Vander Schaaf, Deputy Inspector General of DOD.\n  Mr. Vander Schaaf notes that the focus of the investigative effort \nthat led to Mr. Atchison was the unauthorized trafficking in classified \ndocuments. But there was no evidence resulting from any DOD or NASA \ninvestigation involving Mr. Atchison in any wrongdoing relating to \nclassified documents. The Air Force took an adverse employee action \nagainst Mr. Atchison for other reasons.\n  Mr. Atchison has asked that the statements about him be corrected in \nthe record, to the extent possible. I agree, Mr. President, that the \nrecord must be corrected, and that is what I have attempted to do here \ntoday. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14563-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATION AND SERVICE OF THE NEW JERSEY STATE FIRST \n                              AID COUNCIL\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nNew Jersey State First Aid Council which is holding its 67th annual \nconvention from October 5 through October 8.\n  The New Jersey State First Aid Council has its roots in Belmar, NJ \nwhere at the scene of a fire in 1929, Charles Measure, the council's \nfounder, saw a badly injured police officer receive only blank stares \nand helpless shrugs from a crowd of onlookers who did not know what to \ndo to help staunch the flow of blood. Although someone eventually \nstepped forward and saved the officer's life, the incident convinced \nMeasure that there was a need for organized emergency response to such \ncrisis situations. From the ashes of that confused and terrifying scene \narose a new sense of security and purpose in the State, as the New \nJersey State First Aid Council was born.\n  Developing a statewide organization was not easy, but Measure and his \nassociates persisted until their idea became reality. In November of \n1931, the eight squads came together to form the first district, and \nthe council swung into action. Measure's decision to step forward and \npioneer this first operation resulted in New Jersey trailblazing a path \nin first aid work in the United States.\n  Mr. President, for the last 64 years, the council has served our \nState in countless ways. They have faithfully followed the tenets of \ntheir original constitution: `` * * * to bring together all first aid \nand safety squads; to organize and promote first aid in a systematic \nmanner; to assist all squads in the purchase of supplies and equipment; \nto standardize all equipment, especially inhalators; and to further \nadvance first aid instruction in conjunction with the Red Cross.'' Over \nthe last six decades, the council's membership has swelled to 448 \nsquads with over 14,000 members throughout the State. The council has \nalso worked to promote community education and awareness regarding \nsignificant health issues. In recent years, the council has worked \ntirelessly in support of legislation to fund the training of emergency \nmedical technicians and in 1992 the First Aid Technician's Act was \npassed. The act assesses $0.50 for every moving motor vehicle violation \nfor a fund to pay for training and recertification of EMT's. The \ncouncil has over $4 million in its coffers that will eventually be \ndisbursed for training.\n  I have often emphasized the inadequacy of relying purely on political \nmeans to solve problems in our society. Solutions are not to be found \nsolely in maintaining alliance to a party, or in voting for a \nparticular candidate, but are to be found in the development of a \nstrong civic society and in confronting our problems at the community \nand family level. Therefore, I am happy to recognize the New Jersey \nState First Aid Council as an example of the volunteer spirit which I \nbelieve does more to strengthen our communities than many a bill or \namendment.\n  The volunteers of the New Jersey State First Aid Council display an \nenormous amount of compassion and respect for their fellow human \nbeings, as well as a tireless commitment to creating a safer living \nenvironment in our State. Robert W. Snowfield, president of the \ncouncil, has said that being a volunteer EMT is ``something you must \npossess in your heart and mind.'' This is undoubtedly true, since the \nonly reward these volunteers receive at the end of a long day is the \nsatisfaction that their sacrifices have helped to make their own \ncommunity a better place to live.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of this dynamic organization and \nits selfless, dedicated members and congratulate them on the occasion \nof their 67th annual convention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14564-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14564-S14565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier today I had the privilege of \nbeing present at the White House to witness the historic signing of the \nInterim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza by Prime Minister of Israel \nYitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. With the stroke of their \npens, they have taken their people and all the peoples of the Middle \nEast one step closer to lasting peace. Today is truly a day for \ncelebration and prayers of thanks.\n  All of the efforts of those who were the enemies of peace could not \ndeter these two brave leaders from their goal of finding the common \nground that made this agreement a reality. Nor were President Clinton, \nSecretary Christopher, or Ambassador Dennis Ross prepared to cease \ntheir efforts as honest brokers to bridge last minute disagreements \nthat stood in the way of finalizing the deal. I for one would like to \ncommend the President, the Secretary, and all those who worked nonstop \nduring this negotiating process--without their dedication, today's \nevent would not have been possible.\n  Since the establishment of the State of Israel more than 47 years \nago, the people of Israel have sought to live in peace with their \nneighbors in the Middle East. For too long Israeli efforts to reach out \nfor peace and dialogue with its Arab counterparts were met with \nrejection and terrorism. Fortunately, that has now largely changed.\n  It is particularly fitting that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was \namong the leaders present at today's signing ceremony. After all, it \nwas the Government of Egypt that was courageous enough to engage in the \nsearch for peace in that war-torn region. I remember the excitement, \nthe hope, the inspiration that resulted from the signing of the 1978, \nCamp David Accords and the subsequent entry into force of the Israel-\nEgypt peace treaty in 1979.\n\n[[Page S 14565]]\n\n  Regrettably, it would take more than a decade before additional \nefforts to find a formula that would hold out the possiblity of \nresolving the complex issues with Israel's other Arab neighbors would \nbear fruit. Certainly the break up of the Soviet Union and the gulf war \nwere defining moments that totally reshaped the political landscape in \nthe Middle East and improved the prospect for peace. The seeds of \ntoday's agreement were clearly sown during the 1991 Madrid Conference \nwith the road map outlined for resolving both bilateral and \nmultilateral issues within the context of the Madrid Framework.\n  The key provisions of the interim agreement include elections of an \n82-member Palestinian Council that will oversee most aspects of \nPalestinian life in the West Bank and Gaza, the elimination of \noffensive clauses from the Palestinian covenant that call for the \nelimination of Israel, assignment of responsibility for religious \nsites, the temporary deployment of an international observer delegation \nto Hebron, the redeployment of most Israeli troops from Palestinian \ncities and towns, and the staged release of prisoners.\n  This interim agreement is to remain in force through May 1999 and \nbuilds upon the September 1993 Declaration of Principles, in which \nIsrael and the PLO exchanged mutual recognition, and the May 1994 Cairo \nagreement, which established a framework for Palestinian self-rule in \nthe Gaza Strip and Jericho.\n  We can all be justly proud of the enormous progress that has been \nmade to undo the destruction and distrust that are the byproduct of \ndecades of hatred and havoc. I for one am confident that the trust and \ngood will that has been created by the peace process thus far will \nenergize all parties to resolve all the remaining issues that stand in \nthe way of a permanent agreement.\n  I do not seek to minimize the difficulties of the issues that remain \nto be resolved. They include matters related to boundaries, to the \nnature of the Palestinian entity, to the future of Jewish settlements \nin Palestinian areas, to the disposition of refugees, and finally to \nthe status of Jerusalem. However, it is clear to me that the people of \nthe Middle East are committed to finding a comprehensive solution to \nall the disagreements that have stood in the way of a permanent and \nlasting peace. I believe that we in the United States stand ready to do \nall that we can to facilitate that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14564-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14565-S14566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WORLD MARITIME DAY 1995\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as you may know, World Maritime \nDay 1995 will be observed this week, and the theme this year focuses on \nthe achievements and challenges of the International Maritime \nOrganization [IMO].\n  The IMO was created under the auspices of the United Nations in 1948, \nand over the past 47 years has led the way to significant improvements \nin safety in the maritime industry and reductions in marine pollution \naround the world.\n  I ask that the letter sent to me by Coast Guard Capt. Guy Goodwin, \nwhich brought World Maritime Day 1995 to my attention, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Captain Goodwin provided me with a copy of the message delivered by \nIMO Secretary-General William O'Neil to commemorate World Maritime Day, \nand I ask that this, too, be printed in the Record.\n  I believe both Captain Goodwin and IMO Secretary-General O'Neil make \nimportant points about the need to continue to strive for safer \nshipping and cleaner oceans, and I encourage other Senators to read \nthese messages.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                     Department of Transportation,\n\n\n                                             U.S. Coast Guard,\n\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Oceans on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The International Maritime Organization \n     has announced that World Maritime Day 1995 will be observed \n     during the week of September 25 to 29, 1995. The theme for \n     this year's observance is ``50th Anniversary of the United \n     Nations: IMO's Achievements and Challenges''. As you know, \n     Mr. Chairman, IMO has succeeded in winning the support of the \n     Maritime world by being pragmatic, effective and above all by \n     concentrating on the technical issues related to safety at \n     sea and the prevention of pollution from ships, topics that \n     are of most concern to its member states IMO's priorities are \n     often described in the slogan ``safer shipping and cleaner \n     oceans.''\n       Until recently the indications were that IMO'S efforts to \n     improve safety and reduce pollution were paying off. The rate \n     of serious casualties was falling and the amount of all and \n     other pollutants entering the sea was decreasing quite \n     dramatically. But recently there has been a disturbing rise \n     in accidents and our fear is that, if nothing is done, the \n     progress we have diligently fought for over the last few \n     decades will be lost. To avert this danger, IMO has taken a \n     number of actions including establishing a sub-committee to \n     improve the way IMO regulations are implemented by flag \n     States, encouraging the establishment of regional port State \n     control arrangements, adopting a new mandatory International \n     Safety Management Code, and adopting amendments to the \n     convention dealing with standards of training, certification \n     and watchkeeping for seafarers. When these and other measures \n     are added together they make an impressive package that \n     should make a significant contribution to safety and \n     pollution prevention in the years to come. The Coast Guard \n     has been an active player at IMO regarding these and other \n     matters.\n       Enclosed is a message from the Secretary-General of the \n     IMO, Mr. W. A. O'Neil, marking the observance of World \n     Maritime Day 1995.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                G. T. Goodwin,\n\n                                                    Captain, USCG,\n                                     Chief, Congressional Affairs.\n       Encl: World Maritime Day Message of Secretary General \n     O'Neil. -----\n\n                        World Maritime Day 1995\n\n       Fifty years ago the United Nations was created. When people \n     consider the United Nations today, most think only of the \n     headquarters in New York or peacekeeping missions around the \n     world. Very few people know that the United Nations indeed \n     has another side.\n       This side, of course, consists of the specialized agencies \n     of the U.N. system which deal with such matters as the \n     development of telecommunications, the safety of aviation, \n     the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the improvement of \n     education, the world's weather, and international shipping, \n     the particular responsibility of the International Maritime \n     Organization.\n       IMO was established by means of a convention which was \n     adopted under the auspices of the United Nations in 1948 and \n     today has 152 Member States. Its most important treaties \n     cover more than 98 percent of world shipping.\n       IMO succeeded in winning the support of the maritime world \n     by being pragmatic, effective and above all by concentrating \n     on the technical issues related to safety at sea and the \n     prevention of pollution from ships, topics that are of most \n     concern to its Member States. IMO's priorities are often \n     described in the slogan ``safer shipping and cleaner \n     oceans.''\n       But today I do not want to focus on past successes. Instead \n     I would like to talk to you about the future. Nobody can \n     predict precisely what will happen in the shipping world \n     during the next few years but there are indications that, \n     from a safety point of view, we should be especially \n     vigilant.\n       The difficult economic conditions of the last two decades \n     have discouraged shipowners from ordering new tonnage and \n     there is evidence that, in some cases, the maintenance of \n     vessels has suffered. The combination of age and poor \n     maintenance has obvious safety implications. Shipping as an \n     industry is also undergoing great structural changes that \n     have resulted in the fleets of the traditional flags \n     declining in size while newer shipping nations have emerged.\n       IMO has no vested interest in what flag a ship flies or \n     what country its crew members come from. But we are \n     interested in the quality of the operation. We certainly can \n     have no objection to shipowners saving money--unless those \n     savings are made at the expense of safety or the environment. \n     If that happens then we are very concerned indeed.\n       Until recently the indications were that IMO's efforts to \n     improve safety and reduce pollution were paying off. The rate \n     of serious casualties was falling and the amount of oil and \n     other pollutants entering the sea was decreasing quite \n     dramatically. But recently there has been a disturbing rise \n     in accidents and our fear is that, if nothing is done, the \n     progress we have diligently fought for over the last few \n     decades will be lost. To avert this danger IMO has taken a \n     number of actions.\n       We have set up a special sub-committee to improve the way \n     IMO regulations are implemented by flag States.\n       We have encouraged the establishment of regional port State \n     control arrangements so that all countries which have \n     ratified IMO Conventions and have the right to inspect \n     foreign ships to make sure that they meet IMO requirements \n     can do this more effectively.\n       We have adopted a new mandatory International Safety \n     Management Code to improve standards of management and \n     especially to make sure that safety and environmental issues \n     are never overlooked or ignored.\n       We have recently adopted amendments to the convention \n     dealing with standards of training, certification and \n     watchkeeping for seafarers. The Convention has been \n     modernized and restructured, but most important of \n\n[[Page S 14566]]\n     all, new provisions have been introduced which will help to make sure \n     that the Convention is properly implemented.\n       When these and other measures are added together they make \n     an impressive package that should make a significant \n     contribution to safety and pollution prevention in the years \n     to come. But I think we need something more.\n       IMO's standards have been so widely adopted that they \n     affect virtually every ship in the world. Therefore, in \n     theory, the casualty and pollution rates of flag States \n     should be roughly the same but in actual practice they vary \n     enormously. That can only be because IMO regulations are put \n     into effect differently from country to country. The measures \n     I have just outlined will help to even out some of these \n     differences, but they will only really succeed if everybody \n     involved in shipping wants them to.\n       That sounds simple enough. Surely everybody is interested \n     in safety and the prevention of pollution and will do what \n     they can to promote them? To a certain degree perhaps they \n     are--but the degree of commitment seems to vary considerably. \n     The majority of shipowners accept their responsibilities and \n     conduct their operations with integrity at the highest level.\n       Some others quite deliberately move their ships to \n     different trading routes if Governments introduce stricter \n     inspections and controls: they would rather risk losing the \n     ship and those on board than to undertake and pay for the \n     cost of carrying out the repairs they know to be necessary. \n     Some Governments are also quite happy to take the fees for \n     registering ships under their flag, but fail to ensure that \n     safety and environmental standards are enforced.\n       The idea that a ship would willingly be sent to sea in an \n     unsafe condition and pose a danger to its crew is difficult \n     to believe and yet it does happen.\n       The reasons for this are partly historical. We have become \n     so used to the risks involved in seafaring that we have come \n     to see them as a cost that has to be paid, a price which is \n     exacted for challenging the wrath of the oceans. We must \n     change this attitude, this passive acceptance of the \n     inevitability of disaster. When a ship sinks we should all \n     feel a sense of loss and failure, because accidents are not \n     inevitable--they can and should be prevented.\n       The actions taken by IMO during the last few years will \n     undoubtedly help to improve safety and thereby save lives, \n     but they will have an even more dramatic effect if they help \n     to change the culture of all those engaged in shipping and \n     make safety not just a vague aspiration but a part of every \n     day living, so that it comes as second nature. This is a \n     clear, precise target--a target that is within our grasp if \n     we continue to put our minds and energies to the task.\n       Fifty years ago, when the United Nations was being planned, \n     few people believed that there would ever be an effective \n     international organization devoted to shipping safety. But, \n     in the same spirit that led to the founding of the United \n     Nations, IMO itself was born. The vision which led to this \n     has been realized and seafarers of the world have benefitted \n     as a result.\n       However, casualties still do occur and much remains to be \n     done by IMO, by its Member Governments, by the shipping \n     industry and by the seafarers who crew the world's ships, in \n     fact, by all of us involved in shipping. The waters are not \n     uncharted, the course is known, the destination is clear. It \n     is up to us to conduct the voyage in such a way that our \n     objective of maximum safety is in fact realized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14565-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF AND THE BLIND\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and the \nBlind for 125 years of service to students with disabilities in my \nState.\n  On this very day, September 28 in 1870 the doors of the West \nVirginia. Schools for the Deaf and the Blind were first opened in the \nsmall community of Romney, WV. At that time, 25 deaf and 5 blind \nchildren were enrolled that first year in classes in a modest facility. \nSince that time, literally thousands of men and women of all ages with \nhearing and/or visual disabilities have passed through the hallowed \nhalls of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and the Blind.\n  Today, hundreds of individuals receive a variety of services through \nprograms offered by these schools--programs like Be a Star, which \nearned national recognition in the 1993-94 school year as a model for \nhearing and visually impaired youth as volunteers. People assume that \nstudents with disabilities are the recipients of community service \ninitiatives but through Romney's program, the handicapped students were \nable to get involved in community service projects and make their own \npersonal contributions to the local community which has supported the \ninstitution for more than a century. Currently during the 1994-95 \nschool year, the institution is implementing the Stars for Others \nProgram. The goal, once again, is to let students be the leaders they \ncan be in their respective communities. The school expects this year to \nlog over 5,000 hours of staff and student volunteer hours of public \nservice, and I am quite proud of this initiative.\n  In addition to the regular educational programs offered on campus, \nover 100 preschoolers and their families receive services through \nspecial outreach programs. More than 450 students with visual \ndisabilities throughout our State receive Braille and large print \nmaterials through the Instructional Resource Center. Over 250 \nindividuals receive talking books through a loan program coordinated by \nthe Library of Congress. Captioned films are made available through the \nCaptioned Film Depository. Each year, many children with hearing and/or \nvisual disabilities participate in the Preschool Diagnostic and \nEvaluation Program and in the summer enrichment programs.\n  This is a tremendous institution striving to improve its services and \nenhance the quality of life for students with disabilities so that they \ncan live as independently as possible. The efforts made daily by every \nadministrator, every teacher, every individual associated with the West \nVirginia Schools for the Blind and the Deaf have opened many doors to \npeople with disabilities, and given them opportunities for jobs and \nfreedom that they may not have otherwise. The schools have stressed \nthat a physical impediment should not be a wall that blocks students \nfrom the life, but that they too can overcome challenges and play a \nvital role in our society. I share this view and am proud of the \ntremendous progress made by our society over time in recognizing the \npotential of individuals with disabilities. This institution has \ncontributed a great deal to helping ensure that every American, \nregardless of disability, should have the chance to be happy, \nproductive members of our society.\n  The West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and the Blind make a very real \ndifference in the lives of students and their families. With great \npride, and on behalf of all of West Virginia, I send my warmest \ncongratulations on such a special anniversary, as well as best wishes \nfor more years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14566-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2399 just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2399) to amend the Truth in Lending Act to \n     clarify the intent of such act and to reduce burdensome \n     regulatory requirements on creditors.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nTruth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995. Our colleagues in the House \nrecently passed this legislation. It is the product of bipartisan \ncooperation between the Senate and the House. The broad bipartisan \nsupport that this bill has attracted is evidence of the urgency of the \nsituation that it addresses. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I \nbelieve that immediate action \n\n[[Page S 14567]]\nis warranted. I would therefore encourage my colleagues to immediately \nconsider and pass H.R. 2399.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 2399 is intended to curtail the devastating \nliability that threatens our housing finance system in the wake of the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals' recent decision in Rodash versus AIB \nMortgage Co. The Rodash case produced an onslaught of over 50 class \naction suits. The majority of these suits demanded the most draconian \nremedy available under Truth in Lending--rescission. When a loan is \nrescinded, the borrower is released from the obligation under the \nmortgage. Currently, there are dozens of Rodash-styled class action \nsuits pending. If rescission is granted in a class action lawsuit, \nevery class member would be entitled to reimbursement of all finance \ncharges, as well as other charges.\n  The threat of wholesale rescissions presents a real danger to our \nmodern system of home financing: potential liability that could reach \ninto the billions. Last spring we enacted H.R. 1380, a class action \nmoratorium. We enacted this moratorium to allow both Houses time to \ncraft a solution. The moratorium expires on October 1, 1995--so now is \nthe time to act.\n  Mr. President, I cannot overemphasize the threat to our mortgage \nlending system and the secondary markets that provide the mortgage \nmarket with liquidity. And we cannot forget that the liquidity of the \nmortgage markets has helped millions of Americans obtain their dream of \nhome ownership at lower costs.\n  H.R. 2399 is the result of much hard work and represents a \ncommonsense compromise to a highly technical problem. H.R. 2399 \nprovides greater certainty for lenders without eliminating the \nsubstantive protection available to consumers. I would like to \nsummarize some of the important provisions of this bill:\n  First, this bill provides retroactive relief from Rodash-styled class \nactions that are pending certification.\n  H.R. 2399 also clarifies the treatment of certain fees for the \npurposes of the Truth-in-Lending disclosures.\n  This legislation provides greater flexibility, or tolerance, for \nhonest mistakes that result in technical violations and can produce a \nlitigation morass. The current tolerances provided under the law are \nunreasonably low, especially in the context of the 3-year right of \nrescission.\n  Two tolerances are established for rescission purposes. The tolerance \nformulas are based on the size of the loan in question. A smaller \ntolerance is established for standard nonpurchase money mortgages. If a \nborrower receives money from a refinance, only that money is subject to \nrescission. A larger tolerance is available in no new money \nrefinancings. No new money refinancings are used by consumers to take \nadvantage of declining interest rates. In these refinancings, no \nadvances--other than loan proceeds that might be used to finance \nclosing costs, which are not deemed to be new advances--are received by \nthe consumer.\n  H.R. 2399 clarifies the liability of assignees and loan servicers \nunder Truth in Lending. These clarifications will provide greater \ncertainty for the secondary market and help enhance liquidity of the \nmortgage market in general.\n\n  H.R. 2399 also contains substantive protection for consumers. It \nretains the 3 day right rescission, and creates a right of rescission \nin the mortgage foreclosure context.\n  The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to provide consumers with \nnotice of their right to rescind in certain transactions. However, the \nrequirements concerning the form of notice to be provided are \nambiguous. This bill eliminates liability when the incorrect form of \nrescission notice was given to the borrower in a closed-end transaction \nas long as the consumer received a completed form, whether the form was \none of the model forms published by the Federal Reserve Board or a \ncomparable form. The addition of the requirement that the lender \notherwise complied with all the requirements of this section regarding \nnotice is intended to make clear that the lender will continue to have \nliability for any violation of this title that is unrelated to the form \nof notice, such as a misdisclosure of the APR that exceeds the \ntolerance. However, the lender will not be penalized for the form of \nnotice it provided.\n  While any of us might take issue with any of the particular \nprovisions in this bill, on balance it represents a workable solution, \nand demonstrates congressional resolve in the face of a tremendous \nproblem. I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation \nand pass it immediately, without amendments.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2399, the \nTruth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995. This bill represents a \nsolution to the so-called Rodash problem.\n  I would like to begin by commending the chairman of the Senate \nBanking Committee, Senator D'Amato, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe House Banking Committee, Representative Leach, Representative \nGonzalez, Representative McCollum, and Representative Vento for their \ncooperation in working out a bipartisan resolution of this problem. In \nmy view, it responds to legitimate concerns raised by the financial \nindustry but preserves the basic consumer protections of the Truth in \nLending Act.\n  The Rodash problem arose from a court decision last year in which \nsmall violations of the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending \nAct triggered the right of rescission provided by the act. That \ndecision, in turn, resulted in the filing of class action lawsuits \nagainst creditors for small violations of the disclosure requirements. \nThe Congress placed a moratorium on such lawsuits in order to provide \ntime to sort out this issue and clarify the statute. The moratorium \nexpires on October 1. It is therefore important for the Congress to act \nexpeditiously on a permanent solution to the Rodash problem.\n  The House Banking Committee included a response to the Rodash problem \nin a larger banking bill reported out of the committee earlier this \nyear. That bill, in my view, went beyond fixing the Rodash problem. If \npassed, it would have weakened the Truth in Lending Act and undermined \ncritical consumer protections.\n  In order to enact a solution to the Rodash problem before the \nmoratorium expires, agreement was reached to try to move the Rodash \npackage as a separate bill. Negotiations were undertaken between the \nHouse and Senate, and a compromise was reached which is contained in \nH.R. 2399. The House passed H.R. 2399 on Wednesday by unanimous \nconsent. The Senate will do so today.\n  The bill before the Senate today improves significantly the measure \npassed by the House Banking Committee. Under the original House bill, \nconsumers would have lost the right of rescission for a whole class of \nloans even if the most egregious violations of the Truth in Lending Act \nwere committed. The bill before the Senate preserves that vital \nconsumer protection.\n  The original House bill also would have eliminated, for an entire \nclass of mortgage loans, the borrower's right to a 3-day cooling off \nperiod after closing on a loan. The bill before the Senate retains that \ncooling off period.\n  Moreover, the bill before the Senate protects the most vulnerable \ncitizens from abusive lenders. It provides consumers with truth in \nlending protections when faced with foreclosure. This bill will help \nmany elderly people keep their homes.\n  This bill increases the tolerance for statutory damages, lifting the \nbar that determines what constitutes a violation. This bill does not \nincrease the tolerance as much as the original House bill. This is \nimportant because a low tolerance is needed to ensure that consumers \nare receiving accurate information about the cost of credit.\n  This increased tolerance for errors is intended to protect lenders \nfrom the small errors in judgment that occurred in the Rodash case. It \nis obviously not intended to give lenders the right to pad fees up to \nthe tolerance limit of $100. For example, if a delivery associated with \nthe closing cost on a home mortgage costs $30, $30 should be charged \nand disclosed as part of the finance charge. A lender cannot \narbitrarily raise the charge an additional $70 simply because there is \na wider tolerance.\n  The purpose of the Truth in Lending Act is to require disclosure to \nconsumers of the cost of their credit. An outstanding problem remains \nthat there are too many exclusions and exemptions that blur the bottom \nline. The \n\n[[Page S 14568]]\nbill directs the Federal Reserve to report to Congress and develop \nregulations to ensure that all charges related to the extension of \ncredit are included in the finance charges. Lenders and consumers agree \nthat it is important to alleviate confusion over the treatment of fees \nin the finance charge. The Federal Reserve has 1 year to develop these \nregulations.\n  The bill specifically exempts certain charges from the finance \ncharge, including third party fees, taxes on security instruments, fees \nfor preparations of loan documents, and fees relating to pest \ninfestations. The purpose of the exemptions is to provide some clarity \non the treatment of those fees until the Fed acts to ensure that the \nfinance charge definition more accurately reflects the cost of \nproviding credit. The fact that these exemptions are included does not \ncreate a presumption or requirement for the Fed to exclude them from \nthe definition of finance charges. The Fed should include all charges \nin the finance charge unless those charges are not related to the \nextension of credit. I look forward to the Federal Reserve's action and \nI am hopeful this will lead to simpler and more common sense \ndisclosure.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that a reasonable agreement, embodied in \nH.R. 2399, has been reached to address the Rodash problem. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995 \nwill finally bring an end to the massive potential liability facing the \nmortgage industry as a result of extraordinary penalties under the \nTruth in Lending Act [TILA] for technical errors. Recognizing the \nthreat to mortgage lending, we placed a moratorium on class actions for \ncertain technical violations under TILA to give us an opportunity to \ndevelop a solution. The Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995 provide \nthat solution.\n  This bill does a number of important things. First, it provides \nretroactive relief to the mortgage industry from the extreme potential \nliability that was caused by the Rodash versus AIB Mortgage Co. case. \nThis problem, which seriously threatened the viability of residential \nmortgage lending in this country including the mortgage-backed \nsecurities markets, was caused by the ambiguity surrounding the proper \ntreatment of certain charges, and the extremely low tolerance for any \nerror in making disclosures. The current treatment of fees, such as \nmortgage broker fees, has been challenged in litigation. It is not fair \nto subject a lender to extreme penalties for their treatment of these \nfees, which some are now trying to recharacterize as finder's fees. The \nentire industry historically excluded these fees from the finance \ncharge, without regard to whether the broker received yield spread \npremiums or other types of compensation from the lender--known or \nunknown to the borrower--or whether the broker is acting as an agent of \nthe borrower, the lender or both. Based upon the preexisting language \nof TILA, Regulation Z and the Federal Reserve Board commentary--\nparticularly 4(a)-3, this exclusion is manifestly correct. However, it \nseems proper to eliminate any issue whatsoever. With this legislation, \nlenders will now be able to get on with the business of making loans.\n  Second, the bill prospectively clarifies the treatment of specific \ncharges such as tangible taxes and courier fees. This gives creditors \ngreater certainty and provides consumers with more accurate disclosures \nthrough uniform treatment of charges. The Federal Reserve is also \ndirected to review the finance charge disclosure and make \nrecommendations to improve it. Specifically we are looking for \nrecommendations that make the finance charge disclosure more accurately \nreflect the cost of credit. In addition, we would like suggestions on \nhow to eliminate any abusive practices that have developed in the \nreporting of the finance charge.\n  Third, recognizing the highly technical nature of the Truth in \nLending Act, the bill raises the tolerance level for understated \ndisclosures for all future transactions from $10 to $100 for civil \nliability purposes. For errors which can lead to rescission of the \nloan, which is a much more extreme penalty, the tolerance is \\1/2\\ of 1 \npercent of the loan amount. However, for certain refinance loans where \nthe refinancing borrower did not receive additional new advances from \nthe creditor, the tolerance is 1 percent of the loan amount. In \naccordance with current Federal Reserve regulations, funds to finance \nthe closing costs of the transaction do not constitute new advances.\n  Fourth, the bill clarifies that loan servicers are not assignees for \npurposes of Truth in Lending liability if they only own legal title for \nservicing purposes.\n  Fifth, the bill raises the statutory damages for individual actions \nfrom $1,000 to $2,000. Statutory damages are provided in TILA because \nactual damages, which require proof that the borrower suffered a loss \nin reliance upon the inaccurate disclosure, are extremely difficult to \nestablish.\n  Sixth, the bill preserves the consumer's 3-day rescission period for \nall refinance loans with different creditors. As currently set forth in \nthe Truth in Lending Act, this cooling off period expires in 3 years. \nContrary to some court decisions which have allowed this rescission \nperiod to extend for as long as 8 years after the loan was closed in \nthe context of recoupment, the existing statutory language is clear: 3 \nyears means 3 years and the time period shall not be extended except as \nexplicitly provided in section 125(f).\n  Moreover, as is currently set forth in the Federal Reserve \nregulations, when a borrower refinances an existing loan and takes out \nnew money, only the new money is subject to rescission.\n  This legislation is critical to avert what could be a financial \ndisaster in the mortgage industry. I appreciate the bipartisan effort \nto fix the problems with the Truth in Lending Act while still \nprotecting the rights of the consumers and I urge the adoption of this \nbill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be deemed read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements related to the bill appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2399) was deemed read a third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/28/senate-section/article/S14566-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SMALL BUSINESS LENDING ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.
