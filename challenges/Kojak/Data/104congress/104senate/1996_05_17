Mr. President, the Senate will immediately \nbegin consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, the concurrent \nbudget resolution. Under the agreement of last night, there is a \nlimited number of first-degree amendments in order to the resolution. \nSenators are urged to offer and debate those amendments either today or \non Monday.\n\n  Further, Senators are reminded that there will be no rollcall votes \neither today or Monday so that we can complete the debate on these \namendments and then enter into a series of votes on Tuesday. Any votes \nordered on the amendments will occur on Tuesday, and Senators can \nexpect numerous votes Tuesday in order to complete action on the budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I want to take just a moment to express our \nappreciation for the tremendous work that is being done by the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, working with his ranking member on the other side, Senator \nExon. I know they are trying to move this very important piece of \nlegislation forward. However, there now remains, at 9:30 this morning, \n29 hours and 51 minutes to be consumed. We have a lot of work to do, \nand it is important that we continue to do that work and to use this \ntime.\n  I want to emphasize that in the past I believe the record will show \nan average of probably at least 15 hours has been yielded back, and I \nthink at least that much or more should be yielded back this time. I am \ntroubled, and I think a lot of Senators are, that there seems to be \nsome delay in moving this legislation through to completion. Let us \nmake our case; let us offer our amendments; let us have our debate, but \nlet us get this job done. I want to emphasize that the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, has indicated very strongly that we are going to finish \nthis bill on Tuesday. Senators should be prepared to work in the effort \nto get that accomplished. I believe we have amendments in order now.\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, and Senator Biden of \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3985.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TAX RELIEF PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:--\n       (1) the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     1997 (S. Con. Res. 57) calls for $122 billion in net tax \n     reductions through 2002;\n       (2) the Committee Report accompanying the 1997 concurrent \n     resolution (Senate Report 104-271) states, ``The Committee's \n     recommendation would accommodate further tax reform or tax \n     reductions to be offset by the extension of expired tax \n     provisions or corporate and business tax reforms. Should the \n     tax writing committees choose to raise additional revenues \n     through these or other sources, such receipts could be used \n     to offset other tax reform proposals such as estate tax \n     reform, economic growth, fuel excise taxes or other policies \n     on a deficit neutral basis'';\n       (3) the tax reductions passed in conjunction with the \n     fiscal 1996 budget (H.R. 2491) included tax breaks which \n     would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and large \n     corporations, such as, reductions in the capital gains tax, \n     exemptions from the alternative minimum tax, reduced tax \n     penalties for corporate raiding of employee pensions, and \n     increased tax incentives for corporations to move jobs \n     overseas; and\n       (4) over the last decade, the cost of attending college has \n     almost doubled, rising at twice the rate of inflation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying the \n     reconciliation instructions in this budget resolution assume \n     that it is the sense of the Senate that any tax revenue \n     raised by the Finance Committee to provide gross tax * * * \n     the amount needed to pay for a per-child tax credit will be \n     used either:\n       (1) to finance a tax deduction of $10,000 per year for \n     higher education tuition and student loan interest costs; or\n       (2) to reduce the federal budget deficit;\n\n     and not for tax cuts which disproportionately benefit the \n     wealthy and large corporations.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, what this amendment essentially says is that if there \nare to be any further tax cuts beyond tax credits for children and \nfamilies, these cuts must take the form of a tax deduction of up to \n$10,000 per year for higher education tuition payments or student loan \ninterest payments.\n  The report of the Senate Budget Committee allows for additional tax \ncuts beyond tax credits for children and families. These additional tax \ncuts are bound to flow disproportionately to high-income wealthy \npeople. I believe that we should, instead, focus our efforts where they \nought to be--on tax relief to enable families to afford higher \neducation. That is what this amendment that my colleagues and I are \nintroducing on this side of the aisle would do. It is expected that \nthis education tax cut would finance a $10,000-per-year tax deduction \nfor higher education tuition and for student loan interest costs.\n  Mr. President, on April 29, 1996, the front cover of Newsweek states \nin bold terms:\n\n       $1,000 a Week--The Scary Cost of College\n\n  This cover story addresses the fact that some colleges in this \ncountry cost their students $1,000 per week of school. That is what a \nfamily today in America is faced with.\n  Mr. President, according to the College Board, tuition costs have \ngone up more than 40 percent since 1985. Expressed in constant 1994 \ndollars, in 1985, tuition at the average private college was $10,058. \nBy 1994, it was $14,486--a 44-percent increase. The average public \ncollege tuition was $2,095 in 1985. By 1994, it was $2,948--a 41-\npercent increase.\n  If you look at this next chart, what you can see is that over the \nyears, since 1980, family income has risen only half as fast as \nskyrocketing medical costs; but even more than medical costs, what we \nsee is a dramatic increase in private college tuition and public \ncollege tuition.\n  There is an economic squeeze for working families in America. \nAffordable higher education is at the very top of the list of \npriorities for families in our country. The first thing we should do as \npublic servants is respond to these families.\n  Mr. President, as this next chart shows, in my State of Minnesota, \nfrom 1981 to 1992, the CPI has gone up 60 percent; the medical care \nsubindex has gone up 133 percent; community college tuition has gone up \n151 percent; the University of Minnesota tuition has gone up 153 \npercent; State university tuition has gone up 204 percent; and \ntechnical college tuition has gone up 316 percent.\n  I spend a lot of time in schools in my State. I can tell you, Mr. \nPresident, it is not at all uncommon to meet students who are taking 6 \nor 7 years to graduate because they are working two and three minimum \nwage jobs to get through. It is not at all uncommon to meet many \nstudents who are in their thirties and forties, going back to school at \ncommunity colleges, who are trying to get back on their own two feet \nand are having a very difficult time making ends meet.\n  It is not uncommon to meet students who sell plasma at the beginning \nof the semester to buy textbooks. Mr. President, when we talk about \nhigher education, we are talking about a major economic issue for \nfamilies in Minnesota and all across the country.\n  As we see in this next chart, if we look at the last 15 years, we see \nthat median family income has gone up 5 percent. However, tuition at a \npublic 4-year institution has gone up 98 percent, and tuition at a \nprivate 4-year institution has gone up 89 percent. If we want to \nrespond to working families in our country, then we need to make sure \nthat no additional tax cuts flow to wealthy or high-income people \nbefore we make higher education affordable for everyone. That is why \nthis amendment says that it is the sense of the Senate that whatever is \nleft over by way of tax cuts goes to education.\n  Now I want to talk about student loans. Look at this chart. This is \nreally rather amazing. What we see here is that, in the 1974-75 school \nyear, grants made up 80 percent of an average student aid package. \nTwenty years later, in the 1994-5 school year, grants make up only 20 \npercent of student aid. In 1974-5, only 20 percent of a student's \nfinancial package was loans--and now loans are up to 80 percent.\n  So tuition and costs have skyrocketed beyond the means of most\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\nfamilies in Minnesota and in our country. And student aid has gone down \nin real terms, with loans replacing grants in greater proportion. In \nthe meantime, real family income is not going up--in fact, many \nfamilies over the last 20 years are just standing still, barely able to \nmake ends meet. This is happening, even though we all know, and \nfamilies know, that higher education is the most important factor in \ndetermining whether or not our sons and daughters and grandchildren \nwill be able to make a good living in the future.\n  It is not uncommon, I say to my colleagues, as someone who spent over \n20 years in higher education, to find students graduating from school \nwith debts ranging from $20,000-$30,000 to $60,000. This \ndisproportionately affects those with lower and middle incomes. This \nnext chart expresses what we mean when we talk about a ``declining \nstandard of living'' for the bottom 60 percent of the population, or \nwhat we mean when we talk about the economic squeeze of the middle \nclass, of working families in America. Here we see real family income \nfrom 1979 to 1993, looking at it by quintile: The top 20 percent of \nfamilies saw their incomes go up 18 percent, the next 20 percent up 5 \npercent, the middle 20 percent down 3 percent, the next 20 percent down \n7 percent, and the bottom 20 percent down 15 percent.\n  This amendment is a reasonable proposition. I hope there are 100 \nvotes for this amendment.\n  This next chart is rather amazing, and gives you a sense of the \nprohibitive cost of higher education. If you were to send your son or \ndaughter to a public college and you started saving 17 years in \nadvance, you would have to put away $234 a month. $234 a month. If you \nplanned 5 years in advance, it would be $765 a month.\n  If you want to send your child to a private college, and you start \nsaving 17 years in advance--and that is pretty good advance planning, \nstarting at the time of birth of your son and daughter--you would have \nto put away $489 per month. If you waited until your child was in \njunior high, 5 years before starting college, which is still pretty \nimpressive advanced planning, you would have to put away $1,599 per \nmonth to be able to afford private higher education. Almost $1,600. And \nthis is after you pay your mortgage, after you buy your groceries, \nafter you clothe your children, and after you save for your own \nretirement.\n\n  I suggest to you, Mr. President, and I suggest to my colleagues, that \nthe vast, vast, vast, vast--I said that four times--majority of \nfamilies in our country, whether it be Minnesota or Wyoming or South \nCarolina, you name it, cannot afford to put this kind of money into \nsavings, as much as all of us want our sons and daughters and \ngrandchildren to do well.\n  So, Mr. President, what this amendment says, in a nutshell, is that \nif we as Senators want to respond to the concerns of working families \nin our States, if we want to respond to the concern that parents have \nthat their children be able to do well--and we know there is a huge gap \nbetween employment earnings of those who graduate from college versus \nthose who are not able to do so--if we want to provide some relief to \nworking families, to middle-income families, if we want to make sure \nthat every woman and every man--some of them not so young, because we \nare talking about community colleges as well--has the opportunity for \nhigher education, then what we have to make sure is that when we talk \nabout tax cuts, anything beyond tax credits for children and families \nwill go toward a $10,000 tax deduction that families can use to pay for \ntuition and to pay for the interest on their loans.\n  This is what I would call an eminently reasonable amendment. I think, \nfrom the point of view of my State, from the point of view of the State \nof Massachusetts or Washington or other States represented here, there \nis probably no more important priority for families than to make sure \nthat men and women, women and men, are able to afford higher education. \nI have spent a lot of time on campuses, and I can assure my \ncolleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--that this is a hugely \nimportant issue to the people we represent.\n  I cannot think of an amendment I brought to the floor of the Senate \nthat has more importance in terms of how it affects families all across \nour country, and I hope there will be very, very strong support for \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the concept of a tax deduction for college tuition costs. \nThe amendment we are considering today specifies--that it is the sense \nof the Senate--that if there is any tax revenue raised by the Finance \nCommittee beyond what is needed to pay for a per-child tax credit, it \nshould be used to either finance a tax deduction of $10,000 per year \nfor higher education tuition and student loan interest costs, or to \nreduce the federal deficit. While I am not comfortable with some of the \nlanguage of the amendment, which appears to preclude tax cuts in any \nother form this year, I share the sponsors belief that a tax break for \nthe costs of higher education should be among our highest priorities \nwhen discussing tax changes in the 1997 Federal budget.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of a bill that was introduced by Senator \nDaschle in January, 1995 that would make working families with annual \nincomes under $100,000 eligible for a tax deduction of as much as \n$10,000. This legislation, which is based on a proposal made by \nPresident Clinton, is a commonsense approach. It is well targeted to \nease an already crushing and still rapidly growing financial burden on \nmany hard-working families who are struggling to get by today.\n  Mr. President, we all know that the American people are anxious about \ntheir economic future. They are worried about the security of their \njobs and about their ability to take care of their families. As any \nparent with children in college or children approaching their college \nyears can tell you, nothing compounds these anxieties like the \nspiraling costs of higher education. For many average working families, \nthere is a real fear that they will not be able to afford to send their \nchildren to college, or that doing so will break them financially.\n  The basis for this fear is all too real. According to the College \nBoard, the average yearly cost in 1994 for an undergraduate attending a \nprivate university was $19,561, which is 94 percent higher than the \nsame cost 10 years ago. The average yearly cost for a public \nuniversity, $6,862 is up 76 percent over the same period.\n  It's no wonder then that many middle class families are being priced \nout of the higher education market. The establishment of a tuition tax \ndeduction along the lines of what we are proposing, in combination with \nstudent loans and grants, would help many families keep pace with these \nrising costs. It would accomplish that goal without creating any new \nbureaucracy or burdensome regulations, and would leave it to families \nto decide how to maximize the benefit of the deduction.\n  Best of all, it would help our children get the tools they need to \nfind and hold on to good jobs. In today's economy, and even more so in \nthe future, that means a college education.\n  There is no more sound predictor of economic success than a 4-year \ndegree. Consider this example: a male college graduate earns on average \n83 percent more than a man with only a high school diploma. A similar \ndisparity exists for women with different levels of education.\n  We must also remember that many of the young minds that we stimulate \ntoday will be the engineers, inventors, business leaders and skilled \nworkers who stimulate the economy and create the jobs of tomorrow. As \none parent, wrote to me, ``Without the intellectual curiosity and the \nunderstanding of the world about us that a college education affords, \nalong with the knowledge and the skills in some specific area, we would \nnot develop the minds of those people in our country who are able to \ncome up with the ideas and develop businesses that create jobs.''\n  Congress has an opportunity to respond to the fears of the American \npeople about the financial costs of higher education and to their hopes \nabout their children's futures. This tax deduction proposal is an \nimportant step toward reaching those goals, and I think it sends a \nstrong message to the American people that we in Washington are \nlistening.\n  Congress should heed the calls of hard-working middle class families \nwho want their Government to value education. This idea makes a world \nof sense, and hopefully it will soon help\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\nmake us a nation of greater knowledge and prosperity.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican budget has many flaws, but \nits worst flaw is its deviousness. Last year's Republican budget was a \nnaked assault on Medicare, education, and the environment. This year's \nbudget simply puts a figleaf on the same obnoxious priorities. \nObviously our Republican friends learned the wrong lesson from last \nyear's debate. Instead of changing their priorities, they've concealed \nthem.\n  Education is a prime example. They cut 20 percent over the next 6 \nyears--and falsely call it a freeze of current spending. The \ndevastating cuts in title I, Pell grants, and Head Start are not even \nmentioned.\n  In the area of taxes, the Republicans boast that their budget \nprovides maximum flexibility for tax legislation this year. As we \nlearned last year maximum flexibility is a code phrase for capital \ngains tax cuts and other tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals and \ncorporations in the Nation.\n  Senator Wellstone has offered an amendment specifying that the first \npriority for any tax cut beyond the tax credit for children should be a \ntax deduction of $10,000 a year for college tuition and interest on \nstudent loans. Otherwise, available savings should be used for deficit \nreduction.\n  Tax relief is vital to keep college within reach for students and \nworking families. Higher education is no longer a luxury for the few. \nIt is a necessity for participation in the modern economy. According to \nthe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 60 percent of all jobs created \nbetween 1992 and 2005 will require education beyond high school.\n  But rising college costs and heavy college loan burdens threaten to \nput college out of reach for many students and working families. That \nis why tuition tax relief is so important. President Clinton's proposal \nwould allow a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for college tuition \ncosts, and restore the deduction for interest on student loans.\n  For a family earning $50,000 a year, this relief would mean a \nreduction of $1,500 in their tax burden. Students paying back their \nstudent loans would be able to deduct the interest on their loans, just \nas homeowners deduct the interest on their mortgage. Students had this \nbenefit until 1986, and it is time to restore it.\n  We know from experience that education is an investment that will \nmore than pay for itself for students and the Government. Under the GI \nbill, every dollar invested in college aid produced $8 in economic \nreturns. The additional taxes paid by GI bill graduates during their \nworking lives have more than paid for the cost of the program.\n  Education and skills are the key to higher wages for American workers \nin the global economy. Economist Paul Krugman writes,\n\n       We are living through one of those difficult periods in \n     which technological progress, instead of producing broadly \n     shared economic gains, steadily widens the gap between those \n     who have the right skills and those who do not.\n\n  The education gap has been steadily growing. From 1969 to 1989, the \nreal income of college-educated heads of households between the ages of \n25 and 54 rose by 22 percent. But in that same period, the income of \nheads of households without a college education increased by only 1 \npercent.\n  The average high school graduate in 1992 earns $6,000 more than a \nhigh school dropout. The average college graduate earns $14,000 more \nthan a person with only a high school diploma.\n  At the same time, the cost of college is increasing at more than \ntwice the rate of inflation. The April 29 Newsweek cover story said it \nall. When elite colleges cost $1,000 a week to attend, paying for \ncollege is truly scary.\n  Tuitions have risen in public colleges as well. At the University of \nMassachusetts, tuition and fees have more than doubled over the past \neight years, from $2,200 in 1988 to $4,560 in 1996, in order to \ncompensate for declining State support.\n  To make matters worse for students squeezed by increased college \ncosts, the value of Federal student aid has declined drastically, and \nhas shifted from grants to loans. In 1975, 80 percent of Federal \nstudent aid came in the form of grants. Now 80 percent of student aid \ncomes in the form of loans.\n  Borrowing to cover costs has skyrocketed. In 1994, the average \nstudent loan debt was $12,520. By 1998, the average debt will reach \n$21,000. Over the last 8 years, borrowing in the Federal student loan \nprogram has more than doubled.\n  The growing cost of a college education has become a heavy burden on \nfamilies across the country. But they know that it is still the best \ninvestment they can make in their children's future. We must do more to \nhelp ease that burden. I urge my colleagues to support the Wellstone \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by \nthe junior Senator of Minnesota to use the Tax Code creatively to help \nfamilies afford higher education. While Republicans are cutting Pell \ngrants and student loans for average working families, Democrats \npropose to give every family a $10,000 maximum deduction for tuition \ncosts, and allow their sons or daughters who take out student loans to \ndeduct the interest on those loans so the burden of debt they carry \nwhen they graduate will not be so great as it otherwise would be.\n  These proposals are real-life solutions to real-life family problems. \nHow can we say that people should go to college--everyone should \nreceive the training they need--and then make it as difficult as we can \nto do it? We need to make it easier for Americans to afford the \neducation and training they need to compete in a new global \nmarketplace.\n  The costs of college are rising rapidly. This year, the average \nundergraduate will pay up to 6 percent more than last year for tuition \nand fees at both 4-year and 2-year colleges. Parents putting children \nthrough college, adults returning to school, and graduates with student \nloan payments are all facing these costs.\n  This tax deduction is targeted to middle-income families, to help \nordinary Americans meet the costs of higher education. A full tax \ndeduction would be available to two-income families earning up to \n$100,000, and single individuals earning up to $70,000. These tax \ndeductions could be used for educational expenses at 4-year colleges \nand universities, community colleges, and vocational and professional \nschools. This amendment would help 16.5 million students across the \ncountry better afford the costs of higher education.\n  This is in contrast to the Republican budget which caps the Federal \ndirect student loan program at 20 percent of loan volume. This will \nresult in disruptions for colleges and universities and real problems \nand uncertainty for students. Since schools participating in the direct \nloan program currently handle nearly 40 percent of loan volume, many \nwill be forced out of the program. But the real reason Republicans are \ntrying to mangle this successful program is to help assure banks and \nguarantee agencies continued access to Federal subsidies.\n  Under the current Tax Code, although education expenses related to \none's current job are tax deductible, education investments to prepare \nfor new jobs and careers are not. This amendment would address this \ndiscrepancy.\n  But beyond helping families pay for tuition costs, I want to help \nparents get the lifetime education and training they will need to \ncompete. Investment in higher education is crucial to making sure that \nAmericans are able to meet the challenges of jobs which require \nadvanced skills. Statistics show that the more education a person has, \nthe more money he or she will earn. We need to provide access to \nhigher-paying jobs for students from all families, and this is an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, in 1995 President Clinton proposed a deduction for \ntuition expenses. I was proud to support his proposal, but I did not \nbelieve it went far enough. I have heard from dozens, indeed hundreds, \nof Massachusetts students or the families of those students, about the \ndifficulties they are experiencing in paying back the loans they have \ntaken out in order to be able to afford post-high school education. \nBefore the Senate Democratic leadership introduced the President's \nproposal, I urged that they expand the proposal to provide tax \ndeductibility of interest paid on outstanding student loans, and they \nagreed that such a provision would be desirable and would offer real\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nand important help to Americans who are seeking to improve their \neducational levels and their competitiveness as workers; the leadership \ngroup added tax deductibility of loan interest payments before they \nintroduced the measure. I am pleased that the amendment we are debating \ntoday contains both these key features that will enable deduction from \nincome taxes of both tuition and student loan interest payments.\n  This is a solid amendment, Mr. President, which will help Americans \nto help themselves. I compliment the Senator from Minnesota for \ndeveloping the amendment, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and \nhis staff who have labored diligently to produce the Democratic \nleadership amendments and prepare them for floor action, and all other \nSenators who have been involved in assembling this amendment and \nbringing it to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment, which takes a very significant step toward helping the 16.5 \nmillion students in colleges and universities to afford the education \nthey need.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, while I have the floor, in very short \norder, I want to also send a few other amendments to the desk. First of \nall, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the existing amendment for a \nmoment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3986\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that funds are provided for the hiring of new \n  police under the Community Oriented Policing Service in fiscal year \n                                 1997)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I now send an amendment to the desk. \nThis amendment is to ensure that full funds are provided for the hiring \nof new police under the Community Oriented Policing Service (COPS) \nProgram in fiscal year 1997. I see on the floor my colleague from \nMassachusetts, who has been a real leader on this issue. I can say, \nspeaking just for the State of Minnesota, that police chiefs and \nsheriffs and the law enforcement community have done an extremely \neffective job in taking this program and dealing with issues of \ndomestic violence. COPS has led to a lot of concentrated work with \nyoung people, a lot of concentrated work in neighborhoods that have \nhigh levels of violence.\n  I cannot think of a more important program, and that is why this \namendment makes certain that this budget resolution provides for COPS \nto be fully funded. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3986.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO \n                   HIRE NEW POLICE OFFICERS.\n\n       (a) It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the function totals and reconciliation \n     instructions in this budget resolution assume: (1) full \n     funding of the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund; and (2) \n     that sufficient funds will be made available for Public \n     Safety and Community Policing grants to reach the goals of \n     Title I of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994 (Public Law 103-266).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJohn Kerry be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3987\n\n(Purpose: To prevent Congress from enacting legislation that increases \n           the number of children who are hungry or homeless)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3987.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Sense of the Senate.--(a) It is the sense of the \n     Senate that the assumptions in this budget resolution assume \n     that Congress will not enact or adopt any legislation that \n     would increase the number of children who are hungry or \n     homeless.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the assumptions in \n     this budget resolution assume that in the event legislation \n     enacted to comply with this resolution results in an increase \n     in the number of hungry or homeless children by the end of \n     fiscal year 1997, the Congress would revisit the provisions \n     of said legislation which caused such increase and would, as \n     soon as practicable thereafter, adopt legislation which would \n     halt any continuation of such increase.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment simply says that the \nSenate will not enact any legislation that will increase the number of \nchildren who are hungry or homeless. And it also says that if, in fact, \nlegislation passed by Congress does increase the number of homeless or \nhungry children by the end of fiscal year 1997, the Congress will \nrevisit the provisions of the legislation which causes the increase and \nwould, as soon as possible, adopt legislation to stop the increase.\n  Mr. President, I have brought this amendment to the floor of the \nSenate before. It was defeated twice, believe it or not. It was then \npassed on voice vote. I deeply regret that I let it pass on a voice \nvote. I want to have a recorded vote on this because I believe, as a \nmatter of fact, some of the decisions we are making, in terms of some \nof the cuts we are making, will create more hunger and homelessness \namong children, and I want all of us to be held accountable.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3988\n\n     (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to \n maintaining current expenditure levels for the Low Income Home Energy \n           Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for fiscal year 1997)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be set aside, and I send another amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] for himself, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Levin and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 3988.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LIHEAP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) home energy assistance for working and low-income \n     families with children, the elderly on fixed incomes, the \n     disabled, and others who need such aid is a critical part of \n     the social safety net in cold-weather areas during the \n     winter, and a source of necessary cooling aid during the \n     summer;\n       (2) LIHEAP is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help \n     millions of low-income Americans pay their home energy bills. \n     More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have \n     annual incomes of less than $8,000, more than one-half have \n     annual incomes below $6,000.\n       (3) LIHEAP funding has been substantially reduced in recent \n     years, and cannot sustain further spending cuts if the \n     program is to remain a viable means of meeting the home-\n     heating and other energy-related needs of low-income \n     families, especially those in cold-weather States;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying this \n     budget resolution assume that it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funds made available for LIHEAP for fiscal year 1997 \n     will be not less than the actual expenditures made for LIHEAP \n     in fiscal year 1996.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. \nWhat this amendment says is that we should sustain the same level of \nfunding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. This has \nbeen a huge battle. I do not know that there has been an issue that I \nhave worked harder on, and I cannot believe that every single time this \ncomes up, we have to fight so hard to make sure that people do not go \ncold in the United States of America.\n  So I want to get a strong affirmative vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set \naside.\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3989\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this next amendment that I am about to \nsend to the desk I send on behalf of myself, Senator Murray and Senator \nWyden. It says that it is the sense of the Senate that no welfare \nreform provision should be enacted by Congress unless until Congress \nconsiders whether such welfare reform provisions would exacerbate \nviolence against women and their children, further endanger women's \nlives, make it more difficult for women to escape domestic violence, or \nfurther punish women victimized by violence. Any welfare reform measure \nenacted by the Congress should require that any welfare-to-work \neducation or job placement programs being implemented by States address \nthis impact of domestic violence on welfare recipients.\n  One word of explanation, Mr. President. We have some fairly dramatic \ndata that shows, in many cases, as many as 50 percent of women on \nwelfare or in workfare programs have been or are victims of domestic \nviolence. They have been battered.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that any welfare reform provision that we \nenact must take into account these circumstances. It cannot be ``one \nsize fits all.'' It took Monica Seles 2 years to play tennis again. \nImagine what it is like for a woman and her children who have been \nbeaten over and over and over again.\n  We cannot pass a piece of legislation without any special allowance \nfor these families that have gone through this violence, because we \nmust not force these women and children back into very dangerous homes. \nThat is what this amendment says.\n  This Congress and this country have become much more focused, thank \ngoodness, on the problems of domestic violence. When we consider \nwelfare reform, we must take this interest into account.\n  I repeat this. You cannot force a mother and her children, even if \nshe is low income, back into a dangerous home where she could end up \nbeing murdered.\n  I will repeat that once more. We cannot pass legislation without \ntaking into allowance the problems of domestic violence, the problems \nof women who have been battered, the problems of children who have been \nbattered. We cannot pass this legislation without understanding that \none size does not fit all, because if we do, in the case of many \nfamilies--and in the relatively short period of time I have next week, \nI will have some data to bring out--we will force many women and \nchildren back into dangerous homes. We are going to force many women \nand children into situations where they could lose their lives.\n  Mr. President, that is not melodramatic, that is the case. So I hope \nthere will be overwhelming support for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mrs. Murray and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3989.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At an appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying \n     functional totals and reconciliation instructions in this \n     budget resolution include:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Violence against women is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women. The Department of Justice estimates that \n     over 1 million violent crimes against women are committed by \n     domestic partners annually.\n       (2) Domestic violence dramatically affects the victim's \n     ability to participate in the workforce. A University of \n     Minnesota survey reported that one-quarter of battered women \n     surveyed had lost a job partly because of being abused and \n     that over half of these women had been harassed by their \n     abuser at work.\n       (3) Domestic violence is often intensified as women seek to \n     gain economic independence through attending school or job \n     training programs. Batterers have been reported to prevent \n     women from attending such programs or sabotage their efforts \n     at self-improvement.\n       (4) Nationwide surveys of service providers prepared by the \n     Taylor Institute of Chicago, document, for the first time, \n     the interrelationship between domestic violence and welfare \n     by showing that between 50 and 80 percent of women in welfare \n     to work programs are current or past victims of domestic \n     violence.\n       (5) The American Psychiological Association has reported \n     that violence against women is actually witnessed by their \n     children, who as a result can suffer severe psychological, \n     cognitive, and physical damage and some studies have found \n     that children who witness violence in their homes have a \n     greater propensity to commit violent acts in their homes and \n     communities when they become adults.\n       (6) Over half of the women surveyed by the Taylor Institute \n     stayed with their batterers because they lacked the resources \n     to support themselves and their children. The surveys also \n     found that the availability of economic support is a critical \n     factor in women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten themselves and their children.\n       (7) Proposals to restructure the welfare programs may \n     impact the availability of the economic support and the \n     safety net necessary to enable poor women to flee abuse \n     without risking homelessness and starvation for their \n     families.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) No welfare reform provision should be enacted by \n     Congress unless and until Congress considers whether such \n     welfare reform provisions would exacerbate violence against \n     women and their children, further endanger women's lives, \n     make it more difficult for women to escape domestic violence \n     or further punish women victimized by violence.\n       (2) Any welfare reform measure enacted by Congress should \n     require that any welfare to work, education, or job placement \n     programs implemented by the States address the impact of \n     domestic violence on welfare recipients.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous-consent that we go back to the higher \neducation tuition tax deduction amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the last unanimous-\nconsent request? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, simply, on behalf of the manager, I want \nto make it clear that the majority has not yielded back time on the \nWellstone amendments, nor have we given up the right to second-degree \nthese amendments.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I inquire what the order is at this point \nin time, if there is an order, and, if there is not, I want to keep the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point, Senators are obtaining \nunanimous consent to set aside previous amendments.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was originally scheduled to go at a later \ntime. Because we were fogged in, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed with two amendments, which I was going to do \nlater, at this moment in time and reserve such time on those amendments \nas is set aside for other colleagues on our side to be able to speak at \na later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be introducing two amendments on behalf of the \nleadership, one with respect to the environment and one with respect to \neducation. I am joined on the education amendment by the distinguished \nSenator from Washington, Senator Murray. I will just proceed very \nrapidly on the environment one in order to dispose of it, and then we \nwill spend a few minutes on the education one.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3990\n\n(Purpose: To help protect the quality of our water and air, to clean up \ntoxic waste, to protect our national parks and other natural resources, \nand to ensure adequate enforcement of environmental laws, by restoring \nproposed cuts in the environment and natural resources, to be offset by \n the extension of expired tax provisions or corporate and business tax \n                                reforms)\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, this is an amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenators Lautenberg, Boxer, Mikulski, Daschle, Baucus, Lieberman, \nLeahy, Dodd, Kennedy, and Graham of Florida. I want to particularly \nthank the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, for his \npersistent, continued leadership in this particular area and his \nefforts in committee to try to guarantee that we had adequate funding \nwith respect to the environmental policy for this country.\n  I regret enormously that this amendment to restore funding for \nenvironmental cleanup failed by a party line vote in the Budget \nCommittee.\n  This amendment that we are now proposing funds the most fundamental \npriorities of the country with respect to the environment, protection \nof our natural resources, our national parks.\n  I will just preface the specifics of the amendment by saying, Mr. \nPresident, that all of us care enormously about the budget and the \nfiscal restraints that we are living under right now. The issue in \nWashington is not whether or not we are going to balance the budget. \nThis fight should not be, ``They don't want to balance the budget.'' \nThey do. ``They're irresponsible. They just want to spend a lot more \nmoney.'' We don't.\n  That is not the fight. There are two budgets, one of which we voted \non last night that balanced the budget by CBO figures in 6 years. It is \na Democrat vision of how we ought to go about spending money to balance \nthe budget. There is an opposing vision. That opposing vision suggests \nthat we should not be spending a certain amount of money on \nenvironmental protection, but rather we ought to be spending that money \ngiving tax breaks to our wealthiest citizens, people who already have a \nlot of money and do not particularly need at this moment to receive \nanother tax break.\n  Mr. President, I remind colleagues that we have reduced the deficit \nover the last 4 years and cut it in half. That is a promise kept by the \nPresident of the United States. When he ran for office, President \nClinton said, ``I will cut the deficit of this country within 4 \nyears.'' It is now 3\\1/2\\ years later, and the deficit has been cut in \nhalf. In addition to that, we have had, as we know, record economic \ncontinued growth. We have had 8.5 million jobs created. That is the \ncontext in which we are making a number of choices about where we \nproceed from here.\n  One of those most fundamental choices is whether we are going to keep \nfaith with our commitment to the American people that our kids are not \ngoing to drink leaded water, that we are going to continue to proceed \ndown the road of the Safe Drinking Water Act, that we are going to \ncontinue down the path of the Clean Air Act.\n  We have made great gains in the last few years in the quality of the \nair that people breathe. There are less people entering hospitals or \ndying of emphysema or lung disease as a consequence of the fact that \nour cities are now becoming free of smog and carbon dioxide and the \nnitrogen oxides that used to not only take away the view, but take away \nlife. That is an enormous gain in the quality of life for this country.\n  Our amendment seeks to guarantee that we continue to make that gain. \nSo we seek to restore $7.3 billion over 6 years for environmental \nprotection funding. We seek to raise that funding to the President's \nrequested level for three key environmental agencies--the Environmental \nProtection Agency [EPA] itself, for the National Park Service [NPS], \nand for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA].\n  Mr. President, the President's budget and the Republican budget--here \nare two different views. These numbers are not rhetoric. The Republican \nbudget seeks to cut $10.9 billion for environmental protection from the \nPresident's budget request over the next 6 years.\n  The President's budget would, in fact, be cut severely by the \nRepublican budget in the final year--fiscal year 2002. In 2002, the \nRepublicans would cut by 20 percent the National Park Service budget. \nThe President's budget for the National Park Service is extremely \nimportant given that the number of visits to our Nation's parks \ncontinue to increase and that steady pace of visits has taken its toll \non many parks. For example, the Grand Canyon alone needs $350 million \nto repair roads, sewers, and water systems. In addition, over the last \nseveral years, Congress has added a substantial number of new \nresponsibilities to the Park Service, while the core operational budget \nfor the Park Service has remained flat in real terms since 1983.\n\n  The Republican budget, in fiscal year 2002, would include a 12-\npercent cut for Superfund even though there are thousands of Superfund \nsites not yet cleaned up; at many sites cleanup efforts have not even \nstarted.\n  It would mean a 9-percent cut for the EPA's water programs, even \nthough there is city after city in America with decaying water \ninfrastructure, with problems with pipes and sewers and\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\ncombined sewer overflows. Nevertheless, there is a cut.\n  It would provide a 23-percent cut for the Environmental Protection \nAgency's operations and enforcement programs, which is a way of gutting \nenvironmental protections and cleanups. If you do not have the \ninspectors--the environmental cops on the street--to go out to hold \npeople accountable, then some people will take advantage of the system. \nSome people will cut corners on environmental measures or do nothing at \nall and pollution will occur, which is precisely why we are in the \npredicament we are in this country and, I might add, in every country \nin the world facing massive cleanups of toxic sites of poisons and of \ndirty water and of dirty air.\n  There is a 21-percent cut for the EPA science and technology program \nwhich defies imagination when you measure what the Japanese are doing, \nwhat the Germans are doing, what other countries are rushing to do to \ncreate jobs in the new technologies that will clean up these \nenvironmental disasters. Why would the United States of America, the \nworld's leader in many of these technologies, precisely because we have \ninvested in them, suddenly retreat and disinvest?\n  There is a 15-percent reduction in the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's operations and research program.\n  Mr. President, these cuts that the Republicans are proposing are more \nthan just numbers on a page. They express a set of priorities. They \nexpress their vision of where expenditures ought to go. They have to be \ncounterbalanced against the choices that have been made to fund the \nalternative of that money.\n  Where does that money go? Does it go into deficit reduction? No. It \ndoes not go into deficit reduction. They are taking from these \nenvironmental priorities and giving to people who already are doing \nvery well in the United States of America. That does not really make \nsense.\n  So the question has to be asked, again and again and again, what are \nthe priorities of our Nation?\n  Let me give a specific example of what happens in my State of \nMassachusetts in the area of drinking water. Massachusetts and the \nNation have made great strides in the past two decades on cleaning up \nour water. Massachusetts is probably one of the States providing higher \nexpenditure in terms of efforts to safeguard our drinking water. Yet 17 \npercent of our citizens still drink from water systems that violate \nFederal water standards. We have over 1 million people in 80 \ncommunities who last year drank water that failed to meet the Federal \nstandards. We have 300,000 people in 14 communities who drank water \ncontaining disease-causing fecal matter. There are over 800,000 people \nwho drank water from water supplies that failed to meet the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency standard for adequate filtering and \ndisinfecting of tap water. In Massachusetts, in 1994 and 1995, there \nwere 141 water systems serving nearly 500,000 people that failed to \nmeet the basic sanitary testing requirements for tap water.\n  Mr. President, that is just my State. I could show those examples in \nStates all across this country. Why are Americans going out and buying \nbottled water at a cost that far exceeds their water bills on an annual \nbasis? The answer to that is because they do not trust the water \nsystems. Why do they not trust the water systems? Because they know \nthese kinds of statistics exist. It is our responsibility to be able to \nguarantee that those systems work.\n  What is happening in the face of that responsibility? We are going to \ncut back on enforcement. We are going to cut back on water grants to \nStates. It is absolutely mindless. We should be assisting communities \nwith investments for new water systems and testing measures. We should \nbe spending more to guarantee that our citizens are safe. That is the \nresponsibility of Government.\n  What we have here are two very differing views of what that \nresponsibility is and how it ought to be carried out. Mr. President, we \nare seeking, as I said, $7.3 billion simply to bring the level back to \nwhat the President recommended for three key areas: the EPA, the Park \nService, and NOAA.\n  There are reasons for doing this. With respect to an agency such as \nNOAA, many people do not know what services NOAA provides that \nAmericans use and depend on every day. For example, NOAA runs the \nNational Weather Service which is vital to the Midwestern States, \nparticularly, for farming disasters, for prediction of storms. It is \nNOAA's long-term oceanic and atmospheric research program that \ndeveloped the 5-day weather forecast and just recently made possible \nthe 6-day forecast.\n  The weather service modernization at NOAA is now at a critical stage. \nThe President's budget would allow us to finish the job we are doing of \nproviding new technologies and restructuring in this NOAA field. Future \nweather satellite coverage, by these cuts, would be cut in half. That \nwould result in a blackout if any working satellite failed. The funds \nthat are here would allow NOAA to maintain its fleet of satellites, \nassuring that there would be no gaps in satellite coverage. This is \ncritical for weather warnings, for hurricane storm prediction, avoiding \ndisasters, and for many other defense and civilian-oriented programs. \nNOAA's research increases the reliability of hurricane predictions \nsaving the nation billions of dollars in losses.\n  NOAA's programs help protect human lives and property; it provides \nnational security by supporting weather service modernization and \noperations. It is critical to our flight systems, to the safety of our \ntransportation network, to our national fisheries and coast protection \nefforts.\n  I am not going to continue on in this area. I do want to emphasize, \nMr. President, we are really simply asking that we keep going down the \nroad that America has decided it would like to go down. Regrettably, \nwhat will most likely happen here is we will have these cuts proposed \nby the Republicans; we will expend enormous amounts of energy debating \nthese cuts that the American people do not want; and then we will come \nback later this year and will probably win some kind of a restoration \nin environmental funding. At least, I hope we will.\n  In the end, we are just nickel-and-diming ourselves and disinvesting \nin one of the most important quality-of-life issues that really matter \nto our fellow citizens.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kerry-Lautenberg \namendment to restore funding for essential environmental programs.\n  This amendment will help to protect the quality of our water and air, \nclean up toxic waste, and preserve our national parks and other natural \nresources by restoring proposed Republican cuts in the environment and \nnatural resource programs.\n  It appears as if my Republican colleagues are attempting to back away \nfrom and cleverly cover up all the damage their budget does to the \nenvironment.\n  Some of my colleagues may be surprised to learn that their budget \nassumes savings derived from drilling for oil in the arctic refuge. \nIt's in there, along with deep cuts for the EPA's enforcement and \noperations programs and the National Park Service's operations and \nmaintenance activities.\n  This amendment will keep the budget in balance by the year 2002. The \n$7 billion add back is easily offset by using just a fraction of the \nextension of expired tax provisions or the elimination of corporate \nloopholes the Republicans intend to use for their budget plan.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nLautenberg's and Senator Kerry's amendment to restore funding for the \nNational Park Service, EPA, NOAA, and the Department of the Interior.\n  This amendment goes to the heart of the debate over what kind of \ngovernment the American people want. And it expresses in legislative \nlanguage some of the strongest values we hold dear.\n  There is no doubt the American people are of a mind to reduce the \nsize and cost of government. They believe government takes too much \nfrom their pockets and spends too much on programs that aren't working. \nThose are strongly held views, and on the face of it you might think \nthis amendment runs counter to that public mood. But I would gladly \ntake the opportunity to offer the essence of the Lautenberg amendment \nup for a very public vote of\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\nthe American people. There is doubt whether we can prevail on the \nSenate floor. There is no doubt that we would prevail in the court of \npublic opinion.\n  Because for all their doubts about government, the American people \nexpect government to fulfill some very basic duties. Protect them from \nforeign enemies. Protect them from crime. And keep them and their \nchildren safe from hazards that they are unable to defend against on \ntheir own. That most definitely includes environmental pollution. They \nalso care deeply about global warming, endangered species, and \npreservation of America's parks and forests.\n  Yes; they're mad about taxes, stagnant wages, and government waste. \nBut they're mad about beaches they can't swim at, water they can't \ndrink, rivers they can't fish in, and air that's unsafe to breathe. \nThis amendment shows respect for America, its land, air and waters and \nits people, by restoring funds for clean water, safe drinking water, \nenforcement of environmental laws, cleanup of toxic waste sites, and \npreserving our national parks.\n  Let me address several key aspects of the amendment.\n  First, Senator Lautenberg's amendment would restore $623 million to \nEPA's science and technology budget over the next 6 years. Frankly, Mr. \nPresident, I simply can't understand why the proposal before us cuts \nthe President's request in this area by 21 percent.\n  Let's look at what the science and technology account at EPA does. \nThis account funds the operating programs of the EPA's Office of \nResearch Development and the program office laboratories. These \norganizations provide scientific and technical expertise to help meet \nthe agency's environmental goals. Specifically, these funds are used to \nimprove our understanding of risks to human health and ecosystems, \ndevelop innovative and cost effective solutions to pollution prevention \nand risk reduction. Funding from this account is used by EPA to develop \nrisk assessment criteria and to develop sound cost-benefit research and \ntechniques. As we all know, there has been extensive talk this Congress \nabout the importance of both risk assessment and cost benefit analyses.\n\n  And the specific programs that EPA will focus on with funds from this \naccount are critical. For example, drinking water research at EPA \nevaluates the effects of the pathogenic bacteria, parasites, and \nviruses that can cause serious illness or even death. In the air \nquality area, EPA intends to focus a multiyear effort on the dangers of \nsmall particles of soot known as particulate matter. A recent report by \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council concludes that approximately \n64,000 people may die prematurely from heart and lung disease each year \ndue to particulate air pollution. According to the report, lives are \nnot just being shortened by days or weeks but by an average of l to 2 \nyears in the most polluted areas. EPA's research will focus on \nmortality estimates, an evaluation of the biologic mechanisms resulting \nin harmful effects, and development of innovative control strategies.\n  Mr. President, all of us would agree that it is critical that EPA's \nregulations and policies be based on good credible science. But \ndeveloping that science involves a public investment of funds. We \nshouldn't criticize EPA for failing to rely on the best science if we \ndon't provide the resources to do the job.\n  Second, I strongly support the restoration of funding for the State \nrevolving fund under the Clean Water Act. SRF money is critical for \nConnecticut and particularly Long Island Sound.\n  The SRF program espouses the virtues that the majority has been \nemphasizing this Congress--it provides low interest loans to States to \nmeet community based environmental needs and offers flexibility in how \nmoney is spent. For example, Connecticut has received $170 million in \nFederal funds and has committed over $1 billion in State funds since \n1987 to improve sewage treatment plants.\n  In Connecticut, clean water is not just an environmental issue--but \nan economic issue. Long Island Sound, for example, generates \napproximately $5 billion per year for the local economy--through fin \nand shellfish harvest, boating, fishing, hunting, and beach-going \nactivities. The commercial oyster harvest is a great example. In 1970, \nConnecticut's once thriving shellfish industry was virtually \nnonexistent. Today, its $50 million harvest has the highest value in \nthe Nation. This improvement is due in large part to required upgrades \nin water quality.\n\n  Our work on cleaning up Long Island Sound, however, has a long way to \ngo. Health advisories are still in effect for recreational fish \nconsumption, and disease causing bacterial and viruses have been \nresponsible for numerous beach closures. In March, the department of \npublic health in Connecticut issued a fish consumption advisory for \nmercury levels in freshwater fish from Connecticut waterbodies.\n  Connecticut still needs hundreds of millions of dollars to perform \nneeded improvements on public sewage systems, which continue to be the \nlargest source of pollution for the Sound. The total estimated cost of \nupgrading the outdated plants is estimated at $6 to $8 billion.\n  Inadequate funding of the SRF delays needed improvements in Long \nIsland Sound and in other great water bodies in this country --\nimprovements that have enormous economic, recreational, and \nenvironmental benefits. That's why I support the additional funding in \nSenator Lautenberg's amendment.\n  Let me just touch briefly on several other provisions in the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  The amendment restores funding for NOAA's operations and research \nprogram. One of the missions of this program is to improve the National \nWeather Service's ability to predict hurricanes. This makes good \neconomic sense. An average hurricane warning today covers about 300 \nmiles of coastline and involves preparation and evacuation costs the \npublic in excess of $50 million per event. The improved approach to \npredicting hurricanes proposed by the National Weather Service can \nreduce the size of the warning areas, saving more than $5 million per \nstorm, according to the Weather Service. This is a highly cost-\neffective approach--the Service tells us that the savings are more than \n50 times the cost of the proposed additional observations. The enhanced \nobservations will result in earlier, more accurate warnings. It will \nallow the public to protect residences more effectively and to relocate \nboats, recreational vehicles to safe locations. It will save property \nowners and insurance companies huge amounts of money. Moreover, when \nthe areas of warning are smaller, the National Weather Service believes \nthey will be taken more seriously, leading to more thorough \npreparations and saving more lives.\n  Mr. President, the Lautenberg amendment expresses more clearly than \nmany pieces of legislation we debate on the Senate floor the kind of \nvalues we cherish in this country. I strongly urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak on one other matter in the budget \nresolution. The budget assumptions to the Energy Committee appear to \ninclude an assumption that revenues will be obtained from drilling for \noil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, although this is \nnot clearly spelled out in the committee's report. This would be a huge \nmistake.\n  As we found out during the fiscal year 1996 budget discussions, a \nwide majority of Americans oppose this move and the President clearly \nwill veto any bill that includes opening up ANWR for drilling.\n  The arguments for balancing the budget by drilling in the Regue \ncontinue to be very weak. Geological surveys show that the odds of \nstriking oil are extremely low--the estimate for a major strike is only \n5 percent. Environmental studies predict irreversible damage from \ndrilling to this pristine ecosystem from drilling, particularly the \ncalving activities of the 150,000 caribou that simply have no where \nelse to go. The footprint of development would span a network of \nhundreds of square miles along the highly sensitive coastline where \nwildlife and fish are concentrated.\n  Mr. President, I urge that the Energy Committee not come back in the \nreconciliation bill with provisions to open ANWR for drilling.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment because \nI feel very strongly about the long-term implications of turning our \nbacks on the environment. This Congress tried\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\nto repeal environmental laws and they tried to tie up the system with \nprocedural gimmicks. They tried to cut funding for the EPA, and they \ntried to pass riders on the appropriations bills for temporary \nsuspensions of environmental laws.\n  While we were able to hold back some of this political pandering to \nspecial interests, the environment did suffer setbacks with the \nRepublican initiatives that either slipped through the cracks or were \nforced through Congress as parts of larger compromises. But now we are \ntalking about systematically reducing funding over the next 7 years. We \nsimply cannot do that without having negative consequences.\n  The Congressional Budget Office may conclude that the bill saves \nmoney, but that is only because they are counting dollars, not inches \nof acid rain, kilograms of toxic waste and concentrations of airborne \nparticulates. When it comes time to pay the health bills of 7-year-old \nchildren who grew up around dirty Superfund sites, the cost will be \nhigh. The cost of neglect for our streams and rivers, the cost of \napathy for safe drinking water, the cost of maintenance lapses in the \nNational Park Service, and the cost of data gaps in basic environmental \nscience will be high. The environment will not take care of itself. We \nhave to step up and be responsible about the future we pass to our \nchildren.\n  This budget is not responsible when it comes to basic protections for \nour air, water, streams, and natural resources. That is why we are \nworking to restore environmental funding by using bipartisan offsets \nidentified by the Republicans. Environmental protection is supposed to \nbe a bipartisan issue. Presidents Bush, Reagan, and Nixon signed some \nof our most important environmental laws. We offer this amendment to \nbring the budget back into line with the bipartisan commitments made in \nthe past 25 years.\n  The people of the United States never voted to gut environmental \nspending. They voted for honest efforts to control wasteful spending, \nclose wasteful loopholes, and refocus government on the priorities that \ngovernment can do best. This amendment will make sure government \nprovides basic safeguards for a clean environment. This is a job that \ngovernment can do and needs to do. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3991\n\n(Purpose: This amendment increases the Function 500 totals to maintain \n   levels of education and training funding that will keep pace with \n     rising school enrollments and the demand for a better-trained \n workforce. This increase is fully offset by the extension of expired \n         tax provisions or corporate and business tax reforms)\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, this is a very similar issue to the one \njust discussed. I am proud to be joined in this effort by the Senator \nwho led the fight in committee, who has been one of the Senate's most \noutspoken and capable leaders with respect to the issue of education, \nSenator Murray of Washington. She attempted in committee to get this \nchanged. We are now seeking this together on the floor, along with \nother colleagues.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, if somebody came along and said to \nAmericans, ``I'm going to run for office, and I'm proposing the largest \ncuts in education in American history,'' you would be laughed out of \nthe room. People would look at you and say, ``What, are you serious? \nThat's your platform?'' That is what is being proposed. That is what we \nhave in the agenda in this budget--the largest education cuts at the \nFederal level in American history.\n  Now, it is incomprehensible to me, Mr. President, when we measure \neach of the particular Federal programs that are contained within the \nFederal budget for education, why at this point in American history \nthat is the route we would choose to go down. Republican President \nGeorge Bush led an effort, with the Republican Governors and Democrat \nGovernors alike, to try to reform the education system of this country. \nTogether, the President, President Bush, and the Governors fought for \nsomething called Goals 2000. President Clinton came into office and we \nmanaged to move that effort to fruition.\n  It is the most basic kind of effort to try to address the problems in \nour schools. There is not any American who is not aware of the problems \nof our schools. It is why parents struggle to send their kids to any \nschool they think will work. They go into debt to do it. They go to \nparochial school, they get out of public school, they struggle with \ntheir public school.\n  State after State has stressed the issue of education reform. Yet, \nhere we are, having passed something that offers school districts help \nto be able to\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\nraise the standards, raise the standards of teaching for the kids, \nraise the standards of ongoing learning for the teachers, raise the \nstandards of curriculum, raise the standards with respect to the \nadministration of a school so you have school-based management--a whole \nhost of things that almost everyone in the U.S. Senate would agree are \ngood things to do--yet we are going to reduce, for literally tens of \nthousands of kids, the opportunity to be able to touch those goals.\n  This budget would cut education by $25 billion in real terms over the \nnext 6 years. In fact, it would cut education by $3.2 billion in fiscal \nyear 1997 alone. When we examine this budget, we can only conclude it \nis the sequel to last year's story with respect to the attack on \neducation that most Americans came to agree was extreme.\n  Senator Murray and I rise today to offer an amendment that will \nrestore our funding for education investments to the level proposed in \nthe President's fiscal year 1997 budget. This simply comes to the level \nof a balanced budget over 7 years, by CBO figures, that the President \noffered in his budget.\n  Mr. President, I will have two charts that show what has happened in \neducation, but I will wait until the charts arrive.\n  We have a lot of schools, despite increased resources, that do not \nhave computers. They do not have facilities in libraries that even have \nmodern textbooks. Many schools have part-time librarians because they \ncannot afford to have a full-time one. Many schools cannot even afford \nto stay open beyond 2:30, 2 o'clock in the afternoon. We have a huge \npublic resource we have invested in, and we do not even use it into the \nevening for many communities--for remedial education, ongoing family \neducation, for problems with language so people could proceed faster to \nthe mainstream with respect to the use of language--a whole host of \nthings we could be doing creatively. We do not do them, and now we will \ncut our capacity to be able to provide the kind of assistance that \nwould allow schools to experiment in those areas.\n  It is very difficult for me to understand why we are reducing the \nability of people to even have remedial reading and other kinds of \nefforts when only one-third of the high school graduates in the United \nStates of America last year had what is considered a passable reading \nlevel. We have 2\\1/2\\ million kids in America who graduated from high \nschool last year. One-third of them were below basic reading level, \none-third were at the margin, and only one-third were passable. Only \n100,000 of our high school graduates had what was considered a world-\nclass reading level. I do not know if every school in this country \nneeds phonics or what, but to reduce the ability of schools to make \nthose choices right now flies directly counter to the experience that \neveryone has come to agree is critical in order to be able to get a \ndecent job in this new information management world we live in. \nEverybody understands that.\n  The world is different. The marketplace is different. People are \ngoing to have to prepare for three, four, five careers in a lifetime. \nHow do you do that if you are not coming out of the best education \nsystem in the word? How do you come out of the best education system in \nthe world if you do not have the basic resources and the basic tax base \nin many communities to be able to afford it? How about the tax base \nissue?\n  Title I: So many of our communities depend on title I money to be \nable to provide the mainstreaming, the extra teacher assistance, even \nthe classroom level of students that provides adequate education at the \nearly intervention level.\n  Why would we be reducing the ability to do that? Why would we be \nreducing the ability of kids to have Head Start? Why would we be \nreducing the ability of kids to do the one thing we have learned is so \nimportant, which is to take at-risk kids and get them into a new \nlearning environment where they can actually gain the skills to get a \njob when they are at risk of dropping out of high school? We have seen \nso many of these kids that we understand that this is critical.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would still spend $17 billion less than \nfunction 500 than would have been invested if the prerescission \npolicies of last year had kept pace with inflation. So this is not \nprofligate spending. We are not coming here asking people to just throw \nmoney at a problem. We are asking people to keep up in those programs \nthat have been proven to work at least with a level of inflation and \nprerescission level.\n  Mr. President, I have more that I could say on this. I will turn to \nmy colleague, Senator Murray, who will talk with greater specificity \nabout what is at stake here.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  I am pleased to be offering this amendment today, along with Senators \nKerry, Levin, Kennedy, Daschle, Wellstone, Simon, Harkin, Dodd, Kohl, \nBingaman, Mikulski, Dorgan, and Wyden.\n  Mr. President, our amendment simply increases the level of investment \nthis country will make in education and job training over the next 6 \nyears. When Senator Magnuson, whose seat I now sit in, was here over \ntwo decades ago, education proponents were asking Congress to dedicate \none-third of the Federal budget to education. Today, very sadly, a mere \n3 percent of our budget is invested in our children's education.\n  Function 500's discretionary initiatives--the part of the budget that \nthis amendment addresses--contain some of our most successful education \nand job training programs, including Head Start, title I, impact aid, \nschool-to-work, vocational education, and education technology \nprograms.\n  I can tell you, as a Senator who is a preschool teacher, a PTA \nmember, a mother, and a Senator, that I know each of these programs \nmakes a difference in the lives of our young people.\n  Mr. President, children are our Nation's most precious resource. I \nhave heard so many of my colleagues say this. We know the next \ngeneration faces more challenges than any who came before them. They \nface a more competitive job market, rapidly changing occupations, more \ntechnology, and increasing international competition. Adequately \nfunding function 500 is one of the best ways the Federal Government can \nprepare our children for the changing work force. It is a simple, \ncommonsense investment. And it is an investment that yields big \ndividends quickly.\n  I, personally, have seen a Head Start student smile as she listened \nto a teacher read her a book for the very first time. I have talked \nwith college students who would not be in school were it not for a Pell \ngrant. I was on a school board that passed a bond to put technology \ninto our classrooms because we knew that in our lifetime every student \nwould need to be able to use the latest technology. I have been in \nschools like the Bethel School District, where students tell me school-\nto-work programs have changed their lives and brought personal success.\n  Quite frankly, I am a little disappointed that we need to offer this \namendment today. We all know last year's budget debate was acrimonious. \nBut, after much haggling, we were able to restore valuable education \nfunds in the omnibus fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill. I commend \nSenators Specter, Harkin, Kennedy, and others for their hard work and \ndedication to getting that job done in the last budget. But, after all \nof this, I did not expect to see the new Republican budget propose \nanother truly inadequate level for education and job training funds.\n  Now, I have heard the Republicans tell us their budget actually \nincreases education spending by $3.1 billion over 6 years. Well, that \nis not the whole story. I have to tell my colleagues, that amount will \nnot even keep pace with inflation. Nor will it match the amount needed \nto serve the Nation's increased enrollment projections. Student \nenrollment will increase 7 percent over the next 6 years, and next \nyear's enrollment will be the highest national level since 1971. It is \nclear to me that, over 6 years, the Republican budget amounts to a \ncut--plain and simple. It is $26 billion below inflated fiscal year \n1996 levels. It is a retreat from our responsibility to provide \neducation and opportunity to the next generation of Americans, and it \nlacks the core values I believe most Americans hold.\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I offered this \namendment last week in the Budget Committee markup. Unfortunately, it \nwas not accepted. It was rejected along party lines. But let me take a \nminute to describe this amendment a little bit further. This amendment \nincreases function 500's 6-year spending level $56.1 billion over the \nRepublican proposal. However, please note, this amendment falls short \nof what we would be spending under fiscal year 1995 prerescission \nlevels.\n  I want to emphasize that point. This amendment spends $17.7 billion \nless than what would have been invested if the fiscal year 1996 \nprerescission policies were kept in place. The 1995 level is the most \nappropriate. However, I understand that that level is not fiscally \npossible because we all need to give a little as we move toward a \nbalanced budget. I believe this amendment is truly a good-faith \nconcession from the most acceptable education and job training funding \nlevel.\n  Finally, it is important to understand that this amendment is paid \nfor by closing corporate tax loopholes and extending expired tax \nprovisions. Our children--our young people are worth it.\n  Mr. President, I have held a series of town hall meetings throughout \nWashington State over the course of this past year. In Tacoma, Spokane, \nYakima, and Vancouver people came together to talk about the \nresponsibility adults have in improving the well-being of our children. \nWe agreed to respect our differences, but to get beyond them to the \nthings we can all agree on. Overwhelmingly, all adults and young people \nagreed we need to invest in our children's education.\n  In fact, whenever I talk with my friends and neighbors about the \nbudget, they always tell me not to cut Federal investments in education \nand job training. They know Head Start works in Washington State. It \nserves 11,000 kids annually, but there are 6,000 more eligible children \nthat could be served with increased funding.\n  I have seen firsthand the successes that come from our vocational \neducation programs. We must remember that over 50 percent of our \nchildren will not go on to college, and they need to graduate with \nskills that give them real jobs. We know, vocational education and \nschool-to-work programs help prepare those young adults to compete in \nthe rapidly changing global marketplace.\n  I recently talked to a young woman who was waiting to hear if she \nwould get a Pell grant this year. Her eyes filled with tears as she \ntold me this was her one chance to get to college next fall.\n  I also know from personal experience, as a teacher, the progress \nbeing made in our public schools through title I funding and education \ntechnology grants. Sure, cutting education funds will not mean we stop \nteaching reading, writing, or math. But, if we do not pass this \namendment it will mean one more child will not get the help they \ncritically need to be a success one day.\n  Mr. President, these programs work in my home State. But, support for \nthese programs is widespread. My colleagues may have seen a recent USA \nToday poll that showed 82 percent of Americans do not want to balance \nthe budget if it means cutting education. We should listen to this \nmessage and do what our constituents recommend.\n  The debate over our fiscal priorities has come a long way since \nexactly 1 year ago, and Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, deserves a lot of the credit for advancing this discussion \nand moving our Nation closer to a balanced budget. I believe the \ndifferences between the two parties has narrowed to a point where \ncompromise is within reach. All we need now is the courage to do so.\n  Mr. President, last year's budget debate was painful for all of us. \nBut, I know it was especially painful for our constituents--our hard-\nworking friends and neighbors. They did not know why the budget debate \nforced the Government to shut down twice; one time for 3 straight \nweeks. They did not see that as progress. Instead, they saw it as just \nanother example of what is wrong with Congress and the Government \ntoday.\n  I do not mention this to point fingers at any particular party, but \nas a reminder that the budget debate requires compromise if we hope to \nreally serve the people.\n  In the end last year, we learned our Government is truly a democracy. \nWe learned any successful budget agreement will need to be as broad and \nbipartisan as possible. Most importantly, we learned that it is \npossible to balance the Federal budget without retreating on education \nor hurting children.\n  The final appropriations bill increased education funding from the \noriginal proposal because we all recognized we needed to compromise on \nthis critical area of funding. We have to do that again, now, with this \nbudget and with the passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am optimistic we have learned from our mistakes and \nI am confident Congress and the President can come to terms on a \nbalance budget plan. Both sides have come a long way over the course of \na year. During the appropriations process, Republicans have \nacknowledged the need to increase funding for education, the \nenvironment, cops on the street, and AmeriCorps; and the President has \nsubmitted a CBO-certified balanced budget that includes cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to note that many of my colleagues \nargue for the Republican budget package by claiming it will benefit our \nchildren and grandchildren in the long run. They claim we will give our \nchildren a better economy and lower interest rates tomorrow by \nbalancing the budget today. Well, this may be true, but they fail to \nnote that this plan cuts our vital investments to do so; programs like \nHead Start, title I, Pell grants, and vocational education.\n  I fail to see how my children will be better off tomorrow without \ndecent, quality education today. In fact, if my kids do not have an \neducation, they will not get a job, and if they do not get a job, they \nwill not be able to buy a home with those lower interest rates.\n  Mr. President, a businessman recently commented to me that a good \nbusiness that plans to be here in the future cuts its budget carefully \nand invests in its most important resources. He said he feared this \nCongress appeared to be having a fire sale. We need to look ahead and \nsay we do want to survive long into the future. This amendment helps \nget us there.\n  So, again, I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, when \ncompared to prerescission 1995 levels, this amendment is a modest \ninvestment in education and job training and restores a core value I \nbelieve Americans hold: The belief that education is important. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support Senator Kerry, myself, and \nothers in supporting this critical amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will just take a couple of minutes and \nthen reserve the remainder of the time for other Senators who want to \nspeak on this issue. I thank the Senator from Washington. I want to \nemphasize, if I may, a couple of points that both she and I have made.\n  This is not a struggle, in my judgment, over whether one group wants \nto be fiscally responsible and the other group does not. We are both \ntalking about a framework for a balanced budget. In fact, were it not \nfor the insistence on a very significant size tax cut on a 7-year \nbasis--still over $200 billion, less than that over 6 years--there is \ntoday enough money on the table by both sides, agreed upon, to balance \nthe budget. I hope Americans understand that. We do not have to have \nthis fight except for the struggle over a tax cut. It is the struggle \nover the tax cut that forces the taking of money from a whole lot of \nthings that matter in order to give the tax cut. The tax cut is \nfundamentally a borrowing from the future to give to the present. The \ntax cut is essentially a transfer payment taking from the next \ngeneration in terms of investment and current programs and giving to a \ngroup of people to spend it today.\n  That is really what we are fighting about here because we have \nidentified, and the President has delivered to us and we have voted for \na sufficient number of discretionary cuts to balance the budget of this \ncountry this afternoon. What we are saying in our vision is we are \nwilling to support--many of us, not everybody perhaps--some form of a \ntax cut in order to have compromise here.\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\n There are certainly some Americans who really deserve one. If it were \ngeared in a way that absolutely guaranteed that the right people were \ngetting it, there might be much more support for building the \ncompromise faster. But there is no excuse for taking 20,000 kids out of \nHead Start and saying you do not get a head start so we can give \nsomebody earning more than $300,000 a year more money. It is \nirrational. But that is exactly what the program is at the same time as \nthe stock market of this country went up 34 percent in one year, at the \nsame time as company after company reports record profits, at the same \ntime as interest rates are low, unemployment is low, and 8.5 million \njobs have been created in 3\\1/2\\ years. What is the rationale for \ntaking 20,000 kids and saying you do not get a head start so we can \njump-start the economy--8.5 million jobs better than Ronald Reagan did, \nbetter than George Bush did? It is illogical.\n  In New Bedford, MA, 294 children are currently participating in Head \nStart. So I wonder what Senator here would like to go tell those kids, \ngo stand in front of them and say, ``No more program. Sorry.'' Or to \nsay that ``50 of you are going to be out of this program and the rest \nof you get to go ahead because we think it is a good program. We just \ndo not want 50 of you to continue in it so we can give people who earn \n$300,000 or more a nice tax break.'' That is the choice.\n  Mr. President, another important effort that would be cut here is the \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools Program. It serves over 134,000 kids in \nMassachusetts alone. The Republicans want to cut this antiviolence \nprogram by $50 million. That may be a relatively small cut. But again, \nI ask the question: Why? Why? Has somebody discovered suddenly that \nevery school in America is free of drugs? Has somebody discovered \nsuddenly that drugs are no longer a problem? Has somebody discovered \nthat kids are not still bringing weapons to school and we do not need \nto make our schools safer? I cannot think of a parent in America who \nwould agree that safe schools and drug-free schools is not yet a \npriority of this Nation. Yet, our friends on the other side of the \naisle, in order to give this great big, fat tax cut, are coming in and \nsaying, ``Sorry, kids. It does not matter how unsafe your school is. We \nare not going to consider that a Federal priority anymore.''\n  Mr. President, I will just close by showing on these two charts the \nhistory of what has happened with respect to these expenditures. This \nis what we did in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 in the black--\nevery year the Federal priority was to try to help make a difference to \nhurting places in America. We were going to try to help these schools \ndo better.\n  Here is the Republican revolution. There is the date that the \nRepublican revolution began--the biggest cuts in American history all \nof a sudden despite the fact that experts across the land will tell you \nthat each of these efforts is working.\n  Mr. President, here is the history in a different way. This is what \nwe are doing. Last year the Republicans proposed a $26 billion cut in \neducation appropriations. The Senator from Illinois is here. He will \nremember this. He was one of the people who helped to stop it. They \nwanted to cut $10 billion from education last year. That was their \noriginal goal. But the committee raised a storm. People raised a storm, \nand that came out of the committee at $4.9 billion. Then it came down \nhere, and we had an effort, a fight on the floor, that resulted in a \n$3.7 billion cut finally. That is the bite of the apple they took. We \ncame along and said, ``We do not want a $3.7 billion cut. We think that \nis wrong.'' So we had another big fight on the floor. We consumed all \nthe time and energy of the U.S. Senate, and we finally won and got the \n$3.7 billion restored so we have a lesser cut.\n  What is the lesson learned from that? The Senate ultimately voted--I \nthink it was about 80-plus Senators--to say let us just take this tiny \nlittle nibble out of the apple. And what happens this year? They come \nright back and propose to devour the apple again with a $25 billion \ncut. Why are we are going through that exercise again? No wonder most \nAmericans are sitting around at home saying, ``Have these guys lost \ntheir minds? Where are they coming from?''\n  That is called extreme, Mr. President, from here, to here, with this \nintermediary experience, and here is what we wound up with. You would \nthink somebody learned a lesson.\n  So I hope that we are going to have the good common sense not to \nsplit ourselves apart but to come together around the most fundamental \ncommitment we could make in this country today. There is no way we will \ncompete with Japanese, with Germans, with any of the other developing \ncountries who care more about education than we do apparently. They put \nthe effort into it. We should be putting the effort into it. All of us \nknow that very few Governors, very few mayors are going to run for \noffice with the ability to say, ``I am going to raise the tax base, the \nproperty tax,'' which is the most onerous of all taxes, ``and I am \ngoing to adequately fund education.'' The whole purpose of these \nefforts was to make up the difference in those areas. I hope that we \nwill do just that in this Chamber.\n  I ask unanimous consent to reserve the remainder of time on both the \nenvironment amendment and the education amendment for those Senators \nwishing to speak thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator please yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield 2 minutes of his time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. EXON. I congratulate and thank the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senator from Washington for an excellent presentation on two very \nimportant subjects. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor \nto both of the amendments that have been offered and discussed this \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate very much the vivid presentation centering on \nsomething that is very fundamental to those of us on this side of the \naisle, and I hope and urge my colleagues to support these two \namendments because they are absolutely vital to the future of America, \nand that is what it is all about.\n  This amendment simply raises the function totals in the Republican \nbudget up to those included in the President's budget for education and \ntraining programs.\n  While the Republicans cite an increase in education spending compared \nto their freeze baseline, they admit a cut of $3.2 billion over 6 years \nto a 1996 freeze. How could that be? The answer is simple. Their so-\ncalled ``freeze baseline'' for the education Function only freezes for \n1 year and then dips down in the outyears. They do not extend the \nappropriators' hard-fought compromise agreement on education spending \nthrough the whole budget window.\n  The lesson of the long, drawn out, saga of the 1996 appropriations \nprocess was that the American people, the majority of Congress, and the \nPresident consider it a top priority to adequately fund education \nprograms. The Republicans seem to need to be knocked over the head to \nlearn that lesson.\n  Let me say in closing that I strongly support the Kerry-Murray-Levin-\nKennedy amendment and urge its adoption by the Senate.\n  I thank my friend and I yield back any time remaining that has been \nyielded to me.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill very much.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Kerry \namendment. I thank Senator Kerry for his leadership as well as Senator \nMurray from Washington for her leadership.\n  I first had the chance to meet John Kerry many years before we served \nin the Senate together. I was impressed by him then, and the \ncontribution and sense of vision and understanding he had, and I have \nbeen impressed in my years in the Senate.\n  Every study that any economic group makes of where we ought to go, \nwhat we ought to do, I do not care whether\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\nit is conservative, liberal, what it is, they all come back and say one \nthing: we have to invest more in education.\n  In the area of higher education, we are still preeminent in the \nworld, though others are catching up. In the area of primary and \nsecondary education, we are now among the developed nations in what we \nspend per person about 14th. In preschool education, we are way behind. \nWe ought to be doing more. This is where we set the priorities.\n  Let me just give you an historic analogy that my friend from Nebraska \nis old enough to remember along with me, if he will forgive me, and \nthat is the GI bill after World War II. It was an interesting thing; \nthere was a fight among veterans groups as to what should happen. The \nAmerican Legion, of which I am a member--and I have sometimes differed \nwith my friends in the American Legion--after World War II said we \nought to have an education program for veterans, and they pushed it. \nAnd some of the other veterans groups said no, we should have a cash \nbonus for veterans. Fortunately, for the United States of America, the \nAmerican Legion prevailed, and the GI bill was a huge step forward for \nthis Nation. We then had in comparative terms about one-third of the \nincome, even accounting for inflation, that we do today. The average \ngrant, if you were to add inflation, from the GI bill today would be \n$9,400, regardless of income. We struggle for $2,300 in a Pell grant \ntoday for those of extremely limited income.\n  However, in a sense we are going through the same fight. And here I \ndiffer with some of my friends on both sides. We do not call it a cash \nbonus today. We call if a tax cut. And instead of investing in \neducation, we are being asked to cut back on education. It is \nshortsighted. We ought to be looking at our children and our \ngrandchildren and saying, how do we build a better future for them? I \nhave to believe we do not do it by giving tax cuts that, frankly, I do \nnot think are wise. We are saying we are going to balance the budget in \n7 years, and it is kind of like a New Year's resolution. We are \nproclaiming a New Year's resolution to diet and starting with a huge \ndessert.\n  And then we have the wrong priorities--$11 billion more for defense \nthan the Defense Department requests but cutting back on education.\n  So I strongly support my colleague from Massachusetts in this effort. \nI think he is right, and I applaud his leadership on this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have been talking about the amounts of \nmoney which effectively will be authorized in the budget that has been \nproposed to us by the majority of the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. There are important differences in the \npriorities of Democrats and Republicans. The budget should reflect the \nNation's priorities. And I want to just follow up and continue what I \nknow was an excellent presentation by my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, talking about the priorities of education \nand to try and clarify what the proposed Republican budget would mean \nto parents, families, and school systems across this country.\n  First, all of us know that money in and of itself does not solve \nproblems. How we allocate resources is a pretty clear indication what a \nnation's priorities are. Education is among their highest priorities. \nIt ranks above crime, the economy, health care, and the deficit for the \nfirst time in history. 82 percent of Americans oppose cutting education \nto balance the budget.\n  The American people need to understand that there are significant \ncuts in K-12 and higher education in the Republican budget. American \npeople do not support real reductions in funding of education programs \nor the elimination of some programs, to pay for tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals and corporations. I do not think that is a choice most \nAmericans would make, yet that is before us in this budget proposed by \nour Republican friends.\n  There are significant cuts in Head Start, which helps young people \nget on the first rung of the ladder of the education process and \ndevelop their self-esteem so they are better prepared to enter the \nschool. The Republican budget freezes Head Start below current levels, \ndenying at least 20,000 children this preschool experience in 1997 \nalone. Our Democratic amendment increases Head Start by 10 percent in \n1997, allowing 796,500 children to benefit from this comprehensive \neducation, nutrition, and health services program.\n  There are real cuts in title I, which improves the math and reading \nskills of children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Republican \ncuts to title I will deny reading and math assistance to 550,000 \ndisadvantaged children next year. Our Democratic amendment increases \ntitle I by 7 percent for 1997, providing instruction to 7 million \ndisadvantaged children.\n  There are significant cuts in Goals 2000, which funds the efforts of \nlocal schools to enhance academic achievement. Republicans cut Goals \n2000 funding in 800 schools. Our Democratic amendment permits an \nincrease in funding of $176 million in 1997, in order to respond to the \nhigh level of requests for Goals 2000 funds in States and localities \ntrying to improve the achievement levels of their students.\n  The Republican budget will also deny needed opportunities for job \ntraining to over 130,000 youths and adults in 1997. The House budget is \neven more extreme. It cuts job training programs by 43 percent below \nthe 1995 level. The number of participants in this program will drop \nfrom 1.8 million this year to 1.1 million in 2002, a loss of 750,000 \nparticipants. These programs now serve only 3.6 percent of eligible \nworkers. The Republican cut would reduce that level to 2.2 percent.\n  There are reductions in the support for Safe and Drug Free Schools. \nWe hear a lot of statements about how we are going to deal with the \nproblems of substance abuse. It is a complex issue. Safe and Drug Free \nSchools helps reduce violence and substance abuse in the schools of \nthis country. This program is being seriously cut back.\n  In higher education, Pell grants will be cut by $6.2 billion over 6 \nyears. As a result, 1.3 million students will lose Pell grants, and the \nvalue of the maximum grant will decline by $400 per student by 2002.\n  Pell grants have already lost 25 percent of their purchasing power \nover the last 15 years. In 1979, a Pell grant provided three-fourths of \nthe cost of attending a public college. Now it provides less than a \nthird of that cost.\n  Our Democratic amendment tries to ease the difficulties that students \nand working families face in struggling to pay for college. It allows \nPell grants to keep pace with inflation, with the maximum Pell grant \nreaching $3,130 by the year 2002.\n  Our amendment will also increase the investment in work study by 10 \npercent in 1997. It will expand the number of students who gain work \nexperience while they earn money for college from 700,000 to 1 million \nby 2002. By contrast, under the Republican budget 800,000 students will \nlose work study assistance by 2002.\n  The Republican budget also dismantles the direct loan program, which \nhas been overwhelmingly endorsed by students and colleges across the \ncountry. Under the direct loan program, students get their loans to pay \nfor college faster and more easily than under the guaranteed loan \nprogram. Direct lending also offers income-contingent repayment, so \nthat the size of a student's loan payment is determined by his or her \nincome. Direct lending is an enormous success, an incredible success. \nIf I have the time, I will read into the Record some of the various \nreports and assessments, where young people and colleges overwhelmingly \nendorse it.\n  The House of Representatives effectively eliminates the direct loan \nprogram. The Senate caps it at 20 percent, which will still undermine \nit in a very significant way. Only 4 weeks ago Republicans and the \nadministration agreed to let colleges choose a student loan program. \nThat was only 4 weeks ago. But now, they come right back and say, ``No, \nwe are going to go back on that agreement, not build on it.''\n  The Republican budget denies colleges the opportunity to choose the \nloan program that provides the best service and lowest cost to their \nstudents. The Republicans say, ``Oh, no, we know best. We know best. We \nhere in Washington, DC, know best. We here in the Senate know best.''\n  You know better than what the students and colleges in my State of \nMassachusetts want? Schools and colleges\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\nshould make their own choice. My colleges will not be permitted that. \nMy students in Massachusetts will not be permitted that. Their option \nis effectively closed out by the arbitrary position which has been \ntaken by the Republican majority.\n  There is one group that will benefit from the Republican cap on \ndirect lending. The guaranty agencies and banks in the guaranteed loan \nprogram will gain $100 billion in new loan volume, which will provide \nthem $5 or $6 billion in new profits. That money ought to remain in the \npockets of hard-working Americans.\n  In the fiscal year 1995 Rescissions, we voted to cut education \nfunding to $39.5 billion. Then, the next year, the 1996 Republican \nbudget came in at $36.2 billion--a $3.3 billion shortfall. Many of us \nfought in the U.S. Senate and said, let us at least protect education--\nby keeping funding at the fiscal year 1995 level.\n  Eventually the Republicans ran into a brick wall because the \nPresident said the American people believe in investing in the children \nof this country and we are not going to backstep in education. We had \nto close down the Government. That was perpetrated by the unwillingness \nof Republicans to protect education and the environment.\n  Then, only a few weeks ago, here in the U.S. Senate we voted 84 to 16 \nto restore $2.7 billion to education, to get us back to where we were \nin 1995. The final passage of that bill was 88 to 12. Republicans and \nDemocrats were saying, ``We support this. We are all for it.'' The \nvictory was brief. Only a few weeks later, from April 25 to May 9, the \nRepublicans propose a significant cut to education again by $3.2 \nbillion--$3.2 billion. The 1997 Republican budget is a thinly-disguised \nrehash of the harsh anti-education plan we defeated a few months ago.\n  Now, what do our Republican friends say? We are going to use that cut \nthat we were not able to get last year as the baseline for \nappropriations over the next 6 years. When they made their proposal on \nthe budget, they cut $3.2 billion and used that as the baseline over \nthe future years.\n  Mr. President, this is the fundamental point. When you use that lower \nbaseline and project it out over the period of the next 6 years, \neffectively it reduces funding for education by 20 percent, by one-\nfifth.\n  That is bad enough, but let us look at what is happening to the \nschool-age population during that time. Over the next 6 years, we are \ngoing to see a significant expansion in the number of children that are \ngoing to public schools; enrollment is going to increase 7 percent. \n50,000 more teachers are needed just to avoid overcrowded classrooms.\n  Mr. President, we face the same problem in higher education. There is \ngoing to be a 12 percent increase in the total students that enroll in \npostsecondary education as well. That is not figured in. So when we \ntalk about a 20 percent reduction in education spending, we must \nremember that this decrease comes at a time when increased funding is \nneeded just to keep up with the flood of new students.\n  This is no time to cut education. Education is a priority for \nnational investment. To prepare children for the future we need to \nspend more on education, not less.\n  Our Democratic amendment gets these priorities right. It permits an \ninvestment in education that keeps pace with rising enrollments and the \ndemand for a better trained work force. I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor this amendment. This is a vote for education and for the wise \npriorities that will guide America sensibly to the future.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the education \namendment offered by Senators Murray and Kerry.\n  This amendment would restore the overall funding level for critical \neducation and training programs jeopardized under this budget proposal. \nThe amendment is fully paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes.\n  Students, parents, and teachers taught us a valuable lesson this past \nyear. The budget we are considering today seems to have missed the main \ntenet of that lesson--this Nation can not afford large education cuts.\n  Mr. President, over the next 6 years, funding for education programs \nunder this budget would be reduced by 17 percent in real dollars, a cut \nof $7.4 billion. Such a weak commitment to education ignores profound \nchallenges facing students, schools, and families.\n  School violence is more and more prevalent; yet this budget \njeopardizes the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program.\n  The cost of obtaining a college education is going through the roof; \nyet this budget restricts opportunities for college aid.\n  Math and reading scores of children are stagnant; yet Title I funding \nto help the most disadvantaged children build basic skills is weakened.\n  And technology is racing past the classroom door; yet this budget \nleaves education technology programs behind.\n  How can we make such assumptions? Because those programs were \ntargeted for devastating cuts under the partisan budget plan last \nyear--the same cuts which were so soundly rejected by the American \npeople.\n  It is true that the bulk of education funding comes from States and \nlocalities, but school administrators are the first to admit that the \nFederal contribution is critical. Cutting our investment in education \nis foolhardy. In the struggle to meet the challenges of educating \ntoday's students, schools and communities need more help, not less.\n  We clearly must to be willing to make difficult decisions to reign in \ngovernment spending. But it makes no sense to cut corners on education. \nThere is a simple reason for this. In the next century, the world's \nstrongest Nation will be the one which has the best educated people. If \nwe abandon schools and students today, we will not be prepared for the \neconomic challenges tomorrow.\n  Reducing our investment in education will have painful results. \nStudents with special needs will not get the individual attention they \nmust have to succeed in school. Drugs and violence will threaten the \nsafety of even more students and teachers. Students will not have the \nskills to make the connection to jobs after graduation. And ambitious, \nintelligent students will not go to college, because they will not be \nable to afford the tuition.\n  Mr. President, according to the College Board, college tuition costs \nlast year increased at a rate of 6 percent nationally, which is more \nthan twice the rate of inflation. Only a decade ago, student debt \nlevels were $9 billion. This year student loans may reach $29 billion, \nwhich is up from $27 billion last year and $24 billion in 1994.\n  Facing the realities of skyrocketing tuition costs, parents are \nfinding it harder than ever to help their children reach a higher \nstandard of living. Families are falling deeper and deeper in debt \ntrying to send their kids to college today.\n  Are we prepared to turn our backs on those seeking to succeed through \na good education? I should hope not. We confronted these same concerns \nlast year, and we came to the right conclusion then. This year we are \nforced down the same road, and the answer must be the same now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support education and vote for the Kerry-\nMurray amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield to \nme for 1 minute?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Massachusetts, \nsince he had indicated a few moments ago that he was retaining the \nremainder of his time later on, have we come to an end then at this \nparticular period of time or does someone else wish to talk on this?\n  Mr. KERRY. I know the Senator from Nevada wishes to speak with \nrespect to the environmental amendment but I would ask unanimous \nconsent--I think it is in order anyway--the remainder of time on both \namendments be managed by the distinguished manager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator from Nevada seek?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the manager of this bill could allow me, \nI would like 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 20 minutes off of the time--\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since I have been waiting here, I have a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that I wanted to send to the desk. If the \nSenator from Nevada would allow me, it would only take me about 2 \nminutes. Will he let me do that ahead of his 20 minutes?\n  Mr. EXON. I inquire of the Presiding Officer, how much time is \nremaining on these two amendments, on the support side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 48 minutes in the \naggregate on these two amendments.\n  Mr. EXON. Forty-eight in the aggregate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Have been used.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Nevada has asked for 20 minutes and I \nyield that. The Senator from Washington asked for how much?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Three minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. I would simply say that the Senator from Washington is not \nseeking any additional time, as I understand it, on these two \namendments. She is following with an amendment. She would like to go \nnext under the order. I am wondering if possibly, to move things along, \nthe Senator from Nevada could maybe shorten his remarks and then maybe \ncome back later on this afternoon, if he is going to be available. We \nare trying to accommodate a whole group of people, as the Senator \nknows.\n  All that I am saying is we thought we were about ready to proceed \nunder the schedule with the amendment to be offered and remarks by the \nSenator from Washington. I am wondering if the Senator from Nevada \nmight be able to accommodate us some on this.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend and the manager of the bill that I, of \ncourse, have no problem yielding to my friend from Washington. But I \nsay to the two managers of this bill, I am trying to cooperate. I had \nan amendment that I was going to offer that is on the list. I decided \nnot to do that because this amendment is pending. Therefore I feel, in \nthe spirit of cooperation, that I have complied with that spirit.\n  Mr. EXON. I see. In other words, basically what the Senator is \nsaying, trying to expedite this, he will not be offering the amendment \nthat we had scheduled for him to talk on this afternoon?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. What I say to the two managers is that I am \ngoing to speak on the Kerry amendment that is an umbrella environmental \namendment, and that way I will not offer my amendment, which is more \nspecific. Theirs is more broad than mine.\n  Mr. EXON. We appreciate everybody's cooperation. Sometimes \ncooperation--the Senator from Washington, as I understood it, was \nscheduled to talk around noon. Has that been moved up?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe it was 1:30 or 2. I am willing to do it now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Exon, I think we are \ndoing great. It looks like this is going to be a day filled with good \nutilization of our time. But I will just state as these amendments have \nbeen offered, we have not yielded back our time in opposition. It would \nseem to me Senator Reid needs some time, but I think we also have to \nwork in this time to rebut the Kerry amendment and the previous one.\n  I do not want to do that now because you would rather use the time to \naccommodate a Senator, but clearly we are not going to be without a few \nwords, although we have heard most of the arguments last year. We do \nnot have to take a lot of time. But we do want to rebut the two \namendments, so I would appreciate it if you did not go much beyond \nSenator Murray and then see if we want to use time in rebuttal. We are \nentitled to that right now, as I understand it. I will say I do not \nwant to use that now.\n  If the Senator has an important commitment to Senator Murray, let us \ndo that, and then I would very much like to use some time on our side \nin rebuttal to the three that have been offered.\n  Mr. EXON. I guess what you are saying is you do not object to remarks \nby the Senator from Nevada or the amendment to be offered by the \nSenator from Washington, in that order, is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Actually I did not say that, but if that is what you \nwant now, that will put us up another 30 or 40 minutes? That is fine.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Washington wants 3 minutes, and I will try \nto do mine in 15, no more than 20.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  Mr. EXON. I suggest, Mr. President, then to accommodate everybody as \nwell as we can, the Senator from Washington be recognized at this time \nas per previous agreement and then the Senator from Nevada would follow \nin that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \naccommodation and ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside in order that I may introduce an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3992\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the General Services \n  Administration should place a high priority on facilitating direct \n transfer of excess Federal Government computers to public schools and \n               community-based educational organizations)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3992.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Assumptions.--The figures contained in this resolution \n     are based on the following assumptions:\n       (1) America's children must obtain the necessary skills and \n     tools needed to succeed in the technologically advanced 21st \n     century;\n       (2) Executive Order 12999 outlines the need to make modern \n     computer technology an integral part of every classroom, \n     provide teachers with the professional development they need \n     to use new technologies effectively, connect classrooms to \n     the National Information Infrastructure, and encourage the \n     creation of excellent education software;\n       (3) many private corporations have donated educational \n     software to schools, which are lacking the necessary computer \n     hardware to utilize this equipment;\n       (4) current inventories of excess Federal Government \n     computers are being conducted in each Federal agency; and\n       (5) there is no current communication being made between \n     Federal agencies with this excess equipment and the schools \n     in need of these computers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals and reconciliation instructions in \n     this budget resolution assume that the General Services \n     Administration should place a high priority on facilitating \n     direct transfer of excess Federal Government computers to \n     public schools and community-based educational organizations.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment I sent forward is simply a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that I believe most of my colleagues \nwill support. I hope it can be accepted by voice vote later today or \nnext week.\n  This amendment simply directs the General Services Administration to \nfacilitate the process of getting excess Government computers to \nschools or nonprofit school organizations. This amendment is following \na Presidential Executive order that was to make modern computer \ntechnology an integral part of every classroom, provide teachers with \nprofessional development that they need to use new technologies \neffectively, and connects classrooms to the national information \ninfrastructure and encourages the creation of educational software. I \nhave heard many of my colleagues talk about the need to put computers \nand technologies into the classroom, but the reality is that many \nschool districts cannot afford this expensive equipment.\n  The President's Executive order now has all Federal agencies \ndocumenting their excess computer equipment. My amendment will direct \nGSA to facilitate this process so the excess computers that are in \nGovernment service can be gotten into the schools where they are \nneeded.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this. Again, I hope it can be done \nquickly and efficiently on a voice vote.\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\n  I thank my colleagues and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is now recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3990\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am speaking on the Kerry amendment dealing \nwith the environment. I have here a publication on the Great Basin \nNational Park. It is called ``The Story Behind the Scenery.'' It is a \nnew publication, one of which I am very proud, because it showcases a \nnational park that we have in the State of Nevada.\n  Mr. EXON. Could I interrupt the Senator from Nevada for just a \nmoment? I wonder if he will yield to the two leaders of the bill \nwithout losing his right to the floor. We are making some good \nprogress. We have two amendments, one from the Republican side and one \nfrom the Democratic side, that we are prepared to accept at this time, \nif we could interrupt the Senator?\n  Mr. REID. Fine.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, at the present time I have talked with the \nchairman of the committee. There are two amendments that we are \nprepared to accept, one from that side and one from this side. At the \npresent time the staff is presenting those amendments to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  I believe he has them now. I believe the chairman of the committee is \nprepared to offer these two amendments, one from each side, sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendments that we are ready to accept.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3993\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on funding to assist youth \n                                at risk)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Campbell with respect to at-risk youth. I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Campbell, for himself and Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3993.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING TO ASSIST YOUTH AT \n                   RISK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) there is an increasing prevalence of violence and drug \n     use among this country's youth;\n       (2) recognizing the magnitude of this problem the Federal \n     Government must continue to maximize efforts in addressing \n     the increasing prevalence of violence and drug use among this \n     country's youth, with necessary adherence to budget \n     guidelines;\n       (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that \n     between 1985 and 1994, juvenile arrests for violent crime \n     increased by 75 percent nationwide.\n       (4) the United States Attorney General reports that 20 \n     years ago, fewer than half our cities reported gang activity \n     and now, a generation later, reasonable estimates indicate \n     that there are more than 500,000 gang members in more than \n     16,000 gangs on the streets of our cities resulting in more \n     than 580,000 gang-related crimes in 1993;\n       (5) the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention reports that in 1994, law enforcement \n     agencies made over 2,700,000 arrests of persons under age 18, \n     with juveniles accounting for 19 percent of all violent crime \n     arrests across the country;\n       (6) the Congressional Task Force on National Drug Policy \n     recently set forth a series of recommendations for \n     strengthening the criminal justice and law enforcement \n     effort, including domestic prevention effort reinforcing the \n     idea that prevention begins at home;\n       (7) the Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that \n     between 1991 and 1995, marijuana use among 8th, 10th, and \n     12th graders has increased and is continuing to spiral \n     upward; and\n       (8) the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention reports that \n     in 1993, substance abuse played a role in over 70 percent of \n     rapes, over 60 percent of incidents of child abuse, and \n     almost 60 percent of murders nationwide.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assume that--\n       (1) sufficient funding should be provided to programs which \n     assist youth at risk to reduce illegal drug use and the \n     incidence of youth crime and violence;\n       (2) priority should be given to determine ``what works'' \n     through scientifically recognized, independent evaluations of \n     existing programs to maximize the Federal investment; and\n       (3) efforts should be made to ensure coordination and \n     eliminate duplication among federally supported at-risk youth \n     programs.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to speak to my \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment to Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, the \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 1997. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis initiative by my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. This \namendment expresses the sense of the Senate to help young people at \nrisk in three ways:\n  First, the amendment calls for sufficient funding within existing \nfiscal constraints for programs to assist youth at risk by reducing \nillegal drug use, crime, and violence.\n  Second, the amendment places a priority on supporting program \nevaluations which are scientific and independent to determine what \nworks and to ensure the limited Federal dollars are invested wisely.\n  And, third, the amendment calls for efforts to coordinate and \neliminate duplication among federally supported at-risk youth programs.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly address each of these points in the \namendment.\n  First, there are many programs funded by various Federal agencies, \nincluding the Departments of Justice, Education, Labor, and Health and \nHuman Services. These programs help keep troubled kids out of gangs and \noff drugs. They give many kids a second chance to get their lives on \nthe right track. And they should get the support of Senators within the \nfiscal constraints we all face with the Fiscal Year 1997 budget.\n  Second, the amendment recognizes the importance of maximizing the \nFederal investment by ensuring these programs work. When Federal \ndollars are limited and we are working hard to balance the budget, it \nis important that we know what works. My colleague from Tennessee, \nSenator Thompson, is pursuing this matter in the Youth Violence \nSubcommittee, which he chairs. Therefore, this amendment places a \npriority on supporting scientifically recognized, independent \nevaluations of existing at-risk youth programs.\n  And finally, the Federal Government supports over 100 youth programs \nthrough many agencies. A March 1996 report from the General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] indicates that currently 16 different Federal departments \nand agencies are administering 131 programs to help delinquent or at-\nrisk youth. My colleagues Senator Kassebaum and Senator Cohen have been \nworking on this important issue. The pending amendment calls for \nefforts to eliminate bureaucratic duplication and ensure coordination \nof these federally supported youth programs.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues, during this busy and \ncritical time of debate on the budget resolution, will join with me in \nmaking a formal statement to the American people that we have not \nforgotten our troubled youth, nor the impact they are having on our \nsociety. By agreeing to this amendment, my colleagues and I will be \naccepting the cold, hard statistics about the criminal behavior, drug \nuse and violence among a segment of today's youth. But, we also will \nrecognize the importance of helping these children in whom our future \nrests.\n  This amendment is not about arguing over dollar amounts for different \nagencies' programs. This amendment is not about pointing the finger. \nRather, this amendment is about taking responsibility for our youth; \ntaking responsibility for the current overlap in programs and \ndetermining how this is affecting the children these programs are \nintended to help; and, about taking responsibility for the budget \nallocations we make regarding troubled kids. In short, this sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment is about taking responsibility for our future and \nour children's future.\n  Mr. President, we are experiencing an unprecedented wave of gang \nformation and gang activity in my home State of Colorado, and \nthroughout the country, that is so menacing that society all but \nsurrenders certain neighborhoods to gun-toting teens.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], a comparison \nof arrests nationally between 1984 and 1994 reveals that juvenile \narrests for violent crime had increased 68 percent. Murder arrests \nincreased 168 percent and aggravated assault increased 98 percent over \nthat period.\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\n  In Colorado Springs, for example, statistics reflect this national \ntrend of increased juvenile arrests for violent crimes. Between 1985 \nand 1994, juvenile violent crime arrests in Colorado Springs increased \nfrom 59 to 211, an increase of 258 percent. While the juvenile \ninvolvement in murder and rape in Colorado Springs, based on arrest \ndata, is infrequent, significant increases are seen in the categories \nof robbery and aggravated assault.\n  According to the Colorado Springs Police Department, they have seen \nthe emergence of youth gangs, and police have identified a small but \nextremely active number of habitual juvenile criminals. One study \nreveals that as many as 15 percent of local adolescents may be involved \ndirectly or indirectly with gangs.\n  Police departments have been tracking serious juvenile offenders for \nmany years, and from what we have learned it is clear the criminal \njustice system alone cannot impact the problem of juvenile crime. \nPrevailing social conditions, including family stability, education, \nand societal institutions all have impacts on the behavior of juveniles \nthat are well-ingrained before they come to the attention of law \nenforcement. In addition, the FBI points out that the population group \naged 10 to 17 years, which account for 98 percent of juvenile violent \ncrime arrests, is projected to increase significantly by the year 2000. \nThis development will almost certainly lead to further escalation of \njuvenile crimes and arrests.\n  Colorado is not alone. Experts say most urban areas will see a rise \nin youth violence, stemming from poverty, lack of educational \nopportunities, the growing number of single-parent families and the \nillegal use of firearms.\n\n  Add to that a profound demographic change. Current trends indicate \nthere will be a dramatic increase in the population of 10- to 17-year-\nolds over the next several years. According to the Department of \nJustice, murders by kids in this age group rose 124 percent from 1986 \nto 1991.\n  In Denver alone, it is estimated that there are currently 7,000 gang \nmembers, up from about 700 3 years ago.\n  In 1994, I took to the streets in the gang-infested areas of Denver \nto meet with and listen to several gang members to find out why they \ngot involved in gangs and how hard it is to leave. They told me that \nthe biggest part of the problem is kids who are looking for some kind \nof identity, companionship, and affiliation they are not getting \nelsewhere.\n  Also, these kids realize the solution to gangs and violence can only \ncome through self-help. But getting through to these kids is a problem. \nAfter listening to them, I shared with them my experiences as a kid who \nfrequently found himself in trouble with the law and also as a young \nman employed as a counselor to work with inmates confined at both San \nQuentin and Folsom prisons. Their response was ``how do they move from \ntheir current situation to becoming a productive member of society''? \nThey can see both points, but haven't figured out a strategy for \nbridging that gap.\n  I feel that putting offenders in jail is a priority, but equally \nimportant is the ability to take a broader approach, focusing on kids \nand families, court diversion programs and prison alternatives.\n  Recently, members of my staff met with the Chief of the Denver Police \nDepartment, all of his Division Chiefs, the Executive Director of the \nColorado Department of Public Safety, and the Director of the Youthful \nOffender System.\n  All of these leaders agree that prevention efforts must begin at an \nearly age--before the first stolen car or the first drive by shooting. \nColorado spends an estimated $50,000 per juvenile on incarceration. \nSome of those funds need to go toward prevention.\n  In Denver, there are 10 high schools and 18 middle schools that have \nfrequent police calls to the school itself or the surrounding area. \nThere is one exception. . .Lake Middle School, which has one uniformed \nDenver police officer on duty during school hours. This is not a \nMcGruff or an officer friendly. This is a real officer that makes sure \nthat the school is not disrupted by negative activity. This initiative \nhas tangible results and it would be nice to see one officer in the \nother 27 schools.\n  That is just one example of how prevention efforts that focus on \nyouth are having a positive effect in my State. There are many more in \nColorado and nationwide that deserve our support.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I know there are no easy answers, but I \nthink that if we take the time to listen, we very well may begin to \nunderstand the problem. I am committed to finding solutions to gangs \nand youth violence, and look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthese problems. One step is to provide sufficient support during the \nfiscal year 1997 budget process. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport passage of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this amendment puts the Senate on record in \nsupport of funding for programs that help young people stay off drugs \nand avoid crime and violence. It also commits the Senate to evaluating \nall crime prevention and eliminating duplication of services among \nthese programs. In short, this is a clear, concise statement that we \nsupport doing what works in preventing crime and we oppose bureaucratic \nduplication. This is a sensible approach to prevention that we think \nall Senators can support.\n  While we work toward a balanced budget this week--a goal that I \nstrongly support--we must not neglect our obligations to protect our \ncitizens from crime. And as any law enforcement official will tell you, \npart of that fight must include efforts to help at-risk youth avoid a \nlife of crime. It makes sense to support prisons and police because we \nmust protect our communities. But we have clear evidence that many \nprevention efforts can and do turn young people around, reduce juvenile \ncrime and delinquency, and stop crime in the first place. We should be \nsupporting those efforts, too.\n  While we should fund these effective measures, we should also gather \nmore information on what works, so this amendment commits the Senate to \nsupporting rigorous evaluation of existing prevention programs. And \nfinally, we must do a better job of coordinating prevention programs, \neliminating duplication, and streamlining the Federal bureaucracy.\n  A bipartisan Senate has repeatedly supported crime prevention \nfunding, yet funding has then been cut during House-Senate conferences. \nAs we begin our efforts for fiscal year 1997, I am hopeful that the \nfull Senate will once again speak out on behalf of America's at-risk \nyouth, and commit to giving them the help they need to steer clear of \ncrime and delinquency.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senator Campbell for his leadership \nand hard work on behalf of America's young people and in support of \ncrime prevention--not only on this amendment, but throughout his tenure \nin the Senate. I look forward to working with him to see that the \nSenate follows through on the commitments contained in this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the amendment. We are willing \nto accept it.\n  Mr. EXON. We are willing to accept the amendment, Mr. President.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. If there be no \nfurther debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3993) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3994\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the use of \n           budgetary savings in the mandatory spending area)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. This \nhas to do with a sense of the Senate regarding the use of budgetary \nsavings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Ms. \n     Moseley-Braun, for herself and Mr. Simon, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3994.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following new section:\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE USE OF BUDGETARY \n                   SAVINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in August of 1994, the Bipartisan Commission on \n     Entitlement and Tax Reform issued an Interim Report to the \n     President, which found that, ``To ensure that today's debt \n     and spending commitments do not unfairly burden America's \n     children, the Government must act now. A bipartisan coalition \n     of Congress, led by the President, must resolve the long-term \n     imbalance between the Government's entitlement promises and \n     the funds it will have available to pay for them'';\n       (2) unless the Congress and the President act together in a \n     bipartisan way, overall Federal spending is projected by the \n     Commission to rise from the current level of slightly over 22 \n     percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United States \n     (hereafter in this section referred as ``GDP'') to over 37 \n     percent of GDP by the year 2030;\n       (3) the source of that growth is not domestic discretionary \n     spending, which is approximately the same portion of GDP now \n     as it was in 1969, the last time at which the Federal budget \n     was in balance;\n       (4) mandatory spending was only 29.6 percent of the Federal \n     budget in 1963, but is estimated to account for 72 percent of \n     the Federal budget in the year 2003;\n       (5) social security, medicare and medicaid, together with \n     interest on the national debt, are the largest sources of the \n     growth of mandatory spending;\n       (6) ensuring the long-term future of the social security \n     system is essential to protecting the retirement security of \n     the American people;\n       (7) the Social Security Trust Fund is projected to begin \n     spending more than it takes in by approximately the year \n     2013, with Federal budget deficits rising rapidly thereafter \n     unless appropriate policy changes are made;\n       (8) ensuring the future of medicare and medicaid is \n     essential to protecting access to high-quality health care \n     for senior citizens and poor women and children;\n       (9) Federal health care expenses have been rising at double \n     digit rates, and are projected to triple to 11 percent of GDP \n     by the year 2030 unless appropriate policy changes are made; \n     and\n       (10) due to demographic factors, Federal health care \n     expenses are projected to double by the year 2030, even if \n     health care cost inflation is restrained after 1999, so that \n     costs for each person of a given age grow no faster than the \n     economy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that budget savings in the mandatory spending area should be \n     used--\n       (1) to protect and enhance the retirement security of the \n     American people by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     social security system;\n       (2) to protect and enhance the health care security of \n     senior citizens and poor Americans by ensuring the long-term \n     future of medicare and medicaid; and\n       (3) to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline, to \n     ensure that the level of private investment necessary for \n     long-term economic growth and prosperity is available.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, both Democrats and Republicans \nagree that the Federal budget should be balanced by the year 2002. \nThere is complete bipartisan agreement on that point, and there is \ncomplete agreement between the Congress and the President. \nUnfortunately for the American people, however, that is where the \nagreement ends. There is no agreement on how to balance the budget.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to repeat the \nmistakes both sides have made in the last few years. Given what is at \nstake, both for our country's future generally, and for individual \nAmericans and American families all across this country, we have a \nresponsibility and an obligation to work together to address these core \nissues.\n  There should be no doubt what is at stake, and why addressing our \nbudget problems is so important. One measure that demonstrates just how \nfundamentally important these budget issues are is our national savings \nrate. Private savings in America as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct has been declining for decades. In the 1960-69 period, it was \n8.3 percent. By the 1990-93 period, however, it declined to only 5.2 \npercent.\n  What is even worse is the huge increase in the percentage of our \nnational savings being consumed by Government deficit. In the 1960-69 \nperiod, only two-tenths of 1 percent of our total national savings went \nto finance Government deficits. By the 1990-93 period, however, fully \n3.5 percent of our national GDP went to fund Government deficits, \nleaving only 1.7 percent to fund new jobs, and the growth in \nproductivity upon which the wealth and standard of living of every \nAmerican ultimately depends.\n  And the impact of our failure to come to grips with our deficits is \nnot just a macro-economic issue. It is not something to be left to \neconomists and policymakers. The daily life of every American is \ndirectly affected by this set of issues. There are no other issues that \nwill have a larger impact on the kind of life each and every one of us \nlives than this one.\n  The cover story in this month's the Atlantic Monthly by Peter \nPeterson entitled ``Social Insecurity: Unless We Act Now, the Aging of \nAmerica Will Become an Economic Problem that Dwarfs All Other National \nIssues'' makes that point very well, and it also illustrates the \nproblem we have to overcome. The article's preface states, in part, \nthat ``the long gray wave of Baby Boomers retiring could lead to an \nall-engulfing economic crisis * * * Yet politicians of both parties say \nthat most of the urgently necessary reforms are `off the table.' ''\n  It seems to me, however, that every option has to be on the table, \nand that Democrats and Republicans, and the Congress and the President, \nhave to work together--first to tell the truth to the American people \nabout the causes of our long-term budget problem, and second, to come \ntogether to solve that problem in a way that makes sense for America. I \ndon't suggest that this issue is above politics. What I do believe, \nhowever, is that this issue is so important that the only way to solve \nit is to invoke an old Chicago adage--good Government is good politics.\n  During the last Congress, I served on the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform, the so-called Kerrey-Danforth Commission. \nUnfortunately, last year's budget battle did not begin to come to grips \nwith the implications of the work of that Commission, even though an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority of the Commissioners were in complete \nagreement on the long-term budget threats we face, and the causes of \nthose threats.\n  The basic problem identified by the Commission was a simple one. The \ncurrent budget trend the Federal government is on is completely \nunsustainable. Unless we act--soon--we face a future where the size of \nGovernment explodes. The portion of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States consumed by the Federal Government will rise from \napproximately 21.4 percent of GDP in 1995 to over 37 percent of GDP by \nthe year 2030.\n  Looking at percentages of GDP may seem somewhat abstract to some. It \nmight be useful, therefore, to think about what that figure might mean \nfor the Federal Government and Federal deficits if we translate those \npercentages into the fiscal year 1995 Federal budget.\n  In fiscal 1995, the Federal Government spent approximately $1.5 \ntrillion. If that year's budget took up 37 percent of GDP, as the \nCommission forecast for 2030, total fiscal year 1995 spending for the \nFederal Government would have been over $1.15 trillion higher, or $2.65 \ntrillion. The Federal deficit would explode from the $163 billion \nactually reported in fiscal 1995 to over $1.3 trillion.\n  Think about that. The Federal deficit, under this scenario, would \namount to almost 87 percent of the total amount the Federal Government \nactually spent in fiscal 1995.\n  Of course, the budget could never actually get to that point; the \nFederal Government would go bankrupt long before then. That, however, \nis where current trends take us. The question is what drives those \ntrends; what are the underlying problems we have to face.\n  Looking at Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, one might think that \ndomestic discretionary spending--programs like education, and \ntransportation, and environment--are responsible for those trends. \nAfter all, over 50 percent of the net deficit reduction proposed in the \nbudget resolution comes from domestic discretionary spending.\n  Domestic discretionary spending, however is not the force driving \nbudget deficits--either now or in the future. In fact, as a percentage \nof GDP, domestic discretionary spending is lower now than it was in the \n1970's and only slightly higher than it was in the 1960's. What is \nresponsible is mandatory spending. Mandatory spending--principally \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, and interest \non the national debt--has increased from about 6 percent of GDP in 1962 \nto well over 11 percent now. And it is projected to almost triple to \nabout 32 percent of GDP by the year 2030.\n  Mandatory spending is steadily squeezing out discretionary spending,\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\nrising from about 29.6 percent of the total Federal budget in 1963 to \nabout 61.4 percent of the budget in 1993. And it is projected to \naccount for fully 72 percent of the overall budget by the year 2003.\n  It is mandatory spending and the factors driving it upward, \ntherefore, not discretionary spending--not the programs Congress \nappropriates every year--that must be the focus of our attention. And \nthat means we have to look at two core issues: rising health care \ncosts, and demographics.\n  Federal health care costs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, are \nprojected to more than triple as a percentage of GDP by 2030. By that \nyear, Medicare and Medicaid alone would consume more than $11 out of \nevery $100 our economy generates.\n  Even more devastating than health care cost inflation, however, is \ndemographics. Health care expenses also illustrate that point. The \nEntitlement Commission found that even if Congress and the President \ncan bring health care cost inflation under control, health care costs \nwill double as a percentage of GDP by the year 2030.\n  The simple fact is America is getting older. In 1980, there were five \nworking Americans for every Social Security beneficiary. By the year \n2030, there will be less than two. Americans are now living much longer \nthan they did in 1935 when Social Security began. The average life \nexpectancy was 61.4 years then. It is 75.8 years now, and it is \nprojected to be 78.4 years by 2025. In 1935, the life expectancy of a \nperson reaching the age of 65 was 12.6 years. Now it is 17.5 years, and \nby 2025, it will be 18.8 years.\n  The most fundamental budget issue, therefore, is this issue of \ndemographics. When the baby boom generation begins to hit retirement \nage in a little more than a decade from now, Federal entitlement \ncosts--the demands on Social Security and Medicare--will really begin \nto explode.\n  Unless we begin to act now, by 2030, when all the boomers will have \nreached 65, Social Security alone will be running an annual cash \ndeficit of $766 billion. If Medicare HI is included; the combined cash \ndeficit of these two programs, in other words their spending minus the \npayroll taxes supporting them, will be $1.7 trillion by 2030.\n  The Federal Government has essentially promised to pay today's adults \n$8.3 trillion in future Social Security benefits over and above the \ncontributions they and their employers have made--a figure more than \n250 times as great as all the unfunded liabilities of all private \nsector pension plans in the United States.\n  Unless we begin to face this looming challenge now, the taxes \nrequired to support Medicare and Medicaid would be in the range of 35 \nto 55 per cent of every worker's paycheck by 2040.\n  Mr. President, the budget problems I have discussed are a threat to \nthe retirement and health security of virtually every American. The \nneed for action now is compelling, for reasons related to Government \nfinance, for reasons related to our economic prosperity generally, and \nmost importantly, for reasons related to the lives of the American \npeople, and the kind of retirement they will enjoy.\n  We need to face our budget problems, and we need to act in ways that \nwill enhance the retirement security of Americans. Most Americans do \nnot currently have the resources to provide for their own retirement \nsecurity through savings. In fact, in 1993, half of all American \nfamilies had less than $1,000 in net financial assets, and that figure \nhas not changed in the past decade.\n  What we need, therefore, is a bipartisan approach to the budget, one \nbased on these underlying budget realities. We need to tell the truth \nto the American people about what the Government needs to do, and what \nthey need to do, to protect their retirement and health security. And \nwe need a budget that is focused on retirement security, on health \nsecurity, and on rebuilding our national savings rate.\n  That is what the amendment I am offering today attempts to do. By \nadopting this amendment, the Senate will be saying that it believes \nthat budget savings in the mandatory part of the budget should be used:\n  First, to promote and enhance the retirement security of the American \npeople by ensuring the long-term future of the Social Security system;\n  Second, to promote and enhance the health care security of senior \ncitizens and poor Americans by ensuring the long term future of \nMedicare and Medicaid; and\n  Third, to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline to ensure \nthat the level of private investment necessary for long term economic \ngrowth and prosperity is available.\n  What this amendment is all about is the connections between issues. \nWe cannot deal with retirement and health security if we do not tell \nthe American people the truth about our entitlement problems, and tell \nthem early enough so that they can act to help themselves. We cannot \nprotect Social Security and Medicare if we do not ensure that Americans \nunderstand the linkages between tax policy and their health and \nretirement security. We cannot invest in other priorities of Americans, \nlike education, if discretionary spending is squeezed out of the budget \naltogether by mandatory spending. And we cannot raise the national \nsavings rate if we do not focus on restoring long-term, not just \ntemporary, budget discipline.\n  The time to start is now. The time to tell the American people is \nnow. The time to come together in a bipartisan attempt to face these \nproblems and to address them is now.\n  This amendment is in no way an answer to the budget problems we face. \nIt is, however, a demonstration of our understanding of our core budget \nproblems, and our understanding of the impact these problems will have \non the lives of the American people unless we act based on their \npriorities. I believe their priorities Americans want us to focus on \nare protecting retirement and health security, and raising our national \nsavings rate by restoring real, long-term budget discipline. Those are \nmy priorities. I hope all of my colleagues share those priorities, and \nwill demonstrate that support by voting for this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield all time we have in opposition to the \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield our time on this side.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3994) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from New Mexico, and I certainly \nappreciate and thank my friend from Nevada for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nevada is charged \nagainst the time of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the two managers of the bill, I \nappreciate their moving this legislation along. I spoke on the floor \nyesterday about my concern about not having ample opportunity in normal \nworking hours to debate this. That has been worked out. I extend my \nappreciation to the leadership on both sides of the aisle for that.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3990\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise the Senator from \nNevada when he has spoken 18 minutes.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, this is a beautiful publication about \nthe Great Basin National Park. It has wonderful pictures, color \npictures of a wonderful national resource. The oldest living things in \nthe world are in the Great Basin National Park, it has bristlecone \npines that are over 5,000 years old. This park has a glacier, it has \nthe Lehman Caves, which are subterranean caves with stalactites and \nother features that are found only in caves throughout the United \nStates. It is a wonderful park.\n  But, for the beautiful pictures that you see and the description I \ngave, it does not portray what is behind the scenes, the story behind \nthe scenes.\n  Our national parks have become deplorable. The Presiding Officer is \nfrom a wonderful, beautiful sister State, a border State of the State \nof Nevada. I had the opportunity last year, for the first time in my \nlife, to float down the beautiful Colorado River through the Grand \nCanyon. The scenery on that trip was beautiful, however, the other\n\n[[Page S5235]]\n\npart of the trip was seeing the other conditions they have in the park.\n  I have to say, the average visitor does not see the deplorable \nconditions at Great Basin National Park or the Grand Canyon National \nPark where the park rangers must live. In many of these parks, and \nGrand Canyon is no different, the conditions in those parks where the \nemployees live are unbelievable and embarrassing. More than half the \nNational Park Service housing units are currently rated substandard.\n  Why do I talk about this? I talk about this because the underlying \nbudget that we are being asked to approve decimates environmental \nprograms.\n  What this amendment of Senator Kerry's does is restore $7.3 billion \nfor environmental programs, providing full funding at levels requested \nby the President for the EPA, the National Park Service, and other \nenvironmental agencies of the Federal Government.\n  I am going to speak today about the National Park Service. That does \nnot take away the importance of restoring moneys to other units, but \nthe National Park Service is in deplorable condition. In many cases, \nPark Service employees and their spouses and children are at physical \nrisk in the substandard housing they have. This poor state of housing \nis considered, without question, a serious morale problem in many of \nthe parks. How can we expect these hard-working--and they have become \neven harder working in recent years because we are so understaffed--\nthese hard-working men and women of the National Park Service to take \ncare of the land if we do not, in effect, take care of them?\n  These men and women love their jobs. They are park rangers because \nthey have chosen that for their life's occupation, and they put up with \nthese substandard conditions and substandard housing units, working in \nthese beautiful outdoor areas. But they should not have to.\n  The current National Park Service maintenance backlog is $4.5 billion \nand continues to grow each day that goes by. With the reduction \nproposed in this budget, our National Park Service will simply decay \nmore. The infrastructure will deteriorate, and the ability to conserve \nthese precious natural resources will decrease.\n  Managers of the park systems have already closed various areas of the \nparks around the country, and they are contemplating closing more, \nbecause they do not have money to keep them up. Maintenance will fall \nfurther and further behind as our parks continue to deteriorate.\n  In fiscal year 1996, the Interior Subcommittee took the largest \npercentage hit of any subcommittee in the entire Senate. This budget \nproposes to exacerbate the damage done by last year's cut. We should be \nworking on a bipartisan basis to protect our environment. We should \ncome here and talk about what is happening to the environment. The \nenvironment is being hit too hard. The environmental programs, in years \ngone by, have been bipartisan programs, going back many, many years to \none of the leading environmentalists of our day, Theodore Roosevelt.\n  President Roosevelt, the father of our national parks, once said, \n``To waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the \nland instead of using it so as to increase its usefulness, will result \nin undermining in the days of our children the very prosperity which we \nought by right to hand down to them amplified and developed.''\n  The spending cuts proposed in this budget would, instead of \namplifying and developing, as President Roosevelt, the father of our \nNational Park System, said, would result in the erosion of conditions \nin our National Park System. This underlying budget will not help. It \nwill hurt our National Park System. This proposed budget strays from \nPresident Roosevelt's passion for the grandeur of our environment by \nattempting to gut national park funding. It would reverse the \nlongstanding support by the citizens of this Nation to the continued \npreservation and protection of the national parks.\n\n  Mr. President, I worked to get a national park in the State of Nevada \nand was able to do so. We were so proud as a State to have a national \npark. We were on the map for national parks. When people travel to \nnational parks, they have a route they take. Nevada became part of \nthat. It became a bridge from the States of Arizona and Utah which have \nall kinds of national parks. We have one in Nevada.\n  Certainly, we have not been able to build a visitors center, and I \ncan understand that, but certain things that need to be done for the \npeople who visit that park should be done.\n  Underlying all that is where the people at Great Basin National Park \nwork, where they have to live. It is in a remote area. They live in \nplaces that I would not recommend. But there are other examples. In the \nState of Nevada, there are examples. We have not only a national park, \nbut we have the National Park Service which takes care of the Lake Mead \nRecreational Area.\n  The busiest entity in our National Park System is Lake Mead. Over 10 \nmillion people visited last year at Lake Mead. We have many problems at \nLake Mead. We have an antiquated water treatment system. The State of \nNevada inspected the park's water treatment facilities and notified the \npark that because of surface water facility deficiencies, that the \nwater supplied to areas of the park ``pose an acute risk to human \nhealth.''\n  This occurred at the busiest park entity we have. As a result, the \npark had to post signs that visitors should boil the water before \ndrinking. This is a national travesty for a park that received over 10 \nmillion visitors last year. As a result of the current budget \nproposals, it may take longer than 10 years before this problem is \ncorrected. I am going to try as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee to get some money in that system to take care of this \nembarrassing problem.\n  There are other examples in Lake Mead. If the current budget \nproposals are enacted, we have been told we are going to eliminate air, \nboat and vehicular patrols, resulting in increased resource \ndegradation, reduced emergency response and increased risk of injuries \nand fatalities.\n  Mr. President, Lake Mead is located about 15 miles, at most, from Las \nVegas. It is a 24-hour city. Lake Mead has become a 24-hour resource. \nPeople go down there all times of the night and day. We need law \nenforcement, which is being eliminated or reduced. We need vehicle \npatrols, both by land and water.\n  If this budget proposal goes through, we have been told we are going \nto eliminate park ambulance services, we are going to reduce water-\nquality monitoring, we are going to reduce daytime and weekend patrols, \neliminate night shifts. I have already indicated we cannot do this. \nThis is a 24-hour park. This will result, of course, if this budget \nreduction goes forward, in reduced visitor safety and an increase in \ncrimes and vandalism in this park. That is wrong.\n  Reduction in the number of toilets and campgrounds open to the public \nis being talked about, and I worked very hard to have those increased. \nWe have a number of areas where we have toilets that can be taken to \nimpacted areas on special tourist traffic weekends. They are talking \nabout reducing them. They are talking about closing areas of the park.\n  This is happening all over the United States. I am more familiar, of \ncourse, with Lake Mead. At Independence National Historic Park, they \nare talking about the same thing as Lake Mead, and the same thing at \nYosemite.\n  From Nevada we are close to Yosemite. We consider it, even though it \nis in California, part ours. But for Yosemite, Mr. President, they are \ntalking about closing some of those campgrounds, resulting in a \nreduction in overnight stays of more than a million visitor nights. \nThey are talking about a reduction in regular maintenance, resulting in \nthe accelerated collapse of infrastructure.\n  OSHA and other compliance citations will be inevitable. Visitor \nprotection services will be reduced, resulting in increased visitor \nfatigue, resource damage and employee injury due to fatigue. We are \ntalking about a cutback in snow removal, and at Yosemite, a reduction \nin cultural staff.\n  Mr. President, these parks--and that is all I am talking about today \nis our National Park System--they are a national treasure. These parks \nbelong to all Americans. We, as stewards of these parks, have no right \nto take these treasures from them.\n  In the short term, this proposal would save money. It is penny-wise \nand\n\n[[Page S5236]]\n\npound-foolish and in the long run it will cost us money. The result in \nthis budget will be to increase maintenance costs in the future. Over \nthe long run it would lead to irreversible consequences and irrevocably \ndamage the Nation's heritage.\n  The effect of this budget will result in outcomes immediately visible \nto the public, Mr. President, such as deferred maintenance, extensive \nclosing of campgrounds and other visitor facilities, it would reduce \nvisitor protection services, and cut back in the number of and types of \ntours, all over the United States. We can and we must find other \nsavings in our quest to reduce the Federal deficit. We have done that.\n  What this underlying amendment will do is reduce corporate welfare in \nexchange for putting this money back into environmental programs. It \ndefies common sense to think that Congress will fund a tax cut at the \nexpense of our national parks.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow that to happen. The amendment that we \nare offering would increase funding for the National Park Service by \nabout $1.1 billion, the amendment that is included in the Kerry \namendment. This is important. It would restore the National Park \nService funding to the level of the President's budget. It would be \noffset, as I have indicated, by a reduction in tax loopholes. The \nnational parks are one of the great legacies which we leave to our \nchildren.\n  Let us make sure that we do not leave them a legacy in disrepair and \ndecay. We owe them, Mr. President, better than that. The natural \nwonders of these national parks are a gift from powers higher than \nCongress. What we do with them is our gift to our children. In the \nearly part of this century, President Teddy Roosevelt galvanized this \nNation's efforts to preserve America's heritage by setting aside \nthousands of acres as national parks. The time has come for this body \nto galvanize support again for continuing to preserve this natural \nlegacy.\n\n  Mr. President, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, \nthis is something we should work together on. This is important. The \npeople--the people--want this. We just cannot let this embarrassment \ncontinue, the degradation of our National Park System. I have talked \nabout how it impacts Nevada.\n  We have one park in Nevada, and a few entities within the park \nsystem. The States of Utah, New Mexico, California, States all over the \neastern and western seaboards have national parks. They are falling \napart just like that one park in the State of Nevada. We are a new \npark. Some of the parks are suffering even more than we are. There are \nother parks, there are entities in the park system like Lake Mead.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, over 10 million people visited that park \nlast year. It is overutilized and we certainly do not give it enough \nhelp with the resources to maintain it in a way that we should be proud \nof.\n  So I hope that we in a bipartisan effort can support this amendment. \nWe were in the environmental battles last year, some of which led to \nthe closure of the Government. We do not need that again. This is \nsomething we should do in the spirit of bipartisanship and a spirit of \ntaking care of these great natural wonders that were originally \ndeveloped, conceptually by a Republican President, Teddy Roosevelt.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Arizona takes the \nfloor, I ask unanimous consent that Amy Lueders, a congressional \nfellow, be allowed the privilege of the floor during the remainder of \nthe debate on this budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes amendment \n     numbered 3995.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SUPERMAJORITY \n                   REQUIREMENT FOR RAISING TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's current tax system is indefensible, being \n     overly complex, burdensome, and severely limiting to economic \n     opportunity for all Americans;\n       (2) fundamental tax reform should be undertaken as soon as \n     practicable to produce a tax system that is fairer, flatter, \n     and simpler; that promotes, rather than punishes, job \n     creation; that eliminates unnecessary paperwork burdens on \n     America's businesses; that recognizes the fact that families \n     are performing the most important work of our society; that \n     provides incentives for Americans who save for the future in \n     order to build a better life for themselves and their \n     families; that allows Americans, especially the middle class, \n     to keep more of what they earn, but that raises enough money \n     to fund a leaner, more efficient Federal Government; and that \n     allows Americans to compute their taxes easily; and\n       (3) the stability and longevity of any new tax system \n     designed to achieve these goals should be guaranteed with a \n     supermajority vote requirement so that Congress cannot easily \n     raise tax rates, impose new taxes, or otherwise increase the \n     amount of a taxpayer's income that is subject to tax.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this concurrent resolution on the budget assumes \n     fundamental tax reform should be accompanied by a proposal to \n     amend the Constitution of the United States to require a \n     supermajority vote in each House of Congress to approve tax \n     increases.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment which \nexpresses the sense of the Senate regarding a supermajority for the \nraising of taxes. It essentially says that once the Congress has \nachieved fundamental tax reform we would then move to the adoption of a \nresolution proposing to the States a constitutional amendment that \nwould require a supermajority to raise taxes.\n  The budget resolution that is before us now projects that revenues to \nthe Treasury will rise from $1.42 trillion in 1996 to $1.85 trillion in \nthe year 2002. That is an increase of $430 billion or about 30 percent \nby the end of that 6-year period, an increase that is attributable \nprimarily to economic growth since the budget resolution assumes no new \ntaxes.\n  In fact, the increasing revenue figures actually factor in the effect \nof the $500 per child tax credit for families. Even taking into account \nthe tax changes, revenues to the Treasury will continue to grow. What \nall of this means is that we can achieve a balanced budget without new \ntaxes. We can do it by limiting spending, and pursuing tax policies \nthat promote economic growth and opportunity.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution recommends the kind of change \nthat people have been demanding: more responsible spending, tax relief, \nand progress toward a balanced budget. And yet it represents only part \nof the change that the people have been seeking. Fundamental tax reform \nrepresents the second part of the equation.\n  By the time that Americans had filed their income tax returns on \nApril 15, they had spent about 1.7 billion hours on tax-related \npaperwork. That is according to Internal Revenue Service estimates, and \nthey should know. Business spent another 3.4 billion hours. According \nto the Tax Foundation, the cost of compliance will approach $200 \nbillion.\n  If that is not evidence that our Tax Code is one of the most \ninefficient and wasteful ever created, I do not know what is. Money and \neffort that could have been put to productive use solving problems in \nour communities, putting Americans to work, putting food on the table, \nor investing in the Nation's future are instead devoted to wasteful \npaperwork.\n  It is no wonder that the American people are frustrated and angry and \nthat they are demanding real change in the way that Washington taxes \nand spends.\n  Mr. President, I am offering this amendment today with two objectives \nin mind. First, to put the Senate on record with regard to the need for \nfundamental tax reform and, second, and perhaps even more important, to \nput Senators on record with regard to the\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\nconcept of a supermajority requirement for raising taxes.\n  Last month the House of Representatives considered the tax limitation \namendment, a proposed amendment to the Constitution to require a two-\nthirds vote to raise taxes. The measure was similar, though not \nidentical, to Senate Joint Resolution 49 which I introduced earlier \nthis year.\n  The Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee held a \nhearing on my proposal on Tax Day, April 15. I hope it will be \nscheduled for action by the full Senate later this year.\n  The amendment I am offering today, however, merely deals with the \nconcept of a tax limitation, something that is important whether \nfundamental tax reform succeeds or not, but which takes on added \nsignificance and importance if tax reform results in the elimination of \nmost of the deductions, exemptions, and credits in which taxpayers find \nsome refuge from high tax rates today.\n  Deductions, exemptions, and credits have less significance if one low \nrate is applied to income. But without a supermajority requirement for \nraising taxes, people would be particularly vulnerable to any changes \nthat Congress might make in a new single rate income tax or sales tax. \nA supermajority requirement for raising taxes would make it much harder \nfor Congress to increase the burden on taxpayers after fundamental tax \nreform has been accomplished. That is, I believe, both appropriate and \nnecessary.\n  In fact, Mr. President, a supermajority requirement for raising taxes \nwas recommended by the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax \nReform appointed by Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich. The \ncommission, which was chaired by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, \nadvocated a supermajority requirement in its recent report on how to \nachieve a simpler single rate tax to replace the existing maze of tax \nrates, deductions, exemptions, and credits that makes up the Federal \nincome tax as we know it today.\n\n  Here is what the Kemp commission report said:\n\n       The roller-coaster ride of tax policy in the past few \n     decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility of \n     real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with \n     Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of \n     the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger \n     when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in less than 7 \n     years. The commission believes that a two-thirds \n     supermajority vote of Congress will earn Americans' \n     confidence in the longevity, predictability and the stability \n     of any new tax system.\n\n  Mr. President, ideally, a tax limitation should be put into place \nafter this comprehensive tax reform that is recommended by the Kemp \nCommission is accomplished. That is because tax reform necessarily aims \nto broaden the tax base and then apply one low rate to whatever amount \nof income is left. Because base broadening would be subject to a \nsupermajority vote under the proposed constitutional amendment, some \nare concerned it could make comprehensive tax reform more difficult to \nachieve. In fact, that is correct.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment which I am offering today takes \ninto consideration that particular concern, recommending that a \nsupermajority requirement would occur in the context of fundamental tax \nreform. In other words, only after fundamental tax reform had been \nachieved.\n  As I said before, however, a tax limit is needed whether tax reform \nsucceeds or not. There is no small irony in the fact it will take a \ntwo-thirds majority vote of both the House and the Senate to overcome \nPresident Clinton's veto and enact last year's Balanced Budget Act with \nits tax relief provisions. By contrast, the President's record-setting \ntax increase of 1993 was enacted with only a simple majority--and not \neven a majority of elected Senators at that. The Vice President had to \nbreak a tie of 50-50 to secure passage of the tax increase bill in the \nSenate.\n  The idea of a tax limitation is based on a simple premise: It ought \nto be at least as hard to raise people's taxes as it is to cut them. \nWhat we are attempting to do here is to force Members of Congress to \nthink of tax increases not as a first resort but as a last resort. A \ntax limitation will make it harder to raise taxes, of course. But \nperhaps more than that, it will force Congress to fundamentally assess \nthe ways it goes about raising revenues.\n  Mr. President, this is perhaps the most important thing I have to say \nthis morning. We should remember that the amendment does not limit \nrevenues to the Treasury; it merely precludes tax rate increases \nwithout a supermajority vote. There is a reason for this. Most of us \nwould agree that lower tax rates stimulate the economy, resulting in \nmore taxable income, more taxable transactions and, therefore, more \nrevenue to the Treasury. Lower tax rates, within limits, end up \nproducing more revenue to the Treasury. So it matters how we raise \nrevenues. Do we do it by trying to raise taxes or do we do it \nparadoxically, by lowering taxes? The latter is obviously preferable.\n  The tax cuts of the early 1980's are a case in point. They spawned \nthe longest peacetime expansion of our economy in the Nation's history. \nRevenues to the Treasury increased as a result, from $599.3 billion in \nfiscal year 1981 to $990.7 billion in fiscal year 1989, up 65 percent. \nRevenues to the Treasury during those Reagan years increased \nsubstantially with tax rate reductions. That is the way we should raise \nthe revenues that fund Federal programs.\n  High tax rates, on the other hand, discourage work and production and \nsavings and investment. So there is ultimately less activity, less \neconomic activity, to tax. That is precisely what Martin Feldstein, the \nformer chair of the President's Council on Economic Advisers, found \nwhen he looked at the effect of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase. \nHe found that taxpayers responded to the sharply higher marginal tax \nrates imposed by the Clinton tax bill by reducing their taxable incomes \nby nearly $25 billion. They did that by saving less, investing less, \nand creating fewer jobs. The economy eventually paid the price in terms \nof slower growth.\n\n  It is interesting to note that revenues, as a percentage of the gross \ndomestic product, have actually fluctuated around a very narrow band: \n18 to 20 percent of the GDP for the last 40 years. In fact, revenues \namounted to about 19 percent of GDP when the top marginal income tax \nrate was in the 90 percent range in the 1950's, and they also amounted \nto just under 19 percent when the top marginal rate was in the 28 \npercent range in the 1980's.\n  Now, why the consistency? Mr. President, this is the most important \npoint I want to make. Why do revenues to the Federal Treasury stay \nconstant at about 19 percent of the GDP, whether tax rates are 90 \npercent or 28 percent? It seems counterintuitive. Why is it so? It is \nbecause tax rate changes have a greater effect on how well or how poor \nthe economy performs than they do on the amount of revenue that flows \nto the Treasury relative to the GDP. In other words, how Congress taxes \nis more important than how much it taxes. The key is whether tax policy \nfosters economic growth and opportunity, measured in GDP, or results in \na smaller and weaker economy.\n  The point is this: 19 percent of a larger GDP represents far more \nrevenue to the Treasury and is, therefore, preferable to 19 percent of \na smaller GDP. We raise revenues for the Federal Government not by \nraising marginal tax rates, but by reducing them. It is a paradox, but \nit is true.\n  Requiring a supermajority vote for tax increases is, I think, sound \npolicy. It is not a new idea. It is an idea this has already been tried \nand tested in a dozen States across the country. In 1992, an \noverwhelming majority of the voters of my home State of Arizona, 72 \npercent, approved an amendment to the State's constitution requiring a \ntwo-thirds majority vote for tax increases. There is a reason that the \nidea has been so popular in Arizona and other States. Tax limits work. \nAccording to a 1994 study by the Cato Institute, a family of four in \nStates with tax and expenditure limits faces a State tax burden that \nwas $650 lower, on average, 5 years after implementation than it would \nhave been if the State tax growth had not been slowed.\n  Tax limitation works. It will force Congress to be smarter about how \nit raises revenue. It will force Congress to look to economic growth to \nraise revenue instead of simply increasing tax rates, which does not \nwork, anyway. It will protect taxpayers from additional rate increases.\n  I encourage my colleagues when we have the opportunity, I presume on\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\nTuesday, to support this simple sense-of-the-Senate amendment, to \nsupport the concept of tax limitation, to in effect, say, when we have \nachieved fundamental tax reform, then we should require a supermajority \nto raise the taxes.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude this part of the discussion on the \nmore general subject of the budget that is before the Senate. As I \nsaid, relative to the amendment I am proposing here, revenues to the \nTreasury depend more on whether we have a healthy economy, whether we \nare conducting Government in a way to encourage growth, investment and \nsavings, than it does on whether we are raising tax rates. What the \nbudget that has been presented by the Republican Budget Committee has \ndone here is to work in several ways toward that goal, to foster \neconomic growth and investment, and, therefore, opportunity.\n  I want to begin by commending the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nthe Senator from New Mexico, and the members of his committee, for \nproducing a budget which balances and, as I will note later, as a \nresult of which quickly puts more money into the pockets of Americans, \nhelping to stimulate this economic growth that I have been speaking of. \nIt not only achieves balance, but it adheres to the schedule that we \nestablished last year for eliminating the budget deficit by the year \n2002. And I would also note that the progress that we have made since \nlast year is really quite extraordinary. It might be assumed by the \ngeneral public, watching the machinations in the Congress and the \nPresident's vetoes and gridlock reported by the media, that nothing has \nbeen accomplished. But the fact of the matter is, a lot of money has \nbeen saved, and $23 billion, or 9 percent, has been cut from domestic \nspending levels. And even more could have been saved had Congress not \nbeen forced to add back $5 billion to satisfy President Clinton's \ndemands for more spending, and to ensure that he would sign the final \nbudget for 1996 into law.\n\n  But the point is that, with our efforts of last year, as \ncontroversial as they were, as contentious as they were, as much as the \nPresident made us put back money because he wanted to spend more, we \nstill saved $23 billion last year.\n  In last year's budget, the Congress eliminated about 200 Government \nprograms. That is 200 programs that have been eliminated before we even \nstart this year's budget cycle. It is really the great untold story of \nlast year, that savings were achieved--not with President Clinton's \nhelp, but in spite of it. We made progress on taxes as well, Mr. \nPresident. Again, this came in spite of President Clinton's objections. \nWe raised the Social Security earnings limitation to ease the burden on \nnearly 1 million seniors. We passed tax relief for our troops serving \nin Bosnia. We permanently increased the health insurance deduction for \nthe self-employed from 25 to 30 percent. We would have liked to have \ndone much more, of course. And we prohibited States from taxing the \npension income of former residents who retired and moved to other \nStates, the so-called source tax repeal.\n  So we provided a lot of tax relief for Americans. There would have \nbeen additional tax relief for the American people if President Clinton \nhad not vetoed the bill that we passed last November--vetoed it on \nDecember 6 of last year. When he vetoed that bill, he precluded an \nextension of the exclusion for employer-provided education assistance. \nHe precluded a $500 per child tax credit. He prevented us from \ninstituting a marriage penalty tax relief provision. He prevented us \nfrom implementing capital gains tax reform, and also a tax deduction \nfor the first $2,500 in interest on a student loan. These are all tax \nrelief provisions that we passed but the President vetoed.\n  We would have provided Americans with enhanced opportunities to save \nin their individual retirement accounts. And we would have given them \nmore choice in obtaining affordable health care through the medical \nsavings accounts that were, again, in the bill we passed but that the \nPresident vetoed.\n  The President said ``no'' to tax relief. In fact, it seems to me, Mr. \nPresident, that there is no tax that the President is willing to part \nwith. Even the gasoline tax debate that we have had--it has obviously \nbeen grinding on the President, and he suggested that maybe he would \napprove it because it is very popular. But he will not commit to it. He \nadmitted that he raised taxes too much back in 1993. But when it came \ntime to roll the tax increases back, he has said ``no.''\n  Now, the committee-reported budget before us today again challenges \nPresident Clinton to do some of the things that he has promised for so \nlong. I am going to be offering another amendment, in a moment, which \nwill really put this, I think, to the test. But the budget that we have \nproduced here, which Senator Domenici and his committee presented to \nus, includes real welfare reform and middle-class tax relief. It \nensures the solvency of Medicare and reforms Medicaid--all the things \nthe President has said he wants to do. It balances the budget honestly, \nwithout the kind of gimmicks and triggers recommended by President \nClinton, which, by the way, are gimmicks that will require deep cuts in \ndomestic discretionary programs, including the environment, scientific \nresearch and education, if balance is to be achieved at all.\n  In fact, despite the claims to the contrary, President Clinton's \nbudget does not balance. I am going to repeat that. Despite the claims \nof some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, the President's \nbudget is not in balance. The director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, June O'Neill, in her testimony on April 17, said, ``Under CBO's \nmore cautious economic and technical assumptions, the basic policies \noutlined in the President's budget would bring down the deficit to \nabout $80 billion by 2002, instead of producing the budget surplus that \nthe administration estimates.'' In other words, even though the \nadministration estimates that it will be in balance at the end of 6 \nmore years, the CBO says, in fact, it will be in deficit by $80 \nbillion. In contrast, the budget proposed by Senator Domenici, called \nthe Republican budget, is, of course, in balance.\n\n  The bottom line here is that, for all the President's proclamations \nthat he is now a true believer in a balanced budget, he still has yet \nto offer an honest plan to achieve balance by any certain date. As I \nsaid, the Senate Budget Committee's proposal does exactly what we \npromised. We promised not to cut Medicare. This budget does not. \nMedicare spending would be allowed to grow at twice the rate of \ninflation. In fact, per beneficiary spending would grow from $5,200 in \n1996 to $7,000 in 2002, a 35-percent increase. We allow it to grow, but \nat a sustainable level. We provide a $500 per child tax credit for \nevery child under 18. We protect Social Security. We reform Medicaid. \nAnd we continue progress toward more market-oriented farm policies.\n  There are very good reasons for us to be proposing this honest \nbalanced budget, Mr. President. One is, of course, that it protects \npriorities, like Social Security and Medicare, and, importantly, it \naccommodates tax relief for middle-income families. First and foremost, \nit is the right thing to do. In fact, Mr. President, no generation \nbefore us has spent so lavishly on itself, only to leave the bills to \nfuture generations to repay. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said recently:\n\n       There is great delight in working hard and living within \n     our means so our children could be better off than we have \n     been. Only in the last generation has this bias toward the \n     future been reversed. Now we are borrowing against the farm \n     to pay today's living expenses, and leaving our children to \n     pay off that debt.\n\n  Mr. President, the Speaker is right. But balancing the budget is not \njust about the future. A balanced budget would produce substantial \nbenefits for today's generations as well. The Congressional Budget \nOffice predicts that a balanced budget would facilitate a reduction in \nlong-term interest rates of between 1 and 2 percent--some say as high \nas 2.7 percent. Among other things, that means that Americans will have \nthe chance to live the American dream and to own their own homes.\n  A 2-percent reduction in the typical 30-year mortgage in Arizona \nwould save homeowners over $220 a month. That is $2,655 a year. Let me \nrepeat this. By balancing the budget now, interest rates will come \ndown, and a 2-percent drop in interest rates would save the average \nfamily with a home mortgage in Arizona $2,655 each year.\n\n[[Page S5239]]\n\n That is money in our pockets, Mr. President.\n  So it is not just about the future, though the future is critical. It \nis about today, helping the working families of today keep more of what \nthey earn, just as a result of making a commitment that we will have \nthe Federal budget balanced in another 6 years.\n  A couple of other examples. A 2-percent reduction in interest rates \non a typical $15,000 car loan would save buyers $676. That is real \nmoney. The savings would also accrue on student loans, credit cards, \nand loans to businesses who want to expand and create new jobs. \nReducing interest rates is, perhaps, one of the most important things \nwe could do for people all over the country today.\n  So the point I want to make in relation not only to the amendment \nthat I have just proposed, which would commit the Senate to the \nproposition that economic growth is important and that we can achieve \nit more by reducing tax rates than by increasing them, is that the \nbudget that we have proposed promotes that kind of growth, that kind of \nopportunity as a result. It is a good budget, a responsible budget. It \naccepts the challenge to rein in Government spending and to ensure that \nwe leave our children and grandchildren with a legacy of more than debt \nand despair. So I urge my colleagues, when the time comes, to support \nthis budget.\n  Mr. President, I would like to reserve the remainder of the time on \nthe amendment which I have just been discussing. I ask unanimous \nconsent to lay this amendment aside and to send another amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3996\n\n   (Purpose: To adopt the President's budget for the Low Income Home \n Energy Assistance Program through fiscal year 2000 and freeze funding \n                      for the program thereafter)\n\n  Mr. KYL. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3996.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 10, decrease the amount by $90,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 11, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 12, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, decrease the amount by $85,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, decrease the amount by $174,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $85,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $174,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 31, line 17, decrease the amount by $90,000,000.\n       On page 31, line 18, decrease the amount by $85,000,000.\n       On page 31, line 24, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 31, line 25, decrease the amount by $174,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 6, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 7, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 13, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 14, decrease the amount by $181,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to speak on this amendment for a \nlittle while and then again reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. How long does the Senator expect to speak on this \namendment?\n  Mr. KYL. I would say to the Senator from West Virginia, probably \nabout 10 minutes, but certainly no longer than 15.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very modest, but I think it will \nprovide a real test of whether everyone who likes to call themselves \nsensible about fiscal policy really means it. It is a test of whether \nwe are really serious about holding the line on spending, or whether we \nare even unwilling to make a small step to balance the budget.\n  This amendment deals with the so-called LIHEAP program, the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. It accepts the President's \nspending figures, his budget, for this program for the next 4 years. \nThis is a forward-funded program, but it accepts the President's \nfigures through the year 2000, and then for the last 2 years of the \nprogram it continues spending at exactly that level. By contrast, the \nPresident would allow spending on that program to dramatically escalate \nin the last 2 years, which just happens to be the campaign year.\n  So what I am proposing here is a very slight reduction in spending in \nthe last 2 years of the 6-year program and spending at the \nadministration's request for the first 4 years. This, therefore, is a \ngood test.\n  Will big spenders even vote against this modest cut? I am reminded of \nwhat happened about 3 years ago when the Senator who occupies the Chair \nand I both served in the House of Representatives and we were engaged \nin a similar debate. We had failed to cut 15 percent from a program. We \nthen failed to cut 12 percent, and then 10 percent, and then 5, and \nthen 3 percent. Finally, our colleague from Pennsylvania, \nRepresentative Walker, got up and said, ``All right. Then would you at \nleast cut $19.93?''--that being 1993. Again, there was a vote taken. \nAnd, no, the House of Representatives would not even reduce the program \nby $19.93.\n  This is a little more than $19.93. This will provide some real \nsavings--a few hundred million dollars, which I know in Washington does \nnot seem like much, but to Americans it is real money.\n  So we will see whether we are even willing to cut a little bit in the \nlast 2 years of a program by continuing the spending levels that the \nPresident has deemed sufficient for the next 4 years for the full 6 \nyears of the program.\n  Let us talk about the actual numbers involved here. The budget \nresolution assumes that funding for LIHEAP will be constant at about $1 \nbillion for each of fiscal years 1997 through fiscal year 2002. But the \nPresident recommends LIHEAP funding of $1 billion for fiscal years 1997 \nand 1998, declining to $910 million in fiscal year 1999 and $819 \nmillion in the year 2000. What this amendment would do is to take that \nlevel of funding, $819 million, as I said, and have it be constant for \nthe remainder of this period of time. So that under the amendment, \nLIHEAP would be funded at $1 billion in year 1, $1 billion in year 2, \nunder the President's recommendation would decline to $910 million in \nfiscal 1999, $819 million in the year 2000, and then stay at $819 \nmillion for the year 2001, and the year 2002.\n  It adopts the President's figures, as I said, and then keeps the \nspending constant for the last 2 years. The President otherwise would \nallow LIHEAP spending to increase to $934 million in fiscal year 2001 \nand $1.064 billion in fiscal year 2002. As I said, curiously enough, \nthe high years are the election years.\n  Here is what the Office of Management and Budget has said. The Office \nof Management and Budget, which is the President's office for \ncalculating budget matters and working on budget matters, has said that \nthe declining figures for those middle years--1999 and 2000--are due to \nstandard percentage reductions applied to programs that are not a top \npriority--that are not a top priority. The President's own Office of \nManagement and Budget has taken all of the items in the President's \nbudget and has weighed them, has prioritized them, and has said that \nfor those that are not a top priority, we are going to apply a standard \nrate of reduction. That is why even though it is $1 billion this year \nand $1 billion next year, it is going to go down to $910 million in \n1999 and then $819 million in the year 2000.\n  The President's 1995 budget request, I would note, proposed to reduce \nLIHEAP's funding by half--by over $700 million. His 1995 budget \nproposal would have left $730 million in LIHEAP.\n  So you see, Mr. President, while the Office of Management and Budget \nand\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\nthe President of the United States have said that the appropriate level \nwas $730 million, in the last 2 years of the program they increase it \nto ultimately being over $1 billion a year. All we are doing is taking \nthe Office of Management and Budget at its word, we are taking the \nPresident at his word that these programs really are a little lesser \npriority than some of the more important programs. But instead of \ntaking the spending down to $730 million where the President would have \ntaken it, we leave it at $819 million, almost $100 million more in the \nlast 3 years of this 6-year period of time.\n  So we would provide more for LIHEAP every year compared to what the \nPresident proposed just 2 years ago.\n  I hope this will preclude anybody from arguing we are savaging the \nLIHEAP budget. We are spending more than the President proposed, and we \nare spending the same amount in the last 3 years of the program, the \namount the President recommended in year 4, and then we are continuing \nthat spending in year 5 and 6.\n  Here is the reason for my amendment. The President's outyear figures \nare, obviously, unrealistic. They are not going to be obtained. You \ncannot backload all of the money into the last 2 years of the program, \nand this is because the President has relied on gimmicks to get to \nbalance by the year 2002.\n  Again, remember what I said before. Without those gimmicks, his \nbudget would be $84 million in deficit according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. So the additional spending in these years cannot really \nbe justified. It is not going to happen. I am simply saying, let us \nrecognize that now and ensure that the budget that we pass will be an \nhonest budget.\n  Let me conclude with some statements and thoughts about LIHEAP that \nhelp demonstrate why this is not a top-priority program and, therefore, \nthe President is right in suggesting that the spending be reduced \nsomewhat.\n  Remember that this program was initiated in 1981 to temporarily--\ntemporarily--supplement existing cash assistance programs and to help \nlow-income individuals pay for escalating home fuel costs which \nresulted from the energy crisis of 15 years ago. Around Washington, \nevery temporary spending program and every temporary tax seems to \nbecome permanent, and this one has, too. But it does not have to \nbankrupt us as well.\n  Let me just mention that one of the major utilities in Arizona--\nArizona Public Service--has advised that average residential rates have \ndeclined 10 percent in real terms between 1980 and 1995 in constant \n1980 dollars. These real lower prices mean that it is time to \nreconsider the LIHEAP program, which assumed continuously escalating \nprices back in the days of high inflation. The Clinton administration \ninformed the House Appropriations Committee in 1994 that low-income \nfamilies now spend one-third less of their income on home energy than \nthey did when LIHEAP was initiated.\n  So they have confirmed this reality. And according to CBO's February \n1995 report, ``Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options,'' 26 \nStates--this is the real test, Mr. President--transferred up to 10 \npercent of their LIHEAP funds, which was then legal to do--it is not \nany more, but they transferred up to 10 percent of their LIHEAP funds \nduring 1993 to supplement spending for five other social and community \nservices block grant programs which obviously had a higher priority to \nthem. The transfers obviously indicate that some States believe that \nspending for energy assistance does not have as high a priority as \nother spending does--the same thing that the President himself \nconfirmed.\n  The point is this. LIHEAP has evolved from a temporary energy crisis \nassistance program to a broad income supplement which the Clinton \nadministration in its 1995 budget request said, and I am quoting, \n``does not target well those low-income households with exceptionally \nhigh energy costs in relation to income and which does little to help \nassisted households achieve independence from the program.''\n  So the Clinton administration has been quite honest about this. It \nhas acknowledged it is not the best program to help the low-income \nfamilies. It has acknowledged that the original purpose, to temporarily \nhelp people in an escalating time of fuel bills, is no longer a high \npriority because, as I noted, the fuel bills are going down, and \ntherefore in its own budget request has assigned the LIHEAP program a \nlower budget priority applying an across-the-board reduction. It has, \ntherefore, recommended that from the $1 billion we are going to spend \nnext year and the year after, it be reduced to $934 million--fine--down \nto $819 million--fine--and my amendment simply says and hold it at $819 \nmillion for the last 2 years of this 6-year period.\n  What could be more reasonable? And yet I suspect this will put some \nof our colleagues to the test. I would just offer a challenge to those \nmembers particularly who come from the States that utilize LIHEAP \nsignificantly. This is an opportunity, an opportunity to do something \nthat does not occur very often and that is to be able to say I voted to \ncut a program that is used by people in my own State quite a bit \nbecause I knew it was wrong, I knew that in effect because of changed \ncircumstances this had become fat, not muscle, this had become almost a \npork-type project. Of course, we know that we all have to pay for these \nspending programs, and we are willing to do our part to bring the \nbudget deficit down. Members even from States that utilize this program \ncan say that now because we are spending all we need to spend on the \nprogram, according to the administration. And so by holding the figure \nat the administration's level, we will be helping to reduce the budget \nand we will be also demonstrating in at least one small way that we \nreally mean it when we say we can achieve deficit reduction. So not \nonly for those States that do not particularly rely upon it but for the \nMembers who come from those States that do, it is a real opportunity \nthat does not come along very often. As I said, it will really help us \nto determine whether or not we are serious about achieving balancing \nour budget by the year 2002 or whether it is just rhetoric and we are \nleaving it to our children to pay the bills.\n  I hope that when this LIHEAP modest reduction by in effect having \nlevel spending in the last 3 years of the program comes to a vote on \nTuesday, all of our colleagues will join in supporting the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nMassachusetts wishes to speak for, say, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment which I will offer, and it may be \nthat the Senator from Massachusetts has an amendment or amendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I would like to offer some \namendments dealing with Medicare-Medicaid. I will not speak on those \nmeasures now. I would like to get them in order.\n  I do not want to interfere with the orderly procedure which is being \nfollowed here about submitting amendments and setting them aside. And \nso I would inquire if that is an agreeable process with the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nrecognized at this point and I may yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts for 15 minutes without losing my right to the floor, and \nthat the time he utilizes be charged either against his amendments or \nagainst the time on the resolution itself; that I then be recognized to \ncall up my amendment. We will not be alternating as the Senators I \nthink would like to do, but the distinguished Senator from Arizona, \n[Mr. Kyl], just offered two amendments. I did not raise any objection \nto that. So if Senators will give me consent, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object and I will \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have not set aside the Kyl amendments. We will do \nthat first.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl amendments be \ntemporarily set aside.\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am surely  not  going  to  object.  \nDid  the Senator inform the Senate in my absence how long he was going \nto take on his amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will take the full hour. I will probably use 50 minutes \nof it and then charge some time against the resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And Senator Kennedy is going to need 15 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fifteen minutes and then offer amendments but will not \nspeak on them out here because others want to address the Senate. I \nwill address the Senate at another time on those measures but I will \nfile them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So we know on our side, how long is the Senator \nproposing that you use the time of the Senate between the two of you \nbefore one of us can be--is it an hour and 15 minutes that we are \ntalking about?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, I was going to use 50 minutes of my hour, reserve the \nremainder of the time and complete my speech on the time from the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before we get back on our side, so we will know who \nshould be here, is it an hour and a half or what do you think?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would think that would be about it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. About an hour and a half.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be 15 minutes. The Senator has indicated 50.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is granted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank all Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his typical courtesy and I appreciate all of us are trying \nto have an opportunity to address the Senate on a number of the items \nthat are included in the budget and adjusting schedules.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode \nIsland Mr. [Pell] be added as an original cosponsor of amendment No. \n3991, the Kerry-Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3997, 3998, 3999, and 4000\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send four amendments to the desk, and I \nask unanimous consent that they be considered individually. I further \nask unanimous consent that they be laid aside. I hope to discuss them \nfurther during the course of the afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes \n     amendments numbered 3997, 3998, 3999, and 4000.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3997\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress that the reconciliation \n   bill should maintain the existing prohibitions against additional \n            charges by providers under the medicare program)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ADDITIONAL CHARGES \n                   UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) senior citizens must spend more than 1 dollar in 5 of \n     their limited incomes to purchase the health care they need;\n       (2) \\2/3\\ of spending under the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act is for senior citizens \n     with annual incomes of less than $15,000;\n       (3) senior citizens cannot afford physician fee mark-ups \n     that are not covered under the medicare program or premium \n     overcharges; and\n       (4) senior citizens enrolling in private insurance plans \n     receiving medicare capitation payments are currently \n     protected against excess charges by health providers and \n     additional premium charges by the plan for services covered \n     under the medicare program.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that any reconciliation bill considered during the second \n     session of the 104th Congress should maintain the existing \n     prohibitions against additional charges by providers under \n     the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act (``balance billing''), and any premium surcharges for \n     services covered under such program that are levied on senior \n     citizens enrolled in private insurance plans in lieu of \n     conventional medicare.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican budget plan is designed to \nmake Medicare ``wither on the vine,'' in the words of Speaker Gingrich. \nUnder the guise of greater choice, it is rigged to force seniors to \ngive up their family doctor and join private insurance plans. If the \nRepublican plan had been enacted last year, private insurers would have \nreaped a bonanza. If only half of all seniors had left conventional \nMedicare, private insurers would have reaped windfall revenues of $625 \nbillion over the next 7 years.\n  Not only does the Republican plan force senior citizens to join \nprivate insurance plans, it strips away existing protections against \nadditional, uncovered provider charges--so-called balance billing--once \nthey have enrolled. It eliminates current protections against premium \nsurcharges for basic Medicare services. It puts every senior at \nfinancial risk.\n  Unlimited balanced billing would be allowed under at least three \ncircumstances under the Republican plan. Charges for any service--\nexcept emergency services--supplied by a provider not having a contract \nwith the private insurance company would not be limited. Charges for \nservices provided through a Medicare medical savings account would be \nunlimited. And services provided by an unrestricted fee-for-service \nplan would be unlimited.\n  Currently, private insurance plans receiving Medicare capitation \ncontracts may not charge enrollees any additional premium for coverage \nof Medicare basic services. Under the Republican plan, that protection, \ntoo, is eliminated.\n  Because of gaps in Medicare and high health care costs, senior \ncitizens have a difficult time affording the health care they need. \nEighty-three percent of all Medicare spending is for older Americans \nwith annual incomes below $25,000. Two-thirds is for those with incomes \nbelow $15,000. Senior citizens typically spend more than $1 in $5 of \ntheir limited income to purchase the health care they need. It is wrong \nto expose them to higher medical bills and higher premiums so that \ndoctors and insurance companies can reap greater profits.\n  The President vetoed these unfair proposals last year, and the \nDemocrats in Congress upheld his veto. The amendment I am offering \ntoday gives every Member of the Senate the opportunity to go on record \nas rejecting this new budget's proposals to allow balance billing and \npremiums surcharges in private insurance plans receiving Medicare \ncapitation payments. I hope the Senate will adopt it.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3998\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress that the reconciliation \n  bill should not include any changes in Federal nursing home quality \n        standards or the Federal enforcement of such standards)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING NURSING HOME \n                   STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) prior to the enactment of subtitle C of title IV of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, deplorable \n     conditions and shocking abuse of senior citizens and the \n     disabled in nursing homes was widespread; and\n       (2) the enactment and implementation of such subtitle has \n     brought major improvements in nursing home conditions and \n     substantially reduced abuse of senior citizens.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that any reconciliation bill considered during the second \n     session of the 104th Congress should not include any changes \n     in Federal nursing home quality standards or the Federal \n     enforcement of such standards.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, strong Federal quality standards for \nnursing homes were enacted by Congress with solid bipartisan support in \n1987, after a series of investigations revealed appalling conditions in \nnursing homes throughout the Nation and shocking abuse of senior \ncitizens and the disabled.\n  Elderly patients were often allowed to go uncleaned for days, lying \nin their own excrement. They were tied to wheelchairs and beds under \nconditions that would not be tolerated in any prison in America. \nDeliberate abuse and violence were used against helpless senior \ncitizens by callous or sadistic attendants. Painful, untreated, and \ncompletely avoidable bedsores were found widespread.\n  Patients had been scalded to death in hot baths and showers, or \nsedated to\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\nthe point of unconsciousness, or isolated from all aspects of normal \nlife by fly-by-night nursing home operators bent on profiteering from \nthe misery of their patients.\n  These conditions, once revealed, shocked the conscience of the \nNation. The Federal standards enacted by Congress ended much of this \nunconscionable abuse and achieved substantial improvement in the \nquality of care for nursing home residents.\n  Last year, the Republican budget programs included a frontal assault \non these standards. The first House reconciliation bill repealed them \nentirely. The Senate bill reported from Committee did the same. As \npublic outrage mounted, the Republican Congress was forced to modify \ntheir program--but each time the fine print left major loopholes. \nFortunately, the President vetoed this harsh program, and the Democrats \nin Congress sustained his veto.\n  It is difficult to believe that anyone, no matter how extreme their \nideology, would take us back to the shameful conditions before 1987. \nBut this is exactly what the Republican plan will do. The American \npeople will never accept such a program, so the Republican program, \nonce again, buries the assault on nursing home quality in fine print. \nThis time, the House Commerce Committee has announced that it will \nmaintain current standards--but the fine print says that enforcement \nresponsibility will be taken from the Federal Government and turned \nover to the States. Yet it was because States failed to adequately \nprotect nursing home residents that the Federal law was enacted in the \nfirst place.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of the Congress that Federal \nnursing home quality standards should be maintained without any ifs, \nands, or buts. This is the minimum assurance that senior citizens and \ntheir families deserve--and I hope the Senate will vote to give them \nthat assurance.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3999\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress that provisions of \ncurrent medicaid law protecting families of nursing home residents from \nexperiencing financial ruin as the price of needed care for their loved \n                        ones should be retained)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS CONCERNING NURSING HOME CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) under current Federal law--\n       (A) protections are provided under the medicaid program \n     under title XIX of the Social Security Act to prevent the \n     improverishment of spouses of nursing home residents;\n       (B) prohibitions exist under such program to prevent the \n     charging of adult children of nursing home residents for the \n     cost of the care of such residents;\n       (C) prohibitions exist under such program to prevent a \n     State from placing a lien against the home of a nursing home \n     resident, if that home was occupied by a spouse or dependent \n     child; and\n       (D) prohibitions exist under such program to prevent a \n     nursing home from charging amounts above the medicaid \n     recognized charge for medicaid patients or requiring a \n     commitment to make private payments prior to receiving \n     medicaid coverage as a condition of admission; and\n       (2) family members of nursing home residents are generally \n     unable to afford the high cost of nursing home care, which \n     ranges between $30,000 and $60,000 a year.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that provisions of the medicaid program under title XIX of \n     the Social Security Act that protect families of nursing home \n     residents from experiencing financial ruin as the price of \n     securing needed care for their loved ones should be retained, \n     including--\n       (1) spousal impoverishment rules;\n       (2) prohibitions against charging adult children of nursing \n     home patients for the cost of their care;\n       (3) prohibitions against liens on the homes of nursing home \n     residents occupied by a spouse or dependent child; and\n       (4) prohibitions against nursing homes requiring private \n     payments prior to medicaid coverage as a condition of \n     admission or allowing charges in addition to medicaid \n     payments for covered patients.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the cruellest aspects of the \nRepublican proposals have been their failure to protect nursing home \npatients and their relatives from financial abuse. Last year, both the \nHouse and Senate Republican bills initially eliminated the protections \nin current law--enacted with broad bipartisan support in 1987--assuring \nthat a spouse remaining in the community would be able to keep at least \na modest amount of income and savings, so that she would not be reduced \nto abject poverty in order for a loved one to get the nursing home care \nhe needed.\n  Once the public became aware of these harsh proposals, the \nRepublicans rushed to repair their public relations problem, but as in \nthe case of nursing home quality standards, the provisions they claimed \nrestored the current protections were as full of holes as a Swiss \ncheese.\n  Their bills allowed nursing homes to charge patients more than \nMedicaid will pay, so that spouses could still be forced to sell their \nhome or wipe out all their savings to give their loved ones the care \nthey need. What kind of a spousal protection program is it that says, \n``The State can't take away all your savings and your home so that your \nloved one can get the care he needs, but the nursing home operator \ncan?''\n  Their bills continued to wipe out protections that have been included \nin Medicaid since 1965 against a State forcing adult children to be \nresponsible for the cost of care for a nursing home patient. Twenty-\nnine states have these laws on the books. Only the Federal law prevents \nthem from being enforced--and the Republican bill would have repealed \nthose protections. What kind of family values say that it is perfectly \nall right to tell adult children, struggling to raise a family and meet \nthe needs of their own children, that the State can take away all your \nsavings and hopes as a condition of their parents getting the nursing \nhome care they need?\n  And finally, their bills provided no protection against a State \nplacing a lien on the home of a nursing home resident, even if a spouse \nor a child is still living there. That protection has been a part of \ncurrent law for decades--but the Republican plan would have repealed \nit.\n  The President vetoed these harsh bills, and the Democrats in Congress \nsustained his veto. The amendment I am offering today gives the Senate \na chance to go on record as repudiating those Republican policies and \ndirecting that they not be included in this year's reconciliation \nbills.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4000\n\n        (Purpose: To protect the wages of construction workers)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE DAVIS BACON ACT.\n\n       Notwithstanding any provisions in the report of the \n     Committee on the Budget to accompany S. Con. Res. 57, it is \n     the Sense of the Senate that the provisions in this Budget \n     Resolution assume no changes to the Davis Bacon Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are laid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3996\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was listening to my good friend from \nArizona talking about LIHEAP, which is an essential program, \nparticularly for seniors and children, to keep warm in the winter. He \nwas talking about how people in Arizona do not get much value out of \nthat.\n  I was here when the Congress appropriated $3.4 billion to complete \nthe central Arizona project. There is still 725 more to go. I will just \nsay, the taxpayers of Massachusetts did not get much benefit from that \nprogram either.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Excuse me, the Senator from West Virginia has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will Senator Byrd yield 1 minute to the \nSenator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely; gladly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not remember what the last project \nfor Boston Harbor cost----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was not the one who was complaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It almost cost more than the Arizona project, and we \ndid not get anything from that in New Mexico, either.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Senator, was that not part of the Interstate \nHighway System? The completion of the top part of it was the last link \nand was the part that was to be completed in which Massachusetts \ntaxpayers contributed, like others contributed for their highways in \ntheir State. We can talk about it at another time. I see my friend and \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I have an additional 30 seconds? This one I am \ntalking about is known as the ``big dig.'' That is the one that is \ngoing to cost about $10 billion. At one point, it was kind of known as \nthe ``great Tip O'Neill project.'' Everybody seemed glad to do that for \nTip O'Neill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is called the Central Artery, which next time you go \nup, you will see the interstate signs on it. We hope you will enjoy \nyour trips to New England.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not get there very often, and when it is finally \nbuilt, there will not be such big traffic jams, and I will enjoy Boston \nthen.\n  I want to make sure for the Record it is understood that we are not \nin any way waiving the hour we have to rebut each of these amendments. \nWe are accommodating by letting the Senators who are the proponents get \nthem done today. That is a mutual request of both sides. I do not think \nwe can take all the time on each amendment, but clearly by not \nanswering them today does not mean we are not going to answer them, \neither in the presence of the proponent or not. At some point before \nfinal passage, we will answer most of them.\n\n  I thank Senator Byrd for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4001\n\n (Purpose: This amendment increases overall discretionary spending to \nthe levels proposed by the President.

Mr. President, I am offering an amendment on behalf of \nmyself and the following Senators: Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nBumpers, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Dorgan. I welcome further \ncosponsors, Mr. President.\n  Now, Mr. President, I yield myself 50 minutes of my 60 minutes, and I \nhope that the Chair will let me know when my 50 minutes have been \nconcluded.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by the offering of yet another \nbudget resolution which shortchanges our country's future. The cuts in \nnondefense discretionary spending that would be necessary over the next \n6 years in order to meet the reduced levels of budget authority and \noutlays provided in this budget resolution are truly extraordinary.\n  One has only to turn to page 211 of the committee report accompanying \nthis budget resolution to see what I mean. On that page, one finds a \ntable entitled ``Comparison of Budget Plans: Six-Year Totals.'' That \ntable compares the deficit reduction that would take place over fiscal \nyears 1997 through 2002 under President Clinton's budget proposals \nversus those under the Republican budget resolution that is now before \nthe Senate.\n  According to that table, in that committee report, over that 6-year \nperiod, fiscal years 1997-2002, discretionary spending will be cut \nunder the Republican budget resolution by $296 billion. This amounts to \n$66 billion more in cuts to discretionary spending than the President's \nbudget proposals, which would cut $230 billion over the same period.\n  That is one of the reasons why I voted against the President's budget \nlast night. I preferred it to the Republican budget that is before us. \nBut the President's budget cut discretionary funding badly, even though \nthe Republican resolution cuts it worse.\n  Mr. President, look at the cumulative effect of the cuts in buying \npower that will have to be made over the next 6 years under either the \nbudget resolution or the President's budget. They are mind-boggling--\nmind-boggling. We are talking about cuts proposed by the President \ntotaling $230 billion below the rate of inflation. And we are talking \nabout cuts under the Republican budget resolution totaling $296 billion \nbelow inflation over the next 6 years for discretionary programs.\n\n  When we pile real reductions of that severity, one on top of another, \nyear after year after year after year, how can any thinking person \nexpect this Nation to sustain any financial ability to meet the minimum \nneeds of the American people in all of the critical areas that are \nfunded by discretionary appropriations. Those needs are not frozen. We \ndo not have a freeze on crime in America. We do not have a freeze on \nbridge repairs. We do not have a freeze on potholes in the roads or a \nfreeze on the dirty water supply or a freeze on aging sewers or on \nenvironmental pollution. Those needs still\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\npress and tax our financial resources. And it all adds up to hundreds \nof billions of dollars in backlogs--backlogs.\n  What has been our response? Our response has been to budget less and \nless money to deal with the ever-increasing backlogs. If we continue to \neviscerate our own Nation with this unwise and careless way of \nbudgeting, I fear for the ultimate consequences. What will be affected? \nNearly everything in the daily lives of the American people will be \naffected. For instance, two-thirds of the domestic discretionary budget \ngoes to fund our Nation's infrastructure.\n  About 13 percent of all domestic discretionary spending is for \ntransportation programs--including the maintenance and improvement of \nour National Highway System, our airport and airway system, and all \nsafety-related facilities and equipment, including our public \ntransportation systems. In all areas of transportation there are \nglaring, unmet needs which not only affect the safety of the American \npeople, but also cost our economy billions of dollars each year because \nof delays in getting our products to their markets and in getting \nworkers to and from their jobs.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, there are currently \nmore than 234,000 miles of the nearly 1.2 million miles of paved \nnonlocal roads which are in such bad condition that they require \ncapital improvements either immediately--just travel down the streets \nof Washington--or within the next few years. The Nation's backlog in \nthe rehabilitation and maintenance of our Nation's bridges currently \nstands at $78 billion. That is the backlog as of now. And it is getting \nworse and it is getting bigger, the Nation's backlog.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration, 118,000 of the \nNation's 575,000 bridges--more than one out of five--are structurally \ndeficient. Heavier trucks are prohibited from using them--an action \nthat has an immediate, adverse impact on the Nation's productivity. \nAnother 14 percent of the Nation's bridges are functionally obsolete, \nmeaning they do not have the land and shoulder widths or vertical \nclearance to handle the traffic they bear.\n  Fully 70 percent of the Nation's interstate highways in metropolitan \nareas are congested during peak travel times. Such traffic congestion \ncosts the economy $39 billion a year in wasted fuel and lower \nproductivity for both passengers and commercial traffic. Congestion \nalso undermines our ability to clean up the Nation's air, since more \nthan 70 percent of the carbon monoxide emitted into the atmosphere \ncomes from motor vehicles.\n  To make matters worse, the Department of Transportation continues to \nestimate increased growth in vehicle use that will put us in even worse \nshape. Things are not getting better. Things are getting worse by the \nday. It has been estimated that the number of vehicles on our Nation's \nhighways will grow by about 8 percent by the year 2000. However, over \nthe same period, freight tonnage, carried by our Nation's trucks, will \ngrow by more than 30 percent. Yet, under this proposed budget \nresolution and for several years to come, it can be anticipated that we \nwill be required to cut, rather than increase, our investment in \nmaintaining our Nation's highway system. How can we even consider not \naddressing these problems? This budget resolution totally ignores those \nneeds.\n  No area of infrastructure investment is as critical as our Nation's \nhighway system. The system carries nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate \ncommerce and more than 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist \ntraffic. And yet, just 7 months ago the Department of Transportation \npublished its annual status report on the Nation's surface \ntransportation system. That report estimated that it would require \nadditional annual investments of roughly $15 billion to adequately \nmaintain our existing surface transportation infrastructure--$15 \nbillion annually just to maintain our existing surface transportation \ninfrastructure. Unfortunately, we simply are not making the necessary \ninvestments to ensure a prosperous future for our children, especially \nwhen compared to the investments that are being made by our economic \ncompetitors throughout the world.\n  Just as our Federal funding patterns have ignored the anticipated \ngrowth in highway use, so, too, are we ignoring the anticipated growth \nin airport use. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the \nnumber of passengers expected at our Nation's airports will grow almost \n60 percent over the next decade. That will not include me because I do \nnot like to fly. My name is Byrd, but I do not like to fly. And what \nhas happened in recent days has made me even more fearful.\n\n  If no new runways are added, the number of severely congested major \nairports will grow by 250 percent. The Federal Aviation Administration \nestimates that in order to bring existing airports up to current design \nstandards, as well as to provide sufficient capacity to meet the \nprojected demand, it will cost no less than $30 billion over the next \nseveral years. What is this blatant neglect doing to safety standards? \nWhat is this blatant neglect doing to safety standards? Safety for \nwhom? Safety for the American people? Safety for the traveling public?\n  Mr. President, we do the American people no favor by ignoring these \ntrends and by balancing the Federal budget on the back of critical \ndomestic investments.\n  Fully another 14 percent of domestic discretionary spending is for \neducation, training, and employment programs--including Head Start, \nelementary and secondary education, Pell grants, and other college \nstudent financial aid.\n  Tremendous unmet needs have also been identified in this portion of \nthe budget. Over the past number of years, we have managed to \nsubstantially increase funding for Head Start, special education \ngrants, and Pell Grants. But we clearly will be unable to sustain these \nincreased levels of spending in the future under this budget \nresolution.\n  Senators should not go home and beat their chests about how strongly \nthey support education when they vote for the cuts in discretionary \nspending contained in this budget resolution. They will be saying one \nthing, while actually doing quite another. And there is too much of \nthat in politics already.\n  This Republican budget cuts $24.4 billion in budget authority in \ninflation-adjusted dollars from this portion of the budget over the \nnext 6 years. This amounts to a cut of 25 percent in real terms.\n  Another 12 percent of domestic discretionary spending is for \nenvironmental improvement and energy efficiency programs--ranging from \nsewage treatment grants to toxic clean-up to energy R programs.\n  This Republican budget resolution appears to assume reductions for \nthe Environmental Protection Agency totaling $5 billion over 7 years. \nThese reductions are assumed to be applied to each EPA program account, \nincluding Superfund, State and Tribal Assistance grants, Science and \nTechnology, and EPA operating programs. The impact of these proposed \nreductions would be devastating to EPA's ability to address protection \nof public health and the environment.\n  It should be noted that while the annual request for wastewater \ntreatment infrastructure programs is $1.35 billion, there are \ndocumented wastewater infrastructure needs of $137 billion throughout \nthe United States. While the Federal funding for this infrastructure \nprogram leverages additional matching funds from States and localities, \nthe administration's proposed budget assumes a level that enables \nStates to provide $2 billion. With requirements totaling $137 billion \ntoday--and continuing to grow with the population--clearly the need is \nfor more infrastructure funding for clean water facilities, not less.\n  In the area of infrastructure requirements for States to meet the \nrequirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the total requirements are \nunknown. A needs survey is now being conducted, and will be completed \nin June. No preliminary estimates are available, but it is safe to \nassume that the annual budget request of $550 million will be \ninsufficient to address the needs of local communities in upgrading \nboth publicly and privately owned drinking water systems. In my own \nState of West Virginia, a recent Federal study reports that it would \ntake $162 million dollars to clean up and provide potable water to \napproximately 79,000 West Virginians. It would take another $405.7 \nmillion to meet the worsening\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\ndrinking water supply situation of some 476,000 West Virginians. There \nyou have it. We have an annual budget request for the whole country of \n$550 million and yet in West Virginia we have a total need for $568 \nmillion--$568 million in West Virginia alone--as against $550 million \nfor the whole country that is being requested in the budget. It does \nnot make sense.\n\n  We are becoming like a Third World country in many parts of the \nNation. West Virginia is not alone. West Virginia is a rural State. \nWhat kind of a budget ignores the most basic, most basic need, clean \ndrinking water, of people? Safe drinking water seems to me to be pretty \nbasic stuff. What good is the environment that ignores that kind of \nneed?\n  Additionally, under this budget resolution, funding for watershed \nprojects and flood prevention will be drastically reduced. Furthermore, \nwater and wastewater treatment programs for rural areas will be cut \nmore than one-third.\n  Funding for the Nation's existing water resource infrastructure--its \nsystem of dams, locks, harbors, irrigation systems, reservoirs, and \nrecreation sites--will suffer serious cuts. In the area of flood \ncontrol and storm damage prevention projects, where cost-benefit ratios \nexceed 20 to 1, there will be insufficient funds to meet the needs. \nAlready, there is a serious backlog of deferred operations and \nmaintenance requirements on existing projects. Our ports and harbors, \nthrough which the bulk of our Nation's commerce and trade with the rest \nof the world moves, will be seriously affected by declining investments \nsuch as dredging and channel improvements.\n  Under this budget resolution, the Nation's critical disposal of \nnuclear waste generated at electricity-producing power plants will be \nfurther set back. Over the next 30 to 40 years, estimates are that \nnuclear waste cleanup costs for both defense and civilian sites will \ntotal between $200 and $250 billion. What are we doing to the \nenvironment? What horrors are we unleashing with this type of neglect? \nDoesn't anybody in this town care?\n  The question is, Mr. President, under the constraints of this budget \nresolution, how can we possibly meet the needs of the American people \nacross the broad spectrum of our national life--from crime control, to \njob retraining, to better and safer highways and bridges and aviation, \nto drug treatment and prevention, to education, to research, to \nenvironmental cleanup, to clean water, and to programs which assist \nthose in our society who are unable to care for themselves and their \nchildren through no fault of their own?\n  How long--how long--will we continue to slash and burn these \ndiscretionary spending programs, while letting automatic entitlements \nand corporate welfare and tax expenditures grow and eat away at the \nfoundation of our national economy? Where is the basic common sense and \ndecency in this budget? Where is the basic common sense and decency in \nthis budget?\n  The amendment I am offering today will add $106 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority and $65 billion in discretionary outlays \nover the 6-year period of this budget resolution. And if it is adopted, \nwe will still be $230 billion below inflation over the period of 6 \nyears. For fiscal year 1997, budget authority, under my amendment, \nwould be increased by $7.4 billion and outlays would be increased by \n$6.3 billion. Similar increases above the amounts included in this \nresolution are provided for in each of the remaining years through \nfiscal year 2002. In other words, my amendment would provide for the \nsame level of discretionary spending as the Clinton budget over that 6-\nyear period--and that Clinton budget was $230 billion too low.\n\n  My amendment will bring that figure for outlays and budget authority \nat least up to the Clinton budget--namely, $106 billion more in budget \nauthority, and $65 billion more in discretionary outlays than this \nRepublican budget resolution would provide. We need more--much more--\nbut at least this amount will give us some little chance of meeting our \nminimum needs.\n  Furthermore, my amendment will eliminate the so-called defense walls \nfor the period of this budget resolution. But so did the Clinton budget \nthat was voted on last night. And every Democrat here voted for that \nbudget--other than this Democrat. It was better than the Republican \nbudget, but it cuts discretionary funding and cuts taxes--not as much \nas the Republican budget, but it still cuts taxes, which is utter folly \nat this time in our history. In other words, my amendment combines \ndefense and nondefense discretionary budget authority and outlays into \none figure for each of the fiscal years 1997-2002. Now, if any \nDemocrats here oppose my elimination of the walls, they voted to do \nthat last night in the Clinton budget, so they should not have any \nhesitancy in supporting my amendment. This will return us to the normal \nsituation under which the Appropriations Committees are given one \ndiscretionary figure for budget authority and one figure for \ndiscretionary outlays each year. The committee will then determine how \nmuch budget authority and outlays should be allocated to defense and \nhow much of the budget should go to nondefense spending each fiscal \nyear. That is the way the system is supposed to work. There is not \nsupposed to be an artificial gimmick to protect a sacred cow in the \nbudget.\n  In order to pay for its increase in spending, my amendment provides \nfor a corresponding increase in revenue over the 6-year period of the \nbudget resolution, and this increase in revenues is brought about from \na combination of closing corporate loopholes, extension of expiring \nexcise tax provisions, and/or elimination or modifications of the so-\ncalled tax expenditures. As shown on page 211 of the committee report, \nthe President's budget proposes $40 billion in savings from ``corporate \nreform,'' together with an additional $43 billion from extension of \nexpiring tax provisions. The Republican budget resolution proposes $21 \nbillion and $36 billion, respectively, in those same areas. It, \ntherefore, should be possible for the appropriate committees--Finance \nand Ways and Means--to find the additional revenues that I have \nproposed from some combination of those corporate reforms and extension \nof expiring tax provisions. However, if they are unable to do so, I \nstrongly recommend that the Finance and Ways and Means Committees turn \nto the issue of tax expenditures as another excellent source for \nachieving the increase in Federal revenues over the next 6 years, \ncalled for in my amendment. That area of the Federal budget has \nmiraculously--if you do not believe in miracles, here is one, in our \nown day and time--escaped the attention of the so-called deficit \nreduction hawks.\n\n  Few Americans are familiar with the term ``tax expenditure.'' Simply \nput, tax expenditures are tax dollars lost to the Federal Treasury due \nto special provisions in the Tax Code, which allow deductions, \nexemptions, credits, or a deferral of tax payments. The word \n``expenditure'' is used to highlight the fact that these tax breaks \nare, in many respects, no different than if the Government simply wrote \na check to the individuals or businesses concerned.\n  The plain truth is, Mr. President, that tax expenditures are nothing \nmore than another form of Government spending--back-door spending. But \nthese checks are written to those with special interests and with \nspecial influence in Washington. And they go out of the Treasury first. \nThey do not spend out over a year or 6 months like normal expenditures \nfrom the Treasury. They are gone--out the door right away every year to \nbenefit the special interests, before anybody else gets one thin dime.\n  Also, unlike the spending that is reviewed annually by the \nAppropriations Committee, once tax expenditures are enacted into law, \nvery rarely do they again come under congressional scrutiny, certainly \nnot with the frequency and the intensity of those programs which make \nup discretionary funding. As Dr. Paul McDaniel, of the University of \nFlorida, testified before the Senate Budget Committee, over 80 percent \nof current tax expenditures were also in effect in 1986--10 years ago--\nthe last time Congress gave these programs a thorough review. Just like \nentitlements, then, tax expenditures continue indefinitely, largely \noverlooked by even the most determined budget cutters.\n  According to the latest information available, tax expenditures for \nfiscal year 1995 totaled $453 billion, and are projected to grow to \n$480.4 billion for fiscal year 1996, $509.7 billion for fiscal year \n1997, $537.3 billion for fiscal year\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\n1998, and $568.5 billion for fiscal year 1999. Just for those 5 years \nalone, then, these tax expenditures total more than $2.5 trillion.\n\n  How long would it take to count trillion at the rate of $1 per \nsecond? It would take 32,000 years to count trillion. Over the 6 years \nof this budget resolution, total tax expenditures will exceed $3 \ntrillion. Should somebody not be taking a hard look at this huge area \nof back-door spending?\n  The problem, however, is not just in the aggregate amount of these \nprograms. Unlike traditional forms of discretionary spending, tax \nexpenditures circumvent the extremely important authorization and \nappropriations process. Because these provisions come out of the tax-\nwriting committees of the House and Senate, those committees become, in \neffect, both the authorizing and appropriating authority. That fact is \nobviously very appealing to special interest groups seeking Federal \nfinancial support, and there are lots and lots and lots of those.\n  Under the normal legislative process, anyone interested in obtaining \nFederal support must first begin by convincing the relevant authorizing \ncommittee to actually sanction their project in law. Even then, \nhowever, there is no guarantee that the Appropriations Committee will \nbe able to fund the project to the full extent that had been \nauthorized. And so it is not difficult to see that if a group could \nbypass that two-step process, they would have a much higher probability \nof seeing their interest fulfilled.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake, some of these Tax Code spending \nprograms are worthwhile and serve a useful public purpose. The earned-\nincome tax credit, for instance, has lifted many Americans out of the \ndepths of poverty--hard-working Americans, whose only ``crime'' is that \nthe work they do does not pay enough to support their families. Or the \nmortgage interest deduction, which has allowed home ownership to become \naffordable to many Americans that would otherwise be forced to forego \nthat part of their dreams.\n\n  However, although many of these tax expenditures are of significant \nbenefit to a great many Americans, many tax expenditures benefit only a \nvery select few. These expenditures should not be immune from review; \nour budget situation demands that we examine all spending. Whether it \nbe done through the appropriations process or through the Tax Code, \nspending is spending. A dollar leaving the Federal Treasury through the \nbackdoor of the Tax Code has just as much an impact on our budget, and \non our deficit, as does a dollar going out the front door--appropriated \nby Congress. That is the front door. It goes out the appropriations \ndoor. We simply cannot continue to ignore these tax expenditures in our \nbudget debates. It seems to me that the very least we can do is to \nrequire regular reauthorizations of all tax expenditures so that we can \nbe certain that longstanding provisions, which may have been justified \nyears ago when they were enacted, are still justified in light of \ncurrent budgetary constraints.\n  Take, for example, the mortgage interest deduction. This tax subsidy \nhas, as I just noted, helped millions of families across our country \nachieve what many would describe as one of the most tangible aspects of \nthe American dream--owning one's own home. It is, without question, one \nof the most valuable and worthwhile tax expenditures in our Tax Code. \nYet, in tight budget times, does it make sense to subsidize the \npurchase of vacation homes? That is what we are doing today. Current \nlaw allows taxpayers to deduct the interest paid on up to $1 million in \ndebt used to acquire and improve first and second homes, as well as the \ninterest on up to $100,000 of other loans secured with a home, \nregardless of the purpose for which that money is borrowed. Because of \nthe current tax rules on second homes, millions of Americans struggling \nto buy their first homes are, in effect, helping subsidize the vacation \nhomes of the wealthy. Worse yet, to the extent that the revenue loss \nassociated with the deductibility of mortgage interest on second homes \nadds to our budget deficit, the cost of helping wealthy Americans buy \ntheir vacation homes is simply being dumped on future generations of \nAmericans, rich and poor.\n  I say to my friends on the committee with the responsibility to bring \nforth the legislation to make cuts in entitlements and tax \nexpenditures--come on in, the water's fine. We on the Appropriations \nCommittee have already been exposed to public scrutiny in each \nappropriation bill every year. We have had tough, enforceable caps on \ndiscretionary spending for a number of years. We have always made the \ncuts to stay beneath those caps, and we will continue to do so. But, \nthe discretionary well has dried up as far as contributing further to \ndeficit reduction. Let us get on with tapping the more than $500 \nbillion that is spent each year on tax expenditures.\n  Since 1980, investment in physical infrastructure--that means \ninvestment in our own communities--that means investment in the \ncommunities of every individual who is watching this Senate Chamber \nthrough that electronic eye; that is your community--investment in your \ncommunity and in things that matter in the daily lives of our people--\nthat investment in physical infrastructure has declined, both as a \npercentage of all Federal spending and as a percentage of our Nation's \ngross domestic product. The cuts embodied in this budget--the here and \nnow budget--resolution only exacerbate, only make worse, this trend--a \ntrend that is both shortsighted and unwise.\n  Any businessman will tell you that a business cannot prosper for very \nlong if the necessary investments are not continually made in the tools \nand machinery that provide the engine for that prosperity.\n  The owner of a small manufacturing plant can, perhaps, delay \ninvestments in new tools and machinery for a brief period of time. He \nmay be able to continually piece that machinery together using \ntemporary fixes. But over the long haul, more often than not, the \nfailure to adequately invest in that machinery and equipment will prove \nto be a very expensive and costly mistake. In the end, that machinery \nmust be replaced, often at a cost that proves to be considerably higher \nthan the cost of continued and steady maintenance and investment. If it \nis not, then the plant will fall further and further behind and \neventually go bankrupt.\n  The same is true for our Nation's investment and maintenance of its \ninfrastructure. People need to understand that. Increasingly, in recent \nyears, we have embodied this penny-wise, pound-foolish frugality when \nit comes to our Nation's basic GNP generator, our infrastructure.\n  For the last several months, we have heard much debate on the Senate \nFloor regarding the tragic maladies that are brought about by the \nFederal budget deficit, maladies that we threaten to pass on to our \ngrandchildren. That is all true, but it is equally true that a less \nthan robust economy only exacerbates our national deficit problem.\n  I would like to take a moment to recount some of the maladies that we \nwill also pass on to the next generation for our failure to adequately \ninvest in our transportation infrastructure. How can we hope to ensure \na prosperous future for our children's children, if we leave the next \ngeneration with a transportation network so dilapidated, unsafe, and \ninefficient that it is a national embarrassment rather than a source of \nnational pride as has been the case in the past. How can we hold up our \nheads if we continue to let our national parks fall into disrepair, our \nsewers deteriorate, our air become filthy, our drinking water become \npolluted, our schools and our bridges become dilapidated and our \nhighways become pitted, potholed nightmares? How can we be so blind as \nnot to see the relationship of that kind of neglect to our national \neconomy?\n  We heard a great deal about building the country's infrastructure in \nthe Presidential campaign 4 years ago. We never hear anything about it \nanymore. We do not hear anything about building our Nation's physical \ninfrastructure. We are going to wake up, though, at the end of this 6 \nyears when we find that we have let our country down, let the \ninfrastructure deteriorate, and then we will see what it costs to \nreplace it.\n  The American people are going to get tired of this so-called \n``Contract With America''--cut, slash, burn--and all of the tears that \nare shed for our children and grandchildren, if we do not balance this \nbudget. Yet, those same Senators\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\nwho are shedding tears for our children and grandchildren and saying \nthat we need to balance the budget, vote for tax cuts. It is all right \nto load that burden on our children and grandchildren, and they vote to \nsee our infrastructure waste away.\n  I am reminded of a parable in the Scriptures when Jesus was meeting \nwith his disciples in the Mount of Olives. In chapter 25 of the Book of \nMatthew, the King James version, we read this:\n\n       14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a \n     far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto \n     them his goods.\n       15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and \n     to another one; to every man according to his several \n     ability; and straightway took his journey.\n       16 Then he that had received the five talents went and \n     traded with the same, and made them other five talents.\n       17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained \n     other two.\n       18 But he that had received one went and digged in the \n     earth, and hid his lord's money.\n       19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and \n     reckoneth with them.\n\n  The American people are going to reckon with us. They are going to \nreckon with us one day.\n\n       20 And so he that had received five talents came and \n     brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst \n     unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five \n     talents more.\n       21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and \n     faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, \n     I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the \n     joy of thy lord.\n       22 He also that had received two talents came and said, \n     Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold I have \n     gained two other talents beside them.\n       23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful \n     servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will \n     make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of \n     thy lord.\n       24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, \n     Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where \n     thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not \n     strawed:\n       25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the \n     earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.\n       26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and \n     slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, \n     and gather where I have not strawed:\n       27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the \n     exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine \n     own with usury.\n       28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him \n     which hath ten talents.\n       29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he \n     shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be \n     taken away even that which he hath.\n       30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer \n     darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\n  Mr. President, there will come a day of reckoning for us. People are \ngoing to ask about our stewardship, and they are going to find that we \nhave been lacking. They will find that we hid our talent in the Earth. \nWe did not provide for the upkeep of their bridges and their highways \nand their sewer systems and their water systems, their parks, their \nforests. We did not continue the research that would enable us to stay \nahead of our competitors. We will have proved to be poor stewards. And \nthey are going to say, ``Throw them out.'' Take from him that hath not \nand give it to him which hath. We are going to come to that day of \nreckoning. The American people are going to get tired of this slash and \nburn philosophy. They are going to say, ``What has Government been \ndoing for us? What have you done for us? What have you done for our \nhighways and our bridges, our water systems?''\n  So how can we be so blind as not to see the relationship of that kind \nof neglect to our national economy? We are not increasing the talents \nthat have been entrusted to us. We are not investing so that we will be \nimproving on our country's lot, so that we will be rendering a \nprofitable stewardship. No, we are going to put our talents in the \nground.\n  Increased productivity means increased economic growth. Increased \neconomic growth means more jobs and, thus more income for the U.S. \nTreasury. Increased economic growth means increased national security. \nIt also means an enhanced competitive position for a nation. It means a \nhigher standard of living, and increased public investment also \nencourages increased private investment. Why not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Just a reminder to the Senator. He \nhas used 50 minutes; 10 minutes remains of the time requested.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield as much time as I \nmay use off the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if you had a company, let us say, and you \nwould like to buy a brand-spanking new fleet of trucks, all outfitted \nin bright red paint and chrome, how would you like to put that fleet of \nnew trucks out on roads that are filled with potholes and on bridges in \nneed of repairs? How would you like to have your trucks detour 18 miles \naround a bridge which was closed because it was unsafe? How much would \nthat cost? How much would that lower your productivity? How much would \nthat cut into your profits? You probably would be reluctant to invest \nin the new trucks at all. Hence, public investment encourages private \ninvestment and is conducive to the profit making of the private sector.\n  A sound economy will require continued capital investment in our \nNation's physical plant that not only replaces existing infrastructure \nbut also expands capacity to accommodate growth. Reducing the Federal \nbudget deficit on the back of critical capital investments will only \nundermine our national prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness.\n  And those chickens are going to come home to roost one day, one day. \nNobody talks about infrastructure anymore. People are going to wake up \none morning and say, ``Where have you been? Where were you?'' That was \nthe first question that the Lord asked in the book of Genesis when He \ncame into the garden looking for Adam: ``Where art thou?'' And our \nconstituents are going to say, ``Where were you? Where were you when \nthey voted for that budget?'' I am not going to vote for it. Folly of \nfollies. It cuts taxes. And so did the President's budget. That is why \nI voted against his budget. It is folly to cut taxes at this time. We \nought to be increasing our revenues and building up our infrastructure, \nbuilding our Nation's roads and bridges, funding our research needs, \nimproving our parks and forests, and cleaning up our Nation's water \nsupply.\n  We are on our way down a very slippery slope. Budgets are the basic \nblueprints for our Nation's future. If we continue to write budgets \nthat sap our vital domestic strength, we will shortly be on our way to \nThird World status. Then our people will ask, ``Where were you? Where \nwere you?''\n  The insanity in investing in everything but our infrastructure will \nbecome painfully apparent. When the backlogs are so huge that we cannot \nmeet them, we will rue the day that we demagoged and pandered.\n  Oh, you Republicans are going to cut taxes. We Democrats will also \ncut taxes. Pandering. That is pandering. The American people are not \nasking for a tax cut. We all say, balance the budget. Well, let us \nincrease revenues and pay for the Nation's needs. Pay as we go so that \nour country can be competitive in world markets.\n  We will rue the day that we demagoged and pandered and labeled all \ninvestments in our own country's basic infrastructure as ``pork.'' Is \nit pork to spend $10 billion on the Washington Metropolitan Transit \nSystem? No, that is not pork. This is the Nation's Capital. That is \ninfrastructure. That is not pork, that is infrastructure.\n  We have a deficit all right. And it is serious. But there is another \ndeficit looming on the horizon which is in many ways far more serious. \nOnce we allow America to fall into total disrepair, 6 years from now, 8 \nyears from now, 10 years from now, people are going to look around them \nand say: What has happened? What has happened to America? America's \nneeds have not been met, its infrastructure needs have gone to pot, and \nthe politicians squandered our rights.\n  Once we allow America to fall into total disrepair, how will we ever \nafford the trillions of dollars it will take to put it right? Then \nthere will be a big cry. All the politicians then will be for building \ninfrastructure, because the people will be saying: Where were you? \nWhere were you when this happened? Why did you allow this to happen?\n  So, I ask my colleagues to begin to turn this disastrous trend around \ntoday\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\nand support this modest attempt to answer America's most basic domestic \nneeds, and invest at least President Clinton's level of funding in our \nown Nation and in our own people. And he was $230 billion lower than \ninflation over a period of 6 years.\n  We are running out of time.\n  In conclusion, let me briefly describe my amendment once again. It \nwould add $106 billion in budget authority and $65 billion in outlays \nover the 6-year period of this budget resolution to discretionary \nspending. Total discretionary spending would then be the same as \nproposed by President Clinton. Too low, but at least that much. In \naddition, the amendment would do away with the defense wall for fiscal \nyears 1997 and 1998 as proposed by the Senate Budget Committee and \ninstead allow the Appropriations Committees each year to determine the \nappropriate level for defense and for non-defense spending. Finally, in \norder to pay for these spending increases, my amendment would close \nsome corporate loopholes, and do tax extenders as proposed by the \nSenate Budget Committee and by President Clinton. I would also \nrecommend an additional source of funds for consideration by the \nFinance and Ways and Means Committees--namely, tax expenditures.\n  I welcome additional sponsors of my amendment, Mr. President, and I \nurge all Members to support the amendment. I reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time consumed \nin the quorum call be equally divided against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4002\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding reimbursement of \n   the United States for the costs of Operations Southern Watch and \n                            Provide Comfort)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for himself and \n     Mr. Smith, proposes an amendment numbered 4002.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS ON REIMBURSEMENT OF THE UNITED \n                   STATES FOR OPERATIONS SOUTHERN WATCH AND \n                   PROVIDE COMFORT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) as of May 1996, the United States has spent \n     $2,937,000,000 of United States taxpayer funds since the \n     conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991 for the singular purpose \n     of protecting the Kurdish and Sunni population from Iraqi \n     aggression;\n       (2) the President's defense budget request for 1997 \n     includes an additional $590,100,000 for Operations Southern \n     Watch and Provide Comfort, both of which are designed to \n     restrict Iraqi military aggression against Kurdish and Sunni \n     people of Iraq.\n       (3) costs for these military operations constitute part of \n     the continued budget deficit of the United States; and\n       (4) United Nations Security Council Resolution 986 (1995) \n     would allow Iraq to sell up to $1,000,000,000 in petroleum \n     and petroleum products every 90 days, for an initial period \n     of 180 days.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the President should instruct the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to seek \n     modification of Security Council Resolution 986 (1995), to \n     specifically mandate and authorize the reimbursement of the \n     United States for costs associated with Operations Southern \n     Watch and Provide Comfort out of revenues generated by any \n     sale of petroleum or petroleum-related products originating \n     from Iraq.\n       (2) in the event that the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations fails to modify the \n     terms of Resolution 986 (1995) as called for in paragraph \n     (1), the President should reject any United Nations-\n     negotiated agreement to implement Security Council Resolution \n     986 (1995);\n       (3) the President should take the necessary steps to ensure \n     that--\n       (A) any effort by the United Nations to temporarily lift \n     the trade embargo for humanitarian purposes, specifically the \n     sale of petroleum or petroleum products, restricts all \n     revenues from such sale from being diverted to benefit the \n     Iraqi military, and\n       (B) the temporary lifting of the trade embargo does not \n     encourage other countries to take steps to begin promoting \n     commercial relations with the Iraqi military in expectation \n     that sanctions will be permanently lifted; and\n       (4) revenues reimbursed to the United States from the oil \n     sale authorized by the United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 986 should be used to reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on April 7, 1991, United States led \ncoalition forces and Iraq agreed to a cease-fire which ended Operation \nDesert Storm. Several days prior to agreeing to the terms of the cease-\nfire, Iraq initiated military action against the Kurdish population in \nnorthern Iraq and a Sunni Moslem population in southern Iraq.\n  Saddam Hussein's repressive actions against these Iraqi peoples \nincluded the use of helicopters flying strapping missions against the \nKurds on the ground. In southern Iraq, Saddam's Republican Guard chased \nthe Sunnis into the marshes along the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. \nAfter chasing the Sunnis into the marshes, the Republican Guard \nactually set fire to the marshes, burning many Sunnis alive.\n  Saddam's barbarism against these forces did not go unnoticed by the \ncoalition forces. General Schwarzkopf directly linked Iraq's repressive \nactions against the Kurds and the Sunnis to the cease-fire discussions.\n  On April 5, 1991, 2 days prior to concluding the cease-fire \nagreement, the United Nations passed Security Council Resolution No. \n687 and No. 688. These resolutions condemned Iraq for its repressive \nactions against the Kurds and Sunnis.\n  After adoption of these two resolutions, the Secretary General of the \nUnited Nations enlisted the support of the United States to engage in \nmilitary operations to protect these Iraqi civilian populations against \nSaddam's aggression.\n  These military operations became known, as we all learned over the \nnext few days and weeks, as Operation Southern Watch and Operation \nProvide Comfort.\n  Mr. President, that was in 1991, over 5 years ago. Since starting \nthese military operations, the United States has paid and paid greatly \nto provide this watch and comfort. The cost of these military \noperations has been tremendous, both in terms of money and in lives. On \nApril 14, 1994, the United States lost 15 American lives in a terrible \naccident, the result of conducting a dangerous and difficult military \nmission.\n  In addition to the 15 American and 11 foreign national lives lost, \nthe United States has spent $2.9 billion to conduct these military \noperations. But the cost continues to go up. The President's 1997 \ndefense budget request includes an additional $590.1 million to \ncontinue these military operations.\n  On April 14 of last year, the U.N. adopted another security council \nresolution, No. 986. This resolution provides Iraq the opportunity to \nsell as much as $2 billion in oil and oil-related products every 6 \nmonths for the purpose of providing food and medical relief to the \npeople of Iraq. The revenues are to be placed in an escrow account with \nthe United Nations.\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\n  Paragraphs (8)(b), (8)(d), (8)(e), and (8)(g) of resolution No. 986--\n1995--specifically authorize the use of revenues from the sale of Iraqi \npetroleum and petroleum-related products as reimbursement for costs \nassociated with the implementation of resolution No. 986--1995--or \npreviously passed Security Council Resolutions.\n  Iraq and the United Nations have begun a fourth round of talks to \ncontinue negotiations related to acceptable terms for implementation of \nresolution No. 986. One of the primary issues of disagreement is over \nwho would distribute the humanitarian aid. I must say I question the \nwisdom of handing fungible goods over to the Iraqi military and \ntrusting them to distribute them to the needy.\n  The amendment I offer today does not seek in any way to prevent this \nsale, nor does it seek to prevent efforts to relieve the humanitarian \nproblems of Iraq. My amendment is very simple. If we are going to allow \nIraq to sell oil to pay for humanitarian costs, the United States \nshould recover the moneys our taxpayers are spending for the ultimate \nin humanitarian assistance: military protection!\n  We are working on a budget resolution. We are working on a budget \nresolution that seeks to eliminate annual deficits, and, hopefully, \nsomeday even begin to reduce the debt. It is going to be very difficult \nto accomplish this if we have to continue to pay for these protections, \nthese military actions, to provide comfort. We pay the bill for it, but \nothers take the credit and get the benefit. It is the American \ntaxpayers that are paying this bill. I would like to see if we cannot \nfind some way to get a little help with these costs.\n  The Members need to understand that the U.N. resolution that has been \nconsidered specifically authorizes the revenues from the oil sale to \npay for U.N.-related costs for humanitarian assistance. If it is a good \nidea for the United Nations to be able to recover their costs, why not \nthe United States as well and the American taxpayers?\n  Frankly, it looks like the administration dropped the ball. Prior to \nthe adoption of resolution No. 986, the administration, I believe, \nshould have insisted that the American taxpayer be reimbursed for our \nbills from the sale of this oil.\n  Again, Members need to understand that the United Nations is seeking \nto use money from the oil sale to recover moneys spent for humanitarian \nassistance in Iraq. I do not understand why the President was not \naggressively protecting the American taxpayers the same way the United \nNations was trying to protect their costs.\n  There is one other thing that Members need to know prior to voting on \nthis amendment: None of the $2.9 billion the United States has spent \nfor these military operations has been counted toward our contributions \nto the United Nations. That is unbelievable.\n\n  Even though these military operations exist solely because of the \nUnited Nations request for assistance, the United Nations does not \ncount this $2.9 billion toward our contribution to the operation of the \nUnited Nations Numerous Members this past week have talked about how \nbad it is that the United States has not been fulfilling its payments \nto the U.N., that we are in arrears. They have been worrying about \nthat.\n  Some of my colleagues have complained that we are not paying our past \ndue bills to the United Nations But the State Department ledger--as \nwell as the United Nations ledger--does not account for all the \nfinancial support and support in kind that the United Nations receives \nfrom the Pentagon, for which the American taxpayer is having to foot \nthe bill.\n  I think this really is an outrage. If we are going to allow Saddam \nHussein, with all of his oppression and treachery, to sell oil, risking \ndiversion of the funds for more military modernization, more military \naggression, more development of weapons of mass destruction, and more \nviolations of international sanctions requiring weapons destruction and \ncessation of international oppression, I think we have to stand up and \nraise some serious questions about this.\n  We should, at the very least, recover moneys from the sale of this \noil to reimburse the American taxpayer, who is being forced to pay \nactually twice. We pay for the military operations to protect the Kurds \nand the Sunnis, and we do not get credit for this tremendous cost when \nthe State Department tallies our dues to the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider this amendment. It \nseems the fair thing to do. I understand the U.N. and Iraqi negotiators \nhave been considering how to distribute the proceeds from the oil \nsales. It seems like this is a time to move in there and say we are \nentitled to some recovery from these oil sales to help offset the costs \nof doing what we think is the right thing to do, which we are doing in \nconjunction with the United Nations. I urge the President to ensure the \nAmerican taxpayers interests are protected by rejecting any oil sale \nagreement which does not reimburse the United States for the cost of \nOperation Southern Watch and Operation Provide Comfort.\n  I urge at the appropriate time that this amendment be adopted. It is \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and I think that the American people \nwould support this effort very strongly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3991\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on amendment 3991 \noffered by Senators Kerry and Murray?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 45 minutes remains.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nfor up to 10 minutes off of the time allotted for that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in 1989, 6 years ago, President Bush and \nthe Nation's Governors recognized the critical need to raise education \nstandards in this country. They sought to raise standards that we hold \nour students to and that we try to adhere to in our schools throughout \nthe country. They met in Charlottesville, VA, in the first education \nsummit in our Nation's history.\n  They set ambitious goals to improve education by the year 2000. They \nagreed to measure their progress and to report their success to the \nAmerican people every year.\n  In 1995, last year, we reached the halfway point. The 1995 annual \n``National Education Goals Report,'' which came out last November, told \nus what had improved and also what got worse.\n  Some things were better: 4th and 8th grade math achievement had \nimproved; preschoolers were read to and told stories more than they \nused to be; according to the statistics we have, threats and injuries \nto students in schools had declined somewhat.\n  Some things, however, had become worse. For example, 12th grade \nreading achievement had declined; fewer teachers had degrees in the \nsubjects they were teaching; student drug use and the sale of drugs in \nour schools had increased.\n  The overall conclusion of that report last year was--this is a quote \nfrom the report--it says:\n\n       On the whole, our progress toward the National Education \n     Goals has been modest. Even in areas where we have made \n     significant progress from where we started, our current rate \n     of progress simply will not be sufficient to reach the \n     ambitious levels specified in the National Education Goals * \n     * * [Therefore, we need] to pull together as communities and \n     states to provide our children with an education that is \n     truly world-class.\n\n  Mr. President, 13 years ago, early in President Reagan's term, in \nApril 1983, President Reagan's Commission on Excellence in Education \nissued a famous report, a report that has become famous, entitled ``A \nNation at Risk.'' The commissioners wrote that:\n\n       * * * the educational foundations of our society are \n     presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that \n     threatens our very future as a nation and a people.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       [That the commission] deeply believes that the problems we \n     have discerned in American education can be both understood \n     and corrected if the people of our country, together with \n     those that have public responsibility in the matter, care \n     enough and are courageous enough to do what is required.\n\n  Mr. President, the responsibility to improve education in this \ncountry is a joint responsibility. We in Congress are among those who \nhave a public responsibility in this matter. Every year since the goals \nwere set, we in Congress\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\nsupported progress toward reaching those goals by providing some \nincreased level of funding each year until fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, let me just call my colleagues' attention to this \nchart to make the point I have been trying to make. This is entitled \n``A Break With Bipartisan Support for Education.'' It shows fiscal year \n1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, and in each year it shows some \nlevel of increase, in billions of dollars--some absolute increase in \nthe total dollars the Federal Government has been willing to provide to \nassist States and local school districts with education.\n  Last year, in 1996, for the first time since the summit in \nCharlottesville with President Bush, we saw an actual decrease proposed \nfor funding in education. Now, I am proud to say that before the final \nchapter was written on the appropriations for 1996, most of that \nfunding was restored. I do think the President deserves great credit \nfor having insisted that we do better by education than was proposed in \nlast year's budget bill.\n  Now we are faced with a very similar circumstance, Mr. President. The \namendment that is offered by Senator Kerry and Senator Murray would \nallow us to once again get on with bipartisan support for education. \nThis amendment restores essential education funds. It restores $56 \nbillion in funding over 6 years for the function 500 in the Federal \ndeficit--that is the education and training function. That is the \namount needed to get to the level that the President requested.\n  These funds are essential if we are to both maintain important, \nongoing educational programs such as Head Start and title I, and also \nhelp schools enter the information age by buying computers, connecting \nthose computers to the Internet, training teachers, and developing and \npurchasing sound instructional software.\n  The Republican budget, if this amendment is not adopted, would have \nthe effect of either cutting existing education programs or postponing \nany significant funding increase for technology until the year 2002. In \nmy view, schools cannot wait until the year 2002 to train their \nstudents to be computer literate.\n  The Republican budget proposal over 6 years would cut spending for \neducation and training by $25 billion below the level spent in fiscal \nyear 1995. The effective cut will be even greater because the level of \nfunding provides no money for either inflation or the rising \nenrollments now occurring in the schools. The $56 billion proposed to \nbe added back in this amendment is essential in order to maintain \ncurrent program services, to accommodate inflation, to accommodate the \nincreased numbers of students who are arriving at our schools, and who \nwill be arriving at our schools during these 6 years, and to provide a \nmodest investment in priority areas where we do have bipartisan support \nsuch as increased access to educational technology.\n  Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about educational technology \nas it applies to my home State of New Mexico. In a State like New \nMexico, this Federal support for better use and more access to \neducational technology will be crucial. We have some small rural \nschools in New Mexico that are already doing a good job of integrating \nthe use of technology into the way they teach their students. One \nexample is an elementary school in Tusuque, NM, where every classroom \nhas four computers that are both connected to each other by a local \narea network, and are connected to the Internet. In Cuba, NM, there is \na fiber network connection to every school in the district.\n  But most New Mexico schools are not connected to the Internet. Most \nschools are not able to train their students to be computer literate \ntoday.\n  A 1995 Office of Technology Assessment report identified New Mexico \nas one of the four most deficient States as far as the availability of \neducational technology is concerned. My State ranked 49th in the \ncountry in the availability of connections for technology use in \nschools.\n\n  Our Department of Education in New Mexico has estimated the costs of \ninvesting in the simple steps that are needed to put a computer in each \nclassroom. Their estimates give one a sense of the size of the problem \nthat is faced in a State like mine. Their estimate is that something in \nthe range of $53 million would be needed to put one workstation in \nevery classroom and principal's office throughout our State. Mr. \nPresident, $87 million would be needed to include a workstation for \neach administrator and classroom projection system, $156 million would \nbe needed to connect the computers and give them software and printers, \nas well as $22 million annually thereafter for the ongoing costs of \nphone lines and maintaining their connection to the Internet. Of \ncourse, even more would be required to train the teachers to use this \nequipment. The reality is this year our State legislature appropriated \n$3.5 million for equipment and professional development combined. That \nis a step in the right direction but it is far, far less than our \nschools need.\n  This amendment that Senator Kerry and Senator Murray are offering is \nessential if we are to install educational technology now rather than \nwaiting until the year 2002. The Federal Government has a \nresponsibility to ensure a basic level of equity in our schools and in \nour students' access to the new tools for learning. Technology can be a \ngreat equalizer. It can also be a great divider. If we allow our \nschools to be organized in such a way that many of our students do not \nhave access to that technology, then we are allowing technology to \ndivide us rather than to bring us together.\n  The workplace will demand some level of computer literacy from its \nworkers. Students from poor schools and poor districts should not be \nput at risk because their schools could not afford to train them to use \ncomputers.\n  This amendment is needed to allow a modest increase in the national \ninvestment in technology. The President's Technology Literacy Program \nwould increase the funds available to schools for educational \ntechnology very substantially this next year. Without such help, richer \nStates will supply their students with computer access to this computer \nliteracy, but States like mine, States like New Mexico, will not be \nable to do so.\n  Mr. President, I am persuaded that technology does hold real and \nrealistic promise for leveling the playing field between rich and poor \nschools, between rich and poor States, as far as education is \nconcerned. But to realize this promise we need to create a budget and \npass a budget resolution that permits us to both maintain essential \neducational programs which we all support, such as Head Start and title \nI, and also to invest in some of these new needs such as educational \ntechnology.\n  This amendment is needed to make our children computer literate for \nthe 21st century, to connect them to the information highway. I urge \nadoption of the Kerry-Murray amendment when it comes to a vote this \nnext Tuesday. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the status of the matter is that the Lott \namendment is pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Pete Domenici, for the \noutstanding work that he has done, and always does, on this budget \nresolution. He acts with integrity, with a rich understanding of the \nissues, and with extreme fairness to all of us.\n  I am in somewhat a rare position in this budget debate because \nusually around here, we find it easy to oppose the best-laid plans of \nmice and men, especially in this area of the budget, where one cannot \nget the job done without making some extremely unpopular choices. But I \nam proud to have been a supporter of the efforts spearheaded by the \nBudget Committee chairman and by our distinguished majority leader.\n  While also a participant in the bipartisan Chafee-Breaux budget \ngroup, with two trains leaving the station, it is my fond hope that \nmore of our colleagues will get aboard. But I will not count on it to a \ngreat degree. I see nothing conflicting between these two efforts. In \nfact, we ought to make every change in Medicare originally envisioned \nby the\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\nfirst Republican plan of last year, plus we ought to also make every \nadditional restraint on spending, as proposed by the Chafee-Breaux \ngroup, such as making adjustments in the CPI. That amendment will come \nbefore us, and it is a fine bipartisan effort. We hear a lot about that \nhere, but nobody ever does it.\n  Mark my words, this Congress will have to do all of the above before \nwe claw our way out of this deficit mess and a debt that, even if we \ndid it all right, at the end of 7 years would be a debt of $6.4 \ntrillion. This is not an either/or situation.\n  The one singular way to err in this process is to repeat last year's \nexercise and experience and get nothing done in terms of restraining \nmandatory spending growth. We presented the President with a balanced \nbudget reconciliation bill last year and he vetoed it. Did he veto it \nbecause there was something else waiting in the wings, something that \nwould be enacted into law and would get the job done? No, you bet not--\nnothing, nothing.\n  A perfectly workable balanced budget reconciliation bill was vetoed, \nand the resulting burden will be placed on the backs of the future \ntaxpayers. As a consequence, billions more are going sailing out the \ndoor on auto pilot. I hope we will do better this year, and one way to \ndo it is to enact into law one of the balanced budget plans before us.\n\n  Debate time is limited on this resolution, so I will make just a few \npoints that I believe are of importance. First, I call the attention of \nthe Senate to an amendment that was attached in the Budget Committee by \nthe occupant of the chair, Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota. It is worthy \nof our attention and commendation.\n  That amendment gives the sense of the Senate that our budget \nresolution should include an analysis prepared in consultation with \nCBO, which would show the impact on entitlement spending for the next \n30 years. That is one of the most important things we will do here. \nThis country is facing a ticking fiscal time bomb in the form of a \ndemographic explosion coming in the early 21st century--the retirement \nof the baby-boom generation. The real crisis faced by this country does \nnot occur within the budget window that we see here envisioned in this \nor any other budget resolution. It starts happening in a very severe \nsense around the year 2012, and it will mean disaster.\n  This is the work of the entitlements commission. We presented it to \nyou; 30 of the 32 of us signed it. You have neglected it totally, and \nthe President neglected it totally. But Bob Kerrey and Jack Danforth \ndid tremendous work. So it will mean fiscal meltdown if we do not \nchange our course.\n  We have had a number of hearings on this subject, and every expert \nwho has come before us has said we cannot wait to deal with this \nproblem; we must address it now. Every year we wait means more severe \nbenefit cuts in Social Security and Medicare, more drastic tax hikes in \nthe years ahead, and payroll tax increases.\n  But we are not making those tough choices in this budget. The reason \nis that we are simply not looking far enough ahead. If this Congress \nwould raise its sights above the short-term horizon, beyond the next 7 \nyears, it would see a disaster looming approximately two decades away. \nThe amendment of my friend, Senator Grams, is vitally important because \nit will force us to confront this reality.\n  Further, the amendment says that the President should include \ngenerational accounting information each year in his proposed budget. \nThis is a favored cause of mine. I think this is so important. My \ncolleagues may recall that when the President submitted his first \nbudget after his inauguration, it had a generational accounting \nchapter, which contained the alarming information that future \ngenerations stood to face 82 percent lifetime tax rates if present \ntrends are sustained. Some political advisers in the White House must \nhave dispensed with that one when they realized what it said that first \nyear when the President was seeking the support of the American people, \nbecause we have not seen that data in any subsequent budget.\n\n  I have asked this administration time after time, ``What happened to \nthe generational accounting in your first budget?'' No one in the White \nHouse has ever given me an adequate explanation as to why this \ninformation should remain concealed from the American taxpayers. They \nhave even asserted that the information now really is not all that bad, \nis not quite as alarming as before. But, still, they will not publish \nit for reasons that are vague and mysterious. Perhaps not so \nmysterious--it would have been difficult for the President to criticize \nour balanced budget plan last year if his own budget were to admit that \nthese confiscatory tax rates awaited future generations if we did not \nget the job done.\n  This is vital information, information about one of the greatest \ninequities ever foisted by the U.S. Government upon a generation of \nAmericans. And we ought to see it revealed. I commend the Senator from \nMinnesota for adding the language in committee, and I do hope that the \nadministration will heed it.\n  Finally, I want to advise my colleagues that it is now my intention \nto offer a sense of the Senate, which I hope would be uncontroversial. \nI ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4003\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that all Federal spending \n and revenues which are indexed for inflation should be calibrated by \nthe most accurate inflation indices which are available to the Federal \n                              Government)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], for himself and Mr. \n     Moynihan, proposes an amendment numbered 4003.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . ACCURATE INDEX FOR INFLATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) a significant portion of Federal expenditures and \n     revenues are indexed to measurements of inflation; and\n       (2) a variety of inflation indices exist which vary \n     according to the accuracy with which such indices measure \n     increases in the cost of living; and\n       (3) Federal government usage of inflation indices which \n     overstate true inflation has the demonstrated effect of \n     accelerating Federal spending, increasing the Federal budget \n     deficit, increasing Federal borrowing, and thereby enlarging \n     the projected burden on future American taxpayers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this budget resolution \n     include that all Federal spending and revenues which are \n     indexed for inflation should be calibrated by the most \n     accurate inflation indices which are available to the Federal \n     government.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, please note that Senator Moynihan is an \noriginal cosponsor of that amendment. It is simply a sense of the \nSenate that our budget choices should make use of the most accurate \nmeasures of inflation that are available to the Federal Government. \nSimply that, a proposition that I believe no Senator should disagree \nwith.\n  I believe it will be acceptable to the managers of the budget \nresolution, but I think a rollcall vote may be appropriate on this at \nthe appropriate time, simply because I believe it is so important that \neach Senator is on record as recognizing that we have an obligation to \nuse the most accurate data that we have, when billions are at stake.\n  We know that if we overstate inflation, it means that we erroneously \npay out extra billions in terms of cost-of-living allowances, COLA's, \nwe fail to properly index our tax brackets, and the deficit is \nincreased by billions--indeed, hundreds of billions, when counting over \na decade or more--as a result. This is not a matter of dispute.\n  This amendment, I hasten to say, does not condemn, nor does it \nenforce, any particular measure of inflation for any particular purpose \nof the Government. Because of this, I believe it must\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\nbe approved. It is my hope that by recognizing our obligation to use \nthe most accurate information available to the Government, the Senate \ncan subsequently proceed to best determine how to properly meet that \nobligation.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, and I ask the \nChair to please tell me when I have used that time. I take this time \noff of the bill.\n  Mr. President, it has been interesting to watch the discussion here \non the floor this morning with reference to amendments from that side \nof the aisle. Normally, I would say tax, tax, tax, spend, spend, spend. \nBut I choose to tell it like it is today. It is: Tax, Rockefeller; tax, \nBoxer; tax, Wyden; tax, Kerry; tax, Kerry; tax, Byrd. So it is tax, \ntax, tax, tax, tax, tax. Do you know how much in new taxes the \nDemocrats have recommended yesterday and today? The total is $188 \nbillion in additional taxes that is desired by those six amendments. \nFor what? To spend, spend, spend, spend, spend, spend. Most of them \nprovide for new spending--not in the budget--and for that new spending, \nthey tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax--six times.\n  What are tax expenditures and corporate loopholes? Frankly, there are \ntwo ways to look at it. One way to think about it is they were taxes \nthat the Government owned, and we said we are not going to collect \nthem. That is a Democrat version of a tax expenditure. The other \nversion is they belong to the taxpayer and not the Government.\n  Let me suggest that it is not easy even in our budget to find $188 \nbillion in tax expenditures and loopholes to pay for these amendments. \nIn fact, I do not believe that any Senator on that side would like to \nuse some of the tax expenditures that I am going to list. They don't \nwant to take it away from the American people. Remember? You take it \naway from them because you believe it is theirs or it is not the \nGovernment that should have had that tax and we did not want it, so we \nleft it with somebody.\n  Let me just give you some of the very interesting ones and put some \nnumbers up alongside them. We could eliminate, Mr. President, the \ndeduction for property taxes permitted under the Tax Code for all of \nthe people who deduct property taxes on property they own. Most of them \nown homes. That would be a tax increase of $79 billion. So we could \nwipe out that property tax deduction and still have to find $110 \nbillion more to pay for the Democrat amendments. Let us go through a \nfew more.\n  We could take away the one-time rollover of a gain on a personal \nresidence for people over 55 years of age. That could be one of these. \nBut that will not even come close to finding all the taxes the \nDemocrats want. It is worth $27 billion, not $188 billion. Let us go to \na few more.\n  We could take away--here is a little one. This might be one that is \ncalled a loophole. We could make it more difficult for startup \nbusinesses to get started. That is a $1 billion loophole. We could make \nit more expensive for communities to attract new plants and jobs to \ntheir communities. That is $3 billion.\n  Now, we could also take away all of the charitable deductions to \ncolleges, Mr. President; no more charitable deductions to colleges to \npay for this new list of spend, spend, spend. That would only bring in \n$13.5 billion.\n  So it seems to me that one man's loophole is another man's necessity. \nIs it necessary that we permit charitable deductions for colleges? I \nbelieve so. I believe it is very, very important. That is a necessity. \nThat is for education.\n  So that is what I have been hearing on the floor--close the loopholes \nto pay for the Government's programs on education.\n  How would the Democrats feel about repealing the deduction for \ncharitable contributions for education?\n  We could take away this deduction for property taxes--$79 billion.\n  Maybe one man's exclusion or one man's exemption is very important. \nFor others it is throwaway. What would the millions of property owners \nthink about that one? What would people with homes think of that one? \nWould they think that tax deduction is a necessity? I believe they \nwould.\n  I want to put it in perspective with one of the largest of all tax \nexpenditures so people can put this into perspective. Let me talk about \nthe big one.\n  The home mortgage deduction is one of the largest tax loopholes that \nwe have. Since we are using the word ``loophole,'' let us use it. I do \nnot think it is a loophole. I think it is a necessity. By allowing a \ndeduction for mortgage interest, the Government foregoes $330 billion \nin revenue collection over 6 years.\n  These amendments, 188 billion dollars' worth of increase in taxes \nover 6 years--all of these numbers I have spoken of are over 6 years--\nwould be well over half the home mortgage deductions for Americans.\n  So, Mr. President, I did not answer each amendment in detail. We will \ntake a few minutes on each of the six amendments that I have just \nalluded to in detail. I will answer on Monday or Tuesday the attack on \neducation. We will have some other Senators talk about it. But I just \nthought, since it was interesting, that there was one trend which went \nthrough all of them, and it was, let us pay for them by raising taxes, \nnot by restraining the spending. So, if you have a priority, maybe you \ncan find in this huge budget something you could restrain and pay for \nit. That is generally what people think we are doing up here. They do \nnot think we are restraining a program and imposing a new tax. The way \nto get around it is to say we are not imposing a new tax because it is \na loophole.\n\n  Mr. President, later on I will discuss the education situation from \nthe broader standpoint of how much we spend on education, how much the \nFederal Government spends, and how much all of the States and \nlocalities pay. So the public, if they are interested in this debate, \ncan see in perspective what these budgets are relative to the total \namount being spent on education.\n  I believe those who watch it later on will be absolutely amazed to \nhave heard arguments that these changes in education are going to make \nus less able to compete in the world markets and that millions of our \nchildren will not get educated. When we put it in perspective--how much \nthe States, cities, and counties pay versus the changes at the Federal \nlevel--they are all going to be able to see that it is a very, very \nsmall portion of the education dollar.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Simpson's \namendment be laid aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4004\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the costs of training \n                   sessions off of Federal property.)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), for Mr. \n     Coverdell, proposes an amendment numbered 4004.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC  .SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FEDERAL RETREATS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that all Federal agencies will refrain from using Federal \n     funds for expenses incurred during training sessions or \n     retreats off of Federal property, unless Federal property is \n     not available.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment regarding Government travel. My amendment is \nsimple--it says that it is the Senate's view that all Federal agencies \nshould refrain from Government training sessions or retreats whenever \nGovernment property or facilities are not available.\n  These are times of economic stress for our Government and businesses \nalike, Mr. President. However, like the business community, our \nGovernment should respond to the current economic situations. If a \nprivate business ran over $100 billion budget deficits each year, it \nwould certainly not fly its employees to Disney World or Jekyll Island, \nGA, as we have seen from Government agencies in recent months. However \nlaudable the goals of these training sessions, and I note that many \nare,\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\nindeed, helpful, we simply cannot afford to do it.\n  It is difficult to explain to Georgians that our Government must cut \njobs at places like Savannah River site, where we have lost over 8,000 \nemployees in the last 4 years, when they read of elaborate business \ntrips abroad and conferences held at resort locations. We must all \ntighten our belts--the Federal Government included. This amendment is \nnot intended to halt Government travel or interrupt necessary functions \nof our Government agencies. It is merely intended as a directive from \nthe Senate as to the Government's future travel decisions in lieu of \nour budgetary restraints. I hope that my colleagues will concur with \nthis commonsense approach and support this amendment.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, to accommodate the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, I ask unanimous consent that, at the conclusion of my remarks, \nwhich will not be extensive, I be allowed to yield 5 minutes off of the \ntime in opposition to the amendment No. 4002, the Lott amendment, to \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, which would be only 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have just listened with keen interest to \nmy colleague from New Mexico. I simply say that the remarks that he has \njust made is a typical case, if I have ever heard one, of constructing \nan imaginary, illusionary strawman and then tearing it to pieces.\n  No one has advocated eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. No \none that I know of has advocated elimination of the rollover or \npersonal residence proposition that was alluded to by the Senator from \nNew Mexico. No one has advocated eliminating charitable deductions. No, \nMr. President. And I do not believe it contributes a great deal to the \nlegitimate discussion of the budget with those kinds of gimmicks.\n  I simply say that what we are doing here is trying to repair serious \nfaults in the Republican budget. We did that last year in the \nRepublican budget. The American people said, ``You are right.'' We are \ndoing it in this budget, and I believe that the American people will \nsay again that the Republicans are overdoing it. There is nothing wrong \nwith various amendments that are being offered here that have been \nvoted or will be voted down. There is nothing wrong with using the same \nproposition to finance some selective improvements in the Republican \nbudget that we maintain are particularly demoralizing for education, of \nwhich we have heard a great deal about today from various Senators--\nhelp for the needy of this country.\n  So for the Senator from New Mexico to come in and cite a whole list \nof billions of dollars, then set up a straw-man to what we are trying \nto do and indicate that we are going to have to eliminate deductions of \nhome mortgages, and so forth and so on, is just not accurate. I want to \nmake sure everyone understands that is not the intended result of any \nof the amendments that have been offered for our side.\n  Mr. President, to emphasize this a little bit more, let me simply say \nthat there is a great deal of confusion today that has us very much \nconcerned on this side as to the traps that are being laid down the \nline.\n  It has been interesting to note that during the debate the \nRepublicans have said time and time again that they have $122 billion \nin tax cuts in their budget. Yet, if one listens to the chairman of the \nBudget Committee on the House side, Congressman Kasich, he maintains \nthat it is not $122 billion in tax cuts, primarily to benefit the \nwealthy, it is going to be $180 billion.\n  Now, even people who throw big numbers around understand very clearly \nthat there is a difference between a tax cut of $122 billion--only $122 \nbillion, I say facetiously, in the discussion that the Republicans are \ncarrying on here on the Senate floor--there is a lot of difference \nbetween $122 and $180 billion that the Republican chairman of the \nBudget Committee on the House side says is included in this budget.\n  We are confident that there are some traps being laid. We are \nconfident that we are going to be back eventually into a debate not \nunlike the one we had last year that the American people agreed with \nthe Democrats on, and that is to balance the budget by the year 2002 \nbut do not complicate that problem by a massive tax cut that basically \nis designed to benefit the wealthiest among us.\n\n  I simply say, Mr. President, on page 3 of this year's budget \nresolution report it states that, in addition to the child tax credit, \n``The committee's recommendation would accommodate further tax reform \nor tax reductions to be offset by the extension of expired tax \nprovisions or corporate and business tax reforms.''\n  Let me read that again. In the Republican budget, it says, and I \nquote, there could be ``further tax reform * * * to be offset by \nextension of expired tax provisions or corporate and business tax \nreforms.'' That ``corporate and business tax reforms'' is just another \nway of talking about the tax loopholes, as we call them, for \nbusinesses.\n  Certainly I think that changes in some of the tax loopholes are \nentirely in order, certainly not the ones cited in tearing down the \nstrawman by the Senator from New Mexico. But I certainly say that I \nthink all Americans would realize and recognize and salute us if we \ncould do more to tear down the tax loopholes or corporate giveaways \nthat are clearly in the Tax Code today that encourage corporations and \nbusinesses in America to locate jobs in Mexico or elsewhere and get a \ntax break for doing it. Those are the kinds of loopholes that we think \ndemand closing.\n  The part of the Republican budget that I have just referenced goes on \nto say, ``Such receipts''--corporate receipts, tax loopholes, call them \nwhat you will--``Such receipts should be used to offset other tax \nreform proposals such as estate tax reform, economic growth, fuel \nexcise taxes, or other policies on a deficit neutral basis.''\n  That is a pretty typical case where the pot appears to be calling the \nkettle black.\n  Last year's vetoed reconciliation bill, supported by virtually every \nSenate Republican, included approximately $26 billion in revenue \nincreases for corporate and other reforms. President Clinton has \nproposed nearly $40 billion for corporate reforms in his balanced \nbudget submission to the Congress. Although the proposals are not \nidentical, the Republicans and the Democrats agree that significant \nrevenue can be raised in these areas without touching all of the \nstrawman that has been built up and torn down in what we have heard in \nthe Chamber this afternoon.\n  The committee report to this budget, on pages 63-67, describes \nexpenditures in our Tax Code that would lose hundreds of billions of \ndollars in revenue over a 5-year period. In that context, the \nRepublican proposals, as well, I might add in all honesty, as those of \nPresident Clinton, are modest efforts to reduce tax loopholes to \neliminate corporate welfare and to make our own tax laws more fair for \nall Americans.\n  Mr. President, our amendment ensures that these additional receipts \nwill be used to lessen the cuts that otherwise would be viewed as fair \nby some and unfair by others. But in any event, to use that means \nrather than help pay for additional tax breaks for the wealthy, which I \nthink we will eventually see emerge with great interest.\n  I now suggest that we yield to the Senator from Rhode Island under \nthe previous unanimous-consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lott). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4002\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I oppose amendment 4002. Not only does it \ndemand that the President do something that is not within his power, \nbut it also encourages a course of action that would undermine United \nStates interests with regard to Iraq.\n  Some time ago, the U.N. Security Council passed resolution 986 to \nenable the sale of Iraqi oil and to use the proceeds for specific \npurposes--mostly to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of \nIraq. Some of the funds would also be channeled to the U.N. Special \nCommission on Iraq--also known as UNSCOM--which is charged with \nmonitoring and dismantling Iraq's special weapons programs, and to the \nCompensation Committee--which is settling international claims against \nIraq.\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\n  This resolution would urge that the President renegotiate the terms \nof the deal so that the proceeds would go to the United States \nDepartment of Defense in order to fund Operation Southern Watch--the \nno-fly zone in southern Iraq, and Operation Provide Comfort--the no-fly \nzone in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n  The President does not have the power to renegotiate the deal. \nResolution 986 was passed some time ago by the Security Council and \ncannot be altered. The United States voted for the resolution because \nit was concerned about the welfare of the Iraqi people, who were \nsuffering under Saddam Hussein's authoritarian regime. At the time the \nU.N. resolution passed, it was becoming increasingly clear that the \nanti-Iraq coalition was beginning to fracture, and some of our allies \nwere beginning to call for the lifting of sanctions against Iraq. The \nSecurity Council resolution offered a rock-solid compromise: Iraqi oil \ncould be sold, the proceeds used for humanitarian and security \npurposes, and strict monitoring procedures would be put in place such \nthat Iraq could in no way benefit from the arrangements. If we were to \nreopen the compromise to discussion now, we may well be opening the \ndoor for erosion of the sanctions regime against Iraq. I doubt very \nmuch that the Senate would wish to do this.\n  Furthermore, if the President were to try to do what is contemplated \nin the amendment--and I repeat, he has no standing to do so--then we \nwould put other important objectives toward Iraq in doubt. We would \nsuggest that we do not support the work of UNSCOM, which has done \ninvaluable work in seeing that Iraq will no longer be able to threaten \nthe world with weapons of mass destruction. We would suggest that the \ninternational community--including United States businesspersons--does \nnot have the right to be compensated for claims against Iraq. We would \nsuggest that Kuwait--the unfortunate object of Saddam Hussein's \nobsessions--does not have a right to be compensated for war damage. And \nworst of all, we would suggest to innocent Iraqis that we oppose them \nas a people and do not care about their treatment by Saddam Hussein.\n  I well recall the many times that President Bush said during the \nPersian Gulf war that we have no quarrel with the Iraqi people, and \ncalled upon them to oppose Saddam Hussein. If we cavalierly suspend \nefforts to provide humanitarian assistance, the Iraqi people will only \ndraw the conclusion that the United States is against them and wants to \npunish them for the sins of Saddam. I can think of no more effective \nway to bolster Saddam's standing in the eyes of the Iraqi people than \nto follow the course of action recommended in this amendment.\n  I do not quarrel with the thought that the President should seek \ncompensation wherever possible for U.S. operations that support U.N. \nmissions. But in the case of Provide Comfort and Southern Watch, both \noperations clearly serve U.S. interests. We shouldn't insist on U.N. \ncompensation for operations that are so important to our own country--\nand jeopardize other humanitarian and security objectives in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I defer to none when it comes to Iraq. I introduced \nthe first-ever sanctions bill against Iraq in 1988, well before it was \npopular or politic to oppose the Saddam Hussein regime. I am certain, \nhowever, the U.N. Security Council Resolution 986 is well-crafted and, \nif implemented, will serve U.S. foreign policy and national security \ninterests. We should not try to tinker with it now, particularly for \nreasons that are as suspect as those put forth in the amendment.\n  I strongly oppose this resolution, and urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need off \nthe resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4003\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, there are two or three things I would like \nto, maybe, attempt to clear up. We have looked through the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming. It appears to me that the \namendment, as we read it, from the Senator from Wyoming is, in effect, \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution that urges Government to use the most \naccurate possible information index available, as far as CPI allowances \nare concerned.\n  We have surveyed our Members on this side, and there is generally \nwide agreement in this proposition, because it basically says we should \ndo what is right and fair on this CPI matter. So if we can move things \nalong, we are prepared, when someone is here, to agree, to offer to \naccept the amendment by the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I just make that announcement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4004\n\n  The second thing I would like to bring up a little bit now, just so \nwe have a basic understanding on these things, is yesterday we made an \nagreement that all amendments had to be filed with the managers of the \nbill at a time certain last night. We received a unanimous consent \nagreement that be done. I certainly do not wish to be hard-nosed on \nthis matter, but it appears to this side that the amendment recently \nsent to the desk by the Senator from Georgia was not on the list of \namendments, at least not the one that we had, that was included in the \nunanimous consent last night.\n  Under that situation, it would take unanimous consent for the Senator \nfrom Georgia to have his amendment considered. I would say, in all \nprobability we might not object to a unanimous consent request in that \nregard, because we do not want to just arbitrarily shut people out, \nbecause sometime tomorrow we may have a situation where some Democrat \ninadvertently was overlooked with regard to a slot to offer what they \nconsider to be a very important amendment.\n  So I hope the majority will show us the same courtesy that we are now \nshowing them, to recognize and realize that there may be times when it \nonly makes good, common sense--and maybe to enhance the comity around \nhere a little bit--we should realize and recognize that the best of \nman's plans sometimes go astray.\n  I do not oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Georgia. I \nhave not made a decision on how I would vote on that, but I would \nsimply say maybe we can work out some kind of an accommodation. At the \nproper time, we would like an explanation of how the Senator from \nGeorgia made and obtained the right to offer his amendment without \nconsultation with us, because it appears, at least, to be a violation \nof what we agreed to. But maybe we can work something out.\n  So, simply saying, going back to the matter of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Wyoming, we are prepared to accept that amendment \nif we can move things along this afternoon, which we are trying to do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Since I see no other Senators on the floor seeking recognition to \nspeak at this time or to offer an amendment, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask unanimous consent the time of the quorum call be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  A quorum is not present. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set \naside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3992 and 4004\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask that we call up amendment No. \n4004, and I call for its adoption. It is my understanding that this was \nnot on the original list. It is just an administrative error in its \nsubmission. But I understand we have reached agreement on this. This \namendment will be accepted, and one of the other amendments on the \nother side will be accepted.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I agree with the statement made by the \nSenator from Georgia. We have agreed to accept his amendment, and, in \nturn, we have reached an agreement on the\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\namendment that is at the desk that was discussed earlier today by \nSenator Murray from Washington, amendment No. 3992, which I call up at \nthis time. If we can adopt both of these amendments, which I think have \nbeen cleared on both sides, then we are one step closer to being \nsuccessful in finishing this debate, hopefully, sometime by Tuesday.\n  So I call up the Murray amendment No. 3992.\n  All time has been yielded back on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to adoption of both \namendment No. 3992 and amendment No. 4004?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3992 and 4004) were agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, there are two additional amendments that I \nunderstand have been cleared. I thought they had been cleared. I have \njust been notified they have not necessarily been cleared.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the quorum call be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have two additional amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides. I believe that the Senator from Washington \nis on his way to the floor to clear both of these. I will just simply \nstate that the two amendments that we have agreed to clear are one \noffered by Senator Snowe and Senator Feinstein to Senate Concurrent \nResolution 57, and the other offered by the two Senators from the State \nof Montana, Senator Baucus and Senator Burns, to Senate Concurrent \nResolution 57. Both of these have been cleared on both sides. When the \nSenator from Washington arrives, I believe it will be for him to ask \nfor the unanimous consent. When that happens, we will get these passed.\n  Following that, I hope that, with the usual procedures of moving from \none side to the other, that the Senator from North Dakota will be \nrecognized for the purpose of making a statement and/or the possibility \nof offering an amendment, as soon as we have cleared these two \namendments.\n  Mr. President, in view of the fact that we are temporarily held up on \nclearing these two amendments, I yield 5 minutes off the bill to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I observe that I admire the work of the Senator from Nebraska, \nSenator Exon, on this budget legislation. I also admire the work of the \nSenator from New Mexico. I know they come to the floor, and it is not \nan easy job to try to steer these pieces of legislation through the \nSenate. As I indicated, even though we have some disagreements from \ntime to time on some of these things, I equally admire their commitment \nand their work.\n  The budget that is brought to the floor of the Senate truly \nestablishes what this country perceives to be its priorities. The one \nthing that is certain about all of this is 100 years from now, none of \nus will be here. No one. Not anyone within the sound of my voice will \nbe here 100 years from now. If those living 100 years from now wanted \nto look back and understand a little bit about what we were about, what \nwe treasured, what we valued, what we thought was important to our \ncountry, one way for them to evaluate that would be to look at the \nFederal budget. What choices did this group of Americans make about \nhow to educate their children? How did we provide for their health care \nneeds? What kind of a defense system did they need, and at what cost? \nHow did they respond to the issues of poverty and hunger? You could \nlook at the Federal budget and make some judgments about what \npriorities did this particular Senate or did this Congress think were \nimportant and were dear to it.\n\n  There are common goals, it seems to me, notwithstanding the \ndisagreements we have heard on the floor of the Senate in recent days. \nThe common goal is to balance the Federal budget. I know some can point \nacross one side of the aisle or the other and say, ``You didn't care. \nYou are spenders,'' or ``You are taxers.'' The fact is, everybody here \nwants to see a budget that is in some reasonable balance.\n  The other objective I think most of us would agree on is, we must \nmeet the needs this country has. We must address the issue of defense, \nyes, education, health care, crime, and poverty. We must address those \nissues.\n  I have heard a lot of discussion in recent days about the record of \nthe current administration, the record of Congress. I think it is \nimportant to understand that the Government is smaller now than at any \ntime since John F. Kennedy was President.\n  This President, President Clinton, and Vice President Gore have \ndeveloped a ``reinventing Government'' strategy that has cut 200,000 \nFederal workers from the work force; 200,000 people who used to work in \nthe Federal Government do not work in the Federal Government now. It is \na Government that is 200,000 people smaller than when this President \ntook office.\n  It is the lowest number of employees working on the Federal payroll \nsince John F. Kennedy was President, the lowest percent of Federal \nspending related to the gross domestic product since 1979. Back when \nPresident Reagan was President, we were up around 24 percent of GDP \nbeing spent by the Federal Government. It has decreased down to about \n22 percent, slightly over 22 percent.\n  The deficit: The deficit has been cut very substantially, almost in \nhalf. The fact is, we have made some progress in some of these areas. \nPart of it was because of the 1993 act which we passed, which was kind \nof a tough thing to do, and cut spending in a significant way. It also \nincreased some taxes. I voted for that. It was not a popular vote. I am \npleased I did because it was the right thing to do. The economy has \nincreased. We have had more economic activity. I think it was the right \nthing to do.\n  As we discuss the priorities out here and talk about what is \nimportant and what is not, one thing that is obvious to all of us--it \ntakes no skill to tear things down. That is a job for unskilled people, \nto tear things down. If you are going to tear a building down, who are \nyou going to hire? A person with skills? You do not need people with \nskills. You hire unskilled people to tear things down. You hire skilled \nworkers to build things.\n\n  I am pleased to be a part of a group of people who have been \nbuilders. We said this country would benefit by a program called Head \nStart. It works. It invests in the lives of the young children ages 3 \nand 4 and 5. It invests in young children's lives who are coming from \nfamilies of disadvantage and low income and have suffered some \ndifficulty. We know that it saves an enormous amount of money, and it \nhelps these young children.\n  I just use Head Start as an example, but there are others, plenty of \nothers. We know that research at the National Institutes of Health \nworks. What about this breathtaking miracle of giving people eyesight \nthrough removing cataracts, new knees, new hips, open-heart surgery? \nWhat about all of the research that is going on down at the National \nInstitutes of Health that saves people's lives?\n  At the turn of this century, people lived to be 48 years of age. Now \nit is 78. Is that an accident? I do not think so. It is because some \npeople in these Chambers decided, let us invest some money in health \nresearch through the National Institutes of Health. It has been \nremarkably successful.\n  We are talking about a whole range of issues that are very important \nto the future of this country: teachers, education, health care \nresearch, Head Start. I can go on--the WIC Program, investment in cops \non the beat, an investment to try to deal with crime, a whole range of \nsimilar issues.\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\n  As we work our way through it, we have disagreements about what is \nimportant. Some are going to bring to the floor of the Senate in a week \nor so a national missile defense program, $40 to $60 billion to spend \nto create an astrodome over America, apparently, to protect us against \nincoming missiles--$40 to $60 billion. When we talk about those \nprograms, the sky's the limit.\n  In fact, in this budget on defense, it is $11 billion more than the \nDefense Department said it wanted. It asks to build trucks that are not \nneeded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In the military, they asked for trucks that were not \nneeded, for planes that were not requested, for submarines that no one \nwanted, because they say, ``It's the defense. We'll stick $11 billion \nmore to that even though the admirals and generals said they don't want \nit.''\n  I hope, as we sift through these priorities, that we will decide \nthere is a difference in spending. Some spending is investment. Some \nspending advances this country's interests. It invests in human \npotential. It improves this country.\n  Other spending is wasteful. We should get rid of it. An agency that \nhas 16 pages of regulations to buy cream-filled cookies--that is dumb \nspending. An agency that has 1.2 million bottles of nasal spray in \ninventory--there are not enough armies in 10 years to need 1.2 million \nbottles of nasal spray. We should get rid of the dumb areas of spending \nbut invest in the things that are important for this country's future.\n  That is what this debate is about: education, health care, help the \nenvironment, things that make this a good place to live. I am proud to \nbe one of the people who I think have been builders to try to advance \nthis country's interests by investing in the right things, but by \nmaking sure that Government works, not wastes.\n  I will come to the floor at some greater length to talk about this \nissue of the Social Security trust fund, because this bill, I might \nsay, the budget bill that balances the budget, on page 5 says in the \nyear 2002 the budget is in fact not in balance at all, it has a $108 \nbillion deficit. How, you ask, did that happen? A $108 billion deficit \nin a bill they say is balanced? Because they will take $108 billion \nfrom Social Security so they can reach zero on page 1, and on page 5 it \ntells what we are doing.\n  I fundamentally disagree with the presentation made earlier today in \nthe Senate, and I hope we will have time in the next couple of days to \nhave a lengthy discussion about whether we will collect the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in the Social Security trust fund to, in fact, save \nthe Social Security system, or whether they will be used as offsets so \nsomeone can say they have balanced the budget when they have not. I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4005 and 4006\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are now prepared to move ahead. I send \ntwo amendments to the desk that I earlier talked about and said they \nhad been cleared. The first amendment is on behalf of Senator Baucus \nand Senator Burns of Montana. The second amendment is known as Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 57 and is introduced by Senator Hutchison, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Feinstein, Senator Mikulski, Senator Dole, and \nSenator Roth.\n  I send these amendments to the desk and I ask for their immediate \nconsideration. When the Chair asks for adoption of these amendments, I \nask that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table. I send the \ntwo amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] proposes amendments, \n     en bloc, numbered 4005 and 4006.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments, en bloc, are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4005\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the essential \n        air service program of the Department of Transportation)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESSENTIAL AIR \n                   SERVICE PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the essential air service program of the Department of \n     Transportation under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title \n     49, United States Code--\n       (A) provides essential airline access to isolated rural \n     communities across the United States;\n       (B) is necessary for the economic growth and development of \n     rural communities;\n       (C) connects small rural communities to the national air \n     transportation system of the United States;\n       (D) is a critical component of the national transportation \n     system of the United States; and\n       (E) provides air service to 108 communities in 30 States; \n     and\n       (2) the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive \n     Airline Industry established under section 204 of the Airport \n     and Airway Safety, Capacity, Noise Improvement, and \n     Intermodal Transportation Act of 1992 recommended maintaining \n     the essential air service program with a sufficient level of \n     funding to continue to provide air service to small \n     communities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the essential air service program of the Department of \n     Transportation under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title \n     49, United States Code, should receive a sufficient level of \n     funding to continue to provide air service to small rural \n     communities that qualify for assistance under the program.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me start by thanking the Senators from \nNew Mexico and Nebraska for their assistance in moving this amendment.\n  The amendment I am offering today is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nregarding the Essential Air Service or EAS program. It highlights the \ncontinued importance of the EAS program and provides that sufficient \nfunding levels be provided to eligible communities in the future.\n  Mr. President, rural America faces many challenges. I do not have to \ntell you that people in rural areas of this country are struggling. \nThey are struggling to make ends meet. And they are struggling with \ntheir transportation system.\n  In recent years, funding for transportation programs that people in \nrural areas rely on have been dramatically cut. Amtrak service has been \nreduced. Rural transit programs are disappearing. Highway funds are \nthreatened. And the Essential Air Service program is constantly under \nattack.\n  Without an adequate transportation system, economic development, and \njob creation in these areas cannot take place. Just as urban areas \ndepend upon transportation programs, so do those folks who live in \nrural areas.\n  When Congress voted to deregulate the airline industry, there was \nclear recognition that some communities would be left without air \nservice. The EAS program was intended to be the safety net for rural \nAmerica. In order to protect those communities from losing air service \naltogether, carriers would receive a Federal subsidy as an incentive to \ncontinue operating in rural markets.\n  In Montana, we have seven communities in the EAS program--the most \ncommunities in the program outside of Alaska. It is a vital program and \nit is essential to many people.\n  The EAS program provides access. It connects the most rural areas of \nmy State to the rest of the country. I do not know if most Members are \naware of this, but Montana is as large as the area between Washington, \nDC and Chicago. That puts things into context. We are a big rural \nState.\n  That is why continuation of the EAS program is so important. Many \npeople in Montana rely on the EAS program. If they need to get to \nBillings or elsewhere to see the doctor or a specialist, they need to \nknow that air service is available.\n  And in order to attract new businesses to an area, there needs to be \nadequate air service. Many companies look at the transportation system \navailable to an area before deciding to locate. Without access to air \nservice, companies and the well-paying jobs they bring with them, will \ngo elsewhere.\n  I was very disappointed that this Congress cut the EAS program by 30 \npercent last year. The result of these huge cuts in the EAS program has \nmeant reduced service to our smallest communities. And the air carriers \nthat\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\nprovide this service have had to struggle to make ends meet because of \nthese cuts.\n  I fought hard against a reduction in the EAS funding. The EAS program \nis such a small program, yet it has been dramatically and unfairly \ntargeted. This goes against the intent of Congress when it recognized \nthat our smallest communities deserve continued air service. You can be \nassured that I will fight this year to make sure this Congress and the \nAppropriations Committees do not make the same mistake again. This \nresolution is the first step.\n  Again, I thank the Senators for their support.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this Chamber has been treading a difficult \npath in the last year. We want a balanced budget in the year 2002. We \nwant a balanced budget for the next generation.\n  I believe that as we set the budget for the coming years, we can find \nplenty of room for responsible cuts. This is also the chance to \nprioritize programs to get the best money can buy.\n  One important priority is accessible air service to all communities, \nrural and urban, across the country. The benefits of airline \nderegulation did not apply evenly to every community. In other words, \nfears that unconditional deregulation would compromise the quantity, \naffordability, and quality of air service to small, rural communities \nhave come true.\n  That's the very reason that Essential Air Service was created. It was \ndeveloped in response to fears that deregulation would leave holes in \nservice throughout the country. And although EAS does not fill the \nholes completely, it does help connect many of our small towns.\n  Air service is too important to our communities and their future to \nignore. In a time when communication is instant through computers, \nfaxes, and cellular telephones, people need to move around quickly and \nefficiently. Community growth through economic promotion and employment \nopportunities is hinged on adequate and accessible air service. Air \nservice is vital not only as a dependable mode of transportation, but \nas a way to pull communities together and promote economic development.\n  In my home State of Montana, where there are a great many miles \nbetween the dots on the map, there are few transportation alternatives. \nAmtrak serves the High-Line, and there is some bus service in the \nsouthern and western parts of the State, but for the most part there \naren't many ways to get from here to there. Add to it the unpredictable \nweather and you get a mix that makes travel often difficult and \noccasionally impossible.\n  Small, rural communities across Montana and America rely on air \nservice for transportation, economic development, delivery of \nmerchandise and services, and medical purposes. Every year Essential \nAir Service comes under fire, but it is still what the name implies: \nEssential. It is essential to the national transportation system; it is \nessential to the development and growth of small communities.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4006\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Congress and the \n President should immediately approve legislation providing homemakers \n               with equal retirement savings opportunity)\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the assumptions of \n     this budget resolution take into account that--\n       (1) by teaching and feeding our children and caring for our \n     elderly, American homemakers are an important, vital part of \n     our society;\n       (2) homemakers' retirement needs are the same as all \n     Americans, and thus they need every opportunity to save and \n     invest for retirement;\n       (3) because they are living on a single income, homemakers \n     and their spouses often have less income for savings;\n       (4) individual retirement accounts are provided by the \n     Congress in the Internal Revenue Code to assist Americans for \n     retirement savings;\n       (5) currently, individual retirement accounts permit \n     workers other than homemakers to make deductible \n     contributions of $2,000 a year, but limit homemakers to \n     deductible contributions of $250 a year; and\n       (6) limiting homemakers individual retirement accounts \n     contributions to an amount less than the contributions of \n     other workers discriminates against homemakers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the revenue level assumed in this budget resolution \n     provides for legislation to make individual retirement \n     accounts deductible contribution limits for homemakers equal \n     to the individual retirement accounts deductible contribution \n     limits for all other American workers, and that the Congress \n     and the President should immediately approve such legislation \n     in the appropriate reconciliation vehicle.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we yield back all time on our side.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we yield back time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4005 and 4006) en bloc, are agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President I allocate myself 5 minutes on the \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, as we consider the budget at this time, I think it is \ncritically important that we remind ourselves what the very key problem \nto the budget at the Federal level is and what ought to and can be done \nto correct the problem. I think it is important that we concentrate on \nwhat the basic problem is--Federal health care costs.\n  I am reminded of the words of George Marshall after World War II when \nhe was attempting to devise the Marshall plan. There were all sorts of \nproblems that were created and discussed and kicked around. Finally, he \nheld a meeting and said, ``Don't fight the problem; decide it.'' That \nis what I believe we ought to do here with respect to health care.\n  We have kicked around with changes to Medicaid. We have fought over \nMedicare costs. But the deficit continues to increase. About one-half \nof the deficit is related to the health care costs of the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs. Thus, as we go forward, it is clear if we do not get \nthe increasing costs of these programs down, the hope of having a \nrational budget in the years ahead becomes very difficult, if not \nimpossible. If these costs continue to increase at the current levels \nsoon it will result in about half a trillion dollars in the Federal \ndeficit. If we could take that half a trillion and use it for other \nmatters, whether it is education or whatever, then the cuts in \ndiscretionary spending we are dealing with now which are creating all \nof the consternation would be pretty much a thing of the past.\n  It is clear the most effective and most painless way to solve the \nbudget problem is to solve the health care cost problem. If we analyze \nthe problem and also look at the public's concerns and desires, it \nbecomes clear we can solve it by both looking to conventional insurance \nconcepts, combined with health care reform already under way in this \ncountry.\n  People perceive the most difficult health care threat they face is a \ncatastrophic medical event. I have a chart here which shows that what \npeople want the most out of health care reform is catastrophic health \ncare coverage. I emphasize the words ``coverage.'' Catastrophic \ncoverage is not a mandated benefit. You might remember last month I \nmade an attempt here to raise the lifetime caps in private health plans \nin order to ensure that people did not find themselves forced into the \nunfortunate situation of having to go bankrupt in order to qualify for \nthe Medicaid Program in order to have health care coverage. Mr. \nPresident, according to a recent survey conducted by the Aragon \nConsulting Group out of St. Louis, MO, 82 percent of the people fear \nmost that some day they will end up in bankruptcy and on a Federal \nhealth care program because they do not have catastrophic health care \ncoverage.\n  Let us take a look at what the present situation is, and, more \nimportant than that, see what we can do to solve the problem. Unless we \nget coverage to people--I point out that coverage is the important \nthing here. Right now we have millions of people who have no coverage \nat all because they work for an employer who does not provide coverage, \nor because individual health insurance coverage is too expensive and \nsince they are not wealthy citizens they cannot afford health care.\n  On the other hand, we have millions and millions of people who have \ncoverage but not adequate coverage. They can have interim caps and \nannual caps on coverage. As I talked about before, they can have the \noverall lifetime cap on coverage, which means after an arbitrary amount \nof money is paid out by\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\nthe insurance company or employer, then they have to look to their own \nprivate resources to finance their health care needs.\n  The best way to solve the health care cost problem is to use the \nbasics of insurance. As I will point out later this is not something \nnew. In the 1950's, the Eisenhower administration designed a \nreinsurance program that provided incentives in the market, very much \nlike the one I will outline, to provide private health insurance to \neveryone.\n  In 1993, the Clinton administration came forward with a plan. That \nplan would have, in the final analysis, provided health coverage for \neveryone. Eventually, the Federal Government would phase ourselves out \nof the Medicare and Medicaid Programs and we could end up with a system \nthat would bring the costs under control. However, that was thrown out \nbecause it was too complicated. So we moved away from that.\n  Around that same time, I had a plan I called MediCore which would \nhave similarly solved the problems--I am goal oriented--and would have \nsolved the problems by placing the States in a position where they \ncould ensure everyone had coverage and the Federal Government would be \nout of it.\n  Now, since that time, we have moved toward incremental reform. That \nis fine. The Health Insurance Reform Act, that we passed unanimously, \nwas a good first step. But this bill does not address how we expect to \nget our Federal health costs under control.\n  One of the most important issues we will be addressing this year is \nchanges in the way we finance health care for senior citizens, persons \nwith disabilities, the underinsured and uninsured. I wholeheartedly \nsupport reducing the deficit as well as moving the Government out of \nthe role of running a health plan for the elderly and the disabled.\n  The reason the Government's health care spending is out of control is \nreally twofold. First, is the way we have chosen to pay for purchase \nservices. When Medicare was designed in the 1960's it was modeled after \nprivate Blue Cross fee-for-service plans. The Government paid providers \ndirectly for each procedure performed. Paying for services rendered at \na distance without any effective utilization control has been a \ndisaster. Our failed attempts to control costs by continuing to cut \npayments to providers is a major reason our Federal deficit is so \nexorbitant.\n  How can reducing provider payments have the effect of actually \nincreasing our Federal deficit? The answer is the cost-shift this \ncreates between insurance provided by the public sector with that \nprovided by the private sector. Cost-shifting has only distorted the \ntrue costs of services and hides the inefficiencies in our overall \nhealth care delivery system.\n  Second, the private market's failure to provide affordable coverage \non reasonable terms to the elderly, disabled, and the poor led to the \npolitical demand for the Congress to create Medicare and Medicaid.\n  The major design flaw of these entitlement programs was segregating \nthe highest insurance risks into Government run plans.\n  This segmentation has not provided any incentives for the private \nsector to find innovative ways to manage the highest cost cases in our \nhealth care delivery system. As a matter of fact, this segmentation is \nhow people are shifted from private health plans to Government run \nhealth plans.\n  The key to getting health care costs under control and to reduce our \ndeficit is to utilize the most basic insurance principle of spreading \nrisk of aberrational cases over a large number of people.\n  This cost-shift from private insurance plans to the public insurance \nplans was the main argument I made during the debate we had on this \nfloor last month when we unanimously passed the Health Insurance Reform \nAct. You might remember an amendment I brought to the floor regarding \nlifetime caps in private insurance plans. The cold dollar facts proved \nover and over again were that by removing these caps we would save \nbillions of dollars in our entitlement programs.\n  The accounting firm of Price Waterhouse estimated the savings to \nMedicaid would be $7 billion over 7 years. The National Taxpayers Union \nestimated that the Federal Government would save $3 billion and the \nState and local government would save $2 billion over 5 years. In \naddition, CBO scored the increase cost to businesses already providing \ncoverage to their employees at 0.16 percent. Again the reason this cost \nto business is small is because we are spreading high-cost cases over \nabout 165 million privately insured individuals.\n  By the way, since the FEHB plans already have no lifetime caps there \nis no additional cost to the Federal Government as employer. This small \nchange in lifting coverage limits would provide the American public \nwith the same peace of mind we, U.S. Senators, have in the event a \ncatastrophic illness or injury hits one of our family members.\n  Central to any restructuring of the health insurance system is the \nunderstanding that what changes are made in the Government programs \naffect the private sector and visversa. The key is to find a mechanism \nthat can act as a bridge between the public and private sectors.\n  The solution that I have developed is a Federal Health Care \nReinsurance Corporation. The mission of this agency is to provide for a \ntrue public private partnership in providing affordable private health \ninsurance to all Americans The operating functions of the Corporation \nwill be contracted out to the private market, therefore the principle \nfunction of the Corporation will be policymaking.\n  The Reinsurance Corporation provides the market incentives for plans \nto compete and manage the care of people who have, in the past, been \n``dumped'' into the public entitlement programs because of high cost \nmedical conditions. All health plans will participate in the financing \nof high-cost cases and, therefore, all health plans may draw on the \nfund for assistance in covering expenses for qualifying high-cost \nindividuals.\n  Payments would be made to health plans on behalf of an individual who \nbecomes a high-cost case because of a particular medical condition. It \nis not a ``special'' health insurance for pool for individuals with \nhigh medical expenses.\n  The Reinsurance Corporation would make it possible for private sector \nhealth plans to compete for the chronically ill and disabled population \nsince plans would be protected against large aberrational costs \nassociated with insuring these individuals. In order to make it \nfeasible for private health plans to accept all comers it will be \nnecessary to decouple the reinsurance payment from the level of risk \nthat the health plans has accepted.\n\n  Once the fund is operational, it would no longer be necessary for a \nhealth plan to exclude a high-cost person: The correct market response \nwould be to apply to the fund for a payment on the person's behalf. \nSince the payment would follow the consumer, the consumer is always \nfree to change plans if he or she is not satisfied with the quality of \nservice in any particular health plan.\n  As we tackle one of the biggest problems for the Federal Government, \nour deficit, we must keep in mind a goal we all agreed to a couple of \nyears ago--the goal of moving toward universal coverage for all \nAmericans.\n  We must keep in mind that any changes we make to the public programs \nof Medicare and Medicaid must not add to the rolls of the uninsured, \nespecially if it is due to unintended consequences of our changes to \nthese programs. More uninsured Americans will only increase total costs \nto the health care system.\n  We must develop a mechanism that provides the private health \ninsurance market the incentive to cover higher cost individuals at \nreasonable prices rather than continue to allow the private sector to \nshift high-cost individuals into our public programs.\n  Prior to the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid, the Eisenhower \nadministration proposed to deal with the private sector's risk averse \nbehavior in health insurance by creating a Government-sponsored \nreinsurance program. The idea was to create a Government program that \nwould demonstrate to the private sector that private insurance of \nhigher risk clientele was feasible.\n  If designed correctly, the Federal Health Reinsurance Corporation \nmight be able to accomplish what President Eisenhower suggested over 40 \nyears ago, have a well-functioning private\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\nsector health insurance system that competes for all members of society \nsimply on quality and price.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, now is not the time to make the largest cuts \nin education in U.S. history. There is simply no growth in this budget \nfor our Nation's many important education programs. To my mind, if we \njeopardize the education of our Nation's children we are jeopardizing \nthe economic well-being of our country. A commitment to education is a \nstrong Federal investment that will ensure that America's children and \nfamilies are prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  Programs like Safe and Drug Free Schools, Head Start, Goals 2000, and \ntitle I are oftentimes the only hope for so many of the children \ngrowing up in disadvantaged communities. At this time, when student \nenrollments are at an alltime high, and expected to be at their highest \nlevel since 1971, we should be increasing the support that we send to \nStates so that they may further their own initiatives in key areas of \neducation. By making such drastic cuts in funding to these invaluable \nelementary and secondary education programs, the future of millions of \nchildren will be threatened.\n  Over the last 30 years, the dream of a college education has been \nbrought within reach of almost every American. As the population of \ntraditional college age students will rise by 12 percent over the next \ndecade, we as a nation must help keep the doors open to college and \nother postsecondary education opportunities. This budget would turn our \nbacks on the college-bound students of America. By cutting $6.2 billion \nover the next 6 years, 1.3 million students will lose Pell grants, \nwhile 800,000 students would lose work-study opportunities by the year \n2002. In the span of a little more than a decade, we have gone from a \nsituation where grants were 75 percent of a student's aid package and \nloan's only 25 percent to one where loans make up 75 percent of the \npackage and grants only 25 percent. To my mind, this is not the \ndirection which we should be moving. Now is the time to continue to \nassist college students in their quest for a brighter future.\n  I am gravely concerned about the direction this budget resolution \nwould takes us. I firmly believe that the drastic education cuts \nproposed would not guarantee that we as a nation are prepared to meet \nthe challenges of the next century. Our commitment to education cannot \nstop here, therefore, I ask my colleague to carefully look at the \nimplications of this budget resolution.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today the Senate continues debate on the \nfiscal year 1997 budget resolution. This budget resolution would \nbalance the Federal budget by 2002 using realistic economic \nassumptions.\n  Let me be clear, however, that it would have been my preference if \nthe budget resolution had retained the flexibility in the first \nreconciliation bill to allow the Finance Committee to develop a tax \nrelief bill for working families. However, I was assured by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee that the conference report on the \nbudget resolution will resolve the differences between the \nreconciliation instructions to the Ways and Means Committee and the \nSenate Finance Committee. I, therefore, urge the Senate conferees to \nensure that the conference report contain the option for some tax \nrelief in the first reconciliation bill.\n  Our Nation's working families are in need of tax relief so that they \nmay more easily provide for their children. I believe it is our duty to \nrespond to their need and give them a tax cut coupled with our efforts \nto balance the Federal budget.\n  Let me just say a few words about the first reconciliation bill that \nwill be moving through the Finance Committee next month. It is my \nintention to mark up the welfare and Medicaid reform proposals as \noutlined by our Nation's Governors.\n  This package will meet the savings goals outlined in the budget \nresolution with $72 billion in savings in the Medicaid area, and $53 \nbillion in the welfare reform package. The Governors' bipartisan plan \nprovides States with flexibility and incentives for moving ahead with \nfundamental reforms in both of these programs. I remain hopeful that \ntheir resounding support and unanimous vote in favor of these reforms \nwill help move this necessary legislation through the Senate in a \ntimely fashion, and that President Clinton will sign this bill--having \nalready vetoed two welfare reform bills.\n  Mr. President, today's budget resolution clearly demonstrates that \nthe debate over Medicaid and welfare is not about spending levels, but \ninstead about who will control the funds? Washington, or the States? \nThis Senator agrees with the Governors. Give the flexibility to the \nStates.\n  Mr. President, last year Republicans proposed to preserve, protect \nand strengthen the Medicare Program. We worked hard to put together a \nbalanced proposal that did not cut Medicare but slowed the rate the \ncost of the program was expected to grow. The budget resolution before \nus would also provide continued increased growth in Medicare spending.\n  This 1997 budget resolution increases annual per beneficiary Medicare \nspending from the current average spending of $5,300 in 1996 to $7,000 \nin 2002. This translates to 43 percent of the total program spending \ngrowth from 1996 to 2002.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to put an end to out of control \nFederal spending that has taken money from the private sector--the very \nsector that creates jobs and economic opportunity for all Americans.\n  The American people are crying out for a smaller, more efficient \ngovernment. They are concerned about the trends that for too long have \nput the interests of big government before the interest of our job-\ncreating private sector. They are irritated by the double standard that \nexists between how our families are required to balance their \ncheckbooks and how government is allowed to continue spending despite \nits deficit accounts.\n  I believe the outcome of spending restraint for our Nation is one of \nthe most important steps we can take to ensure the economic \nopportunities for prosperity for our children and for our children's \nchildren.\n  As a nation--and as individuals--we are morally bound to pass \nopportunity and security to the next generation.\n  The Federal bureaucracy must be reformed to meet the needs of all \ntaxpayers for the 21st century. I am convinced that it is through a \nsmaller, smarter government we will be able to serve Americans into the \nnext century.\n  The President's recent budget proposals for next year offer clear \nevidence of the lack of political will to make the hard choices when it \ncomes to cutting Government spending. His budget does not take \nseriously the need for spending restraint. In fact, the only path that \nthe President proposes is one that leads to higher Government spending, \nhigher taxes, and ever-increasing burdens for our children.\n  Deficit spending cannot continue. We can no longer allow waste, \ninefficiency, and overbearing government to consume the potential of \nAmerica's future. I am committed to spending restraint as we move to \nbalance the budget.\n  Mr. President, the Republican-led Congress has acted to restrain \nFederal spending many times over the past year and a half. After the \nPresident vetoed the balanced budget last fall, we moved ahead with \nother legislation that would help cut Federal spending. In fact, \nearlier this year, the Republican-led Congress passed the line-item-\nveto legislation, a tool that will to help trim Federal spending. We \nall know that we need every possible tool to help reduce Federal \nspending.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I urge \nthat they join me in supporting the budget resolution later this week.\n\n\n                      Student Loan Budget Scoring\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to call attention to an issue that the \nSenator from Illinois brought up at markup of the budget resolution \nlast week. He was concerned that a provision included in the fiscal \nyear 1996 resolution tilted the budget scoring of student loans in \nfavor of the government-guarantee program. Our intent was to conform \nthe treatment of administrative expenses of direct student loans to \nthat of guaranteed student loans and I have been assured by the \nCongressional Budget Office [CBO] that they understood and implemented \nthat intent. The Department of Education has interpreted the language \ndifferently than\n\n[[Page S5260]]\n\nCBO and therefore I can understand how this might lead some observers \nto question the actual effect of the change. Therefore, in response to \na request from the Senator from Illinois, I directed my staff to look \nmore closely at the issue to make sure that the language in the budget \nresolution fulfills our intent.\n  This is not the first time this concern has been raised by the \nSenator from Illinois. During debate on the budget resolution last year \nhe offered an amendment to strike the language. The amendment failed. \nFollowing that discussion, I directed my staff on the Budget Committee \nto draft a letter to CBO in order to ensure that our budget resolution \nlanguage did not bias scoring of administrative expenses in favor of \nguaranteed student loans. Their response was placed in the record \nduring debate on the budget reconciliation bill and I again ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In your letter of September 5, 1995, you \n     asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to respond to \n     several questions regarding the Credit Reform Act and section \n     207 of the 1996 budget resolution related to the treatment of \n     administrative expenses in the student loan programs. \n     Attached are CBO's responses to your questions.\n       If you wish further details, we will be pleased to provide \n     them. The CBO staff contact is Deborah Kalcevic, who can be \n     reached at 226-2820.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill.\n       Attachment.\n\n             Responses to Questions From Chairman Domenici\n\n       The Credit Reform Act of 1990 provided that the federal \n     budget would record the cost of direct loans and guaranteed \n     loans on a subsidy basis rather than a cash basis. The act \n     defined the subsidy cost of a loan to equal the present \n     discounted value of all loan disbursements, repayments, \n     default costs, interest subsidies, and other payments \n     associated with the loan, excluding federal administrative \n     costs. Federal administrative costs of loan programs \n     continued to be accorded a cash-accounting treatment. \n     Estimates of proposals affecting student loans made from 1992 \n     through early 1995 used the accounting rules established in \n     the Credit Reform Act.\n       The budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, adopted in June \n     1995, specified that the direct administrative costs of \n     direct student loans should be included in the subsidy \n     estimates of that program for purposes of Congressional \n     scorekeeping. Since June, for estimating legislation under \n     the 1996 budget resolution, the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) has used this alternative definition of subsidy costs. \n     In addition, changes in economic and technical estimating \n     assumptions complicate the comparison of estimates made at \n     different times. The following questions and answers explore \n     the implications of the change in accounting for direct \n     student loans.\n       Question 1. The President proposed, and signed into law in \n     1993, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program to replace the \n     guaranteed lending program. What was the time frame adopted \n     for the phase-in of that program when it was initially \n     enacted and what savings estimated was provided by CBO?\n       Answer. The President's fiscal 1994 budget proposed \n     expanding the direct student loan program from a pilot \n     program (which was about 4 percent of loan volume) to a \n     program that would provide 100 percent of all student loans \n     by the 1997-1998 academic year. As part of the request, the \n     President proposed to lower interest rates to borrowers as of \n     July 1997, substantially increase the annual capped \n     entitlement levels for direct loan administrative costs, and \n     subsidize schools for loan origination. The budget proposed \n     no changes in the guaranteed loan program except to phase it \n     out. CBO estimated that the proposal would save $4.3 billion \n     over the 1994-1998 period. These estimates were completed \n     using the CBO February 1993 baseline economic and technical \n     assumptions. The President's proposal became the policy \n     assumed in that year's budget resolution.\n       The legislation passed by the Congress differed \n     significantly from the policies assumed in the budget \n     resolution. The bill met the requirement to save $4.3 billion \n     by limiting the volume in the direct lending program to 60 \n     percent of the total and substantially cutting subsidies in \n     the guaranteed loan program. Specifically, direct loans were \n     to represent 5 percent of total volume for academic year \n     1994-1995, 40 percent for 1995-1996, 50 percent for 1996-1997 \n     and 1997-1998, and 60 percent for 1998-1999. The legislation \n     also provided that the ceiling could be exceeded if demand \n     required it.\n       Question 2. In his FY 96 budget, the President proposed an \n     acceleration of that plan so that all student loans would be \n     provided directly from the government no later than July 1, \n     1997. What ``additional'' savings did CBO estimate for the \n     accelerated phase-in under the Credit Reform Act?\n       Answer. The President's fiscal year 1996 budget request \n     included a proposal to expand the direct student loan program \n     to cover 100 percent of loan volume by July 1997. This \n     proposed change was estimated to save $4.1 billion from the \n     CBO baseline over the 1996-2002 period. That baseline \n     incorporated CBO's February 1995 economic and technical \n     assumptions and the direct loan phase-in schedule provided \n     under current law. This baseline reflected the rules that are \n     currently in law for estimating the cost of credit programs.\n       The 1996 budget resolution specified that the direct \n     administrative costs of direct student loans should be \n     included in the subsidy estimates for that program for \n     purposes of Congressional scorekeeping. This change conformed \n     the treatment of the administrative costs of direct student \n     loans with that for guaranteed student loans. For purposes of \n     Congressional budget scorekeeping, the change overrides the \n     Credit Reform Act, which requires that the federal \n     administrative costs for direct loan programs be accorded a \n     cash-accounting treatment.\n       For estimating legislation under the 1996 budget \n     resolution, CBO modified its baseline for direct student \n     loans to include in the subsidy calculations the present \n     value of direct federal administrative costs, including the \n     loans' servicing costs. The change means that direct loans \n     issued in a given year have their administrative costs \n     calculated over the life of the loan portfolio, with \n     adjustments for the time value of the funds. Therefore, the \n     subsidy costs of any year's direct loans will include the \n     discounted future administrative costs of servicing loans \n     which may be in repayment (or collection) for as long as 25 \n     to 30 years. The inclusion of these administrative costs in \n     the subsidy calculations for direct loans increases the \n     subsidy rates for these loans by about 7 percentage points. \n     Consequently, the resolution baseline for student loans is \n     higher than the current CBO baseline. Under the assumptions \n     of the budget resolution baseline, the President's 100 \n     percent direct lending proposal would save $115 million over \n     the 1996-2002 period.\n       Question 3. What would be the long term costs, under \n     scoring rules in effect prior to the 1995 budget resolution, \n     for the above proposal? How would those savings be affected \n     over the life of the loan? How would those costs be compared \n     with the same volume of loans made under the guaranteed \n     program?\n       Answer. The response to the first part of this question is \n     addressed in the previous answer. Compared to the CBO \n     baseline, the President's 1996 budget proposal was estimated \n     to save $4.1 billion over the next seven years. In order to \n     provide an estimate of a proposal to return to 100 percent \n     guaranteed lending by July 1997 under either the CBO or the \n     resolution baseline, we would need more detail than has been \n     provided on how the program would be restructured.\n       Question 4. Did the credit reform amendment adopted as part \n     of the budget resolution direct the Congressional Budget \n     Office to exclude any costs for guaranteed loans?\n       Answer. This year's budget resolution addressed only the \n     budgetary treatment of the administrative costs of direct \n     student loans. By defining the direct administrative costs of \n     direct loans and requiring these costs be calculated over the \n     life of the loan portfolio, the resolution allowed for the \n     costs of direct and guaranteed loans to be evaluated on a \n     similar basis. Thus, all of the program costs for both \n     programs are included in the resolution baseline and are \n     accounted for in the same way, whether they are calculated on \n     the basis of subsidy or cash-based accounting.\n       Question 5. Are there any expenses of direct or guaranteed \n     loans that are currently excluded from the government subsidy \n     costs that would be more appropriately be included in that \n     subsidy? If so, what are they and why have they been excluded \n     from the subsidy cost? For example, some have argued that the \n     credit reform amendment did not include the administrative \n     cost allowance which is paid to guarantee agencies.\n       Answer. Indirect administrative costs--those not directly \n     tied to loan servicing and collection--are included in the \n     budget on a cash basis for both programs. Some have asked \n     whether these costs would be more appropriately included in \n     the loan subsidy calculations. Although it might be \n     appropriate to include some or all of these costs in the \n     subsidy calculation, as a practical matter it is not \n     straightforward to determine which costs to account for in \n     this manner. For the most part the costs of government \n     oversight, regulation writing, Pell grant certification, and \n     other similar expenditures are personnel costs of the \n     Department of Education or contracted services. In addition, \n     many of the costs, such as program oversight, are not tied to \n     a single loan portfolio but affect many portfolios and both \n     programs. Allocating these costs to specific portfolios and \n     programs for specific fiscal years would be difficult.\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) \n     eliminated administrative cost allowance (ACA) payments to \n     guaranty agencies. Until that time, the volume-based payments \n     were always included in the subsidy costs of guaranteed \n     student loans. However, OBRA-93 gave the Secretary of \n     Education authority to make such payments out of the $2.5 \n     billion capped entitlement fund for the direct loan program. \n     Any expenditures from this fund would be accounted for\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\n     on a cash basis. If the Secretary chose not to allocate any \n     funds for this purpose, then there would be no payments to \n     guaranty agencies.\n       As part of its current services budget estimates, the \n     Department of Education announced plans to use funds \n     available under the capped entitlement to pay administrative \n     cost allowances to guaranty agencies at one percent of new \n     loan volume for the next five years. Both the CBO baseline \n     and the budget resolution baseline include these planned \n     administrative expenses on a cash basis under the capped \n     entitlement account at the Department's current services \n     levels.\n       It makes little budgetary difference whether these payments \n     are computed on a cash or subsidy basis. Because the payments \n     are made at the time of loan disbursement, their estimated \n     costs on a cash basis or subsidy basis would be essentially \n     the same. As a result, over the 1996-2002 period the cost of \n     the student loan programs and the budget totals would be \n     changed only marginally by accounting for these payments on a \n     subsidy basis.\n       Question 6. What possible mechanisms exist to reclassify \n     these costs as part of the Federal subsidy, to be scored on a \n     present value basis?\n       Answer. The guaranty agency cost allowance could again be \n     made an automatic government payment under the guaranteed \n     student loan law. Including the current cash-based indirect \n     administrative expenses for both the direct and guaranteed \n     loans in the subsidy estimates would require amending the \n     Credit Reform Act, but it would be difficult to estimate a \n     wide range of Federal personnel-related expenses over a 25- \n     to 30-year period. Determining whether some types of \n     expenditures that are now accounted for on a cash basis \n     should be included in the subsidy calculation would require a \n     more thorough review of the current expenditures of the \n     Department of Education than has been conducted to date.\n       Question 7. Does the credit reform rule adopted as part of \n     the budget resolution provide the proper framework to fairly \n     assess all direct Federal expenses of guaranteed and direct \n     loans?\n       Answer. In general, the Credit Reform Act amendment allows \n     direct comparisons between the costs of the guaranteed and \n     direct loan programs.\n       Question 8. Some have claimed that savings associated with \n     the Goodling proposal to repeal direct lending were a result \n     of excluding administrative costs of guaranteed loans. What \n     is the primary reason for the $1.5 billion in savings \n     associated with the Goodling proposal under the new scoring \n     rule?\n       Answer. On July 26, 1995, CBO prepared an estimate of the \n     original Goodling proposal. The proposal had three \n     components: (1) eliminate the authority for new direct \n     student and parent loans effective in academic year 1996-\n     1997; (2) change the annual and cumulative budget authority \n     levels under Section 458 to reflect the elimination of \n     indirect administrative cost anticipated for new direct loans \n     and the termination of payments of Section 458 funds to \n     guarantee agencies and limit the funds to $24 million \n     annually; and (3) reestablish an administrative cost \n     allowance (ACA) for guarantee agencies at 0.85 percent of new \n     loan volume or 0.08 percent of outstanding volume, with an \n     annual limitation on ACA subsidies of $200 million. Assuming \n     an enactment date of October 1995, the proposals would reduce \n     outlays for student loans by $227 million for fiscal year \n     1996 and by $1.5 billion over the 1996-2002 period.\n       Relative to the budget resolution baseline, shifting loan \n     volume to guaranteed loans would save $855 million over the \n     1996-2002 period. Administrative expenditures would be \n     reduced by $1.97 billion over the next seven years by \n     lowering the cap. Of this amount, $824 million reflects the \n     elimination of the discretionary guaranty agency payments, \n     and the remainder reflects the elimination of the indirect \n     costs for the phased-out direct loan program. Reestablishing \n     the ACA for a 100 percent guaranteed loan program would cost \n     $1.3 billion over seven years.\n       Although the Goodling proposal would have eliminated most \n     of the funds to oversee the phased-out direct loan program by \n     reducing the capped entitlement level for these funds, it did \n     not address the level of appropriated funds that would be \n     necessary to oversee the larger guaranteed loan program.\n       Question 9. Did the Goodling proposal to eliminate the \n     direct loan program and make changes to the guaranteed \n     program you were asked to score, address all Federal \n     administrative costs of direct and guaranteed loans? When you \n     applied the new scoring rule, were you able to properly \n     categorize those expenses to provide a completely fair \n     calculation of the cost differential?\n       Answer. All of the cost analyses of the Goodling proposal \n     for both the direct and guaranteed loan programs were \n     completed using the same budgetary treatment for both \n     programs. The Goodling proposal, however, did not address the \n     level of discretionary appropriations necessary to oversee \n     the larger guaranteed loan program.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the response from CBO confirmed, in my \nmind, that our intent to conform the direct loan scoring of \nadministrative expenses to the guaranteed loan scoring of \nadministrative expenses was fulfilled. In addition, the CBO letter \nnoted that we made no changes to the method by which guaranteed loans \nare scored. This too was our intent.\n  Mr. SIMON. I appreciate the Chairman's willingness to look more \nclosely at this issue. I understand and respect his intent in \nsupporting last year's budget scoring change. I moved to strike that \nlanguage, during debate on the budget resolution last year, both \nbecause I questioned the change, and because other budget scoring \nissues were not addressed at the same time. My concern then, and now, \nis that the scoring change may have gone overboard, either in how it \nwas written or how it has been implemented.\n  The Chairman has moved swiftly in responding to my request at mark-up \nlast week, and already a meeting has occurred among staff from the \nCommittee, CBO, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Education \nDepartment. I ask my colleague what his sense of that meeting is, and \nwhere we go from here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The meeting certainly confirmed that there have been \nconflicting interpretations of the language that was included in the \nfiscal year 1996 budget resolution. CBO insists that it has only added \ncosts to the subsidy estimates of direct lending that were already \nimplicitly or explicitly included on a net present value basis for the \nguarantee program. This was our intent. But according to the manner in \nwhich the Education Department has interpreted the language, they \ninsist that CBO has added costs that are analogous to costs in the \nguarantee program which are not being included in the subsidy estimates \nof the guaranteed program. I hope that the Department of Education will \nshare their specific concerns with CBO and that CBO will share the \nnecessary information with the Department of Education so as to put \ntheir concerns to rest.\n  Mr. SIMON. I agree with my colleague. CBO and the Education \nDepartment need to share data on this issue in order to answer this \nquestion. The meeting on Tuesday was a very good first step.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. With regard to the intent of last year's scoring \nchange, I wonder if my colleague would agree that prior to that change, \nthere was a discrepancy in the Credit Reform Act with respect to how \nadministrative costs are counted, which tends to make direct loans \nappear less costly?\n  Mr. SIMON. I would respond that there are a number of imperfections \nin the budget scoring of student loans, and that the chairman's point \nabout administrative costs is one of them. But on the whole, I believe \nthe imperfections create a bias in favor of the government-guarantee \nprogram. That is why I objected last year to addressing only the issue \nof administrative costs, without considering other issues. I explained \nsome of these issues in a letter to the chairman last week, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, 621 Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As a member of the Committee, I am \n     writing to ask that in the fiscal year 1997 budget \n     resolution, you delete the provision that was added to last \n     year's resolution relating to the scoring of student loans. I \n     explain below--with an example from your home state--why this \n     narrow ``fix'' is not appropriate. If you allow the one-sided \n     scoring to stand, I would urge you to at least apply the \n     language to FFEL as well as the direct loan program.\n       It is not appropriate to bend scorekeeping rules just to \n     accomplish a narrow policy objective. If scoring practices \n     are changed, all appropriate issues should be addressed, and \n     the corrections should be both balanced and comprehensive. \n     This is particularly important with loan programs, where \n     interest rate projections, the choice of discount rates, \n     varying tax benefits, and default expectations all play an \n     important role. As Lawrence Lindsey, a Republican member of \n     the Federal Reserve Board, pointed out last year in a letter \n     to Sen. Abraham:\n       ``Making the [scoring] change the industry proposes without \n     looking at other changes which might be necessary is \n     problematic. For example, the use of the ten year treasury \n     rate for estimating purposes when program costs are based on \n     short term rates creates obvious inconsistencies. Further, \n     the $2.3 billion in revenue loss that occurs through the use \n     of tax exempt student loan bonds is not taken into account in \n     estimating program costs.''\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\n       As Governor Lindsey pointed out, there are numerous \n     problems with the way that student loan costs are scored by \n     CBO (and in many cases by OMB). Let me discuss a few of them.\n       1. Current scorekeeping practices do not consider default \n     problems that plague FFEL but are absent from direct loan \n     program.\n       Three design flaws in FFEL contribute to default costs paid \n     by taxpayers. The direct loan program does not have these \n     flaws. However, CBO and OMB still assume that defaults in the \n     two programs will be identical. This makes no sense.\n       First, GAO has pointed out that perverse financial \n     incentives contribute to defaults in FFEL. The auditors have \n     pointed out that ``guaranty agencies have more financial \n     incentive to expend resources collecting on defaulted loans \n     than working with borrowers to prevent defaults because they \n     can earn additional revenue from default collections.'' On \n     the other hand, because direct lending uses private sector \n     contractors to collect on loans, competitive pressures keep \n     them focused on the task of collecting payments. Since \n     defaulted loans are moved to other servicers or collection \n     procedures, direct loan contractors have no incentive to \n     allow defaults.\n       Second, the enormous complexity of the guarantee system \n     causes borrower confusion and, according to the most recent \n     IG/GAO financial audit (February 1996), ``hampers the \n     Department's ability to obtain reliable student loan data.'' \n     This audit declares that ``[o]ne of the most significant \n     problems is that the Department's student loan information \n     system contains data that is not timely or accurate, thereby \n     limiting its use for compliance and evaluation purposes.'' \n     The number of lawsuits challenging default rate \n     determinations is testament to this problem.\n       Third, and perhaps most dangerous, are the conflicts of \n     interest that plague FFEL. Both the U.S. General Accounting \n     Office and the Inspector General have pointed out how \n     guaranty agencies risk taxpayer funds when they, or their \n     officials, also have financial ties to lenders, secondary \n     markets, or loan servicers. Indeed, the collapse of HEAF, \n     which cost taxpayers an estimated $280 million according to \n     GAO, was related to a conflict-of-interest problem. In its \n     March 1993, report, the IG described an ``egregious'' example \n     in which one agency, accused of not following due diligence \n     requirements, asked the Department of Education to waive a $1 \n     million fine ``because it would ruin its affiliated secondary \n     market.'' The report points out that:\n       ``The guaranty agency's appeal was clearly designed to \n     protect the financial condition of its affiliated secondary \n     market. It also demonstrates how the financial health of an \n     affiliate may influence the decision-making of the guaranty \n     agency.\n       ``The conflict was even more apparent in June 1990, when \n     the same guaranty agency completed a lender review of its \n     affiliated secondary market and reported numerous areas of \n     noncompliance, including due diligence violations. However, \n     the guaranty agency neither required the appropriate \n     repayments resulting from the violations nor took action to \n     ensure future corrective action. The guaranty agency's \n     actions were even more egregious because it had contracted \n     with the secondary market to review the secondary market's \n     own claims and determine whether the guaranty agency should \n     pay them.\n       ``About eight months later, in February 1991, OSFA [ED's \n     Office of Student Financial Assistance] conducted a review of \n     the same secondary market. OSFA found that the guaranty \n     agency's prior review had not been appropriately resolved, \n     and compelled the secondary market to formally address the \n     findings. Only after OSFA's intervention did the guaranty \n     agency assess liability of over $1.1 million against its \n     affiliate. In our opinion, the guaranty agency's \n     reluctance to enforce the Federal regulations clearly \n     demonstrates that the interests of the taxpayers and those \n     of its affiliate were in direct conflict.''\n       In the report, the IG did not identify the agencies by \n     name. But you will be interested in knowing that the above \n     example was the New Mexico agency, according to IG staff. \n     These types of costly conflicts of interest do not exist in \n     the direct loan program, according to testimony by the acting \n     IG before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on \n     March 30, 1995.\n       Despite all of the design flaws of FFEL that contribute to \n     defaults, and the simplicity and appropriate competitive \n     pressures in the direct loan program, CBO and OMB still \n     assume that defaults will be the same in both programs. Given \n     the evidence, this practice clearly should be reviewed.\n       2. Budget scoring does not consider significant tax losses \n     attributable to FFEL.\n       Your staff's analysis of President Clinton's 1997 budget \n     criticizes OMB's scoring of direct versus guaranteed loans, \n     and declares that FFEL and direct loan ``program costs are \n     virtually identical. . .[but] capital for guaranteed loans \n     comes from private sector lenders.'' This latter statement \n     ignores the fact that (1) the capital is essentially co-\n     signed by federal taxpayers, (2) the largest student loan \n     secondary market, Sallie Mae, is a government-sponsored \n     enterprise, and (3) most of the other secondary markets are \n     state government and non-profit entities that are financed \n     using state-sanctioned bonds that are exempt from federal \n     income taxes.\n       The tax losses from these bonds--estimatedby the Joint Tax \n     Committee at $2.3 billion over five years--are not included \n     in the budget analysis of direct versus guaranteed loans.\n       These government and ``non-profit'' secondary markets and \n     loan servicing entities also reduce federal income by not \n     paying income taxes on activities that would otherwise be \n     subject to corporate income taxes. Thousands of state \n     government and ``non-profit'' employees work for banks and \n     secondary markets collecting payments on loans. The \n     ``profits'' from these activities are not taxed, giving these \n     agencies an unfair advantage over risk-taking entrepreneurs \n     and robbing the federal government of revenue. In the direct \n     loan program, these activities are undertaken by private \n     sector, tax-paying contractors. Again, the budget analysis \n     ignores these millions of dollars of tax losses.\n       3. Budget scorekeeping conventions protect banks from \n     interest variations and artificially reduce costs in FFEL, \n     while inflating direct loan costs.\n       Through their entitlement to a ``special allowance \n     payment,'' lenders are protected by the federal government \n     from short-term interest fluctuations. Banks and secondary \n     markets, therefore, can and do fund their student loans \n     through low-interest, short-term securities. In this \n     situation, the standard accounting practice would be to \n     assume that the government's cost of funds is also based on \n     short-term securities. Indeed, that is the deal that Sallie \n     Mae got when the United States lent hundreds of millions of \n     dollars to the company; even though they were 15-year loans, \n     the interest rate was pegged to three-month Treasury bills \n     (and was reset weekly). However, CBO and OMB assume that the \n     government's cost of funds is a higher, long-term rate. This \n     practice unfairly disadvantages the direct loan program \n     compared to FFEL.\n       4. Excess payments to banks should be counted. With its \n     forty-odd guaranty agencies and thousands of banks, the \n     crisscrossing invoices and subsidies make the guarantee \n     program nearly impossible to audit. GAO has found that some \n     banks benefit from this complexity by failing to pass along \n     student origination fees that are due the government. These \n     types of costs should be included in the cost calculation for \n     FFEL. Unfortunately, the guaranty agencies have prevented a \n     real analysis of the costs of the guarantee program by \n     refusing to provide the Department with data for a random \n     sample of borrower records. This type of insubordination \n     should not be tolerated.\n       These and other important budget scoring issues cannot be \n     addressed by adding a few words to the budget resolution. \n     That is why I am asking that you delete last year's change. \n     If you will not delete it, then I urge you to at least fix it \n     so that it is not one-sided. (This can be accomplished by \n     simply applying the ``direct expenses'' portion of section \n     207 of the FY96 budget resolution to guaranteed loans made \n     under FFEL).\n       Thank you for your attention to the matter. If you need any \n     clarification of the issues that I have raised, please \n     contact me or Bob Shireman on my staff.\n           Cordially,\n                                                       Paul Simon,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n  Mr. SIMON. I wonder whether the Senator from New Mexico has had an \nopportunity to review the letter?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have had the opportunity to look at the details in \nthe letter, and I would agree with my friend from Illinois that the \nconcerns he raises go beyond the scope of what I intended to be \naddressed by the budget resolution language last year, namely, the \nconforming the treatment of administrative expenses of direct student \nloans to that of guaranteed student loans.\n  I wonder if my colleague would agree that, notwithstanding the \nproblems he has discussed, the Credit Reform Act improved the way that \nCongress looks at government loan programs?\n  Mr. SIMON. I would agree. We are engaged here in fine-tuning an \nimportant budget reform, not criticizing it. I thank my colleague for \nproviding that perspective, and for his willingness to look at these \nissues.\n\n\n             colorado river basin salinity control program\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Chairman, Mr. \nDominici, to clarify an item in the budget resolution regarding the \nNatural Resources and Environment budget outline.\n  The third point under discretionary assumptions states that the \nchairman's mark assumes the elimination of the discretionary funding of \nthe Colorado Salinity Control Program and not the termination of the \nprogram.\n  The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program is a very important \nwater quality program for the seven basin States, including my own \nState of Utah and the chairman's great State of New Mexico. Elements of \nthe program are found in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the \nU.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, and Bureau of \nLand Management.\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\n  Am I to understand that the word ``elimination'' refers only to the \ndiscretionary funding, since the program is now funded on the mandatory \nside of the budget?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. the Senator is correct. Under the new farm bill \nlegislation signed into law earlier this year, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's Colorado Salinity Control Program was folded into the new \nEQIP program which is a mandatory program. The 1996 farm bill \nauthorizes the Secretary to use funds of the Commodity Credit \nCorporation to carry out the Colorado River Salinity Control Program.\n  It is not the intention of the Budget Committee to eliminate the \nColorado Salinity Control Program elements conducted by the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior nor the newly authorized authority found in \nthe farm bill and in the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act. The \nmark is intended to state a Budget Committee assumption that there will \nnot be discretionary funding as provided for prior to the passage of \nthe 1996 farm bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman for helping to clarify this item.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 1997, the Republican budget. \nIn this proposal, the Senate has before it a blueprint for balancing \nthe budget and reducing the National debt. Mr. President, a budget is \nmore than a set of numbers. It is an outline of priorities and policy \ndecisions. What a refreshing contrast this budget resolution is to the \nbudgets submitted by the President. It illustrates the difference in \nphilosophy between those who wish to put Government first and those of \nus who believe in ``We the People.''\n  In his last State of the Union address, President Clinton declared \nthe era of big government is over. While this was appealing political \nrhetoric, his budget actions do not support his words. The Clinton \nbudgets implemented the largest tax increase in history, imposed the \nhighest Federal tax burden ever, continued deficit spending, added to \nthe national debt, substantially increased nondefense Government \nspending, and dangerously reduced funding for our national defense.\n  Mr. President, in contrast, the Republican budget proposal will \neliminate the Federal budget deficit by fiscal year 2002. It does so by \nslowing the growth rate of Federal spending. The budget resolution cuts \nhow much money Washington spends on itself by trimming nondefense \ndiscretionary spending and holding defense spending at current levels. \nThe resolution slows the rate of increase of spending for entitlement \nprograms. The budget contemplates reforms in Medicaid and welfare. It \nimplements changes which will maintain the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund. Finally, after these reforms are enacted, the budget makes \nroom for tax relief for America's working families. As a result of \nthese actions, the Federal deficit will be eliminated and net interest \nobligations will be reduced.\n  Mr. President, I support the overall direction of the proposed Senate \nbudget resolution. I commend the chairman and members of the Senate \nBudget Committee for their efforts in bringing a resolution to the \nfloor which controls entitlement spending, restrains the growth of \nGovernment, and eliminates annual deficits.\n  Mr. President, we live in the greatest Nation on Earth. It provides \nAmericans more freedom, more justice, more opportunity, and more hope \nthan any Nation has ever provided any people in the history of the \nworld. However, this great country of ours will be in jeopardy unless \nwe do at least two things. First, we must provide an adequate defense \nto protect ourselves against the enemies who would destroy democracy \nand freedom. Second, we must put our fiscal house in order.\n\n  Mr. President, regarding national defense, the President's budget \nproposes more reductions in defense spending. The Clinton budget fails \nto provide the resources necessary for readiness, modernization, or \nforce structure. In short, the administration's defense spending plan \nbuys an older, smaller, and less prepared defense force. In contrast, \nthe funding for defense in the Republican budget allows the Armed \nServices Committee the opportunity to meet current readiness \nrequirements, provide for improvements in the quality of life of \nmilitary personnel and their families, and balance future needs of the \nmilitary services for modernization. I commend Senator Domenici and the \nMembers on both sides of the aisle for their support and commitment for \na strong national defense.\n  Another part of our national defense requirement is to provide for \nthose veterans who have served our country. Those who have fulfilled \ntheir obligation of citizenship must not be deserted. Mr. President, \nthe treatment by the President's budget of veterans' programs \nillustrates some of the gimmickry used to present the appearance of a \nbalanced budget. Recently the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a \nhearing on the President's fiscal year 1997 budget proposal for \nveterans programs, which contemplates steep reductions in veterans \nfunding, particularly for medical care. I was concerned to hear the \nSecretary testify at that hearing that there was no policy behind the \nbudget request. He went on to state that the President assured him that \nall of our outyear numbers were negotiable and would probably increase.\n  Mr. President, I am sure the Secretary is optimistic regarding his \nability to persuade the President. However, it strains the integrity of \nthe balanced budget effort, which the President claims to support, when \nthe administration discards its own budget before it is even submitted \nto the Congress.\n  I am satisfied that the Republican budget protects veterans benefits \nand health care. It increases spending authority overall, and provides \nmodest increases for VA medical care.\n\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution is a good step in putting our \nfiscal house in order. It provides for restrained growth in overall \nGovernment spending. Because spending grows at a lower rate than \nprojected revenue increases, the deficit will be reduced each year, and \nwill be finally eliminated in fiscal year 2002.\n  This budget resolution provides for real deficit reduction without \nraising taxes. American families and businesses have carried a heavy \ntax burden to support the appetite of the Federal Government. Under \npresent tax policies, Mr. President, capital investment is punished, \nearnings of senior citizens are penalized, consumption is favored over \nsavings, and America's families keep less and less of their earnings. \nThis resolution says ``No.''--I repeat, ``No.''--to balancing the \nbudget by additional taxes.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget proposal provides a clear \nalternative to the tax burden imposed under Clinton budgets. That \nburden included a $268 billion tax increase, with some provisions being \nretroactive. It increased the top tax rate, particularly hurting small \nbusinesses, increased tax rates on Social Security benefits, and \nincreased the gas tax, affecting all Americans. President Clinton later \nadmitted that he had made a mistake--that he raised taxes too much.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that this Congress attempted to \ncorrect that mistake by passing a number of tax relief measures. These \nincluded a child tax credit for working families, expansion of \nindividual retirement accounts, capital gains relief, an adoption tax \ncredit, phaseout of the marriage penalty, and an interest deduction for \nstudent loans. However, these were all vetoed by--I repeat--they were \nall vetoed by the President.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution gives us another opportunity to \nprovide tax relief to working families. Our tax system is not only an \neconomic burden, but also an administrative nightmare. The aggravation \nlevel of the taxpayers of this country continues to rise. After \nbringing our budget into balance, we must work toward a fair and \nsimplified tax structure.\n  Mr. President, the framers of our Constitution clearly established \nthe priorities of our national government. While we have adapted to \nmeet current needs and circumstances, the underlying principles remain \nconstant--to provide for our common defense, establish justice, and \npromote the general welfare. While this budget resolution is not \nperfect, it puts us on a course to reap the promises of this Nation--\nliberty for ourselves and our posterity. As Thomas Jefferson once said, \n``And to preserve their independence, we must not let our rulers load \nus with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and \nliberty, or profusion and servitude.'' Mr. President, the\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\nchoice for us is clear--let us choose economy and liberty. I thank the \nChair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, we are in the second year of a Republican-\ncontrolled U.S. Congress. This is the second year that an actual, real, \nbalanced budget resolution is before the Senate for consideration. I \nsuggest, in all humbleness, that is not a coincidence. During the years \nof the first 2 years of the Clinton Presidency when the other party \ncontrolled both the House, Senate and White House, all three branches, \nall three areas of the Government, not one balanced budget came to the \nattention of the Congress.\n  There should be no misunderstanding in the minds of the American \npeople who watch and listen to this debate. Congress only began to \nconsider balancing the budget after the elections of 1994. That is the \ntruth. That alone is a significant accomplishment in a city addicted to \nreckless spending.\n  It is not enough. Good intentions alone are not going to balance the \nFederal Government's books. This country is $5 trillion in debt. That \nis with a ``t,'' Mr. President. Right now we are in the midst of the \nNBA playoffs, so let me give an analogy. Here is an idea of what $5 \ntrillion really is. Shaquille O'Neal, the basketball player who plays \nfor Orlando Magic, earns $30 million each year. That is a lot of money \nplaying basketball. He would have to play 166,000 seasons to earn $5 \ntrillion. That is our current national debt. He makes $30 million a \nyear. It is almost unbelievable for anyone to even be able to fathom \nhow much $5 trillion really is.\n  This is what we are passing on to our children if we do not really do \nthe job that we are elected to do, which is to balance this budget. If \nyou break that down to more detail, every man, woman and child in \nAmerica, every baby born as I am now standing on the Senate floor for \nthese few minutes, will be born $20,000 in debt. That is what we are \ndoing to our children.\n  I think we have a moral obligation, if not a financial obligation, to \nsolve this problem. It is not a Republican problem. It is not a \nDemocratic problem. It is not a congressional problem. It is not a \nPresidential problem. It is an American problem that goes right to the \nheart and soul of this Nation. If we fail to get this job done, we will \nlose this Nation.\n  That is what this is all about. Balancing the budget is about doing \nwhat we know is the right thing to do, despite the political \nconsequences. Every man, woman, and child out there, every voter, every \nyoung person, they know the consequences if this country continues to \ndrive this debt and allow the interest and the entitlement programs to \nconsume our budget so there is nothing left for anything else. We have \na rare opportunity to work in a bipartisan manner to have this budget \nsigned into law.\n\n  Why do I say that? This is an election year. Everybody says the place \nwill go to pot and we will not get anything done. Let me use the \nPresident's own words. The President said, ``The era of big government \nis over.'' We should take him at his word. This budget ends that era, \nbalances the budget, gets us on the track of downsizing again, making \nthe Federal Government responsible for what it is supposed to be \nresponsible for and not responsible for the things it is intruding \ninto.\n  The President also has stated he believes he raised taxes too much in \n1993. All right, this budget repeals the Clinton gas tax and it repeals \n$123 billion of the President's $250 billion tax increase. The \nPresident stated he supports a tax credit for families with children. \nAll right, this budget provides a $500 per child tax credit for \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet for each of their children. The \nPresident has said, ``Let's end welfare as we know it.'' All right, \nthis budget reforms welfare, sends the power out of Washington and back \nto the States where it belongs. There is common ground. If the \nPresident means what he says, pick up the pen, Mr. President. Do not \nveto the bill; sign it. Sign it and go out to the American people, face \nthe electorate, all of us, and say, ``We got it done. We balanced the \nbudget.'' If the President gets credit for that, so be it; if we get \ncredit for it, so be it. But get it done.\n  The balanced budget before the Senate is a bold, I grant you it is a \nbold document, but it is a reasonable policy document. It meets the \nPresident's stated intentions. It meets our intentions. It balances the \nbudget in 6 years, provides tax relief for working families, and \nreforms our broken welfare system. It is a blueprint that will guide us \nas we remove power from Washington, reduce the red ink and rebuild \nAmerica.\n  Every Senator in this Chamber knows, Mr. President, there is an \nimportant election night right around the corner on November 5. I think \nit is important we look past that election, look right on past it, and \ninstead of looking to the next election, look to the next generation \nfor a change.\n  Our children and our grandchildren deserve to inherit a nation as \ngreat as the one we grew up in. They have a right to live and learn in \na country that balances its books and pays its debts like you have to \ndo in your family and in your business. There is only so much credit \nyou can get and then you go under. It is called chapter 11. That will \nhappen to us if we do not stop it.\n  Children cannot vote. But if they could, I think it is pretty safe to \nsay they would support the balanced budget before the Senate today, \nbecause we are passing the debt on to them. It is they who will have to \npay for it, not us. I urge my colleagues, in closing, Mr. President, \nforget about November. Cast a vote for the future of your children and \nyour grandchildren. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4007\n\n    (Purpose: Creates a 60-vote point of order against legislation \n  diverting savings achieved through Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse \n enforcement activities for purposes other than improving the solvency \n        of the Medicare Federal hospital insurance trust fund.)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 4007.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . PROHIBITION ON CONSIDERATION OF RECONCILIATION \n                   LEGISLATION THAT DIVERTS SAVINGS ACHIEVED \n                   THROUGH MEDICARE WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE \n                   ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN \n                   IMPROVING THE SOLVENCY OF THE MEDICARE FEDERAL \n                   HOSPITAL INSURANCE TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any reconciliation bill, conference report on a \n     reconciliation bill, or any other legislation that would use \n     savings achieved through medicare waste, fraud, and abuse \n     enforcement activities as offsets for purposes other than \n     improving the solvency of the Medicare Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate by a \\3/5\\ths majority vote of the Members duly chosen \n     and sworn, or by the unanimous consent of the Senate.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to this section shall be limited to 1 \n     hour, to be equally divided between and controlled by, the \n     appellant and the manager of the bill or conference report, \n     as the case may be. An affirmative \\3/5\\ths vote of the \n     Members duly chosen and sworn or unanimous consent of the \n     Senate shall be required in the Senate to sustain an appeal \n     of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under \n     this provision.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in deference to time and to my colleague \nfrom Ohio, who has generously allowed me to offer this amendment prior \nto his remarks on our esteemed friend, Admiral Boorda, I offer this \namendment with the intention of just briefly referencing it at this \npoint and then asking unanimous consent that it be set aside.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, has as its objective to assure that \nany savings that are achieved by the new effort that we are going to \nmake on waste and fraud within the Medicare Program ends up benefiting \nthe Medicare Program and, specifically, the Medicare trust fund.\n  We are all aware of the concern that we have had that the Medicare \ntrust fund was becoming financially vulnerable. In fact, that concern \nhas been exacerbated by some recent information\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\nthat the trust fund is weaker than we had thought a year ago. This \nwould assist in strengthening the trust fund by assuring that any \nproceeds derived from our assault against Medicare fraud and abuse, \nwhich have the result of depleting the trust fund without providing \nmeaningful medical services to older Americans, then any funds that are \nrecovered as a result of this war on Medicare fraud will go back into \nthe trust fund and, therefore, strengthen it for this and future \ngenerations of older Americans.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to discussing this matter in greater \ndetail at another time. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague from Ohio and commend him for his \nthoughtfulness on his upcoming remarks regarding Admiral Boorda.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/17/senate-section/article/S5216-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ADM. MIKE BOORDA\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, to say that a shockwave went across Capitol \nHill yesterday when we heard about Mike Boorda's death would be an \nunderstatement. For those of us who knew him and worked with him very \nclosely, it was not only a shock, it was an extreme shock. We thought \nof him as one of the most pleasant, smiling, outgoing, friendly persons \nthat you ever dealt with across the river in the Pentagon, or anybody \nyou ever dealt with on Capitol Hill as far as that matter goes. So we \nwere all saddened to learn of his tragic death. He was a fine naval \nofficer, who was doing a great job.\n  We talk a lot about the American dream in this country, what it can \nmean, and how you can advance in this country. Mike Boorda actually \nlived it. He literally lived it. He was a high school dropout, who went \nin the Navy as a seaman second class. That is as low as you get when \nyou enter at the bottom rung of the ladder. Over the years, he had such \noutstanding service that he became an officer. He was the very first \nperson to go from the lowest rank in the Navy to the highest rank in \nthe Navy, to his everlasting credit.\n  I do not think there is anybody across the river that was more \nrespected by the Members of Congress than Admiral Boorda. I worked with \nMike for a number of years. I first got to know him, when I was \nchairman of the Personnel Subcommittee on Armed Services and he was the \nhead of naval personnel. We dealt back and forth on personnel matters \nalmost on a daily basis.\n  If I ever knew anybody who I would term as a ``people person,'' it \nwas Mike Boorda. He was so concerned with people that he would \npersonally follow-up calls, not only individual cases, but about all \nthe policies that were established that dealt with people. Those were \nhis biggest concerns in those days, and they continued to be some of \nhis biggest concerns after he became CNO, Chief of Naval Operations.\n  We worked together, and he was concerned about such things as the \npromotion process, health matters, early-out legislation for people \nleaving the service, and pay and allowances for those staying in. The \nwords he always would use repeatedly are, ``Well, are we treating these \npeople fairly? Is this fair?'' That was a hallmark with him--to see \nthat everybody in the Navy was treated fairly. I guess his enlisted \nbackground is what added to that concern about a sense of fairness, \nextending clear from the top to the bottom in the United States Navy.\n  Less than a year ago, I flew with Mike down to Norfolk to commission \nthe U.S.S. Toledo, one of our latest submarines. I remember walking \nwith him, as he returned salutes to officers and enlisted personnel, \nand him suddenly saying, ``Come with me''. He broke ranks with the \ngroup and went over to where some sailors were standing to shake their \nhands. They were shocked that the CNO, with me in tow, would go out of \nhis way to shake their hands. I cannot forget their smiles and I know \nthey appreciated it very much.\n  I think he did that because he had been there. He knew what it meant \nto them. He knew what it was like to grow up in the Navy. The Navy was \nmore than a career to Mike Boorda, it was his home.\n  Not many weeks ago, he asked me to come over and have breakfast--as \nhe did with Senators and Members of Congress from time to time--to talk \nabout matters pertaining to the Navy. It was the two of us, each with a \nstaff person. We talked a little about Navy hardware and what they \nplanned to procure for the future. But we spent most of our time \ntalking about people. He was extremely concerned about the lasting \neffects of the Tailhook scandal, the problems at the Naval Academy, the \nchallenges of placing women in combat roles aboard ships, and living \nconditions of his sailors and their families.\n  Mike Boorda was always concerned about life in the military, and life \nin the Navy, in particular, especially for those who are required to be \naboard ship and go out for extended deployments. He was concerned not \nonly about the sailor, but also about the family at home--the wife, the \nchildren, who are left behind during those long deployments. I still do \nnot think most people in this country realize the rigors of military \nservice and give proper respect and consideration and appreciation for \nthose in the military. That is particularly true in the Navy, because \nwhen we see a carrier abroad in the Adriatic, or a Navy ship deployed \nwhere there is a problem somewhere in the world, we should remember \nthat the people manning that ship are people out away from their \nfamilies, away from home. Those are the things that concerned Mike \nBoorda more than anything else--being fair and treating his people \nfairly.\n  I rarely have seen anyone so dedicated to the welfare of the enlisted \npersonnel of whatever service. It was the enlisted people of the Navy \nthat looked to him for their representation, and he gave it heartily \nbecause he believed in it. He was an inspiration to everyone who served \nbecause he was one of them. I think he still looked at himself as an \nenlisted sailor in the ranks. I think he had a problem seeing himself \nelevated above everyone else as the Chief of Naval Operations.\n  His concerns should not be forgotten. Those of us here will do \neverything to make sure they are not. We will try to represent his best \nwishes as he had expressed them through the years and make certain that \nall of his concerns for the people of the Navy are taken care of.\n  I think there might be a little lesson here for all of us to learn \nfrom this tragedy. Things that seem important at the moment may, in the \nlong term, prove to be of far less importance than the big things that \nwe do in life.\n  Whatever the cause of his death may have been, his memory in the Navy \nwill be one of a person who was concerned about the people of the Navy, \nhis loyalty to those people, and his desire to make sure that they were \nproperly represented. That was his mission. Mike was a people person. \nMost of all, he was a good friend.\n  Annie and I wish to express our deepest sympathy to Betty and his \nfamily. Our hearts go out to them and our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem. We will all miss him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be equally \ncharged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/17/senate-section/article/S5265-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5265-S5266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S. NAVY ADM. JEREMY M. BOORDA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, President Theodore Roosevelt once wrote, \n``Death is always and under all circumstances a tragedy, for if it is \nnot, then it meant that life itself has become one.''\n  The death of Adm. Jeremy M. ``Mike'' Boorda was particularly tragic. \nBut it is important that the tragedy of his death not overshadow the \ninspiring accomplishments of his life.\n  Mike Boorda began serving his country at the age of 16, when he lied \nabout\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\nhis age and entered the Navy. Much to his own surprise, he was \ncommissioned an officer 6 years later. Through hard work and \ndedication, he rose through the ranks and eventually became a four-star \nadmiral and the only enlisted man to become the Chief of Naval \nOperations.\n  During his career in the Navy, Mike Boorda graduated from the \nUniversity of Rhode Island in 1971 and served during the Vietnam war in \nSoutheast Asia. He became an admiral in 1987 and served as the Navy's \nchief personnel officer from 1988 to 1991. He then served as a \ncommander in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from 1991 to 1994. \nAs Chief of the Southern European Command, he directed the air strike \nagainst four Bosnian Serb aircraft that had been flying in violation of \na U.N. ban. It was the first time in the organization's 44-year history \nthat allied forces were used in an offensive mission.\n  Having begun his career as a seaman recruit--the lowest rank in the \nNavy--Mike Boorda had a deep appreciation for the concerns of enlisted \npersonnel, and he strived endlessly to improve the Navy for all of \nthem. He considered those in the Navy who served under him--enlisted \npersonnel and officers alike--to be members of his family. As Secretary \nPerry mentioned, ``Admiral Boorda was a sailor's sailor. Mike Boorda \nhelped make our Navy the best the world has ever seen.''\n  The Nation owes a great debt of gratitude to Admiral Boorda. Despite \nthe tragic circumstances surrounding his death, the many contributions \nhe made to the U.S. Navy and our country during his more than 40 years \nof service will not soon be forgotten. I know I speak on behalf of all \nmy colleagues when I express my deepest sympathies to his wife, Bettie, \nand his four children, David, Edward, Anna, and Robert.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords).

Mr. President, in my years of service in the Senate I have \ncome to revere the rules and procedures that make this legislative body \nunique. They ensure thoughtful debate of important issues while at the \nsame time give credence and consideration to differing points of view. \nBut these tangible assets only become real through the care and effort \nof the people who work here. And when we consider the tremendous \nachievements of this institution, we cannot do so without recognizing \nthe contributions of our staffs.\n  Today I want to call attention to a member of my staff who has worked \non behalf of West Virginians since May 10, 1976. The person I want to \nacknowledge is Catherine Lark Preston. I first came to know Cathy when \nshe worked on my short-lived run for the presidency. Yes, many of you \nmay not know, but I was a favorite son candidate for President during \nthe 1976 campaign. As I say, Cathy was one of those dedicated \nindividuals who worked in my campaign office in downtown Washington. \nOnce I had had my taste of presidential politics and refocused my total \nenergies on the Senate, Cathy was a natural for my office here.\n  Needless to say, Cathy adjusted well to her duties as a caseworker in \nmy office. Over the years, she has worked to help West Virginians \nuntangle the red tape that our federal bureaucracy often creates. She \nhas been a much-needed link to Washington for my constituents.\n  To put it simply, Cathy's efforts have made a difference. I know how, \nduring the day-to-day hassles of our lives, it is easy to forget to \nshow the proper gratitude to those who deserve it. I want to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Cathy and to recognize her twenty-year \ncontribution to the Senate, to West Virginia, and her country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/17/senate-section/article/S5266-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The \nSupplementary Agreement, signed at Vienna on October 5, 1995, is \nintended to modify certain provisions of the original United States-\nAustria Social Security Agreement, signed July 13, 1990.\n  The United States-Austria Social Security Agreement is similar in \nobjective to the social security agreements with Belgium, Canada, \nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg. The \nNetherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the \nUnited Kingdom. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited \ncoordination between the United States and foreign social security \nsystems to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation, and to \nhelp prevent the loss of benefit protection that can occur when workers \ndivide their careers between two countries.\n  The Supplementary Agreement, which would amend the 1990 Agreement to \nupdate and clarify several of its provisions, is necessitated by \nchanges that have occurred in U.S. and Austrian law in recent years. \nAmong other things, it would introduce a new method of computing \nAustrian benefits under the Agreement that will result in higher \nAustrian benefits for certain people who have divided their careers \nbetween the United States and Austria. Another provision in the \nSupplementary Agreement will allow U.S. citizens hired in Austria by \nU.S. Foreign Service Posts to be covered by the Austrian Social \nSecurity System rather than the U.S. system. The Supplementary \nAgreement will also make a number of minor revisions in the Agreement \nto take account of other changes in U.S. and Austrian law that have \noccurred in recent years.\n  The United States-Austria Social Security Agreement, as amended, \nwould\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\ncontinue to contain all provisions mandated by section 233 and other \nprovisions that I deem appropriate to carry out the provisions of \nsection 233(c)(4).\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared \nby the Social Security Administration explaining the key points of the \nSupplementary Agreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph \nexplanation of the effect of the amendments on the Agreement. Annexed \nto this report is the report required by section 233(e)(1) of the \nSocial Security Act on the effect of the Agreement on income and \nexpenditures of the U.S. Social Security program and the number of \nindividuals affected by the Agreement. The Department of State and the \nSocial Security Administration have recommended the Supplementary \nAgreement and related documents to me.\n  I commend the United States-Austria Social Security Agreement and \nrelated Agreement and related documents to the Congress.\n                                                 William, J.

A bill to amend the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act \nof 1985 to clarify that the fee for providing customs services in \nconnection with passengers arriving on commercial vessels making a \nsingle voyage may be collected only one time for each passenger, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     customs service passenger fee\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when Congress passed the North American \nFree-Trade Agreement [NAFTA] it imposed a $6.50 fee for the arrival of \neach passenger aboard a commercial vessel or aircraft coming in from \noutside the customs territory of the United States. NAFTA also imposed \na $6.50 fee on passengers arriving in the United States from The \nCaribbean, Mexico, and Canada.\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\n  The language of the NAFTA implementing language relating to this fee \nwas drafted inappropriately with the result that the Customs Service \nclaims authority to collect the fee each time a cruise ship enters a \nport during the course of a single journey. I believe this \ninterpretation was never intended by the drafters of NAFTA and the \nlegislation I am introducing today would correct this error.\n  The Customs Service interpretation is particularly harmful to one of \nAlaska's most important industries--tourism. Many visitors to my State \noften book cruises that visit some of the most scenic places in the \nworld. For example, during the course of an Alaska voyage, a vessel may \ncall in Ketchikan, Juneau, Valdez, Seward, and Sitka, and may sail \noutside the customs territory of the United States between each of \nthese Alaska ports. Even though this a single continuous journey, under \nthe Customs Service interpretation, the fee would have to be collected \nthree, four, or even five times. This was not Congress' intent.\n  My legislation makes clear that the passenger fee can only be imposed \na single time when a cruise ship is traveling in and out of U.S. waters \non its way along a journey as I described earlier.

A bill to enhance the enforceability of airport revenue \ndiversion provisions under chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n               the airport revenue protection act of 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nI believe will end, once and for all, the illegal diversion of airport \nrevenues. The Airport Revenue Protection Act of 1996 is intended to \nmake it absolutely clear to everyone, which includes airports, local \ngovernments, airport sponsors, the Department of Transportation, the \nFederal Aviation Administration, air carriers, and the traveling \npublic, that Federal laws prohibiting revenue diversion from our \nNation's airports will be strengthened and enforced. Airport sponsors, \nhowever, will continue to have access to judicial review of Department \nof Transportation decisions on revenue diversion.\n  For many years, our Nation's airports have prospered and grown \nsubstantially under an innovative funding mechanism by which airport \nusers, including airlines, their customers, and others who do business \non airports, finance nearly all airport needs. This funding comes \nprimarily from landing fees, rental charges, concession revenues, and \npassenger facility charges. Virtually no public funds are used to \noperate this country's airports. Moreover, local tax revenues do not \nsupport our national system of airports.\n  To the extent that Federal money is used for airports, it comes from \ngrants paid out of the user-funded aviation trust fund. Because it is \ntremendously important the Federal grant money to airports is used only \nfor airport purposes, Congress has had a longstanding policy that \ndiversion of airport revenues for any nonairport purposes is illegal. \nIn fact, several times, Congress has acted to strengthen Federal laws \nprohibiting revenue diversion.\n  Recently, however, Congress was informed that there is a disturbing \ntrend of unlawful airport revenue diversion by local governments. The \nlast round of audits, conducted by the inspector general's office of \nthe Department of Transportation, found that more than $170 million was \ndiverted by at least 23 of our Nation's airports from 1992 through \n1995. These audits show that far too many local governments are \nattempting to solve their fiscal problems by taking money away from \ntheir airports, and using it for nonairport purposes. It also appears \nthat when cities or counties control airports, politics, on all levels, \nis more likely to play a major role in encouraging revenue diversion.\n  The blatant disregard by airport sponsors of the intent of Federal \nlaws prohibiting revenue diversion, particularly by cities such as Los \nAngeles, is reprehensible and must be addressed. Congress can no longer \nstand by and watch as air travelers' hard-earned money is used \nwrongfully to pay a city's nonairport bills.\n  This legislation specifically acts on many of the recommendations of \nthe Department of Transportation's inspector general to address the \nproblem of revenue diversion. First, the bill would expand the \nprohibition on the use of airport revenues to cover revenues from \nairports that are the subject of any form of Federal assistance or that \noperate under a federally issued airport operating certificate. In \naddition, annual airport audits must certify to DOT and FAA that any \nairport funds transferred to airport sponsors are carried out in \naccordance with Federal laws and regulations on revenue diversion. The \nDOT inspector general would then certify that the audit complies with \nFederal law.\n  If, as a result of such an audit, it is determined that illegal \nrevenue diversion has occurred, DOT, acting through FAA, must access a \npenalty against the offending airport sponsor for the amount of the \nillegal diversion plus interest, or withhold the illegally diverted \namount from Federal funds that the sponsor expected to receive from the \nFederal Government. If an airport sponsor does not pay the assessed \npenalty, and withholding does not cover the amount owed, DOT, acting \nthrough the FAA, must file a civil suit to recover the illegally \ndiverted funds and any accumulated interest. Private citizens also are \ngiven the ability to file such suits.\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\n  The legislation also sets up a process to ensure that any recovered \nairport revenue is returned to the airport from which funds were \nillegally diverted. In addition, the legislation protects \nwhistleblowers and establishes a means for them to receive payment when \nit is determined that an airport sponsor has illegally diverted airport \nrevenue. Finally, to ensure that all airports are treated equally, this \nbill would eliminate 10 years from the date of enactment, the \ngrandfather provisions that currently permit revenue diversion at some \nairports.\n  Mr. President, this bill is intended to send the strong message that \nno one can get away with ignoring Federal laws prohibiting airport \nrevenue diversion. It is not directed at activity relating to any \nspecific airport, but instead attempts to create a clear and fair means \nof ensuring that airport money is spent on airport purposes only. I am \nconfident that this legislation will reverse the alarming trend of \nillegal airport revenue diversion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Airport Revenue Protection Act of 1996--Summary of Legislation\n\n\n                                PURPOSES\n\n       This legislation is intended to reverse the alarming trend \n     of illegal diversion of airport revenues, and ensure that \n     airport revenues are used only for airport capital and \n     operating costs. Congress has long believed that airport \n     users should not be burdened with any type of hidden taxation \n     for local services. This bill would leave no doubt that \n     airport sponsors, such as city and county governments, cannot \n     put their local budgetary burdens on airport users.\n       In specific, the legislation bolsters efforts to stop \n     revenue diversion by expanding the prohibition on revenue \n     diversion to cover more instances of diversion. It also would \n     establish clear penalties and stronger mechanisms to enforce \n     federal laws prohibiting revenue diversion. In addition, the \n     bill imposes additional reporting requirements so that \n     illegal revenue diversion can be easily identified and \n     verified. Finally, it would provide important protections for \n     whistleblowers.\n\n\n                          SPECIFIC PROVISIONS\n\n            Restriction on use of airport revenues (Sec. 4)\n\n       This bill would expand the prohibition on use of airport \n     revenues beyond project grant recipients to cover local taxes \n     on aviation fuel and revenues at airports that receive any \n     form of federal assistance or operate under a federal-issued \n     airport operating certificate. Certain airports would be \n     permitted to divert revenue, however, under ``grandfather'' \n     provisions in the bill similar to provisions in existing law. \n     The bill does not affect airports that have been \n     grandfathered in existing law. Under current law, recipients \n     of federal airport grants must provide assurances that \n     airport revenues will not be diverted for non-airport \n     purposes.\n\n             Audits of airport funding activities (Sec. 5)\n\n       In the bill, this review would provide assurances that any \n     funds transferred to airport sponsors (such as local \n     governments) were not illegally diverted. The DOT Inspector \n     General would certify that the review meets the requirements \n     of this section. Current law requires recipients of airport \n     project grants to conduct annual audits. This bill would \n     require DOT, acting through the FAA, to promulgate \n     regulations requiring grant recipients, as part of these \n     annual audits, to provide a review and opinion concerning \n     airport funding activities.\n\n           Recovery of Illegally Diverted Funds (Secs. 5, 8)\n\n       Administrative action: Within 180 days after an audit or \n     any other report identifying an illegal diversion of airport \n     revenues is issued, DOT/FAA, would: (1) make a final \n     determination whether the illegal diversion occurred; (2) \n     provide written notice to the airport and sponsor of that \n     termination and the sponsor's obligation to reimburse the \n     airport; (3) assess an administrative penalty against the \n     airport sponsor in an amount equal to the amount illegally \n     diverted plus interest, or withhold this same amount from \n     federal funds intended for that airport sponsor.\n       Civil action: -If, within 180 days from the date when the \n     airport and sponsor are notified of DOT/FAA's determination \n     of illegal revenue diversion, the sponsor does not pay the \n     administrative penalty and interest, DOT/FAA must initiate a \n     civil action to recover the illegally diverted funds. A \n     private citizen also may bring a civil action (i.e., a qui \n     tam action) for such violations of revenue diversion laws.\n       Statue of Limitations: The bill establishes a 6-year \n     statute of limitations for any action to recover illegally \n     diverted airport funds. In specific, this provision requires \n     an airport or any other person to bring an action to recover \n     illegally diverted funds within 6 years from the date that \n     the diversion took place. Thus, the bill precludes any effort \n     by an airport sponsor to recover illegally diverted airport \n     funds more than 6 years after it occurs.\n       Reimbursement of Diverted Funds to Airport: The bill sets \n     up a process to ensure that any recovered airport funds are \n     returned to the airport from which the funds were illegally \n     diverted. The illegally diverted funds would first have to be \n     reimbursed to DOT/FAA by the sponsor. The funds would be \n     placed in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. DOT/FAA must \n     then, as soon as practicable, reimburse the airport from \n     which the revenue was illegally diverted, in an amount equal \n     to that collected from the sponsor, including interest paid.\n\n          Valid Payment by Airport to Airport Sponsor (Sec. 5)\n\n       If DOT/FAA determines, during an audit or other review, \n     that an airport owes funds to an airport sponsor, interest \n     should be assessed on that amount from the date of DOT/FAA's \n     determination. Any request by an airport sponsor for \n     reimbursement of funds from an airport must be made within 6 \n     years from the date the expense is incurred. An airport \n     sponsor (such as a local government), therefore, could not \n     seek to recover funds from an airport for an expense (such as \n     police and fire services) dating back more than 6 years.\n\n Revision of DOT/FAA Revenue Diversion Polices and Procedures (Sec. 5)\n\n       Within 90 days after enactment, DOT/FAA must revise its \n     policies and procedures ensuring enforcement against illegal \n     diversion of airport revenue, to take into account changes \n     from this legislation.\n\n           Elimination of ``Grandfather'' Provisions (Sec. 6)\n\n       This bill would prohibit diversion from an airport covered \n     by the grandfather provision when either: (1) the debt \n     obligations are retired or refinanced, or (2) 10 years after \n     enactment of this legislation, whichever is earlier. To \n     ensure that all airports are covered by the same prohibitions \n     on revenue diversion, this legislation would eliminate \n     ``grandfather'' provisions in existing law that permit some \n     airport sponsors to divert revenue. Currently, an airport \n     sponsor can legally divert revenue if such diversion was \n     specifically permitted before September 2, 1982, in a law \n     controlling financing by the airport owner or operator, or a \n     covenant or assurance in a debt obligation issued by that \n     date.\n\n         Elimination of Provisions Relating to Hawaii (Sec. 6)\n\n       Specifically, this legislation would prohibit diversion \n     from an airport in Hawaii covered by current exemptions when \n     either: (1) the debt obligations are retired or financed, or \n     (2) 10 years after enactment of this measure, whichever is \n     earlier. Current law provides several exemptions permitting \n     legal use in Hawaii of airport revenues for certain non-\n     airport purposes. Similar to the elimination of \n     ``grandfather'' provisions, this bill also would eliminate \n     provisions in current law that accord special treatment to \n     airport sponsors in Hawaii.\n\n                   Whistleblower Protection (Sec. 7)\n\n       Petition Process: Within 180 days after enactment of this \n     legislation, DOT/FAA must establish a process enabling \n     private citizens (or other parties, but not DOT/FAA \n     employees) to petition DOT/FAA for review of possible illegal \n     revenue diversion from an airport. DOT/FAA must evaluate any \n     petition asserting diversion of $10,000 or more, within 30 \n     days after such petition is made. If a petition asserts \n     illegal diversion of less than $10,000, then DOT/FAA have \n     discretion whether to evaluate such a petition. DOT/FAA \n     reviews a petition, and finds that illegal diversion has \n     occurred, DOT/FAA must take action to recover the funds and \n     provide reimbursement to the airport.\n       Confidentiality of Petitioner's Identity: The petitioner's \n     identity would remain confidential, unless the petitioner \n     provided consent to disclose it.\n       Payment to Petitioner: When DOT/FAA recovers illegally \n     diverted funds, DOT/FAA must take action to make a payment to \n     the petitioner, in accordance with procedures established by \n     DOT/FAA. DOT/FAA may require the sponsor to make a payment \n     for petitioner and transfer that payment from the Airport and \n     Airway Trust Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/17/senate-section/article/S5267-6", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5269-S5270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 673\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nVirginia [Mr. Warner] was added as a cosponsor of S. 673, a bill to \nestablish a youth development grant program, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 969\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the name of the Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Kohl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 969, a bill to require that \nhealth plans provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay for a mother \nand child following the birth of the child, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1491\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grams, the names of the Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Kohl], the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], and the Senator from \nVirginia [Mr. Robb] were added as cosponsors of S. 1491, a bill to \nreform antimicrobial pesticide registration, and for other purposes.\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\n                                S. 1743\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bingaman, the names of the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Exon] and the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1743, a bill to provide temporary emergency \nlivestock feed assistance for certain producers, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 41\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inouye, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Stevens] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n41, a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that \nthe George Washington University is important to the Nation and urging \nthat the importance of the University be recognized and celebrated \nthrough regular ceremonies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/17/senate-section/article/S5269-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5270-S5274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n             THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET CONCURRENT RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n               WELLSTONE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3985\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Biden) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution (S.

Should the \n     tax writing committees choose to raise additional revenues \n     through these or other sources, such recipts could be used to \n     offset other tax reform proposals such as estate tax reform, \n     economic growth, fuel excise taxes or other policies on a \n     deficit neutral basis'';\n       (3) the tax reductions passed in conjuntion with the fiscal \n     1996 budget (H.R. 2491) included tax breaks which would \n     disproportionately benefit the wealthy and large \n     corporations, such as, reductions in the capital gains tax, \n     exemptions from the alternative minimum tax, reduced tax \n     penalties for corporate raiding of employee pensions, and \n     increased tax incentives for corporations to move jobs \n     overseas; and\n       (4) over the last decade, the cost of attending college has \n     almost doubled, rising at twice the rate of inflation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying the \n     reconciliation instructions in this budget resolution assume \n     that it is the sense of the Senate that any tax revenue \n     raised by the Finance Committee to provide gross tax **** *** \n     needed to pay for a per-child tax credit will be used either:\n       (1) to finance a tax deduction of $10,000 per year for \n     higher education tuition and student loan interest costs; or\n       (2) to reduce the federal budget deficit; and not for tax \n     cuts which disproportionately benefit the wealthy and large \n     corporations.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                WELLSTONE (AND KERRY) AMENDMENT NO. 3986\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Kerry) proposed an amendment to \nthe concurrent resolution (S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LIHEAP.\n\n       (a) Findings--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Home energy assistance for working and low-income \n     families with children, the elderly on fixed incomes, the \n     disabled, and others who need such aid is a critical part of \n     the social safety net in cold-weather areas during the \n     winter, and a source of necessary cooling aid during the \n     summer;\n       (2) LIHEAP is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help \n     millions of low-income Americans pay their home energy bills. \n     More than two-thirds of LIHEP-eligible households have annual \n     incomes of less than $8000, more than one-half have annual \n     incomes below $6000.\n       (3) LIHEAP funding has been substantially reduced in recent \n     years, and cannot sustain further spending cuts if the \n     program is to remain a viable means of meeting the home \n     heating and other energy-related needs of low-income \n     families, especially those in cold-weather states;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying this \n     budget resolution assume that it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funds made available for LIHEAP for Fiscal Year 1997 \n     will be not less than the actual expenditures made for LIHEAP \n     in Fiscal Year 1996.\n                                 ______\n\n\n               WELLSTONE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3989\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Wyden) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 57) supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At an appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       The assumptions underlying functional totals and \n     reconciliation instructions in this budget resolution \n     include:\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Violence against women is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women. The Department of Justice estimates that \n     over 1 million violent crimes against women are committed by \n     domestic partners annually.\n       (2) Domestic violence dramatically affects the victim's \n     ability to participate in the workforce. A University of \n     Minnesota survey reported that one-quarter of battered women \n     surveyed had lost a job partly because of being abused and \n     that over half of these women had been harassed by their \n     abuser at work.\n       (3) Domestic violence is often intensified as women seek to \n     gain economic independence through attending school or job \n     training programs. Batterers have been reported to prevent \n     women from attending such programs or sabotage their efforts \n     at self-improvement.\n       (4) Nationwide surveys of service providers prepared by the \n     Taylor Institute of Chicago, Document, for the first time, \n     the interrelationship between domestic violence and welfare \n     by showing that between 50% and 80% of women in welfare to \n     work programs are current or past victims of domestic \n     violence.\n       (5) The American Psychological Association has reported \n     that violence against women is usually witnessed by their \n     children, who as a result can suffer severe psychological, \n     cognitive and physical damage and some studies have found \n     that children who witness violence in their homes have a \n     greater propensity to commit violent acts in their homes and \n     communities when they become adults.\n       (6) Over half of the women surveyed by the Taylor Institute \n     stayed with their batterers because they lacked the resources \n     to support themselves and their children. The surveys also \n     found that the availability of economic support is a critical \n     factor in women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten themselves and their children.\n       (7) Proposals to restructure the welfare programs may \n     impact the availability of the economic support and the \n     safety net necessary to enable poor women to flee abuse \n     without risking homelessness and starvation for their \n     families.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) No welfare reform provision should be enacted by \n     Congress unless and until Congress considers whether such \n     welfare reform provisions would exacerbate violence against \n     women and their children, further endanger women's lives, \n     make it more difficult for women to escape domestic violence, \n     or further punish women victimized by violence.\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n\n       (2) Any welfare reform measure enacted by Congress should \n     require that any welfare to work, education, or job placement \n     programs implemented by the States address the impact of \n     domestic violence on welfare recipients.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 KERRY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3990\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nDashle, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Exon, and Mr. Baucus) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution (S.

A bipartisan coalition \n     of Congress, led by the President, must resolve the long-term \n     imbalance between the Government's entitlement promises and \n     the funds it will have available to pay for them'';\n       (2) unless the Congress and the President act together in a \n     bipartisan way, overall Federal spending is projected by the \n     Commission to rise from the current level of slightly over 22 \n     percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United States \n     (hereafter in this section referred as ``GDP'') to over 37 \n     percent of GDP by the year 2030;\n       (3) the source of that growth is not domestic discretionary \n     spending, which is approximately the same portion of GDP now \n     as it was in 1969, the last time at which the Federal budget \n     was in balance;\n       (4) mandatory spending was only 29.6 percent of the Federal \n     budget in 1963, but is estimated to account for 72 percent of \n     the Federal budget in the year 2003;\n       (5) social security, medicare and medicaid, together with \n     interest on the national debt, are the largest sources of the \n     growth of mandatory spending;\n       (6) ensuring the long-term future of the social security \n     system is essential to protecting the retirement security of \n     the American people;\n       (7) the Social Security Trust Fund is projected to begin \n     spending more than it takes in by approximately the year \n     2013, with Federal budget deficits rising rapidly thereafter \n     unless appropriate policy changes are made;\n       (8) ensuring the future of medicare and medicaid is \n     essential to protecting access to high-quality health care \n     for senior citizens and poor women and children;\n       (9) Federal health care expenses have been rising at double \n     digit rates, and are projected to triple to 11 percent of GDP \n     by the year 2030 unless appropriate policy changes are made; \n     and\n       (10) due to demographic factors, Federal health care \n     expenses are projected to double by the year 2030, even if \n     health care cost inflation is restrained after 1999, so that \n     costs for each person of a given age grow no faster than the \n     economy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that budget savings in the mandatory spending area should be \n     used--\n       (1) to protect and enhance the retirement security of the \n     American people by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     social security system;\n       (2) to protect and enhance the health care security of \n     senior citizens and poor Americans by ensuring the long-term \n     future of medicare and medicaid; and\n       (3) to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline, to \n     ensure that the level of private investment necessary for \n     long-term economic growth and prosperity is available.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         KYL AMENDMENT NO. 3995\n\n  Mr. KYL proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution (S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SUPERMAJORITY \n                   REQUIREMENT FOR RAISING TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's current tax system is indefensible, being \n     overly complex, burdensome, and severely limiting to economic \n     opportunity for all Americans;\n       (2) fundamental tax reform should be undertaken as soon as \n     practicable to produce a tax system that is fairer, flatter, \n     and simpler; that promotes, rather than punishes, job \n     creation; that eliminates unnecessary paperwork burdens on \n     America's businesses; that recognizes the fact that families \n     are performing the most important work of our society; that \n     provides incentives for Americans who save for the future in \n     order to build a better life for themselves and their \n     families; that allows Americans, especially the middle class, \n     to keep more of what they earn, but that raises enough money \n     to fund a leaner, more efficient Federal Government; and that \n     allows Americans to compute their taxes easily; and\n       (3) the stability and longevity of any new tax system \n     designed to achieve these goals should be guaranteed with a \n     supermajority vote requirement so that Congress cannot easily \n     raise tax rates, impose new taxes, or otherwise increase the \n     amount of a taxpayer's income that is subject to tax.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this concurrent resolution on the budget assumes \n     fundamental tax reform should be accompanied by a proposal to \n     amend the Constitution of the United States to require a \n     supermajority vote in each House of Congress to approve tax \n     increases.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         KYL AMENDMENT NO. 3996\n\n  Mr. KYL proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution (S.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nSenate's attention startling new evidence of a resurgence in severe \ncocaine abuse.\n  A recent study conducted and released in California reveals that the \nuse of cocaine is still very much present, that it causes severe health \nproblems and that it shows no signs of slowing down.\n  The report, conducted by the Public Statistics Institute, found that \nemergency room admissions for cocaine abuse have soared to an all-time \nhigh in California.\n  After a surge in cocaine morbidity during the 1980's, there was a \nsignificant drop in 1990, then a complete resurgence to new highs in \n1994.\n  The report showed emergency-room admissions related to cocaine \nincreased to 13,496 in 1994. This represents a 27-percent increase from \nthe previous high of 10,660 in 1988, 79-percent increase over the \nprevious low of 7,545 in 1990, and 266-percent increase over the 3,688 \nadmissions a decade earlier, in 1985.\n  Rates were substantially higher in densely populated cities in \nsouthern and northern California. The State's average of 42 admissions \nper 100,000 people was 270 percent higher in San Francisco, 108 percent \nhigher in Alameda County, 38 percent higher in Contra Costa County and \n47 percent higher in Los Angeles County.\n  Outside the Bay Area, the rates also posted significant increases \nincluding a ten-fold increase in Sacramento County, 750 percent \nthroughout the San Joaquin Valley, and more than 700 percent in Fresno \nCounty, and more than 650 percent in the central California region of \nKern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, and Tulare counties.\n  Thousands of cocaine users are arriving in hospitals every year for \ntreatment of seizures, shock, brain hemorrhage, coma, vomiting, cardiac \narrest, chest pain, fever, and acute paranoia. According to the study's \nresearchers, these problems are only the tip of the iceberg relating to \ncocaine use.\n  The decrease in 1990, perceived to be the result of Federal \nlegislation regulating the chemicals to produce cocaine, appears to \nhave only been a short pause in what seems to be a problem of epidemic \nproportions.\n  The numbers were even more striking for patients of ethnic groups. \nThe number of African-American patients soared from 63.5 per 100,000 in \n1985 to 275 per 100,000 admissions in 1994. From 1990 to 1994, \nadmissions among African-Americans rose 116 percent, 115 percent among \nLatinos. In contrast, admissions rose 36 percent among whites. \nResearchers speculate that the disparity may possibly be linked to the \nrecently documented rise of methamphetamine use by whites.\n  In just a very short period of time, the group that conducted this \nreport--The Public Statistics Institute--has established a strong \nrecord for their nonpartisan, objective reports on drug use and \nemergency-room admissions in the State of California.\n  This group's report on methamphetamine use in California was one of \nthe first reports completed that showed a real epidemic is developing. \nThe earlier methamphetamine report showed a 366-percent increase in \nmethamphetamine-related emergency room admissions in California from \n1984 to 1993. Hospitals in central California saw an unprecedented \n1,742-percent increase in admissions.\n  I am making these comments--and I attended a hearing last week on our \nNation's drug control strategy--because I feel eradicating drugs from \nour society is one of our most pressing challenges.\n  The President's drug control plan announced last week outlines \nimportant steps to meet this challenge. I am pleased to endorse his \naction and urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I am especially pleased that two of the five major strategies under \nthe plan respond to problems that are especially troubling in \nCalifornia methamphetamine and drug smuggling from Mexico.\n  The President has proposed a comprehensive national methamphetamine \nstrategy, which will attack the problem of methamphetamine from several \nsides, including enforcement, training police, legislation, regulations \nto control precursor chemicals, environmental cleanup of clandestine \nlaboratories where methamphetamine is made, international cooperation, \npublic education; and treatment.\n  Specific legislative proposals to help control methamphetamine \ninclude two provisions which are very similar to sections of the \nMethamphetamine Control Act, which I introduced earlier this year in a \nbipartisan effort with Senators Grassley, Reid and Kyl increase \npenalties for trafficking in precursor chemicals required to make \nmethamphetamine, and impose stiff civil penalties on chemical supply \nhouses that furnish vital precursor chemicals to clandestine \nmethamphetamine laboratories.\n  Senator John McCain recently joined us in cosponsoring the \nMethamphetamine Control Act, and I am hopeful that the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on this bill in \nthe very near future.\n  Passing legislation on methamphetamine alone will not solve our \nNation's drug crisis.\n  We must also commit our resources to fighting the entry of drugs \nacross our border, from Mexico.\n  Mexico is the dominant entry point for the illegal drugs which flow \ninto our country and especially into my State of California.\n  The Southwest Border Initiative--which is another very important part \nof the President's anti-drug strategy--adds hundreds of new enforcement \nagents and prosecutors to our border with Mexico, where they are sorely \nneeded, including 657 additional Customs staff at ports of entry along \nthe border; 700 new Border Patrol agents; and new agents for the DEA \nand FBI.\n  Overall, the President's Drug Control Strategy calls for increased \nfunding for drug control to rise from $13.8 billion to $15.1 billion in \nthe next 2 years.\n  In the end, I'm sure my colleagues will agree that we don't need \nanother report to tell us just how bad the drug problem has become in \nthis country.\n  We're losing an entire generation to the scourge of drugs. With the \nincreasing availability of methamphetamine and crack, the problem is \nonly going to get worse.\n  Congress must choke off the supply of these drugs and set tough, \nstrong penalties against those who profit from the drug trade.\n  There are three steps each Member of Congress can take, starting \ntoday, that will take steps toward this goal.\n  First, support the President's drug control strategy, including the \nbudget requests necessary to carry it out. It's a Presidential year, so \nsome on the other side of the aisle may be less likely to support this \nplan. I urge everyone in this Chamber to review the plan, make it \nbetter, but pass it quickly.\n  Second, pass the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, which has \nbipartisan support and which makes reasonable steps of stopping this \nhorrendous drug from spreading from the Western states to the entire \nNation.\n  Third, speak out against drugs in our communities, to our young \npeople, so we can reach them before it is too late. No more message, in \nthe end, is more effective than for everyone--community leaders, \nelected officials, and, most important, parents--to give a resounding \nmessage to our young people to stay away from drugs.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/17/senate-section/article/S5275-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5275-S5298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADMINISTRATION OF CERTAIN PRESIDIO PROPERTIES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SECRETARY OF \n                   THE INTERIOR.\n\n       (a) Interim Authority.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') is \n     authorized to manage leases in existence on the date of this \n     Act for properties under the administrative jurisdiction of \n     the Secretary and located at the Presidio. Upon the \n     expiration of any such lease, the Secretary may extend such \n     lease for a period terminating not later than 6 months after \n     the first meeting of the Presidio Trust. The Secretary may \n     not enter into any new leases for property at the Presidio to \n     be transferred to the Presidio Trust under this title, \n     however, the Secretary is authorized to enter into agreements \n     for use and occupancy of the Presidio properties which are \n     assignable to the Trust and are terminable within 30 days \n     notice by the Trust.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) certain scattered parcels of Federal land located \n     within Gilpin County, Colorado, are currently administered by \n     the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Royal Gorge \n     Resource Area, Canon City District, United States Bureau of \n     Land Management;\n       (2) these land parcels, which comprises approximately 133 \n     separate tracts of land, and range in size from approximately \n     38 acres to much less than an acre have been identified as \n     suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management \n     through its resource management planning process and are \n     appropriate for disposal; and\n       (3) even though the Federal land parcels in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, are scattered and small in size, they nevertheless \n     by virtue of their proximity to existing communities appear \n     to have a fair market value which may be used by the Federal \n     Government to exchange for lands which will better lend \n     themselves to Federal management and have higher values for \n     future public access, use and enjoyment, recreation, the \n     protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife and fish and \n     wildlife habitat, and the protection of riparian lands, \n     wetlands, scenic beauty and other public values.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to authorize, \n     direct, facilitate and expedite the land exchange set forth \n     herein in order to further the public interest by disposing \n     of Federal lands with limited public utility and acquire in \n     exchange therefor lands with important values for permanent \n     public management and protection.\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\n     SEC. 1102. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The exchange directed by this title shall \n     be consummated if within 90 days after enactment of this Act, \n     Lake Gulch, Inc., a Colorado Corporation (as defined in \n     section 1104 of this title) offers to transfer to the United \n     States pursuant to the provisions of this title the offered \n     lands or interests in land described herein.\n       (b) Conveyance by Lake Gulch.--Subject to the provisions of \n     section 1103 of this title, Lake Gulch shall convey to the \n     Secretary of the Interior all right, title, and interest in \n     and to the following offered lands--\n       (1) certain lands comprising approximately 40 acres with \n     improvements thereon located in Larimer County, Colorado, and \n     lying within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park \n     as generally depicted on a map entitled ``Circle C Church \n     Camp'', dated August 1994, which shall upon their acquisition \n     by the United States and without further action by the \n     Secretary of the Interior be incorporated into Rocky Mountain \n     National Park and thereafter be administered in accordance \n     with the laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to \n     the National Park System and Rocky Mountain National Park;\n       (2) certain lands located within and adjacent to the United \n     States Bureau of Land Management San Luis Resource Area in \n     Conejos County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 3,993 \n     acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Quinlan \n     Ranches Tract'', dated August 1994; and\n       (3) certain lands located within the United States Bureau \n     of Land Management Royal Gorge Resource Area in Huerfano \n     County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 4,700 acres \n     and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Bonham Ranch-\n     Cucharas Canyon'', dated June 1995: Provided however, That it \n     is the intention of Congress that such lands may remain \n     available for the grazing of livestock as determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary in accordance with applicable \n     laws, rules, and regulations: Provided further, That if the \n     Secretary determines that certain of the lands acquired \n     adjacent to Cucharas Canyon hereunder are not needed for \n     public purposes they may be sold in accordance with the \n     provisions of section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 and other applicable law.\n       (c) Substitution of Lands.--If one or more of the precise \n     offered land parcels identified above is unable to be \n     conveyed to the United States due to appraisal or other \n     problems, Lake Gulch and the Secretary may mutually agree to \n     substitute therefor alternative offered lands acceptable to \n     the Secretary.\n       (d) Coveyance by the United States.--(1) Upon receipt of \n     title to the lands identified in subsection (a) the Secretary \n     shall simultaneously convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, \n     and interest of the United States, subject to valid existing \n     rights, in and to the following selected lands--\n       (A) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 18, Lots 118-220, which comprise \n     approximately 195 acres and are intended to include all \n     federally owned lands in section 18, as generally depicted on \n     a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n     1994;\n       (B) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 17, Lots 37, 38, 39, 40, 52, 53, and 54, \n     which comprise approximately 96 acres, as generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n     1994; and\n       (C) certain unsurveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 73 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 13, which comprise approximately 11 acres, \n     and are generally depicted as parcels 302-304, 306 and 308-\n     326 on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated \n     July 1994: Provided however, That a parcel or parcels of land \n     in section 13 shall not be transferred to Lake Gulch if at \n     the time of the proposed transfer the parcel or parcels are \n     under formal application for transfer to a qualified unit of \n     local government. Due to the small and unsurveyed nature of \n     such parcels proposed for transfer to Lake Gulch in section \n     13, and the high cost of surveying such small parcels, the \n     Secretary is authorized to transfer such section 13 lands to \n     Lake Gulch without survey based on such legal or other \n     description as the Secretary determines appropriate to carry \n     out the basic intent of the map cited in this subparagraph.\n       (2) If the Secretary and Lake Gulch mutually agree, and the \n     Secretary determines it is in the public interest, the \n     Secretary may utilize the authority and direction of this \n     title to transfer to Lake Gulch lands in sections 17 and 13 \n     that are in addition to those precise selected lands shown on \n     the map cited herein, and which are not under formal \n     application for transfer to a qualified unit of local \n     government, upon transfer to the Secretary of additional \n     offered lands acceptable to the Secretary or upon payment to \n     the Secretary by Lake Gulch of cash equalization money \n     amounting to the full appraised fair market value of any such \n     additional lands. If any such additional lands are located in \n     section 13 they may be transferred to Lake Gulch without \n     survey based on such legal or other description as the \n     Secretary determines appropriate as long as the Secretary \n     determines that the boundaries of any adjacent lands not \n     owned by Lake Gulch can be properly identified so as to avoid \n     possible future boundary conflicts or disputes. If the \n     Secretary determines surveys are necessary to convey any such \n     additional lands to Lake Gulch, the costs of such surveys \n     shall be paid by Lake Gulch but shall not be eligible for any \n     adjustment in the value of such additional lands pursuant to \n     section 206(f)(2) of the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act of 1976 (as amended by the Federal Land Exchange \n     Facilitation Act of 1988) (43 U.S.C. 1716(f)(2)).\n       (3) Prior to transferring out of public ownership pursuant \n     to this title or other authority of law any lands which are \n     contiguous to North Clear Creek southeast of the City of \n     Black Hawk, Colorado in the County of Gilpin, Colorado, the \n     Secretary shall notify and consult with the county and city \n     and afford such units of local government an opportunity to \n     acquire or reserve pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 or other applicable law, such \n     easements or rights-of-way parallel to North Clear Creek as \n     may be necessary to serve public utility line or recreation \n     path needs: Provided however, That any survey or other costs \n     associated with the acquisition or reservation of such \n     easements or rights-of-way shall be paid for by the unit or \n     units of local government concerned.\n\n     SEC. 1103.

The use of any \n     water rights acquired pursuant to this section shall be \n     limited to water that can be used or exchanged for water that \n     can be used on the Blanca Wetlands.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (94 \n     Stat. 2371), enacted on December 2, 1980, established Gates \n     of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and Gates of the \n     Arctic Wilderness. The village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in \n     the highlands of the central Brooks Range, is virtually \n     surrounded by these national park and wilderness lands and is \n     the only Native village located within the boundary of a \n     National Park System unit in Alaska.\n       (2) Unlike most other Alaskan Native communities, the \n     village of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major river, \n     lake, or coastline that can be used as a means of access. The \n     residents of Anaktuvuk Pass have relied increasingly on snow \n     machines in winter and all-terrain vehicles in summer as \n     their primary means of access to pursue caribou and other \n     subsistence resources.\n       (3) In a 1983 land exchange agreement, linear easements \n     were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for use of all-\n     terrain vehicles across certain national park lands, mostly \n     along stream and river banks. These linear easements proved \n     unsatisfactory, because they provided inadequate access to \n     subsistence resources while causing excessive environmental \n     impact from concentrated use.\n       (4) The National Park Service and the Nunamiut Corporation \n     initiated discussions in 1985 to address concerns over the \n     use of all-terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land. \n     These discussions resulted in an agreement, originally \n     executed in 1992 and thereafter amended in 1993 and 1994, \n     among the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, the \n     City of Anaktuvuk Pass, and Arctic Slope Regional \n     Corporation. Full effectuation of this agreement, as amended, \n     by its terms requires ratification by the Congress.\n\n     SEC. 1402. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Ratification.--\n       (1) In general.--The terms, conditions, procedures, \n     covenants, reservations and other provisions set forth in the \n     document entitled ``Donation, Exchange of Lands and Interests \n     in Lands and Wilderness Redesignation Agreement Among Arctic \n     Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation, City of \n     Anaktuvuk Pass and the United States of America'' \n     (hereinafter referred to in this title as ``the Agreement''), \n     executed by the parties on December 17, 1992, as amended, are \n     hereby incorporated in this title, are ratified and \n     confirmed, and set forth the obligations and commitments of \n     the United States, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, \n     Nunamiut Corporation and the City of Anaktuvuk Pass, as a \n     matter of Federal law.\n       (2) Land acquisition.--Lands acquired by the United States \n     pursuant to the Agreement shall be administered by the \n     Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') as part of Gates of the Arctic National Park \n     and Preserve, subject to the laws and regulations applicable \n     thereto.\n       (b) Maps.--The maps set forth as Exhibits C1, C2, and D \n     through I to the Agreement depict the lands subject to the \n     conveyances, retention of surface access rights, access \n     easements and all-terrain vehicle easements.

SKI AREA PERMIT RENTAL CHARGE.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental \n     charge for all ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 \n     of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. \n     497b), the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; \n     16 U.S.C. 497), or the 9th through 20th paragraphs under the \n     heading ``SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS'' under the heading \n     ``UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR'' in the Act of June \n     4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, chapter 2), on National Forest System \n     lands. Permit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to \n     the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be \n     calculated as set forth in subsection (b). Permit rental \n     charges for existing ski area permits issued pursuant to the \n     Act of March 4, 1915, and the Act of June 4, 1897, shall be \n     calculated in accordance with those existing permits: \n     Provided, That a permittee may, at the permittee's option, \n     use the calculation method set forth in subsection (b).\n       (b)(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be \n     calculated by adding the permittee's gross revenues from lift \n     ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from \n     ski school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by \n     the slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest \n     System land. That amount shall be increased by the gross \n     year-round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) \n     physically located on national forest land, including all \n     permittee or subpermittee lodging, food service, rental \n     shops, parking and other ancillary operations, to determine \n     the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental \n     charge. The final rental charge shall be calculated by \n     multiplying the AGR by the following percentages for each \n     revenue bracket and adding the total for each revenue \n     bracket:\n       (A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below \n     $3,000,000;\n       (B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between \n     $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;\n       (C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between \n     $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and\n       (D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue \n     that exceeds $50,000,000.\n       Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection \n     the ski area permit fee (SAPF) formula can be simply \n     illustrated as:\n\n         SAPF = ((LT + SS)  STFP) + GRAF = AGR; AGR  % BRACKETS\n\n       (2) In cases where ski areas are only partially located on \n     national forest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on \n     national forest land referred to in subsection (b) shall be \n     calculated as generally described in the Forest Service \n     Manual in effect as of January 1, 1992. Revenues from Nordic \n     ski operations shall be included or excluded from the rental \n     charge calculation according to the percentage of trails \n     physically located on national forest land.\n       (3) In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair \n     and equitable to both the United States and the ski area \n     permittees, the adjusted gross revenue figures for each \n     revenue bracket in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted annually \n     by the percent increase or decrease in the national Consumer \n     Price Index for the preceding calendar year. No later than 5 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act and every 10 \n     years thereafter the Secretary shall submit to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate \n     and the Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives a report analyzing whether the ski area \n     permit rental charge legislated by this Act is returning a \n     fair market value rental to the United States together with \n     any recommendations the Secretary may have for modifications \n     of the system.\n       (c) The rental charge set forth in subsection (b) shall be \n     due on June 1 of each year and shall be paid or pre-paid by \n     the permittee on a monthly, quarterly, annual or other \n     schedule as determined appropriate by the Secretary in \n     consultation with the permittee. Unless mutually agreed \n     otherwise by the Secretary and the permittee, the payment or \n     prepayment schedule shall conform to the permittee's schedule \n     in effect prior to enactment of this Act. To reduce costs to \n     the permittee and the Forest Service, the Secretary shall \n     each year provide the permittee with a standardized form and \n     worksheets (including annual rental charge calculation \n     brackets and rates) to be used for rental charge calculation \n     and submitted with the rental charge payment. Information \n     provided on such forms shall be compiled by the Secretary \n     annually and kept in the Office of the Chief, United States \n     Forest Service.\n       (d) The ski area permit rental charge set forth in this \n     section shall become effective on June 1, 1996 and cover \n     receipts retroactive to June 1, 1995: Provided however, That \n     if a permittee has paid rental charges for the period June 1, \n     1995, to June 1, 1996, under the graduated rate rental charge \n     system formula in effect prior to the date of enactment of \n     this Act, such rental charges shall be credited toward the \n     new rental charge due on June 1, 1996. In order to ensure \n     increasing rental charge receipt levels to the United States \n     during transition from the graduated rate rental charge \n     system formula to the formula of this Act, the rental charge \n     paid by any individual permittee shall be--\n       (1) for the 1995-1996 permit year, either the rental charge \n     paid for the preceding 1994-1995 base year or the rental \n     charge calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher;\n       (2) for the 1996-1997 permit year, either the rental charge \n     paid for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge \n     calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher;\n       (3) for the 1997-1998 permit year, either the rental charge \n     for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge calculated \n     pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher.\n\n     If an individual permittee's adjusted gross revenue for the \n     1995-1996, 1996-1997, or 1997-1998 permit years falls more \n     than 10 percent below the 1994-1995 base year, the rental \n     charge paid shall be the rental charge calculated pursuant to \n     this Act.\n       (e) Under no circumstances shall revenue, or subpermittee \n     revenue (other than lift ticket, area use pass, or ski school \n     sales) obtained from operations physically located on non-\n     national forest land be included in the ski area permit \n     rental charge calculation.\n       (f) To reduce administrative costs of ski area permittees \n     and the Forest Service the terms ``revenue'' and ``sales'', \n     as used in this section, shall mean actual income from sales \n     and shall not include sales of operating equipment, refunds, \n     rent paid to the permittee by sublessees, sponsor \n     contributions to special events or any amounts attributable \n     to employee gratuities or employee lift tickets, discounts, \n     or other goods or services (except for bartered goods and \n     complimentary lift tickets) for which the permittee does not \n     receive money.\n       (g) In cases where an area of national forest land is under \n     a ski area permit but the permittee does not have revenue or \n     sales qualifying for rental charge payment pursuant to \n     subsection (a), the permittee shall pay an annual minimum \n     rental charge of $2 for each national forest acre under \n     permit or a percentage of appraised land value, as determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary.\n       (h) Where the new rental charge provided for in subsection \n     (b)(1) results in an increase in permit rental charge greater \n     than one half of one percent of the permittee's adjusted \n     gross revenue as determined under subsection (b)(1), the new \n     rental charge shall be phased in over a five year period in a \n     manner providing for increases of approximately equal \n     increments.\n       (i) To reduce Federal costs in administering the provisions \n     of this Act, the reissuance of a ski area permit to provide \n     activities similar in nature and amount to the activities \n     provided under the previous permit shall not constitute a \n     major Federal action for the purposes of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 1702. WITHDRAWALS.\n\n       Subject to valid existing rights, all lands located within \n     the boundaries of ski area permits issued prior to, on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act pursuant to authority \n     of the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 \n     U.S.C. 497), and the Act of June 4, 1897, or the National \n     Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b) are \n     hereby and henceforth automatically withdrawn from all forms \n     of appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition \n     under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing \n     and all amendments thereto. Such withdrawal shall continue \n     for the full term of the permit and any modification, \n     reissuance, or renewal thereof. Unless the Secretary requests \n     otherwise of the Secretary of the Interior, such withdrawal \n     shall be canceled automatically upon expiration or other \n     termination of the permit and the land automatically restored \n     to all appropriation not otherwise restricted under the \n     public land laws.\n\n      TITLE XVIII--THE SELMA TO MONTGOMERY NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL\n\n     SEC. 1801.

Should the decision be \n     made to revoke the withdrawal and reservation, the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall publish in the Federal Register an \n     appropriate order which shall--\n       (1) terminate the withdrawal and reservation;\n       (2) constitute official acceptance of full jurisdiction \n     over the lands by the Secretary of the Interior; and\n       (3) state the date upon which the lands will be opened to \n     the operation of the public land laws, including the mining \n     laws if appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 1908. DELEGATION.\n\n       The function of the Secretary of the Army under this Act \n     may be delegated.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as \n     may be necessary to carry out this title.\n\n                 TITLE XX--SNOWBASIN LAND EXCHANGE ACT\n\n     SEC. 2001. FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in June 1995, Salt Lake City, Utah, was selected to \n     host the 2002 Winter Olympic Games and the Snowbasin Ski \n     Resort, which is owned by the Sun Valley Company, was \n     identified as the site of six Olympic events: the men's and \n     women's downhills, men's and women's Super-Gs, and men's and \n     women's combined downhills;\n       (2) in order to adequately accommodate these events, which \n     are traditionally among the most popular and heavily attended \n     at the Winter Olympic Games, major new skiing, visitor, and \n     support facilities will have to be constructed at the \n     Snowbasin Ski Resort on land currently administered by the \n     United States Forest Service;\n       (3) while certain of these new facilities can be \n     accommodated on National Forest land under traditional Forest \n     Service permitting authorities, the base area facilities \n     necessary to host visitors to the ski area and the Winter \n     Olympics are of such a nature that they should logically be \n     located on private land;\n       (4) land exchanges have been routinely utilized by the \n     Forest Service to transfer base area lands to many other ski \n     areas, and the Forest Service and the Sun Valley Company have \n     concluded that a land exchange to transfer base area lands at \n     the Snowbasin Ski Resort to the Sun Valley Company is both \n     logical and advisable;\n       (5) an environmental impact statement and numerous resource \n     studies have been completed by the Forest Service and the Sun \n     Valley Company for the lands proposed to be transferred to \n     the Sun Valley Company by this title;\n       (6) the Sun Valley Company has assembled lands with \n     outstanding environmental, recreational, and other values to \n     convey to the Forest Service in return for the lands it will \n     receive in the exchange, and the Forest Service has \n     identified such lands as desirable for acquisition by the \n     United States; and\n       (7) completion of a land exchange and approval of a \n     development plan for Olympic related facilities at the \n     Snowbasin Ski Resort is essential to ensure that all \n     necessary facilities can be constructed, tested for safety \n     and other purposes, and become fully operational in advance \n     of the 2002 Winter Olympics and earlier pre-Olympic events.\n       (b) Determination.--The Congress has reviewed the previous \n     analyses and studies of the lands to be exchanged and \n     developed pursuant to this title, and has made its own review \n     of these lands and issues involved, and on the basis of those \n     reviews hereby finds and determines that a legislated land \n     exchange and development plan approval with respect to \n     certain National Forest System Lands is necessary to meet \n     Olympic goals and timetables.\n\n     SEC. 2002. PURPOSE AND INTENT.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to authorize and direct the \n     Secretary to exchange 1,320 acres of federally-owned land \n     within the Cache National Forest in the State of Utah for \n     lands of approximately equal value owned by the Sun Valley \n     Company. It is the intent of Congress that this exchange be \n     completed without delay within the period specified by \n     section 2004.\n\n     SEC. 2003. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this title--\n       (1) the term ``Sun Valley Company'' means the Sun Valley \n     Company, a division of Sinclair Oil Corporation, a Wyoming \n     Corporation, or its successors or assigns; and\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n\n     SEC. 2004. EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) Federal Selected Lands.--(1) Not later than 45 days \n     after the final determination of value of the Federal \n     selected lands, the Secretary shall, subject to this title, \n     transfer all right, title, and interest of the United States \n     in and to the lands referred to in paragraph (2) to the Sun \n     Valley Company.\n       (2) The lands referred to in paragraph (1) are certain \n     lands within the Cache National Forest in the State of Utah \n     comprising 1,320 acres, more or less, as generally depicted \n     on the map entitled ``Snowbasin Land Exchange--Proposed'' and \n     dated October 1995.\n       (b) Non-Federal Offered Lands.--Upon transfer of the \n     Federal selected lands under subsection (a), and in exchange \n     for those lands, the Sun Valley Company shall simultaneously \n     convey to the Secretary all right, title and interest of the \n     Sun Valley Company in and to so much of the following offered \n     lands which have been previously identified by the United \n     States Forest Service as desirable by the United States, or \n     which are identified pursuant to paragraph (5) prior to the \n     transfer of lands under subsection (a), as are of approximate \n     equal value to the Federal selected lands:\n       (1) Certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, which \n     comprise approximately 640 acres and are generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``Lightning Ridge Offered Lands'', dated \n     October 1995.\n       (2) Certain lands located within the Cache National Forest \n     in Weber County, Utah, which comprise approximately 635 acres \n     and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Wheeler Creek \n     Watershed Offered Lands--Section 2'' dated October 1995.\n       (3) Certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, and lying \n     immediately adjacent to the outskirts of the City of Ogden, \n     Utah, which comprise approximately 800 acres and are \n     generally depicted on a map entitled ``Taylor Canyon Offered \n     Lands'', dated October 1995.\n       (4) Certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, which \n     comprise approximately 2,040 acres and are generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``North Fork Ogden River--Devil's Gate \n     Valley'', dated October 1995.\n       (5) Such additional offered lands in the State of Utah as \n     may be necessary to make the values of the lands exchanged \n     pursuant to this title approximately equal, and which are \n     acceptable to the Secretary.\n       (c) Substitution of Offered Lands.--If one or more of the \n     precise offered land parcels identified in paragraphs (1) \n     through (4) of subsection (b) is unable to be conveyed to the \n     United States due to appraisal or other reasons, or if the \n     Secretary and the Sun Valley Company mutually agree and the \n     Secretary determines that an alternative offered land package \n     would better serve long term public needs and objectives, the \n     Sun Valley Company may simultaneously convey to the United \n     States alternative offered lands in the State of Utah \n     acceptable to the Secretary in lieu of any or all of the \n     lands identified in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection \n     (b).\n       (d) Valuation and Appraisals.--(1) Values of the lands to \n     be exchanged pursuant to this title shall be equal as \n     determined by the Secretary utilizing nationally recognized \n     appraisal standards and in accordance with section 206 of the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The appraisal \n     reports shall be written to Federal standards as defined in \n     the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land \n     Acquisitions. If, due to size, location, or use of lands \n     exchanged under this title, the values are not exactly equal, \n     they shall be equalized by the payment of cash equalization \n     money to the Secretary or the Sun Valley Company as \n     appropriate in accordance with section 206(b) of the Federal \n     Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(b)). \n     In order to expedite the consummation of the exchange \n     directed by this title, the Sun Valley Company shall arrange \n     and pay for appraisals of the offered and selected lands by a \n     qualified appraiser with experience in appraising similar \n     properties and who is mutually acceptable to the Sun Valley \n     Company and the Secretary. The appraisal of the Federal \n     selected lands shall be completed and submitted to the \n     Secretary for technical review and approval no later than 120 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, and the \n     Secretary shall make a determination of value not later\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\n     than 30 days after receipt of the appraisal. In the event the \n     Secretary and the Sun Valley Company are unable to agree to \n     the appraised value of a certain tract or tracts of land, the \n     appraisal, appraisals, or appraisal issues in dispute and a \n     final determination of value shall be resolved through a \n     process of bargaining or submission to arbitration in \n     accordance with section 206(d) of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(d)).\n       (2) In order to expedite the appraisal of the Federal \n     selected lands, such appraisal shall--\n       (A) value the land in its unimproved state, as a single \n     entity for its highest and best use as if in private \n     ownership and as of the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (B) consider the Federal lands as an independent property \n     as though in the private marketplace and suitable for \n     development to its highest and best use;\n       (C) consider in the appraisal any encumbrance on the title \n     anticipated to be in the conveyance to Sun Valley Company and \n     reflect its effect on the fair market value of the property; \n     and\n       (D) not reflect any enhancement in value to the Federal \n     selected lands based on the existence of private lands owned \n     by the Sun Valley Company in the vicinity of the Snowbasin \n     Ski Resort, and shall assume that private lands owned by the \n     Sun Valley Company are not available for use in conjunction \n     with the Federal selected lands.\n\n     SEC. 2005. GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The exchange authorized by this title \n     shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:\n       (1) Reserved rights-of-way.--In any deed issued pursuant to \n     section 5(a), the Secretary shall reserve in the United \n     States a right of reasonable access across the conveyed \n     property for public access and for administrative purposes of \n     the United States necessary to manage adjacent federally-\n     owned lands. The terms of such reservation shall be \n     prescribed by the Secretary within 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Right of rescission.--This title shall not be binding \n     on either the United States or the Sun Valley Company if, \n     within 30 days after the final determination of value of the \n     Federal selected lands, the Sun Valley Company submits to the \n     Secretary a duly authorized and executed resolution of the \n     Company stating its intention not to enter into the exchange \n     authorized by this title.\n       (b) Withdrawal.--Subject to valid existing rights, \n     effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal \n     selected lands described in section 5(a)(2) and all National \n     Forest System lands currently under special use permit to the \n     Sun Valley Company at the Snowbasin Ski Resort are hereby \n     withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the public \n     land laws (including the mining laws) and from disposition \n     under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing.\n       (c) Deed.--The conveyance of the offered lands to the \n     United States under this title shall be by general warranty \n     or other deed acceptable to the Secretary and in conformity \n     with applicable title standards of the Attorney General of \n     the United States.\n       (d) Status of Lands.--Upon acceptance of title by the \n     Secretary, the land conveyed to the United States pursuant to \n     this title shall become part of the Wasatch or Cache National \n     Forests as appropriate, and the boundaries of such National \n     Forests shall be adjusted to encompass such lands. Once \n     conveyed, such lands shall be managed in accordance with the \n     Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (commonly known as the \n     ``Weeks Act''), and in accordance with the other laws, rules \n     and regulations applicable to National Forest System lands. \n     This subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to \n     adjust the boundaries pursuant to section 11 of the Act of \n     March 1, 1911 (``Weeks Act''). For the purposes of section 7 \n     of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 \n     U.S.C. 4601-9), the boundaries of the Wasatch and Cache \n     National Forests, as adjusted by this title, shall be \n     considered to be boundaries of the forests as of January 1, \n     1965.\n\n     SEC. 2006.

The Secretary may modify such Phase I facilities \n     upon mutual agreement with the Sun Valley Company or by \n     imposing conditions pursuant to subsection (b) of this \n     section.\n       (3) Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary shall submit the reviewed Master Plan on the \n     Phase I facilities, including any modifications made thereto \n     pursuant to paragraph (2), to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the \n     Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives for a 30-day review period. At the end of the \n     30-day period, unless otherwise directed by Act of Congress, \n     the Secretary may issue all necessary authorizations for \n     construction and operation of such facilities or \n     modifications thereof in accordance with the procedures and \n     provisions of subsection (b) of this section.\n       (b) Phase I Facility Approval, Conditions, and Timetable.--\n     Within 120 days of receipt of an application by the Sun \n     Valley Company to authorize construction and operation of any \n     particular Phase I facility, facilities, or group of \n     facilities, the Secretary, in consultation with the Sun \n     Valley Company, shall authorize construction and operation of \n     such facility, facilities, or group of facilities, subject to \n     the general policies of the Forest Service pertaining to the \n     construction and operation of ski area facilities on National \n     Forest System lands and subject to reasonable conditions to \n     protect National Forest System resources. In providing \n     authorization to construct and operate a facility, \n     facilities, or group of facilities, the Secretary may not \n     impose any condition that would significantly change the \n     location, size, or scope of the applied for Phase I facility \n     unless--\n       (1) the modification is mutually agreed to by the Secretary \n     and the Sun Valley Company; or\n       (2) the modification is necessary to protect health and \n     safety.\n\n     Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \n     Secretary's responsibility to monitor and assure compliance \n     with the conditions set forth in the construction and \n     operation authorization.\n       (c) Congressional Directions.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, Congress finds that consummation of the \n     land exchange directed by this title and all determinations, \n     authorizations, and actions taken by the Secretary pursuant \n     to this title pertaining to Phase I facilities on National \n     Forest System lands, or any modifications thereof, to be \n     nondiscretionary actions authorized and directed by Congress \n     and hence to comply with all procedural and other \n     requirements of the laws of the United States. Such \n     determinations, authorizations, and actions shall not be \n     subject to administrative or judicial review.\n\n     SEC. 2007. NO PRECEDENT.\n\n       Nothing in section 2004(d)(2) of this title relating to \n     conditions or limitations on the appraisal of the Federal \n     lands, or any provision of section 2006 relating to the \n     approval by the Congress or the Forest Service of facilities \n     on National Forest System lands, shall be construed as a \n     precedent for subsequent legislation.\n\n             TITLE XXI--COLONIAL NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.\n\n     SEC. 2101.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that:\n       (1) In 1899, the citizens of Cuprum, Idaho, commissioned \n     E.S. Hesse to conduct a survey describing these lands \n     occupied by their community. The purpose of this survey was \n     to provide a basis for the application for a townsite patent.\n       (2) In 1909, the Cuprum Townsite patent (Number 52817) was \n     granted, based on an aliquot parts description which was \n     intended to circumscribe the Hesse survey.\n       (3) Since the day of the patent, the Hesse survey has been \n     used continuously by the community of Cuprum and by Adams \n     Country, Idaho, as the official townsite plat and basis for \n     conveyance of title within the townsite.\n       (4) Recent boundary surveys conducted by the United States \n     Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and the United \n     States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, \n     discovered inconsistencies between the official aliquot parts \n     description of the patented Cuprum Townsite and the Hesse \n     survey. Many lots along the south and east boundaries of the \n     townsite are now known to extend onto National Forest System \n     lands outside the townsite.\n       (5) It is the determination of Congress that the original \n     intent of the Cuprum Townsite application was to include all \n     the lands described by the Hesse survey.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to amend the \n     1909 Cuprum Townsite patent to include those additional lands \n     described by the\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\n     Hesse survey in addition to other lands necessary to provide \n     an administratively acceptable boundary to the National \n     Forest System.\n\n     SEC. 3002. AMENDMENT OF PATENT.\n\n       (a) The 1909 Cuprum Townsite patent is hereby amended to \n     include parcels 1 and 2, identified on the plat, marked as \n     ``Township 20 North, Range 3 West, Boise Meridian, Idaho, \n     Section 10: Proposed Patent Adjustment Cuprum Townsite, \n     Idaho'' prepared by Payette N.F.--Land Survey Unit, drawn and \n     approved by Tom Betzold, Forest Land Surveyor, on April 25, \n     1995. Such additional lands are hereby conveyed to the \n     original patentee, Pitts Ellis, trustee, and Probate Judge of \n     Washington County, Idaho, or any successors or assigns in \n     interest in accordance with State law. The Secretary of \n     Agriculture may correct clerical and typographical errors in \n     such plat.\n       (b) The Federal Government shall survey the Federal \n     property lines and mark and post the boundaries necessary to \n     implement this section.\n\n     SEC. 3003. RELEASE.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 120 of the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of \n     1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9620), the United States shall \n     not be liable and shall be held harmless from any and all \n     claims resulting from substances or petroleum products or any \n     other hazardous materials on the conveyed land.\n\n            TITLE XXXI--ARKANSAS AND OKLAHOMA LAND EXCHANGE\n\n     SEC. 3101.

Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \ntoday legislation which authorizes the Air Force to enter into a \nmultiyear contract for the procurement of the C-17 globemaster III, the \nworld's newest and finest strategic air lifter.\n  While the legislation before us is simple--authorizing a multiyear \ncontract, it is critically important. In short, it will allow the Air \nForce to more rapidly improve its ability to project U.S. power \nanywhere in the world. In this time of shrinking budgets and growing \ndemands, we must set priorities for modernization of our military \nforces--C-17 is for me a top priority.\n  As my colleagues recall, earlier this year, President Clinton \nattempted to ram through the Congress a 7-year multiyear contract \nauthority. At the time, Senator Thurmond and I supported the idea of a \nmultiyear procurement authorization, but we thought the proposal could \nbe improved in ways which would benefit the taxpayer, the Air Force, \nand the skilled workers who build the aircraft. That is exactly what \nthe committee has done. Under the legislation before us, the \nprocurement of the C-17 will be expedited, resulting in greater savings \nfor the American taxpayer, increased capabilities for the Air Force, \nand greater efficiency and stability for the industrial base.\n  The Armed Services Committee recently completed markup of its fiscal \nyear 1997 defense authorization bill. To take immediate advantage of \nthe opportunities created by the multiyear procurement legislation \nbefore us, the committee was able to add $249 million in the fiscal \nyear 1997 bill to procure an additional aircraft this year and to \nprovide long-lead funding for two more aircraft in fiscal year 1998. As \na result, the Air Force will be on a path which will move the last five \naircraft of the contract up to the first 3 years, saving the taxpayer \nan additional $300 million and creating a more efficient production \nschedule.\n\n  Mr. President, Army missions are up 300 percent since the end of the \ncold war, yet the number of troops forward-deployed is significantly \ndown. Our force is smaller and is Conus based. Now, more than ever, \nsufficient strategic air lift is absolutely essential for the success \nof our military. However, even with the Pentagon's planned buy of 120 \nC-17's, the Department of Defense will be unable to meet its minimum \nstrategic airlift requirement of 49.4 million-ton-miles-per-day between \nfiscal 1997 and fiscal 2004. By expediting the procurement of the C-17, \nwe are helping to fill that void. In my view, it is clear that America \nwill need more than 120 C-17's to meet our needs.\n  Mr. President, clearly the legislation before us is both critical to \nthe needs of the Department of Defense and good for the American \ntaxpayer. I commend the Armed Services Committee for their efforts in \ncrafting this legislation and look forward to its passage.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements related to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1710) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5299]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

COURTOVICH\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to George F. \nCourtovich of Stratham, NH. It was just 1 year ago that my wife and I \nattended this young man's funeral in New Hampshire. George died at an \nearly age of 33, leaving behind his wife Debbie, daughter Colleen, \nparents, George and Dorothy, and brother Jim.\n  I think nothing is harder than consoling a mother, a father, a wife, \na brother, on the tragic loss, such an early and unexpected loss, of \nsomeone who was so close and loved and so young. However, my wife Mary \nJo and I were able to learn so much more about George at his wake and \nfuneral from his friends, colleagues, and family who had gathered to \nmourn his death.\n  George had a youthful zeal for life that touched many in his \ncommunity. From the senior citizens to whom he brought food to on \nholidays to the people in need he helped as a volunteer EMT in his \nhometown, George made a difference. George was a volunteer looking to \nhelp. He strived to make the quality of life better for not only his \nfamily but his community.\n  George also was a ski instructor at Loon Mountain on weekends, \nhelping others learn a sport that he had mastered. He even took on the \ntask of teaching the senior Senator from Texas how to navigate on the \nsnowy slopes of New Hampshire. This is a task daunting for even the \nmost experienced ski instructor, but one George spoke of with honor, \nand, frankly, a little humor.\n  George lived his life to the fullest always looking to move forward \nand to bring others with him. To see the numbers of people who turned \nout for his funeral, it was clear that the people who knew him had \nprofound respect for what George did for his family and community.\n  It is because of people like George Courtovich that we are here \ntoday, Mr. President. The hard working people of this country who \ncontribute to their community, raise their families, help their \nneighbors, make this country what it is today. It is easy to find \nreasons why one cannot participate in their community or volunteer to \nhelp others. It is much easier than it is to become active in such \nendeavors. George did not take the easy route and for that he left this \nworld as an example for others. He left too early, but was able to live \nthree lifetimes before he did.\n  No, George is not with us today but his memory and example of \nleadership and charity are. I join the Courtovich family as they \nprepare to celebrate his life at the morning mass on Tuesday, May 21, \nin honor of their son, brother, husband, and father at St. Michael's \nChurch in Exeter, NH.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/17/senate-section/article/S5299-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5299-S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ADM. MIKE BOORDA\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is with a very heavy heart and a \nprofound sadness that I take the floor today to pay tribute to a good \nfriend, Adm. Mike Boorda. As my colleagues know, Admiral Boorda \napparently took his life yesterday near his home on the grounds of the \nWashington Navy Yard.\n  Mike Boorda was an inspiration to those of us who care about military \nmatters and who strive to improve the quality of life of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines. He was also an inspiration to our \nenlisted ranks, to whom he demonstrated by example that hard work, \ndedication and commitment can pay off. My dad was a naval aviator in \nWorld War II. Like my dad, Mike Boorda was a Mustang, he was an \nenlisted man who rose from the enlisted ranks to become an officer. So \nI had a special appreciation for what Mike Boorda did. His career is a \nmodern day success story. He was the first enlisted man to rise up \nthrough the ranks, become an officer, and become the Chief of Naval \nOperations. He was the first one in the history of America. From his \nenlistment in the U.S. Navy in 1956 through his service as Chief of \nNaval Operations, Adm. Mike Boorda epitomized our Nation's finest. He \nwas truly a remarkable man.\n  Many of my colleagues have described Admiral Boorda's distinguished \nprofessional history. It is a career rich in diversity, long on \naccomplishment.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this point that Admiral Boorda's \ncurriculum vitae be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n    Adm. Jeremy Michael Boorda, U.S. Navy, Chief of Naval Operations\n\n       Admiral Boorda, born in South Bend, Indiana, in November \n     1939, enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1956. He attained the rate \n     of petty officer first class, serving at a number of \n     commands, primarily in aviation. His last two enlisted \n     assignments were in Attack\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\n     Squadron 144 and Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 11. \n     He was selected for commissioning under the Integration \n     Program in 1962.\n       Following Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode \n     Island, and commissioning in August 1962, Admiral Boorda \n     served aboard U.S.S. Porterfield (DD 682) as Combat \n     Information Center Officer. He attended Naval Destroyer \n     School in Newport and in 1964 was assigned as Weapons \n     Officer, U.S.S. John R. Craig (DD 885). His next tour was as \n     Commanding Officer, U.S.S. Parrot (MSC 197).\n       Admiral Boorda's first shore tour was as a weapons \n     instructor at Naval Destroyer School in Newport. In 1971, \n     after attending the U.S. Naval War College and also earning a \n     bachelor of arts degree from the University of Rhode Island, \n     he assumed duties as Executive Officer, U.S.S. Brooke (DEG \n     1). That tour was followed by a short period at the \n     University of Oklahoma and an assignment as Head, Surface \n     Lieutenant Commander Assignments/Assistant for Captain \n     Detailing in the Bureau of Naval Personnel, Washington, D.C.\n       From 1975 to 1977, Admiral Boorda commanded the U.S.S. \n     Farragut (DDG 37). He was next assigned as Executive \n     Assistant to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the \n     Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Washington, D.C. He \n     relieved the civilian presidential appointee in that \n     position, remaining until 1981, when he took command of \n     Destroyer Squadron Twenty-two.\n       In 1983 and 1984, he served as Executive Assistant to the \n     Chief of Naval Personnel/Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for \n     Manpower, Personnel and Training. In December 1984, he \n     assumed his first flag officer assignment as Executive \n     Assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations, remaining until \n     July 1986.\n       His next assignment was Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group \n     Eight in Norfolk, Virginia; he served as a Carrier Battle \n     Group Commander embarked on U.S.S. Saratoga (CV 60), and also \n     as Commander, Battle Force Sixth Fleet in 1987.\n       In August 1988, Admiral Boorda became Chief of Naval \n     Personnel/Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower, \n     Personnel and Training. In November 1991 he received his \n     fourth star and in December 1991, became Commander in Chief, \n     Allied Forces Southern Europe (Naples, Italy) and Commander \n     in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe (London, England). As \n     CINCSOUTH, Admiral Boorda was in command of all NATO forces \n     engaged in operations enforcing U.N. sanctions against the \n     warring factions in the former Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       On 1 February 1993, while serving as Commander in Chief, \n     Admiral Boorda assumed duty as Commander, Joint Task Force \n     Provide Promise, responsible for the supply of humanitarian \n     relief to Bosnia-Herzegovina via air-land and air-drop \n     missions and for troops contributing to the U.N. mission \n     throughout the Balkans.\n       Admiral Boorda's military awards include the Defense \n     Distinguished Service Medal, the Distinguished Service Medal \n     (three awards), the Legion of Merit (three awards), the \n     Meritorious Service Medal (two awards) and a number of other \n     personal and campaign awards.\n       On April 23, 1994, Admiral Boorda became the 25th Chief of \n     Naval Operations.\n       Admiral Boorda is married to the former Bettie Moran. They \n     have four children and nine grandchildren; two sons and one \n     daughter-in-law are naval officers.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Rather than recite his vast and substantial \naccomplishments, I want to talk for a moment about the Mike Boorda that \nI knew. From the first time I met Adm. Mike Boorda, I knew he was \nsomething special. My first impressions were that he was an extremely \nintelligent, forthright, and principled man. He would tell it like it \nis. He pulled no punches. He had a passion for the Navy, a real \npassion. He had a passion for promoting the well-being of U.S. service \nmen and women and for defending the interests of our Nation. When Mike \nBoorda told you something, he looked you in the eye and he spoke from \nthe heart. You could take it to the bank. He was a man of his word. He \nwas a man of honor. He was a man of great courage.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I had the opportunity to \nwork very closely with Admiral Boorda. We frequently spoke on the \nphone. We met in hearings and private meetings, over dinner or just in \npassing. We also spent a great deal of time together during the base \nclosure process.\n  No one took the challenge of downsizing our infrastructure more \nseriously than Mike Boorda. No one fought harder to preserve essential \nnaval capabilities. Sometimes Mike Boorda may not have agreed with the \ndecisions that he was asked to carry out, but, like any good soldier, \nhe carried them out. He never complained.\n  That commitment to national security and to our naval-industrial base \nis well known in New Hampshire. Last Spring, when en route to Bosnia, \nMike Boorda diverted his scheduled trip so that he could spend a few \nhours touring the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard with the Base Closure \nCommission, who was there to look at whether or not we should close our \nshipyard. I remember him calling me saying, ``Senator, do you need me \nthere?'' I said, ``Admiral, I know you are a busy man, but the answer \nis yes, the Base Closure Commission needs to hear from you directly and \npersonally that this shipyard is critical to the future of our Navy.'' \nHe said, ``I will be there,'' and he was. And it made a very profound \nand lasting impact on the people of the Granite State. We owe him a \nlot, an awful lot.\n  It made a direct impact on the members of the Base Closure Commission \nwhom he looked in the eye and said, ``Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot \ntake this base away from me. I need it.''\n  Even today, members will tell you that that had an impact on their \ndecision. He looked them in the eye, and he told them the Navy needed \nthis shipyard. He spoke from the heart, he spoke the truth, and they \nknew it.\n  Those who had the privilege to know Mike Boorda personally, to work \nwith him professionally, or to merely observe him in action, know that \nhe was unique. He had that rare ability to communicate volumes through \na few carefully chosen words. He was not one to dominate a conversation \nor to chew your ear off. He had few words to say. But when he said \nthem, you knew exactly where he was coming from, and he chose them very \ncarefully.\n  He had the ability to transcend politics and parochialism by framing \nissues in their appropriate context.\n  Whether serving a President Bush or a President Clinton, he was still \nAdm. Mike Boorda, naval officer, and a damned good one, Mr. President. \nHe had the ability to command respect, discipline and excellence \nthrough his own example. He was a leader among leaders. The Navy will \nmiss him, the country will miss him, his family will miss him, and I \nwill miss him. I want to offer my deepest sympathies to his wife, \nBettie, and their four children.\n  There is another aspect of Mike Boorda that I want to emphasize. In \nthe Armed Services Committee, former Chairman Nunn and Chairman \nThurmond have always asked the officers who come to testify to speak \nfrom their heart, tell how they feel about an issue and not be bound by \na policy that they may or may not disagree with. Mike Boorda lived up \nto that commitment, and always provided the Senate with honest, candid \ntestimony.\n  Amidst the grief and sorrow of this incident, I am compelled to offer \nsome personal observations and concerns regarding recent events in the \nNavy that may or may not have had some relationship to this tragedy. \nBut I want to express them because I feel them deeply, and I think they \nneed to be said.\n  I have never been one to question the responsibility of our news \nmedia to report on stories of national interest, nor have I sought to \nimpugn the motives of news organizations seeking to root out the truth, \nand I am not doing that now. But it seems to me that the nature of news \ncoverage and reporting is changing these days, I fear, for the worse.\n  Clearly, the Navy has had some difficult problems over the past few \nyears. Some of these were institutional in nature, others were isolated \nincidents and yet others were just plain bad judgment. These are not \nthe norm, Mr. President, but we hear about them just the same. For \ninstance, we hear about the problems at the Naval Academy, but we do \nnot hear about the thousands of young men and women who go through that \nAcademy, who make it, become great officers, and sacrifice their lives \nfor the country. We do not hear a lot about that.\n  The press has a responsibility to report on current events in a \nbalanced and impartial manner. For the most part, I believe that has \nbeen the case. But at some point, there exists a line where responsible \njournalism gives way to excessive badgering. At some point, the \ncontinuing quest for a story can give way to relentless, unwarranted \npersecution.\n  This is a tough town, Mr. President, as you well know. This town can \nconsume people. There is a lot of pressure--pressure on families, \npressure on individuals, pressure to get the job done. It is not a \nreport to work at 9 o'clock and go home at 5 town. Admiral Boorda knew \nthat, and when a crisis erupted, he was on the job, night or\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\nday, whenever necessary. He never questioned that.\n  I want to make it clear, I am not criticizing the media or indicating \ntheir actions had a role in this incident. History will have to judge \nthat. But I am suggesting that perhaps it is time that we all--\nourselves as well as the media--step back and take a hard look at the \ncourse of events that led up to yesterday's tragedy. Perhaps it is time \nto do a little soul searching to make sure things stay in the right \nperspective and to ensure that ethics, morality and fairness are not \nbeing undermined in the never-ending quest for a ``story.'' Sometimes \nthe truth might be more important than the story.\n  As I reflect upon this terrible, terrible tragedy to my friend, I \ncannot help but wonder about the seeming lack of balance in the media's \nreporting of Navy events in recent years. All we ever hear about are \nthe problems--Tailhook, Academy cheating scandals, F-14 crashes, sexual \nharassment. Certainly these are newsworthy items, and they merit \ncoverage and accountability.\n  But what about the positive developments? What about the enormous \nprogress that the Navy has made in improving the opportunities \navailable to women and minorities in the ranks? What about Admiral \nBoorda's ``Seaman to Admiral'' program, which he designed to give \nenlisted personnel the opportunity to aspire to higher achievement, \nlike my father did and like Admiral Boorda did. What about Admiral \nBoorda's efforts as Chief of Naval Personnel and as CNO to enhance the \npay, benefits and quality of life for Navy personnel and their \nfamilies? How much coverage has been devoted to these tremendous \nsuccesses in the U.S. Navy; indeed, in the military as a whole? How \nmuch praise was heaped on Mike Boorda for his vigorous personal efforts \non these issues? Sadly, and in my view, unfairly, not enough.\n\n  Let me make one other observation on Mike Boorda. It is personal, but \nI hope that Mike's family understands me saying this.\n  I had an occasion to visit his home about 6 weeks ago. Senator Lott \nand myself and our wives had dinner with Admiral Boorda and his wife. \nOn the mantel is a picture of the current Pope with one of Mike \nBoorda's sons, who is severely handicapped. What a beautiful picture \nthat was of the Pope laying his hand on Admiral Boorda's son. He was so \nproud of that.\n  I said, ``Mike, are you Catholic?''\n  He said, ``No, but perhaps I ought to be, because the Pope was \nwonderful, and I've never forgotten it.''\n  It takes a pretty special person to raise a son like that. Did the \npress report about that? I don't think so. You probably will not read \nanything about that in Newsweek.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me we need to stop this trend of \nrelentless negative coverage and encourage more balance and \nobjectivity. It seems to me that distinguished military personnel, such \nas Mike Boorda, should have their careers and activities judged in \ntotal, not selectively. It seems to me that Mike Boorda should be \nremembered for his outstanding service to our Nation, for his personal \ninitiatives to enhance the military capabilities and quality of life \nfor our naval personnel, rather than for some select institutional \nchallenges that he inherited or fought to correct, or some other \nisolated occurrence.\n  Sadly, this has not been the case. I cannot help but wonder how much \nof an effect the relentless, often excessive, media hounding of Mike \nBoorda and the institution he loved so much had on him. I know for a \nfact it did concern him greatly because we talked about it. We talked \nabout it a lot.\n  Perhaps it had no effect, perhaps it had a very direct effect. We \nwill never know. But either way, we owe it to Mike Boorda, and we owe \nit to his family to search deep within this media and political culture \nhere in Washington and, if possible, to find ways to prevent a \nrecurrence of this tragedy.\n  About 6 days ago, I had my last conversation with Mike Boorda, and I \nremember being frustrated because he was busy that day and he had not \ngotten around to returning my call, which he always did. It was just \nmaybe 4 or 5 hours after I placed the call when he apologized and said \nhe had been in meeting after meeting and was not able to get back to me \nsooner.\n  I relayed a problem to him that I was having on an issue with one of \nhis officers. He said, ``Senator, as I recall, the officer that you're \nreferring to is a one-star; is that correct?''\n  I said, ``Yes, sir, that is correct. It is a one-star admiral.''\n  He said, ``Well, I'm a four-star, and I'll take care of it.''\n  He did. Mike Boorda was a man of his word.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the people of New Hampshire, who owe Mike \nBoorda a great deal for saving their shipyard, I bid farewell to a good \nfriend, a great naval officer, and I offer his family my deepest and \nsincere condolences.\n  Mike, rest in peace. You deserve it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Smith, for the excellent tribute he has paid to \nAdm. Mike Boorda, whom we all held in such high esteem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/17/senate-section/article/S5299-5", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-26\n\n  Mr. SMITH. As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the \ninjunction of secrecy be removed from the Extradition Treaty with \nMalaysia signed in Kuala Lumpur on Aug. 3, 1995, Treaty Document No. \n104-26, transmitted to the Senate by the President on May 17, 1996; and \nask that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; \nthat it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on \nForeign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's \nmessage be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of \nMalaysia, and a related exchange of notes signed at Kuala Lumpur on \nAugust 3, 1995.\n  I transmit also for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report explains, \nthe Treaty will not require further implementing legislation.\n  This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between \nthe law enforcement communities of both countries. It will thereby make \na significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts.\n  The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content \nof extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. Upon \nentry into force of this Treaty, the Extradition Treaty between the \nUnited States and Great Britain signed at London December 22, 1931, \nwill cease to have effect, with certain exceptions, between the United \nStates and Malaysia.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.
