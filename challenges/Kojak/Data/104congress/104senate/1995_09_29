Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of the McCain amendment No. 2816 on which \nthere shall be 60 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I intend to be brief, and I note the presence of the \nSenator from North Dakota here on the floor. I know that he needs at \nleast 10 minutes of the 30 minutes for this side.\n  I just want to recap the situation as I see this amendment. First of \nall, Mr. President, the choice is clear here what we are talking about. \nThe question is whether we will auction this spectrum off, which, \naccording to experts, the value is between $300 and $700 million, or it \nwill be granted to a very large and very powerful corporation in \nAmerica for considerably less money. Originally it was going to be \nabout $5 million and up to $45 million, and now I understand it is \nabout $100 million.\n  I want to briefly describe the chronology of how we got where we are \ntoday. I want to repeat before I continue, I have no interest in this \nissue. There is no company in my State. There is no corporation that I \nhave engaged in the dialog on this issue. I am simply involved in this \nissue, as is the Senator from North Dakota, because what is at stake \nhere is whether the American taxpayers will be deprived of somewhere \nbetween $300 and $700 million.\n  For the record, Mr. President, I point out that on September 16, \n1995, ACC, which was the original holder of the license for this \nspectrum, entered into an agreement with TCI to sell its spectrum to \nTCI for $45 million. The ACC costs at that time were estimated to have \nbeen $5 million. Such a sale would have meant that ACC would actually \nhave profited from warehousing this spectrum for 10 years.\n  In August and September of 1995, TCI had a sweetheart deal pending \nbefore the FCC as follows: TCI would give up some of the allocated DBS \nspectrum and in return receive the ACC at a cost of $5 million, which \nis to pay for costs incurred by ACC. The $5 million would not be paid \nin cash. Instead, it would \n\n[[Page S 14574]]\nbe in the form of Primestar stock, which could have a much greater \nvalue than the original $45 million.\n  The spectrum given up by TCI is valued at substantially less value \nthan the ACC spectrum. TCI would give up 11 channels at 119 degrees and \nspectrum, allowing DBS service be provided to Latin America, the \nPacific rim, and China.\n  No industry expert believes at this time that those markets will be \nnearly as lucrative as the U.S. market. The week of September 18, 1995, \nTCI proposes it be given the spectrum at 110 degrees west latitude \norbit and gives up DBS spectrum as noted above, which is sold at public \nauction. Whatever the price such spectrum is sold for is the price TCI \npays for the 110 degree west longitude orbit spectrum.\n  September 25, 1995, it is reported that an alternative plan has been \ndeveloped allowing Primestar access to DBS channels at prices well \nabove $45 million. TCI expected to pay for advanced communications for \nchannels. Now we hear about a plan where TCI will pay $100 million for \nthe channels.\n  Mr. President, if TCI says the spectrum is worth $100 million and \nthey are prepared to pay $100 million, then let them bid $100 million. \nTCI is proposing they pay $100 million for the spectrum and they will \ngive up other spectrum.\n  Under this auction plan they could keep their current spectrum and \nwin at auction the new spectrum. If all spectrum is equal, it does make \ngood business sense for TCI to have as much spectrum as possible. Of \ncourse it does. TCI knows the value of spectrum and knows what it wants \nto give up is valueless compared to what it wants to receive.\n  Why would one company change the amount it is willing to pay from $5 \nto $100 million in a matter of months?\n  Mr. President, last night--I have not had a chance to talk to my \nfriend from Colorado. He proposed a compromise that the amendment \nshould read that the auction should be conducted within 60 days, and I \nwant to tell my friend from Colorado I am still prepared to accept that \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, there will be much discussion today \nabout estimates of money, but very little about who stands to make it. \nOf course we are all interested in supporting actions that will aid the \nNational Treasury. However, with regard to this amendment, as the \nCongressional Budget Office has pointed out, the Federal Communications \nCommission can hold auctions for the licenses in question, and as I \nunderstand it, is already considering a proposal that would raise even \nmore money than we are currently considering in this amendment without \nany legislative intervention on our part.\n  However, it should be noted in this debate that one of the supporting \ngroups will definitely gain from the passage of this amendment. The \nNational Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, the NRTC, which has \nloudly supported this amendment, has very good reason to do so. The \nNRTC has an exclusive contract in many rural areas to market the DBS \nservice of General Motors' direct TV. So any delay in introducing \nsignificant high-power DBS competition will benefit the NRTC's \nexclusive sales deal.\n  I do not criticize the NRTC for having such a deal, but I think it is \nimportant to know as we discuss this amendment and note who is \nsupporting it, that the NRTC is far from a disinterested party. In \nfact, the delays that this amendment will create in the ability of any \nmajor competitor to challenge the dominance of direct TV works directly \nin favor of those such as the NRTC who retain monopoly sales rights in \nrural America.\n  This is a far more complex subject than we are even aware. The \nimplications of what this amendment would do are unknown. There have \nbeen no hearings. The expert agency is already considering the issues \ninvolved. It already has the authority to both do what is right and \nassure maximum benefit for the value of the licenses. It is bad public \npolicy for this body to step in and interfere with the adjudicatory \nprocess of an agency when we don't even know who the parties are in the \ndispute.\n  That is why the bipartisan leadership of the Commerce Committee \nopposes this amendment and why my colleagues should also oppose it. The \nmodification of this amendment as offered by the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. McCain], seems to resolve our disagreement and heartily support \nthis compromise.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n           Committee Amendment on Page 79, Lines 1 Through 6\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on last evening there was a managers' \namendment. A mistake in the actual drafting was made. This has been \ncleared on both sides. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \ncommittee amendment on page 79, lines 1 through 6, be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendment on page 79, lines 1 through 6, was \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair and the staff who caught this for us. \nI am glad it is corrected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2816\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Just one word about the McCain-Dorgan amendment. Once \nagain, this, of course, is the Congress injecting itself into the \nfunctions and responsibilities of the Federal Communications \nCommission. There is no question at this very moment the FCC can \nauction the so-called spectrum that is now in dispute. I emphasize \n``dispute'' because it is a legal case that has been in the courts, \nnow, for over a year. It is on appeal.\n  There has been a vote, so to speak, informally, at least, by way of \nreports. Lawyers call from both sides of this case. I understand, now, \nthe vote is 2 to 2 at the FCC: Two members of the FCC disposed toward \nan auction, two disposed toward what they characterize as the \nrecommendation of the staff--the staff that studied this case and \nhandled the testimony and otherwise. There is one indecisive member.\n  So we come with an amendment, without any hearings, without really \nknowing what we are talking about and doing, and we say we know how to \ngrant licenses and everything of that kind, so hereby is the way to do \nit.\n  The fact is, this Senator is very anxious, like all Senators, to find \nmoney. In fact, at this stage of the Congress, it is like tying two \ncats by the tails and throwing them over the clothesline and letting \nthem claw each other. No Senator can put up an amendment that he does \nnot take away money from some other Senator or some other function.\n  So I cosponsored, with the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the \nauction process that has already reaped some $9 billion. I went along, \nof course, with another $8.3 billion offset in the telecom bill by way \nof auction.\n  So I am very much for auctions, and I am very much for the money \nbeing reaped by the Government itself. That is what we are here for, to \nlook out for all the people.\n  Having said that, I see the parties on the floor here, and they have \nbeen discussing it.\n  So I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, under the time agreement, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may use from the time allocated to Senator McCain and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss this issue \ngenerally and begin by saying that I join Senator McCain, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, in offering an amendment. I do not have any special \ninterest in this issue. I state, as Senator McCain did, that I do not \nhave company headquarters or company interests in North Dakota dealing \nwith this issue. I do not have any great concern or interest in who \nends up with these licenses. That is not my interest. My interest today \nis with the taxpayer. The issue here is an issue of anywhere from $300 \nto $700 million. Senator McCain, I think, has well described the \nhistory. But let me just thumbnail it again. \n\n[[Page S 14575]]\n\n  Ten years ago, the Federal Communications Commission awarded special \nnational licenses for the launching of direct broadcast satellite \nsystems in three orbital locations. They are the only three orbital \nlocations that are available that will provide DBS services nationally \nacross the country. So 10 years ago, they awarded licenses for these \nslots would provide direct broadcast satellite services that would \nreach all across the country. Two of those licensees have performed, \nand have moved ahead. Another will launch soon. But one of the original \nlicensees did not perform. It did not perform what is called due \ndiligence. It had the license, but in 10 years did not perform due \ndiligence and, therefore, the FCC said, ``Since you are not going to \nperform, we will take the license back.''\n  The original licenses were awarded free of charge in exchange for \nthem going ahead and developing these systems. They got the licenses, \nwhich had enormous value, free of charge. When one of the licensees did \nnot perform, the FCC took it back.\n  What value does it have? If the FCC were to auction it off, were to \nfind a company now to run it, or who wants to participate in this DBS \nsystem, it is estimated that at an auction it would raise from $300 to \n$700 million. It has very substantial value. That is the value to the \ntaxpayers. The taxpayers own this spectrum.\n  What has happened is when the FCC pulled the license back and said, \n``If you are not going to perform, we will take the license back,'' and \ndid, the company that was not performing began talking with other \ncompanies, especially large cable companies, and they began to try to \nmake a deal for this in order to accomplish a handoff. That is the \nprocess that is now under discussion at the FCC.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona and myself is an \namendment that says we think that this simply should go to auction. Let \nus just have an auction for the third slot. Let us have the taxpayers, \nthe American public, benefit from the $300 to $700 million that will be \nraised.\n  I do not care who wins the auction. I have no interest in any of \nthese companies. It just ought to be auctioned, and the money raised go \nto the public Treasury, reduce the Federal deficit, or do other things. \nBut in any event, the taxpayers ought to get full value for this \nspectrum.\n  That is the point of the amendment. I might say that I think the DBS \nsystems are breathtaking and wonderful achievements. They will provide \nspectacular new technology and competition in the rural areas of \nAmerica and all over our country. The Presiding Officer is from \nColorado, and Colorado has rural regions and small towns far away from \nmany major locations, just as my State of North Dakota.\n  I have often wondered how we, in small communities, are going to be \nable to take advantage of this communications breakthrough. This is \npart of the answer: Direct broadcast satellite systems that reach all \nparts of this country.\n  These are wonderful things for our future. It is going to enhance \ncommunications and provide entertainment and information to everyone in \nthis country. It represents competition, as well, competition to the \nwired cable systems in our country.\n  So I am excited about all of this. I want all three systems to be up \nand operating.\n  The point that we make in this amendment is not a point directed at \nany company, to favor any company or to penalize any company. God bless \nthem all. Let them go at it and provide this breathtaking new \ntechnology. Our point is a point that we make on behalf of the \ntaxpayers. We want this spectrum, which has significant value, to \nprovide its value to the American taxpayer. This is a $300 to $700 \nmillion question. And the question ought to be answered, in our \njudgment, in favor of the American taxpayer.\n  That is why we bring this amendment to the floor. We want the FCC to \nauction that third license. That is what our amendment provides.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2816, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment. The modification is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2816), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending committee amendment, insert the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . COMPETITIVE BIDDING FOR ASSIGNMENT OF DBS \n                   LICENSES.\n\n       No funds provided in this or any other Act shall be \n     expended to take any action regarding the applications that \n     bear Federal Communications Commission File Numbers DBS-94-\n     11EXT, DBS-94-15ACP, and DBS-94-16MP; Provided further, that \n     funds shall be made available for any action taken by the \n     Federal Communications Commission to use the competitive \n     bidding process prescribed in Section 309(j) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. section 309(j)) \n     regarding the disposition of the 27 channels at 110 degrees \n     W.L. orbital location; Provided further, That the provisions \n     of this section apply unless the Federal Communications \n     Commission determines that an alternative adjudication would \n     yield more money for the U.S. Treasury.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the modification at the desk is very \nsimple language. It adds one sentence that I have discussed with \nSenator Dorgan and with Senator Brown. At the end of the amendment, it \nadds the following language:\n\n       Provided further, that the provisions of this section apply \n     unless the Federal Communications Commission determines that \n     an alternative adjudication would yield more money for the \n     U.S. Treasury.\n\n  After discussion with Senator Brown and Senator Dorgan, Mr. \nPresident, that is the whole logic of what we are trying to do here. We \nfind it not only acceptable, but a definition of what we are trying to \nachieve.\n  I thank Senator Brown for agreeing to this modification.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I would like to yield 1 minute to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the modification that has been offered by \nSenator McCain is one that, as I understand it, would suggest that, if \nthere is an alternative approach that would yield as much or more to \nthe U.S. Treasury and the taxpayer, that would be acceptable. That \npresumes that approach meets the test of fairness, and meets all the \nother tests of fairness required under an FCC process.\n  Again, it is not our intention on the floor of the Senate to be \ntalking about who should be involved in this. I have no interest in \nthat at all--none. The question is, What cost does the American \ntaxpayer, who owns this spectrum, get for this process under these \ncircumstances where one licensee did not perform and the license has \nbeen taken back by the FCC?\n  We want full value for that spectrum. That is what our amendment asks \nfor, and the modification does not change that request. I am pleased to \naccept the modification, as well.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to add my voice of support for the \nmodification.\n  We are all very wary of having Congress intervene in the middle of \nthe adjudicatory action by the FCC. I think all Members are aware that \nthere is a great deal of money available in the disposition of this \nmatter. What I like so much about the modification, Mr. President, is \nsimply this: It leaves the FCC free to pick an option that raises the \nmost money for the Treasury. It puts this Congress in a position of not \ntrying to dictate an option that may be less advantageous for the \ntaxpayers. It makes it clear that the FCC retains some power to pick \nthe best option for the taxpayers--one that will bring in the most \nrevenue to the United States.\n  Frankly, it seems to me that the modification represents the \nappropriate position both for the FCC and for this Congress. We should \nnot be in the business of precluding the options of the FCC while they \nare adjudicating a matter.\n  I commend the Senator from Arizona for his modification. I believe it \nsettles this question in terms of this Chamber and that the measure has \nunanimous support.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if the Senator wishes to retain his \nrecord vote. Obviously, if he does, that is fine. But my sense is that \nat this point the Chamber is ready to accept his modified amendment \nunanimously.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank again the Senator from Colorado. I \ndo \n\n[[Page S 14576]]\nnot know a finer individual in the Senate than Senator Brown from \nColorado. He has always had the interests of the constituents and \nfairness in mind. It has been a privilege for me to work with him on \nmany, many issues, especially those that are in opposition to \nprocedures around here that sometimes deprive the taxpayers of their \nhard-earned tax dollars in a way which is unacceptable to the vast \nmajority of them. His agreement to modify this amendment so that it is \nmore clear and achieves the goal which we seek is I think indicative of \nthe individual.\n  It is worth pointing out that the company which is directly affected \nby this legislation is located in his State. So I want to thank him for \nhis agreement. I believe that he has strengthened what we are trying to \ndo and that is to provide the taxpayer with the maximum amount of \ndollars for the property they actually own.\n  Mr. President, I have a legal document that I think is important to \nbolster this argument I would like to ask unanimous consent be made a \npart of the Record. It is a series of legal opinions concerning this \nentire issue. I am pleased to note again that I am not a lawyer, but I \ndo believe that on an issue like this the Congressional Record should \ncontain legal documentation to bolster the argument the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and I have been making on the urgency and importance and \nthe legality of having an auction of this spectrum to provide the \ntaxpayers with the maximum return on this very valuable resource they \nown.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  No Holder of an FCC Construction Permit Has Any Right to Regulatory \n               Approval of FA Transfer for Private Profit\n\n       Federal law does not provide a right to a private company \n     to hoard spectrum and then sell its bare bones construction \n     permit for private gain. Rather, the Federal Communications \n     Commission has a long-standing public policy against any \n     private party ``warehousing'' this scarce public resource. \n     Underlying this policy is the requirement contained in the \n     Communications Act of 1934 that a construction permit will be \n     automatically forfeited if the system in question is not \n     ready for operation within the time specified by the \n     Commission's rules or within such further time as the \n     Commission may allow. 47 U.S.C. Sec. 319 (b).\n       The rules for the various services for which the Commission \n     issues licenses specifically address construction permit \n     requirements and the public policy objectives behind these \n     requirements. The Commission routinely revokes construction \n     permits or fails to grant time extensions to permit holders \n     who fail to construct a system on a timely basis as required \n     in each service.\n       For example:\n       Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) Service.--When the \n     Commission adopted in 1982 the licensing condition rules for \n     DBS service, it determined that these rules were necessary to \n     ``assure that those applicants that are granted construction \n     permits go forward expeditiously,'' Inquiry into the \n     Development of Regulatory Policy in Regard to Direct \n     Broadcast Satellites. Report and Order, 90 FCC Rcd. 676, 719 \n     (1982). The rules provide that a construction permittee must \n     complete construction of a satellite of complete contracting \n     for construction of a satellite within one year of the grant \n     of the permit and be in operation within six years of the \n     construction permit grant, unless the Commission grants an \n     extension upon a proper showing in a particular case. \n     Transfer of control of the permit will not be considered to \n     justify an extension. See 47 U.S.C. Sec. 100.19(b).\n       In the ACC case, ACC entered into a contract with TCI for \n     reportedly $45 million in TCI stock contingent upon a second \n     extension of ACC's construction permit. ACC and TCI assumed a \n     business risk when it entered this contingent contract \n     because both companies were fully aware that ACC had been \n     ``hoarding'' spectrum as shown by the record developed at the \n     FCC. Any reliance these companies may have had on FCC \n     approval in this case would have been totally unreasonable \n     and unjustified under the FCC's current DBS rules. As the \n     International Bureau noted in its decision revoking ACC's DBS \n     construction permit.\n       Advanced has had over ten years, including one four-year \n     extension, in which to construct and launch its DBS system. \n     It has failed to do so. It has thereby failed to meet the \n     Commission's due diligence rules--imposed a decade ago--to \n     ensure that the public received prompt DBS service. In the \n     meantime, the channels and orbital positions assigned to \n     Advanced have gone unused. Other DBS licensees have already \n     begun operation. Only by enforcing the progress requirements \n     of the Commission's rules can we ensure that allocated \n     resources will be efficiently and expeditiously put into \n     productive use.\n       Advanced Communications Corp. Memorandum Opinion and Order \n     (Released April 27, 1995).\n       Personal Communications Service (PCS).--Most recently, when \n     the Commission adopted rules for the new PCS service, it \n     specifically included construction requirements. Although the \n     Commission expressed the belief that the use of competitive \n     bidding (or auctions) would provide the winners with economic \n     incentives to construct, and conversely, disincentives to \n     warehouse the spectrum, nevertheless the Commission said ``we \n     continue to believe that minimum construction requirements \n     are necessary to ensure that PCS service is made available to \n     as many communities as possible and that the spectrum is used \n     effectively.'' Amendment of the Commission's Rules to \n     Establish New Personnel Communications Services, Memorandum \n     Opinion and Order (Released June 13, 1994). PCS licensees are \n     required to serve at least one-third of the population in \n     their licensed area within 5 years of being licensed and at \n     least two-thirds of the population in this area within 10 \n     years. The rules specifically provide: ``failure by any \n     licensee to meet these requirements will result in forfeiture \n     or non-renewal of the license and the licensee will be \n     ineligible to regain it.'' 47 C.F.R. Sec. 24.203(a).\n       Although the first PCS licensees were only awarded three \n     months ago, PCS licensees are already on notice that if they \n     do not build these systems in a timely fashion, the \n     Commission will revoke these licenses even though the \n     licensee may have paid millions of dollars for the privilege.\n       Multipoint Distribution Service and Multichannel Multipoint \n     Distribution Service (AKA ``Wireless Cable'').--When the \n     Commission revised its rules with regard to fixed radio \n     services, the Commission noted that carriers who fail \n     promptly to construct facilities preclude other applicants \n     who are willing, ready, and able of delaying, or even \n     denying, service to the public.

However, frequencies and orbital positions shall \n     not be assigned until completion of the 1983 Region 2 \n     Administrative Radio Conference for the Broadcasting-\n     Satellite Service. The Commission shall generally consider \n     all frequencies and orbital positions to be of equal value, \n     and conflicting requests for frequencies and orbital \n     positions will not necessarily give rise to comparative \n     hearing rights as long as unassigned frequencies and orbital \n     slots remain.\n     Sec. 100.15 Licensing procedures\n       (a) Each application for an interim direct broadcast \n     satellite system shall be placed on public notice for 45 \n     days, during which time interested parties may file comments \n     and petitions related to the application.\n       (b) A 45 day cut-off period shall also be established for \n     the filing of applications to be considered in conjunction \n     with the original application. Additional applications filed \n     before the cutoff date shall be considered to have equal \n     priority with the original application and shall be \n     considered together in the assignment of frequencies and \n     orbital positions. If applications have included requests for \n     particular requencies or orbital positions, the cutoff date \n     shall be considered in establishing the priority of such \n     requests.\n       (c) Each application for an interim direct broadcast \n     satellite system, after the public comment period and staff \n     review shall be acted upon by the Commission to determine if \n     authorization of the proposed system is in the public \n     interest.\n     Sec. 100.17 License term.\n       All authorizations for interim direct broadcast satellite \n     systems shall be granted for a period of five years.\n     Sec. 100.19 License conditions.\n       (a) All authorizations for interim direct broadcast \n     satellite systems shall be subject to the policies set forth \n     in the Report and Order in General Docket 80-603 and with any \n     policies and rules the Commission may adopt at a later date. \n     It is the intention of the Commission, however, that in most \n     circumstances the regulatory policies in force at the time of \n     authorization to construct a satellite shall remain in force \n     for that satellite throughout its operating lifetime.\n       (b) Parties granted authorizations shall proceed with \n     diligence in constructing interim direct broadcast satellite \n     systems. Permittees of interim direct broadcast satellite \n     systems shall be required to begin construction or complete \n     contracting for construction of the satellite station within \n     one year of the grant of the construction permit.

Introduction\n\n       1. For more than a decade, Advanced Communications \n     Corporation (``Advanced'') has had leave to provide the \n     public with Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) service. It has \n     had allocated to it scarce public resources--orbital \n     positions and channels--so that it could provide that \n     service. Advanced paid nothing for these resources. It was \n     obligated only to proceed with due diligence to provide the \n     service it promised. After more than a decade, Advanced has \n     not provided--and is not close to providing--DBS service to \n     the public. It has failed to meet its due diligence \n     obligation. Advanced must now return the public resources it \n     holds to the public so that these resources can be put to use \n     by others.\n       2. Advanced has filed an application for a second four-year \n     extension of time in which to construct, launch, and initiate \n     service from its DBS system. Advanced has also filed an \n     application for consent to assign its construction permit to \n     Tempo DBS, Inc. (Tempo DBS). Finally, Advanced has applied \n     for authority to modify its construction permit to allow it \n     to substitute satellites now being constructed for Tempo \n     Satellite, Inc.\\1\\ Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. (DVS), \n     EchoStar Satellite Corporation (EchoStar), DIRECTV, Inc. \n     (DirecTV), and Directsat Corporation filed objections to \n     Advanced's applications; Tempo Satellite and Nevada Direct \n     Broadcasting System (Nevada) filed supporting comments. \n     Advanced filed replies to the objections.\\2\\\n     \\1\\ Tempo Satellite, Inc. (``Tempo Satellite'') is a \n     subsidiary of Tele-Communications, Inc. (``TCI''), a cable \n     operator. authorized to construct, launch, and operate 11 DBS \n     channels at orbital slots 166 deg. W.L. and 119 deg. W.L. See \n     Tempo Satellite, Inc., 7 F.C.C. Red 2728 (1992). Tempo DBS, \n     the proposed assignee, is an affiliate of TCI.\n     \\2\\ Several of the pleadings submitted by the parties were \n     not timely filed or were not authorized under the \n     Commission's rules. See 47 C.F.R. Sec. 1.45. Such pleadings \n     shall only be considered as informal requests for Commission \n     action of informal comments. See 47 C.F.R. Sec. 1.41. The \n     parties' requests for extension of time are hereby denied.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       3. Advanced has had over ten years, including one four-year \n     extension, in which to construct and launch its DBS system. \n     It has failed to do so. It has thereby failed to meet the \n     Commission's due diligence rules--imposed a decade ago--to \n     ensure that the public receives prompt DBS service. In the \n     meantime, the channels and orbital positions assigned to \n     Advanced have gone unused. Other DBS licenses have already \n     begun operations.\n       4. Only by enforcing the progress requirements of the \n     Commission's rules can we ensure that allocated resources \n     will be efficiently and expeditiously put into productive \n     use. In the past, we have given DBS permittees latitude in \n     meeting due diligence deadlines in order to ensure the \n     development of DBS services. As the Commission has previously \n     stated, however, such latitude is not appropriate in an era \n     in which DBS licensees are successfully operating and are \n     competing for subscribers. Accordingly, we deny Advanced's \n     application for an extension of time and declare its \n     construction permit null and void. We dismiss, as moot, the \n     pending assignment and modifications applications.\n\n                             II. Background\n\n       5. In 1984, Advanced applied for authority to construct and \n     launch a DBS system as part of the second processing round of \n     DBS applications. The Commission granted the application \n     subject to the condition that Advanced ``proceed with the \n     construction of its system with due diligence as defined in \n     Section 100.19(b) of the Commission's rules.'' 47 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 100.19(b).\\3\\ The due diligence requirement has two \n     components. First, the DBS permittee must begin or complete \n     contracting for construction of its satellites within one \n     year of the grant of its construction permit. Second, the \n     permittee must begin operation of the satellites within six \n     years of the grant of its construction permit, unless \n     otherwise determined by the Commission. Section 100.19(b) \n     provides that a transfer of control of the permit is not a \n     justification for extension of either of these deadlines. \n     Orbital positions and channels are not assigned to a DBS \n     permittee unless and until it demonstrates that it has \n     fulfilled the first component of the due diligence \n     requirement.

Advanced's initial grant authorized it to provide \n     service from two satellites, each to deliver six channels to \n     half of the continental United States. Advanced subsequently \n     applied for, and was granted, authority to increase the \n     number of satellites in its system to five, and was later \n     granted authority to increase the number of channels to 27. \n     See Continental Satellite Corporation (``Continental''), 4 \n     F.C.C. Red 6292 (1989).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       6. In October 1986, the Commission found that Advanced had \n     complied with the first component of the due diligence \n     requirement by contracting for the construction of its first \n     two DBS satellites. Advanced was ultimately assigned to the \n     100 deg. W.L. orbit location (channels 1-23, 25, 27, 29, 31) \n     and 148 deg. \n\n[[Page S 14578]]\n     W.L. (channels 1-17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31).\\4\\ In February 1990, \n     Advanced applied for a four-year extension of time, until \n     February 1994, in which to construct and operate its DBS \n     system. The Commission granted this request, extending the \n     deadline until December 7, 1994.\\5\\\n     \\4\\ Tempo Enterprises, Inc. (``Tempo''), 1 F.C.C.

(``Advanced''), 6 F.C.C. \n     Red 2269 (1991).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       7. In August 1994, Advanced applied for another four-year \n     extension of time, until December 1998, in which to construct \n     and operate its system.\\6\\ In September 1994, Advanced filed \n     an application for consent to assign its construction permit \n     to Tempo DBS.\\7\\ In October 1994, Advanced filed an \n     application to modify its construction permit to change the \n     technical design of the Advanced satellites to duplicate the \n     design of satellites then under construction for Tempo \n     Satellite under a separate DBS authorization.\\8\\\n     \\6\\ Request for Additional Time to Construct and Launch \n     Direct Broadcast Satellites, DBS-84-01/94-11EXT (August 8, \n     1994).\n     \\7\\ Request for Consent to Assign DBS Authorizations, DBS-94-\n     15ACP (September 28, 1994).\n     \\8\\ Application for Modification of Construction Permit, DBS-\n     94-16MP (October 14, 1994). In November 1994, Advanced filed \n     an amendment to this modification request. Amendment of \n     Application for Modification of Construction Permit, DBS-94-\n     16MP (November 16, 1994).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       8. Dominion, EchoStar, and Directsat oppose Advanced's \n     extension request. They contend that Advanced has not met the \n     first component of the due diligence requirement because \n     Advanced's contract with Martin Marietta does not meet due \n     diligence requirements, delays in construction were not due \n     to circumstances beyond Advanced's control, and Advanced has \n     ``warehoused'' its authorized frequencies. They argue that \n     Advanced has no valid construction permit and that Advanced's \n     applications for assignment and modification should be \n     declared moot. Directsat and Echostar maintain that Advanced \n     failed to initiate operation due to business decisions within \n     its control, that Commission precedent precludes grant of an \n     extension of time request based on Advanced's failure to \n     attract investors, and that grant of the extension request \n     would prejudice permittees who have significantly passed \n     Advanced in progress toward initiation of DBS service. \n     Dominion argues that under Commission rules, transfer of \n     control of an authorization does not warrant grant of a \n     request for extension of time.\\9\\\n     \\9\\ 47 C.F.R. Sec. 100.19(b) states that ``[t]ransfer of \n     control of the construction permit shall not be considered to \n     justify extension of the[  ] deadline[  ].''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                            III. Discussion\n\n                           Extension request\n\n       9. In adopting rules and policies for DBS service, we \n     determined that a due diligence requirement would ensure that \n     permittees would go forward expeditiously.\\10\\ Accordingly. \n     Section 100.19(b) of the rules for DBS service. 47 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 100.19(b), states that transfer of control of the \n     construction permit will not justify extension of due \n     diligence deadlines. We later noted that ``the rule was \n     intended to ensure the prompt initiation of DBS service for \n     the public, and must be enforced where permittees are allowed \n     to hold spectrum resource for which other applications exist. \n     . . .'' \\11\\\n     \\10\\ Inquiry into the development of regulatory policy in \n     regard to Direct Broadcast Satellites for the period \n     following the 1983 Regional Administrative Radio Conference, \n     90 F.C.C. 2d 676 (1982).\n     \\11\\ CBS, Inc., 99 F.C.C. 2d 565, 572 (1984).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       10. During the ``pioneering era'' of DBS technology in the \n     1980's, the Commission granted numerous extensions of due \n     diligence milestones. The Commission was reluctant to cancel \n     construction permits where permittees failed to initiate DBS \n     service ``in accord with a pre-established timetable set \n     without the benefit of experience.'' \\12\\ As technology \n     developed, however, the Commission gave permittees notice \n     that they could not expect additional extensions. We said in \n     1988, ``[a]s circumstances have evolved and demand for DBS \n     facilities may be increasing beyond the available supply of \n     orbit/channel resource[s], there does now appear [to be] a \n     need for stricter enforcement of the construction progress \n     requirements of the DBS rules.'' \\13\\\n     \\12\\ United States Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc. \n     (``USSB I''). 3 F.C.C. Rcd 6858, 6860 (1988).\n     \\13\\ Id. at 6861.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       11. In ruling on requests for extensions of time, the \n     Commission has stated that ``[t]he totality of \n     circumstances--those efforts made and those not made, the \n     difficulties encountered and those overcome, the rights of \n     all parties, and the ultimate goal of service to the public--\n     must be considered.'' \\14\\ In granting Advanced's 1990 \n     extension, the Commission relied on the substantial \n     developments in DBS satellite technology, the Commission's \n     development of its policy regarding channel and orbital \n     assignments, and the Challenger and Ariane launch vehicle \n     failures of the late 1980's.\\15\\ The Commission warned, \n     however, that ``continued reliance on experimentation, \n     technological developments and changed plans will not \n     necessarily justify an extension of a DBS authorization.'' It \n     further warned that it would ``closely scrutinize all \n     requests for extension of time within which permittees must \n     initiate DBS service.'' \\16\\\n     \\14\\ Id.\n     \\15\\ Id. at 6860.\n     \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       12. Advanced asserts that a second extension is justified \n     under the Commission's rules (and is consistent with similar \n     extensions previously granted) because it has made \n     ``considerable efforts'' to develop DBS service, it has \n     pursued a joint venture agreement, and any delays have been \n     due to circumstances beyond its control. Advanced also \n     implies that the progress Tempo Satellite has made in \n     constructing its satellites should be attributed to Advanced \n     and that these efforts constitute a ``proper showing'' on \n     which to base an extension.\n       13. Advanced first argues that an extension is warranted in \n     light of its efforts to reach a joint venture agreement over \n     a nearly three-year period beginning in 1992, even though \n     these negotiations ultimately failed.\\17\\ The Commission has \n     previously found that on-going negotiations do not justify an \n     extension of due diligence milestones.\\8\\ Failed negotiations \n     surely should fare no better. In denying an extension to \n     another DBS permittee, we held that failure to attract \n     investors, an uncertain business situation, or an unfavorable \n     business climate in general have never been adequate excuses \n     for failure [to] meet a construction timetable in other \n     satellite services.\\19\\\n     \\17\\ In progress reports to the Commission, Advanced said, in \n     April 1992, that it expected negotiations to be completed in \n     ``the next month or two.'' In August 1992, Advanced reported \n     it has signed a letter of intent that called for execution of \n     an agreement within sixty days. In October 1992, Advanced \n     explained that negotiations were continuing, and in April \n     1993, stated it expected to reach an agreement within the \n     next month. In May 1993, it reported it was still in \n     ``complex negotiations,'' and in October 1993, it claimed \n     that negotiations were continuing. However, on December 30, \n     1994, Advanced indicated that negotiations had failed.\n     \\18\\ USSB I, 3 F.C.C. Rcd at 6859.

Advanced also asserts that construction was delayed \n     because it needed to modify its system design. In granting \n     Advanced's first extension request. however, the Commission \n     advised Advanced that its decision to modify it technical \n     proposal was a business decision wholly within its control \n     that would not generally excuse its failure to meet the due \n     diligence requirements, To conclude otherwise would allow \n     permittees to ``extend indefinitely their nonperformance by \n     repeated modifications of their proposals.''\\20\\ DBS \n     technology has evolved to the point where permittees can made \n     design decisions and proceed with construction with relative \n     assurance that their system will be technologically \n     competitive when it is launched. In fact, two permittees have \n     launched DBS systems, which are both already providing \n     service.\\21\\ Advanced has not explained why it did not make \n     similar design decisions for its system, or why such \n     decisions were not wholly within its control. Accordingly, we \n     do not find that continued modifications to Advanced's system \n     warrant an extension of time.\n     \\20\\ Tempo, 1 F.C.C.

Advanced contends that an extension is justified \n     because the company has expended considered funds and \n     ``countless hours'' to implement its system. Advanced asserts \n     that the Commission has granted extension under similar \n     circumstances, citing United States Satellite Broadcasting \n     Company, Inc.\\22\\ In that case, the Video Services Division \n     of the Mass Media Bureau, in considering the ``totality of \n     the circumstances,'' found that the permittee, USSB, (1) has \n     expended $23 million, including a substantial payment towards \n     spacecraft construction; (2) had demonstrated that the \n     remaining financing for the completion and launch of the \n     satellite had been arranged; and (3) had executed launch and \n     various supplier contracts. Advanced, in contrast, has not \n     specified how much money it has spent.\\23\\ has not arranged \n     financing, and has not procured a launch contract. Advanced \n     has failed to show its progress constitutes sufficient \n     justification for a further extension of time. To the \n     contrary, it appears that Advanced wants to abandon its \n     business to Tempo DBS.\n     \\22\\ United States Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc. \n     (``USSB II''), 7 F.C.C.

See \n     Semi-Annual Status Reports, DBS 84-01-88-05 MP and 84-01/88-\n     05 Ext. (October 6, 1993 and April 24, 1994).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       16. Advanced further states that it should be granted an \n     extension because it has ``remained in due diligence'' sine \n     we found it had met the first component of the due diligence \n     requirement by executing a construction contract. The facts \n     belie this conclusory assertion. The due diligence \n     requirement consists of two components. The fact that \n     Advanced continues to have a binding construction contract, \n     or that it has made all payments required by this contract \n     does not excuse its failure to meet the second part of its \n     due diligence requirement: operation of its direct broadcast \n     satellite system.\\24\\ Meeting the first due diligence \n     requirement does not justify failing to fulfill the second.\n     \\24\\ USSB II at 7250. To the extent Advanced relies on its \n     contract with Tempo Satellite and TCI (pursuant to Advanced's \n     application to assign its construction permit) in arguing \n     that it is still in due diligence, we point out that this \n     contract underscores Advanced's lack of commitment to \n     establish its direct broadcast satellite system. The \n     assignment application indicates that Tempo Satellite has \n     arranged financing, executed contracts for satellite launch \n     and construction and for DBS receiving equipment, and has \n     spent $246 million on satellite construction. Advanced's sole \n     contribution to Tempo Satellite's system appears to be its \n     construction permit. For these reasons and the reasons stated \n     at paragraph 18, infra, we find that Advanced's latest \n     contract does not demonstrate a capability and commitment on \n     its part to operate a DBS system.\n     \n[[Page S 14579]]\n\n       17. Advanced also asserts that the Commission's formulation \n     of its channel assignment policy \\25\\ and the delay in \n     granting previous modification requests constitute \n     circumstances beyond its control and warrants an extension of \n     time. However, the channel assignment policy was clarified in \n     1989.\\26\\ Advanced's proposed modifications to its orbit \n     locations and channel assignments were granted in 1991.\\27\\ \n     Advanced has not cited any circumstances that impeded its \n     ability to construct its system over the last four years. \n     Advanced has failed to show that delay in meeting the second \n     component of due diligence is due to circumstances beyond its \n     control.\n     \\25\\ Continental, 4 F.C.C. Red at 6296-7 (1989).\n     \\26\\ Id. at 6301.\n     \\27\\ Advanced, 6 F.C.C. Red at 2274.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       18. Finally, Advanced asserts that an extension of its \n     construction permit would be in the public interest, since it \n     is on the threshold of an advanced DBS system which will \n     benefit the public, and because doing so will promote the \n     efforts of those who have worked to create the DBS industry. \n     To do otherwise, Advanced argues, would discourage innovators \n     in all new technological industries.\n       19. A further extension would not serve the public \n     interest. Advanced has made little progress in construction, \n     launch, and initiation of a DBS system in the past decade. \n     During the same period, two DBS satellites have been launched \n     and construction of others is underway.\\28\\ There is no \n     benefit to the public in allowing Advanced to continue to \n     waste orbital locations and channels while two permittees \n     have already initiated DBS service.\n     \\28\\ See note 21, supra.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       20. Advanced's current authorization required it to begin \n     operation of a satellite by December 7, 1994.\\29\\ If failed \n     to do so. The ``totality of the circumstances'' presented by \n     Advanced in its extension request does not justify granting \n     additional time in which to begin operation. Accordingly, we \n     deny Advanced's request for an extension of time to \n     construct, launch, and operate a direct broadcast satellite \n     system. Because Advanced has failed to satisfy this express \n     condition of its construction permit, the permit is null and \n     void by its own terms.\n     \\29\\ Advanced, 6 F.C.C. Rcd at 2274\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                         B. Other applications\n\n       21. Inasmuch as we have concluded that Advanced's permit is \n     null and void, its pending applications for assignment of \n     that permit to Tempo DBS and related modification application \n     are moot and are accordingly dismissed.\\30\\ To the extent \n     Advanced suggests that construction progress on Tempo \n     Satellite's DBS satellites should be considered favorably in \n     evaluating Advanced's extension request, we disagree.\\31\\ The \n     Commission has based previous extensions of time on a finding \n     that the efforts made by the permittee ``reveal[] no lack of \n     capability or commitment'' to establish its DBS system.\\32\\ \n     Tempo Satellite's construction progress is irrelevant in \n     determining whether Advanced should be granted an extension \n     of time in which to construct and operate Advanced's \n     satellites.\\33\\ Moreover, we believe it would contravene the \n     public interest to consider Tempo Satellite's construction-\n     progress in assessing Advanced's extension request. To do so \n     would reward permittees' inaction or failure to comply with \n     implementation milestones. Such warehousing precludes the use \n     of channel and orbital assignments by other service \n     providers, and will ultimately result in delays in service to \n     the public.\n     \\30\\ To the extent the pleadings address Advanced's \n     applications for assignment and for modification of its \n     construction permit, such pleadings are likewise moot and \n     will not be considered.\n     \\31\\ Under Advanced's proposal to assign its construction \n     permit to Tempo DBS, the satellites deployed under Advanced's \n     permit would be those now under construction for Tempo \n     Satellite, Inc., a DBS permittee.

Rcd 88 (1995), as support for \n     approval of the assignment of its construction permit to \n     Tempo DBS. In that case, the Commission approved the transfer \n     of control of DBS permittee Directsat Corporation from SSE \n     Telecom, Inc. to Echo/Comms. Unlike the circumstances here, \n     Directsat's ``investment in the development of its DBS system \n     has been substantial and the progress set fort in its semi-\n     annual reports has been steady and consistent with the \n     schedule established in its construction contract.'' Id. at \n     para 4. Consequently, the Commission concluded that the \n     public interest in the expeditious provision of DBS service \n     to the public would be advanced by this sale.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       22. In its opposition to Advanced's petition for extension \n     of time, DBSC requests that some of Advanced's cancelled \n     channels be assigned to DBSC. DBSC's request was not made \n     within any designated filing period for modification \n     applications, and is hereby rejected. We will soon issue a \n     notice regarding the reallocation of cancelled channels and \n     available orbital positions.\n\n                          V. Ordering Clauses\n\n       23.

Introduction\n\n       1. On June 1, 1981, the Commission issued a Notice of \n     Proposed Policy Statement and Rulemaking (Notice), 86 FCC 2d \n     719, to consider proposed policies and rules to govern the \n     authorization of direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       However, we believe that the provision of HDTV service \n     should not exclude conventional television service. We note \n     that only one of the DBS applicants, CBS, proposes to \n     broadcast HDTV exclusively. We believe that any transition to \n     HDTV would deprive the public of the use of the band for \n     conventional television transmission. Moreover, HDTV \n     presently requires considerably more bandwidth than \n     conventional television signals, and therefore it reduces the \n     number of channels that can be provided within a given amount \n     of spectrum. Our present proposal would permit the band to be \n     used either/for HDTV or for conventional television signals, \n     as spectrum allocation permits and the market dictates. We \n     believe this approach serves the public interest better than \n     reserving the band exclusively for either service.\n\n                 Licensing and Procedural Requirements\n\n       111. The licensing and procedural policies and requirements \n     we are adopting are, with few exceptions, those that were set \n     forth in the Notice. In particular, applicants will be \n     required to conform to the technical guidelines specified in \n     the WARC-77 Final Acts. Furthermore, all interim \n     authorizations will be subject to modification, as the \n     Commission deems necessary, in order to comport with \n     determinations made at RARC-83 and any other policies and \n     rules which the Commission may hereafter conclude are \n     necessary or appropriate in the public interest. Deviations \n     from the guidelines of the WARC-77 or from the outcome of \n     RARC-83 may be permitted with Commission approval provided \n     they do not cause interference to operational or Commission \n     approval provided they do not cause interference to \n     operational or planned systems of other administrations in \n     excess of that specified in the Final Acts of the WARC-77 or \n     RARC-83.\n       112. Applicants may request specific frequencies and \n     orbital positions. However, frequencies and orbital positions \n     will not be assigned until completion of the 1983 RARC. We \n     note that the number of frequencies, the orbital locations, \n     and the size of the service areas specified in the \n     applications we have received to date have varied \n     considerably. While we intend to take each applicant's \n     request fully into account, the Commission may, in acting on \n     a particular application, restrict the number of channels \n     assigned to any applicant, limit or modify the area to be \n     served, or impose any other conditions it deems necessary.\n       113. The Commission will continue to accept applications \n     for DBS systems. In addition, the Commission intends in the \n     very near future to establish a second cut-off list for \n     applications.\\99\\ In view of the number of applications that \n     have been accepted to date and the number of potential \n     applications that may be filed, future applicants are \n     requested to indicate whether or not they would be willing to \n     operate their systems for non-eclipse-protected orbital \n     positions.\n     \\99\\A number of the interim DBS applications filed in \n     response to the first cut-off date were found unacceptable \n     for filing. Some of these applications were subsequently \n     amended and may now be acceptable for filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       114. In lieu of stringent financial showings and subsequent \n     Commission analysis, we will require that parties granted \n     authorizations proceed with diligence in constructing interim \n     DBS systems. Interim DBS systems will be required to begin \n     construction or complete contracting for construction of the \n     satellite station within one year of the grant of the \n     construction permit. The satellite station will also be \n     required to be in operation within six years of the \n     construction permit grant, unless otherwise determined by the \n     Commission upon proper showing in any particular case. \n     Transfer of control of the construction permit will not be \n     considered to justify extension of these deadlines. We \n     believe that a diligence requirement will provide a more \n     orderly processing of applications and assure that those \n     applicants that are granted construction permits go forward \n     expeditiously.\n       115. Each application for an interim DBS system shall \n     include a showing describing \n\n[[Page S 14580]]\n     the type of service that will be provided, the technology that will be \n     employed, and all other pertinent information. The \n     application may be presented in narrative format.\\100\\ Each \n     application for an interim DBS system shall be placed on \n     public notice for 45 days, during which time interested \n     parties may file comments and petitions related to the \n     application. A 45 day cut-off period shall also be \n     established for the filing of applications to be considered \n     in conjunction with the original application. Additional \n     applications filed before the cut-off date shall be \n     considered to have equal priority with the original \n     application and shall be considered together in the \n     assignment of frequencies and orbital positions. If \n     applications have included requests for particular \n     frequencies or orbital positions, the cut-off date shall be \n     considered in establishing the priority of such requests. All \n     frequencies and orbital positions, however, shall generally \n     be considered to be of equal value, and conflicting requests \n     for frequencies and orbital positions will not necessarily \n     give rise to comparative hearing rights as long as unassigned \n     frequencies and orbital slots remain. Each application for an \n     interim DBS system, after the public comment period and staff \n     review, shall be acted upon by the Commission to determine if \n     authorization of the system is in the public interest.\n     \\100\\ The Commission will carefully review each DBS \n     application for completeness. Accordingly, all applicants \n     should be sure that their applications contain a complete and \n     detailed technical showing and that the service to be \n     provided is adequately described. (See also Memorandum \n     Opinion and Order, FCC 81-500, and Memorandum Opinion and \n     Order, FCC 82-92.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       116. All authorizations for interim DBS systems shall be \n     granted for a period of five years. All licensee shall be \n     subject to the policies set forth in this Report and Order \n     and with any policies and rules the Commission may adopt at a \n     later date. It is the intention of the Commission, however, \n     that in most circumstances the regulatory policies in force \n     at the time of authorization to construct a satellite shall \n     remain in force for that satellite throughout its operating \n     lifetime.\n\n                         VIII.

Construction requirements\n\n       147. In the Second Report and Order, we stated our \n     expectations that broadband PCS would be a highly competitive \n     industry and that licensees would have the incentive to \n     construct facilities to meet the demand for service in their \n     licensed areas. We concluded that specific channel loading \n     requirements are unnecessary; however, we required licensees \n     to meet specified construction benchmarks to ensure efficient \n     spectrum utilization and service to the public. Specifically, \n     we required licensees to offer service to one-third of the \n     population in their service area within five years of \n     licensing, two-thirds of the population in their service area \n     within seven years, and 90 percent of the population within \n     ten years. We stated that failure to meet these requirements \n     would result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee \n     would be ineligible to regain it.\\227\\\n     \\227\\ See Second Report and Order at para.para. 132-134.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     PacBell opposes Sprint's suggestion that cellular carriers be \n     permitted to include their existing coverage in meeting PCS \n     coverage requirements.243\n     \\243\\ See PacBell Comments at 8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       153. MCI asserts that some relaxation of the construction \n     requirements is necessary if base and mobile power limits are \n     not substantially increased.244 US West opposes the 90 \n     percent construction requirement, asserting that 90 percent \n     coverage will increase the cost of PCS fourfold compared to a \n     67 percent population coverage requirement. It states that a \n     stringent construction requirement is not necessary to \n     prevent warehousing of spectrum because the spectrum will be \n     purchased at auction. As part of its filing, US West submits \n     an analysis of nine large western BTAs that indicates that \n     increasing population coverage from 67 to 75 percent results \n     in only a moderate increase in the geographic area that must \n     be served. On the other hand, increasing population from 75 \n     to 90 percent results in a very large increase in the \n     geographic area that must be covered.245\n     \\244\\ See MCI Comments at 17.\n     \\245\\ See US West Reply at 7-9.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       154. Decision. We believe that PCS will be a highly \n     competitive service and that licensees will have incentives \n     to construct facilities to meet the service demands in their \n     licensed service areas. Further, we believe that our use of \n     competitive bidding for PCS licensing and the restrictions on \n     the amount of spectrum that a licensee may control in a \n     geographic area will limit the likelihood that spectrum will \n     be warehoused. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that \n     minimum construction requirements are necessary to ensure \n     that PCS service is made available to as many communities as \n     possible and that the spectrum is used effectively. We note \n     that the Reconciliation Act amendments require the Commission \n     to impose performance requirements.246 While we agree \n     with GCI, NYNEX, and others that construction requirements \n     are needed to ensure service in a timely fashion, we also \n     agree that relaxation of the requirements is desirable to \n     ensure an economical deployment of the service to promote \n     opportunities for PCS ``niche'' services, and to facilitate a \n     competitive market.247\n     \\246\\ See 47 U.S.C. Sec. 309(i)(4)(B), as amended by the \n     Reconciliation Act.\n     \\247\\ See Comments at 13; NYNEX Comments at 8-9.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       155. Accordingly, we are amending the construction \n     requirements as follows. All 30 MHz broadband PCS licensees \n     will be required to construct facilities that provide \n     coverage to one-third of the population of their service area \n     within five years of initial license grant and to two-thirds \n     of the population of their service area within ten years. We \n     will require the 10 MHz licensees to meet a single \n     construction requirement of providing coverage to one-fourth \n     of the population of their service area within five years; or \n     alternatively, they may submit an acceptable showing to the \n     Commission demonstrating that they are providing substantial \n     service. We recognize that these requirements are less than \n     the requirement for narrowband PCS licensees, but we believe \n     this difference is appropriate given the higher expected \n     construction costs involved for broadband PCS.248 \n     Moreover, since licensees must purchase their licenses, they \n     will have added economic incentives to construct their \n     systems as rapidly as possible and introduce service to a \n     significant percentage of the population. In this regard, we \n     also believe that these relaxed construction requirements may \n     increase the viability and value of some broadband licenses, \n     especially those in less densely populated service areas. \n     Finally, since most areas are already served by cellular and \n     SMR providers, we believe it unnecessary to require PCS \n     licensees to provide identical or similar services to areas \n     where it is uneconomic to do so. With regard to the 10 MHz \n     licensees, we believe that the reduced construction \n     requirement will make these licenses more attractive to \n     applicants intending to provide residential, cutting-edge \n     niche services or services to business and educational \n     campuses where the population may be small except during \n     business or school hours.\n     \\248\\ The construction requirements for narrowband PCS are \n     set forth in Memorandum Opinion and Order, GEN Docket No. 90-\n     314 and ET Docket No. 92-100, 9 FCC Rcd 1309, 1313-1314, \n     para.para.27-34 (1994), recon. pending.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       156. At the five-year benchmark we will require all \n     licensees, and again at the 10-year benchmark for 30 MHz \n     licensees, to file a map and other supporting documentation \n     showing compliance with the construction requirements. \n     Licensees failing to meet the population coverage \n     requirements described above will be subject to the license \n     forfeiture penalties adopted in the Second Report and \n     Order.\\249\\ We recognize that even with these requirements, \n     factors such as incumbent microwave operation or sparse \n     population density in some instances could make compliance \n     difficult. In instances where the circumstances are unique \n     and the public interest would be served, the Commission will \n     consider waiving the requirements on a case-by-case \n     basis.\\250\\ These revised construction requirements will \n     ensure efficient spectrum utilization and promote significant \n     nationwide coverage without imposing substantial cost \n     penalties on licensees that serve less densely populated \n     areas. In this regard, we believe that these changes \n     generally address the concerns of those parties that \n     suggested lowering the construction requirements for \n     designated entities or for BTA service areas.\\251\\\n     \\249\\ See Second Report and Order at para.para. 133-134.\n     \\250\\ See WAIT Radio v. FCC, 418 F.2d 1153 (D.C. Cir. 1969).\n     \\251\\ We will also allow the licensee to use, if they choose \n     to do so, the 2000 census to determine the 10-year \n     construction requirement, rather than the 1990 census \n     specified in the Second Report and Order. This change ensures \n     that licensees will not be required to meet benchmarks based \n     on obsolete data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       157. We also recognize the desirability of encouraging more \n     than one provider to serve a diverse geographic area, and \n     note that resale of a licensee's geographic area to other \n     entities, subject to the licensee's control, is not \n     prohibited by our rules. Accordingly, we recognize that \n     licensees may resell spectrum, and believe that this will \n     facilitate the deployment of PCS. Whether or not the licensee \n     enters into resale arrangements, it will be responsible for \n     insuring that the coverage requirement and all the other \n     requirements of our rules are met. The reseller will not be a \n     separate licensee, but rather, will operate subject to the \n     control of the licensee. We believe that resale will \n     encourage service provision, particularly to rural areas, and \n     allow smaller, predominantly rural companies to participate \n     in PCS. We intend to examine in another proceeding whether \n     resale arrangements confer attributable interests on the \n     reseller. See Section IV, supra.\n       158. In summary, our relaxed construction requirements will \n     foster provision of PCS services and will promote diversity \n     in their provision. Permitting licensees to resell service \n     subareas, subject to the licensee's control, will permit \n     smaller, rural companies to provide PCS without participating \n     in the competitive bidding process. Finally, we intend to \n     monitor closely the development of PCS in rural and other \n     under-served areas and, if necessary, will readdress these \n     construction requirements to ensure that our goals for wide \n     area service are met.\n\n                        VI. Technical Standards\n\n               A. Roaming and interoperability standards\n\n       159. In the Second Report and Order, the Commission \n     provided maximum flexibility in technical standards to allow \n     PCS to develop in the most rapid, economically feasible and \n     diverse manner. Specific technical standards were prescribed \n     only to the extent necessary to avoid harmful interference. \n     The Commission recognized that several industry \n\n[[Page S 14582]]\n     technical and standards groups were addressing matters related to PCS \n     technical standards. It encouraged those groups to consider \n     ways of ensuring that PCS users, service providers, and \n     equipment manufacturers could incorporate roaming, \n     interoperability and other important features in the most \n     efficient and least costly manner, noting that PCS will be \n     more useful to the extent that users are not limited by \n     geography or by their ability to use their equipment with \n     different systems.\n       160. Petitioners' Requests. NCS, Motorola, and TIA request \n     that we reconsider our decision not to adopt PCS \n     interoperability requirements.\\252\\ NCS requests that we \n     adopt standards to ensure interoperability and nationwide \n     roaming.\n     \\252\\ Texas Emergency also requests that we adopt a uniform \n     standard for enhanced emergency 911 services.

Introduction. After the cancellation by the Domestic \n     Facilities Division (Division) on delegated authority of its \n     authorization to construct and operate Multichannel \n     Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) station WHT578 on the \n     F-group channels at Deadhorse, Alaska, Cable TV Services, \n     Inc. (Cable) requested reinstatement of its authorization.\n       2. Background. Although acknowledging that it had failed to \n     complete construction by the deadline, Cable states, on \n     reconsideration, that its authorization should be reinstated \n     because it lost its financing and was unable to obtain \n     substitute financing prior to the expiration of its \n     construction period. Approximately six weeks after the \n     construction expiration date, Cable filed an extension \n     application. Cable justifies the late filing of its extension \n     application because it was still searching for financing and \n     it had orally advised Commission staff of its financing \n     problems. Cable also argues that its authorization should be \n     reinstated because, with the exception of video programming \n     currently provided by satellite, no one but Cable would \n     provide multichannel [*2] video programming to the residents \n     of Deadhorse.\n       3. Discussion. Section 319(b) of the Communications Act of \n     1934, as amended, ``provides that a construction \n     authorization will be automatically forfeited if the station \n     is not ready for operation within the time specified in the \n     construction authorization, or such further time as the \n     Commission may allow, unless prevented by causes not under \n     the control of the grantee.'' Miami MDS Co. and Boston MDS \n     Co., 7 FCC Rcd 4347, 8347, 4348 (1992). The expiration date \n     of Cable's construction authorization appeared on the face of \n     the authorization. The authorization also contained the \n     following express provision: ``This permit shall be \n     automatically forfeited if the facilities authorized herein \n     are not ready for operation within the term of this permit. . \n     . .'' At the time, this automatic forfeiture provision was \n     specifically embodied in Section 21.44 of the Commission's \n     Rules. n1 Vidcom Marketing, Inc., 6 FCC Rcd 1945 n.3 (Dom. \n     Fac. Div. 1991).\n       ``Carriers who fail promptly to construct facilities \n     preclude other applicants who are willing, ready, and able to \n     construct from access to limited and valuable spectrum. This \n     has the effect of delaying, [*3] or even denying, service to \n     the public. Revision of Part 21 of the Commission's Rules, 2 \n     FCC Rcd 5713 (1987).'' Miami MDS Co. and Boston MDS Co., 7 \n     FCC Rcd 4347, 4349 (1992). Cable's loss of financing and \n     failure to obtain new financing did not toll its construction \n     deadline. Cable's construction authorization was \n     automatically forfeited pursuant to Section 319 of the \n     Communication's Act, 47 C.F.R. Sec. 21.44 and the terms of \n     the authorization. Cable's lack of financing fails to justify \n     reinstatement of its authorization. Cable asserted in its \n     initial application that it was financially qualified under \n     47 C.F.R. Sec. 21.17. Thus, it is the applicant's independent \n     business judgment that it is financially qualified. \n     Therefore, an independent business judgment to delay \n     construction for financial reasons would not be a cause \n     beyond the applicant's control, justifying an extension of \n     time to construct an MMDS station. See W. Lee Simmons, Inc., \n     2 FCC Rcd 4290 (1987) (extension applicant's business \n     decision not to construct was within its own control); Joe L. \n     Smith, Jr., Inc., 5 Rad Reg. 2d 582 (1965); accord Radio \n     Longview, Inc., 19 FCC 2d 966, 968-71 (1969); Beta Television \n     Corp., [*4] 27 FCC 2d 761, 763 (Rev. Bd. 1970). Cable was \n     required to file its extension application prior to the \n     expiration of its construction authorization. 47 C.F.R. Secs. \n     21.11 and 21.44(a). Cable failed to do so. Therefore, its \n     extension application is hereby dismissed as untimely filed.\n       n1 Section 21.44(a) stated inter alia as follows: ``A \n     construction permit shall be automatically forfeited if the \n     station is not ready for operation within the term of the \n     construction permit. . . .''\n       4. Conclusion and Ordering Clause. Have carefully \n     considered all of the arguments and evidence presented, we \n     find that Cable TV Services, Inc. automatically forfeited its \n     construction authorization for failure to construct prior to \n     the specified expiration date, reinstatement of the \n     authorization is not justified, and its extension application \n     was late filed. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the request \n     for reinstatement filed by Cable TV Services, Inc. regarding \n     the above-referenced MMDS authorization is denied and its \n     extension application is dismissed. This order is issued \n     pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Sec. 0.291, and is effective on its \n     release date. See 47 C.R.R.

The application \n     shall be filed at least 30 days prior to the expiration date \n     of the construction permit if the facts supporting such \n     application for extension are known to the applicant in time \n     to permit such filing. In other cases, an application will be \n     accepted upon a showing satisfactory to the FCC of sufficient \n     reasons for filing within less than 30 days prior to the \n     expiration date.\n       (b) Applications for extension of time to construct \n     broadcast stations, with the exception of International \n     Broadcast and Instructional TV Fixed stations, will be \n     granted only if one of the following three circumstances have \n     occurred:\n       (1) Construction is complete and testing is underway \n     looking toward prompt filing of a license application;\n       (2) Substantial progress has been made i.e., demonstration \n     that equipment is on order or on hand, site acquired, site \n     cleared and construction proceeding toward completion; or\n       (3) No progress has been made for reasons clearly beyond \n     the control of the permittee (such as delays caused by \n     governmental budgetary processes and zoning problems) but the \n     permittee has taken all possible steps to expeditiously \n     resolve the problem and proceed with construction.\n       (c) Applications for extension of time to construct \n     International Broadcast and Instructional TV Fixed stations \n     will be granted upon a specific and detailed showing that the \n     failure to complete was due to cause not under the control of \n     the permittee, or upon a specific and detailed showing of \n     other sufficient to justify an extension.\n       (d) If an application for extension of time within which to \n     construct a station is approved, such an extension will be \n     limited to a period of no more than 6 months except when an \n     assignment or transfer has been approved that provides for a \n     longer period up to a maximum of 12 months from the date of \n     consummation.\n       (e) Application for a construction permit to replace an \n     expired construction permit shall be filed on FCC Form 307. \n     Such applications must be filed within 30 days of the \n     expiration date of the authorization sought to be replaced. \n     If approved, such authorization shall specify a period of not \n     more than 6 months within which construction shall be \n     completed and application for license filed.\n     Sec. 73.3535 Application to modify authorized but unbuilt \n         facilities, or to assign or transfer control of an \n         unbuilt facility.\n       (a) If a permittee finds it necessary to file either an \n     application to modify its authorized, but unbuilt facilities, \n     or an assignment/transfer application, such application shall \n     be filed within the first 9 months of the issuance of the \n     original construction permit for radio and other broadcast \n     and auxiliary stations, or within 12 months of the issuance \n     of the original construction permit for television \n     facilities. Before such an application can be granted, the \n     permittee or assignee must certify that it will immediately \n     begin building after the modification is granted or the \n     assignment is consummated.\n       (b) Modification and assignment applications filed after \n     the time periods stated in paragraph (a) will not be granted \n     absent a showing that one of the following three criteria \n     apply: (1) Construction is complete and testing is underway \n     looking toward prompt filing of a license application; (2) \n     substantial progress has been made i.e., demonstration that \n     equipment is on order or on hand, site acquired, site cleared \n     and construction proceeding toward completion; or (3) no \n     progress has been made for reasons clearly beyond the control \n     of the permittee (such as delays caused by governmental \n     budgetary processes and zoning problems) but the permittee \n     has taken all possible steps to expeditiously resolve the \n     problem and proceed with construction.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Federal Communications Commission\n\n                         [1985 FCC LEXIS 3169]\n\n       In the matter of WULT-TV\n       June 10, 1985 Released; June 4, 1985\n       Opinion by: [*1] McKinney.\n     Opinion: New Orleans Channel 20, Inc., Rochester, NY.\n     Re: BMPCT-840710KH, BAPCT-840727KG, WULT-TV, New Orleans, LA.\n       Gentlemen: This refers to the above-captioned applications \n     for an extension of time within which to construct Station \n     WULT-TV, New Orleans, Louisiana, and for consent to \n     assignment of the construction permit, a petition to deny n1 \n     each of the applications, filed by Marvin Gorman Ministries, \n     Inc. (MGMI), and related pleadings.\n       n1 Applications for extension of time to construct are not \n     subject to petitions to deny. Therefore, the petition to deny \n     the extension of time application will be treated as an \n     informal objection filed pursuant to Section 73.3587 of the \n     Commission's Rules.\n       The Commission granted the construction permit for Channel \n     20 on October 10, 1980, following a settlement agreement \n     among three competing applicants. An application for \n     assignment of the construction permit was granted on January \n     25, 1982. The assignment was not consummated and on March 15, \n     1983, a second assignment application was granted, and was \n     consummated on June 28, 1983. On August 9, 1983, the \n     Commission granted the permittee's application for [*2] a six \n     month extension of time to construct. No construction was \n     undertaken following any of the grants. On February 8, 1984, \n     the Commission granted an additional six month extension of \n     time to construct, subject to the condition that, not later \n     than May 9, 1984, you would file a progress report with the \n     Commission. By letter dated May 9, 1994, rather than \n     submitting a progress report, you informed the Commission \n     that because of the drain on your time and resources and lack \n     of success in obtaining a suitable construction site, you had \n     decided to assign the permit to another entity better able to \n     pursue construction of the station. Consequently, you have \n     once again requested an extension of time to construct in \n     order to assign the permit to another entity. It again \n     appears that no construction has been undertaken. You state \n     that the proposed assignee stands ready to pursue \n     construction of the station once the assignment application \n     is approved.\n       In its objections, MGMI contends that you have had ample \n     time in which to secure a site, have failed to do so, have \n     received two extensions previously for failure to find a \n     site, and that you have made little effort to procure a \n     transmitter [*3] site. Under these circumstances, MGMI argues \n     that you should not be allowed to profit from the sale of the \n     construction permit which would result if the Commission \n     grants the requested extension. MGMI alleges that you have \n     not been diligent in your efforts to secure a transmitter \n     site, and that you assertion that you have, lacks \n     credibility. MGMI points out that several of its officers \n     know of available sites for a transmitter, and that ten other \n     applicants for Channel 49 in New Orleans have specified \n     available sites. MGMI notes that two of the principals of New \n     Orleans Channel 20, Inc. have been holders of the \n     construction permit for Channel 20 since 1980. Therefore, \n     MGMI argues, it is unreasonable to believe that these \n     principals could not have produced a transmitter site within \n     this four year time span. Further, MGMI states that the \n     public interest has been successively undercut by your \n     continuing attempt to hold on to the construction permit. \n     MGMI asserts that your failure to construct over the past \n     four years has removed the channel from the community and \n     prevented any other party from applying to use it.\n       In opposition, you state that the objections are not based \n     on [*4] the present set of circumstances, but on the previous \n     extension applications and the previous applications for \n     assignment of the construction permit which cannot be \n     revisited. You argue that the public interest would be served \n     by extending the construction permit and allowing the station \n     to go on the air promptly. You assert that the public \n     interest would not be served by opening up the channel for \n     multiple competing applications. You note that LeSea \n     Broadcasting, the proposed assignee, has committed itself to \n     constructing the station, and it hopes to have the station on \n     the air in seven months. n2\n       n2 The proposed assignee states that it has: (1) secured a \n     transmitter site and filed an application to modify the \n     Channel 20 construction permit to specify the new site; (2) \n     placed a contingent order for broadcast equipment in the \n     amount of approximately $2.5 million; (3) located a suitable \n     studio site; and (4) reached agreements in principle with \n     individuals who will be the station's operations manager and \n     chief engineer.\n       Additionally, you maintain that past Commission cases made \n     it clear that an extension of time is appropriate where a \n     permittee that has not constructed a station [*5] proposes to \n     assign the permit to a party that is prepared to proceed with \n     construction. Gross Broadcasting Co., 41 FCC 2d 729 (1973); \n     New Television Corp., 65 FCC 2d 680 (Rev. Bd. 1977); Hymen \n     Lake, 56 FCC 2d 379 (Rev. Bd. 1975). You state that in the \n     past, where there has been a firm commitment from the \n     proposed assignee to construct and the probability of early \n     inauguration of UHF television, as here, the Commission has \n     consistently found that the public interest would be served \n     by extending the time for construction. You contend that the \n     extension and assignment of the Channel 20 permit would bring \n     new television service to New Orleans at the earliest \n     opportunity. Further, you allege that MGMI has failed to \n     offer any support for its legal position and has provided no \n     basis for overturning long-established Commission policy.\n       In reply to your opposition, MGMI maintains that you have \n     not submitted any showing of circumstances beyond your \n     control which prevented construction and, therefore, the \n     permit should be forfeited. MGMI alleges that in the 11 \n     months you have controlled the permit, you have made no \n     discernible effort to find a site, order equipment, [*6] or \n     to begin any type of television operation in New Orleans. \n     Yet, MGMI states, you now hope to receive $250,000 for \n     transferring the permit to another party.\n       Before an extension application can be granted, Section \n     73.3534(a) of the Commission's Rules requires either a \n     specific and detailed showing that the failure to complete \n\n[[Page S 14584]]\n\n     construction within the time provided was due to causes \n     beyond a permittee's control or that there are other matters \n     sufficient to justify the extension. In the past, where an \n     assignee made a firm commitment to construct expeditiously \n     and the Commission was persuaded that the assignment \n     represents the fastest way to have the station activated, the \n     pendency of the assignment application can be considered to \n     be such an ``other matter.'' King Communications, Inc., 47 RR \n     2d 109, 110 (Rev. Bd., 1980). However, the filing of an \n     assignment application does not automatically entitle the \n     permittee to an extension of time to have the station built. \n     Moreover, subsequent to the King decision, the Commission has \n     clearly stated that it will take a much closer look at \n     extension applications. See, e.g., Revision of Form 301, 50 \n     R.R. 2d 381, 382 (1981); MEKAOY [*7] C. (KTIE), 48 RR 2d 815, \n     817 (Broadcast Bureau, 1980).\n       Here, we note that it has been four years since the \n     construction permit was issued for Channel 20. During this \n     time, the Commission has granted two assignment applications \n     and two applications for extension of time to construct. Yet, \n     no construction has commenced and it appears that no \n     equipment has been ordered. In granting the last extension of \n     time to construct, the Commission granted the request subject \n     to the condition that not later than May 9, 1984, a progress \n     report would be filed with the Commission. However, on May 9, \n     1984, you informed the Commission that you had decided to \n     assign the permit to another entity. Thus, on July 10, 1984, \n     you filed an application for extension of time to construct \n     and on July 27, 1984, an application for assignment of the \n     construction permit.\n       In this case, the permit was assigned to you on the \n     assumption that you would build promptly. The last extension \n     application was approved on the assumption that its grant \n     would expeditiously result in a new service to the public. \n     These expectations have come to nought.\n       Accordingly, on the basis of the facts set forth in your \n     application, [*8] the Commission is unable to find that \n     construction of the station was prevented by causes beyond \n     your control and the Commission does not find the existence \n     of other matters which would warrant an extension. The filing \n     of the assignment application, under the circumstances, does \n     not warrant an extension of time. You are advised that your \n     application for an extension of time within which to \n     construct Station WULT, New Orleans, Louisiana, is denied, \n     your construction permit is canceled, your call sign is \n     deleted, and your application for assignment of the \n     construction permit to LeSea Broadcasting, Incorporated, is \n     dismissed, as moot.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James C.

Mr. President, I would still like to have a rollcall vote \non this issue, but I have no further reason to debate the issue. So I \nwould suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to alert my colleagues it will be \nmy intention later on today when the floor opens up to offer an \namendment with Senator Burns to provide transitional funding----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would withhold.\n  We are in a controlled time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think my statement would take perhaps 7 or 8 minutes, if \nthere is a parliamentary concern.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will yield the Senator from Nevada 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Then I will yield the Senator from Nevada 11 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 11 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair and my friend from North Dakota for his \ncourtesy.\n  As I indicated, Mr. President, it will be my intention to offer, with \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, an amendment \nlater on today to provide transitional funding for the U.S. Travel and \nTourism Administration.\n  This funding would permit an orderly transition into a new public/\nprivate-sector entity. This amendment enjoys the support of a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, including, among many others, \nSenators McConnell, Hollings, Murkowski, Inouye, Thurmond, and Daschle.\n  I might also note, Mr. President, that the National Governors' \nAssociation at their recent annual meeting endorsed the concept \nembodied in this proposed amendment.\n  Mr. President, none of us is unmindful of the fact that the current \nbudget pressures demand some extraordinary responses. So the purpose of \nthis amendment is simply to provide some transitional funding until \nthis public-private partnership can be organized.\n  As part of this effort, the Congress, the administration, and the \ntravel and tourism organization that are needed best to promote the \ntravel industry are going to need some time to put this into effect. To \ncut off funding cold turkey, as is contemplated in the present form of \nthis bill, would be the equivalent of unilateral disarmament.\n  All of our competitors spend considerably more than we do on their \nnational tourism offices. In fact, the United States ranks 23d, \nspending just $16 million while countries like Greece, Mexico, and \nSpain, spend more than $100 million each year. In fact, putting this in \nsome context, Mr. President, we rank behind such powerhouses as Tunisia \nand Malaysia in terms of the amount of money we are spending.\n  Unfortunately, these spending figures are having a dramatic impact on \nour share of the world's tourism market. In 1993, the United States \nenjoyed almost 19 percent of the world's tourism receipts. This has \ndeclined to 15.6 percent this year, and is expected to shrink to 13.8 \npercent by the end of the decade. The chart that I have prepared will \nindicate that rather dramatic decline. In 1993, 18.7 percent; 1994, \n17.9 percent; 1995, estimated this year, 15.6 percent; and by the end \nof the century, 13.8 percent.\n  Now, this is more than just a statistical observation. It has real \nimpact. The loss in the U.S. share of the world's tourism market can be \ntranslated into a significant impact on our trade deficit and on \nemployment. If we were able to keep our world tourism share from \nshrinking, we would improve our trade balance--that is a plus, Mr. \nPresident--by $28 billion and increase employment by 370,000 people by \nthe year 2000.\n  Those are significant industries. Very few industries can shape our \neconomy to this extent. Travel and tourism is already the second \nlargest employer in our Nation after health care. It employs either \ndirectly or indirectly 13 million Americans.\n  Now, this indicates the trade surplus balance, something that is \nalways of concern to us. We are running, in terms of our international \ntrading accounts, a deficit.\n  This clearly indicates that tourism--international tourism; we are \nnot talking about domestic tourism; this is international tourism--can \nbe a substantial, positive, contributing factor. The estimate this year \nis $18.1 billion, that is, in effect, more people coming to the United \nStates from abroad, spending money in your State, Mr. President, and \nothers who are on the floor and my own as opposed to Americans \ntraveling abroad and spending money in foreign countries--$18.1 billion \nto the good as we say.\n  The opportunity we have as a nation is that international travel and \ntourism is growing rapidly. By the year 2000 more than 661 million \npeople will be traveling throughout the world. That is roughly twice as \nmany people as traveled in 1985. What we need to do is to capture our \nshare of this tourism market. We need to put the muscle of the public \nand private sector together in a public/private-sector relationship to \nmake sure we advance this market, fully exploit this market to make \nsure that we get our fair share of the international travel dollar. And \nto do this we need to develop a new strategy, jointly with the private \nsector, to energize our international tourism efforts.\n  The amendment which we will be offering later today would provide $12 \nmillion in funding for USTTA, for the transition into this new public/\nprivate-sector entity. What this entity will look like is being \nformulated as we \n\n[[Page S 14585]]\nspeak. It should be available for scrutiny at the upcoming White House \nConference on Travel and Tourism.\n  Australia and Canada have recently created such public/private-sector \npartnerships. These new organizations are each spending approximately \n$100 million this year and have developed creative and aggressive \nprograms in promoting national tourism on behalf of their respective \ncountries.\n  I do not come here to defend our current tourism effort. It is in \nneed of a major overhaul. But terminating this program cold turkey is \nnot the appropriate step to take. We must make a transition into a new \nmarket entity. This transition is important for all of us. It gives us \ntime to begin implementing the recommendations that will emerge from \nthe White House conference on tourism, time to help kick off the 1996 \nsummer Olympics in Atlanta, in time to make a transition into a new \npublic/private-sector partnership.\n  Later on, Mr. President, I will urge my colleagues to support this \namendment, which enjoys wide bipartisan support. And I note the work of \nmy distinguished colleague from Montana, Senator Burns, who is a prime \ncosponsor with me.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if anyone else needs to speak, but I \nreserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.\n  Noting no other Senator on the floor, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2815\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment, \nwhich would increase our commitment to addressing the menace of \ndomestic violence.\n  Mr. President, violence against women is one of this country's most \nimportant and pressing problems. Every 5 minutes a women is raped. \nEvery 12 seconds a woman is battered. In fact, these figures reflect \nonly reported crimes--the actual incidence rates probably are even \nhigher.\n  These numbers are mind-numbing and appalling. Yet they fail to convey \nthe horror and the long-term physical and emotional harms that victims \nsuffer. Sexual assault can have a devastating impact on a woman, \nespecially if she cannot get access to needed counseling and support \nservices. These harms can last a lifetime. It's therefore critical that \ncounseling and other services are available to all victims.\n  That is one reason why last year I was proud to cosponsor the \nViolence Against Women Act. This act offers a comprehensive approach to \nfighting family violence and sexual assault.\n  Under the act, Federal funds are distributed to the States for victim \nsupport services, for training of law enforcement officers, for \nexpansion of law enforcement and prosecution agencies, and for the \ndevelopment of more effective programs to prevent violent crimes \nagainst women.\n  Funds have already been distributed to the States under this act, and \nit's off to a good, strong start. But it's only a start. The job is far \nfrom done.\n  Unfortunately, in its current form, this bill would take a step \nbackward in the battle against domestic violence. Last year, Congress \nauthorized about $175 million for fiscal year 1996. Yet the bill would \ncut that level by $75 million.\n  In my view, that cut would be a big mistake. We simply should not \nturn our back on the commitment that we made last year to fighting \nviolence against women.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment, which would provide critical additional funds for the \nViolence Against Women Act. It's time to make the fight against \ndomestic violence a top national priority.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for restoring funding \nfor the Violence Against Women Act programs. When we passed the \nViolence Against Women Act as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, we responded to the crisis of domestic \nviolence that exists throughout this country, in rural and urban \ncommunities, among poor, middle class, and the rich, affecting women \nand children of all races and religions. Those programs are among the \nmost important parts of the comprehensive legislation we considered and \npassed last year after 6 long years of debate.\n  To have gutted these programs through the appropriations process \nwould have been wrong. To have done so when the funding for them was \nassured through the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund would have \nbreached our commitment to the American people. A 99 to 0 vote in favor \nof restoring this funding sends a powerful message to those who would \nhave cut funding for these important programs.\n  Law enforcement and community-based programs cannot be kept on a \nstring like a yo-yo if they are to plan and implement programs to begin \nto deal with domestic violence and its prevention. They need to be able \nto initiate programs and hire staff and have a sense of stability if \nthese measures are to achieve their fullest potential.\n  I know, for instance, that, in Vermont, Lori Hayes at the Vermont \nCenter for Crime Victims Services; Judy Rex and the Vermont Network \nAgainst Domestic Violence and Sexual Abuse; Karen Bradley from the \nVermont Center for Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Abuse; and \nothers, provide tremendous service under difficult conditions. Such \ndedicated individuals and organizations, working in a most difficult \narea, on problems that were once thought to be intractable, ought not \nbe promised support and then frustrated just as they are about to \nexpand needed programs and services throughout the State. Vermont was \nthe first State to apply for and the first State to begin receiving its \nViolence Against Women Act grant. The Governor and his advisers had \nmade plans and promises and announced grantees through the State. That \nimplementation of Violence Against Women Act programs ought to proceed \nwithout further delay, distraction or diminution.\n  What Congress needs to do is to follow through on our commitments, \nnot to breach them and violate our pledge to law enforcement, State and \nlocal government, and the American people. Invading trust funds \ndedicated to Violence Against Women Act programs is simply not \njustifiable. Neither the elimination of the corporate alternative \nminimum tax nor capital gains taxes is sufficient reason for this cut.\n  Funding for important programs implementing the Violence Against \nWomen Act and our rural crime initiatives should not be cut without \ndebate and justification. There has been neither.\n  Earlier this year I offered a resolution rejecting the ill-advised \nHouse action cutting $5 billion from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust \nFund. The Senate agreed and proclaimed its intent to preserve the trust \nfund so that we could fulfill the promise of the Violent Crime Control \nand Law Enforcement Act and our commitment to do all that we can to \nreduce violent crime in our local communities. The action we take today \ntakes an important step in that same direction and preserves to our \nViolence Against Women Act programs funds that are needed for their \nproper implementation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Regular order, Mr. President.\n\n\n                       vote on amendment no. 2815\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Under the previous order, the McCain amendment \nis now in order. There are 4 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado, Senator \nBrown, for his perfection of this amendment, which has allowed us to \nagree on this very important savings of between $300 and $700 million \nfor the taxpayers of America. I thank Senator Brown for that.\n  I yield what remaining time I have to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the Senator's \nremarks. I hope the Members of the Senate will vote to approve this \namendment. It does deal with $300 to $700 million that ought to inure \nto the benefit of the taxpayers of this country, and that is why we \noffered the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have an explanation of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. May we have an explanation of the amendment? I understand \nit is a good amendment, but I would like to know what it is if we are \ngoing to be voting on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. If those Members \nhaving discussions could please retire to the Cloakroom?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment expresses, legally, that the \nU.S. Senate is in favor of obtaining the maximum value for a spectrum \nwhich is valued between $300 and $700 million. This is done by auction. \nThe perfecting amendment by Senator Brown is that, in case there is \nanother way to gain more money for the taxpayers, that path should be \npursued by the FCC as well.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no particular reason to enter into \nany discussion on this amendment. But when we get 4 minutes allotted \nfor explanation of these amendments, that is a very worthwhile \ninjection into the unanimous-consent request. It means something, for \nthe rest of the Members to understand what we are voting on.\n  I am not on the committee that has jurisdiction of that particular \nsubject. I would just like a little clearer explanation. I expect to \nvote for the amendment. I hear a lot of good things about it. But I am \nsure a lot of Members have not heard debate on it. I have not.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the reason my remarks this morning were \nbrief is that we came at 9 o'clock this morning and began a debate on \nthis very amendment per the unanimous-consent request last evening. \nThere was debate on both sides of the amendment beginning at 9 o'clock \nthis morning. My intention was not to take up any more of the Senate's \ntime. It was debated both this morning and partially last night.\n  I think the amendment is a good agreement. I respect the Senator from \nWest Virginia's interest in making sure everybody understands what we \nare voting on just prior to the vote, but I think we have had a good \ndebate on this. I hope the Members will support the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is there any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 19 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am one of those Senators who stayed around \nall afternoon waiting on a vote yesterday. I was told there would be a \nvote at 9 o'clock last night, so I went home about 6:30 or 7 to get \nsome dinner, to be with my good wife, Lady Byrd, and my little dog, \nBilly Byrd.\n  So I came back. Then, after I got back, it was my understanding there \nwas not going to be any vote until this morning. So, as a result of all \nof that, to make a long story short, I did not get to listen to the \ndebate. I do not know about other Senators, but, with that kind of \ndiscussion here, it is pretty hard to keep body and soul together with \na good meal once in a while, let alone understand what is in these \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2819\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, is the pending business the Domenici \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, that is the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Domenici \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have before us an appropriations \nbill. We have imposed, on top of the House bill, our particular \nappropriators' likes and dislikes. But the underlying bill that the \nHouse sent to us essentially says, ``Let's keep the Legal Services \nCorporation, but let's make sure that those things that the Legal \nServices Corporation has been doing that many Senators and many people \nin this country don't think they ought to be doing, that those things \nbe prohibited.''\n  The House did not abolish the program. The House in the \nappropriations bill funded legal services with these prohibitions \nattached. \n\n[[Page S 14587]]\n\n  What I am going to do now is to take the amendment that came out of \nthe subcommittee that is on the floor on legal services, and I am going \nto substitute for it something very much like the House bill. So for \nthose who wonder whether this amendment, the Domenici-Hollings and many \nothers, whether this bill will permit the Legal Services Corporation to \ndo business as usual, I submit to them we are going to let this Legal \nServices Corporation do what the House said they can do.\n  And what is that?\n  First, let me say that this approach to justice came under the regime \nof Richard Nixon. And what he said then I believe applies today, and \nmaybe more so.\n  He said:\n\n       [It] gives those in need new reason to believe that they \n     too are part of ``the system'' . . . [by doing what we have \n     learned] that justice is served far better--\n\n  And continuing with his quote--\n\n     and differences are settled more rationally within the system \n     rather than on the streets. Now [he said in the 1970's] is \n     the time to make legal services an integral part of our \n     judicial system.\n\n  Now, since that point until now, legal services has had a rocky \ncareer. There is no doubt about it. It has been debated on the floor. \nAnd it has been perilously close--but for Senator Rudman as a stalwart, \nperhaps it would have been changed and it would not be around. But \nessentially what the Senator from New Mexico intends is that this \nprogram be around as Richard Nixon intended.\n  Should not the poor people in the country should be served by lawyers \nwhen they themselves have a need for a lawyer. In fact, it was \nmentioned back in the days when the Legal Services Corporation was \nestablished that lawyers would be down there with the poor people \ntaking their case, the idea of storefront justice.\n  I say to everyone, I do not know what is wrong with the United States \nof America saying to the needy people of this country that the judicial \nsystem is not only for the rich. What is wrong with that? Why should a \nRepublican be ashamed to say that? That is what America is all about.\n  What we do not want, at least this Senator does not want, is the \nlegal services to be suing the Legislature of the State of New Jersey \nwhen they are adopting a new welfare program and saying, ``You can't do \nthat.'' I think they should leave that to somebody else. And this \nprogram ought to be for the individual poor people who have a need for \na lawyer.\n  Let me suggest--although it is a criminal case, so it does not \nnecessarily apply to what we are doing, I say to the Senator from South \nCarolina--but has anybody ever seen a situation, such as the O.J. \nSimpson trial, where somebody who has plenty of money gets plenty of \njustice?\n   But here we have in a poverty neighborhood an American citizen who \nis being thrown out of their house, and they have a legitimate reason \nas a tenant to remain there. But if they do not get a lawyer, they are \nout on the streets.\n  If that same thing existed and there was a tenant in a million dollar \nhouse for the summer and the landlord wants to throw them out, they \nwill get justice, will they not? They will get justice. They will get a \nlawyer. Why should that poor person not get that?\n  Frankly, I am one of those who wants to make Government smaller. I \nwant to balance the budget. I do not take a back seat to anybody on \nthis. But what I am trying to do in this amendment is to return the \nlevel of funding to legal services to what it was 3 years ago. I am \ncutting 15 percent, I say to the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, \n15 percent from this funding. Frankly, there are not a lot of programs \ngetting cut much more than 15 percent. There are some, and some are \nzero, but for the most part, 7, 8, 9 percent, even in these very \ndifficult times.\n  I want to read the prohibitions, and might I say, Mr. President, I am \nfully aware--I am fully aware--that a number of people are going to \nvote for my amendment and it will be adopted. It will be adopted, you \ncan count on it. There are a number of people who do not like all these \nprohibitions, but they are going to vote for it. They are going to vote \nfor this amendment because they do not want to see an appropriations \nsubcommittee, which probably had one hearing for 1 hour, 1\\1/2\\ hours, \n2 hours, decide in a funding bill to do away with this program and \ncreate a new block grant that we do not even understand and, at the \nsame time, provide such a small amount of funding for the next year \nthat there will not be anything being done for the poor people.\n  We might just as well say for the next year there is nothing going to \nbe done under the funding level here. If anybody wants to challenge me \non that, do not look at the budget authority number, look at the \noutlay. It is a little tiny bit; $53 million in outlays for the whole \nnext year. The House put in $278 million; $53 million versus a House \nRepublican conservative $278 million. I bring it up to $340 million, \nwhich is 15 percent less than last year.\n  Let me read the prohibitions. If there is anyone here who does not \nthink the Domenici-Hollings amendment wants to make this program work \nfor individual American needy people in their personal litigation, let \nme read the prohibitions.\n  First, you cannot use any of this money or any money from other \nsources that is in the Legal Services Corporation to advocate policies \nrelating to redistricting.\n  No class action lawsuits--no class action lawsuits--can be filed. To \nrevert back to what I just described: Individual legal services for \nindividual Americans in need, for their case and their cause and only \nthat.\n  You cannot use it for influencing action on any legislative, \nconstitutional amendment, referendum, or similar procedures of \nCongress, State, or local legislative bodies. The same as the House.\n  You cannot use it for legal assistance to illegal aliens. Americans, \nAmericans are what we have in mind, American citizens.\n  Supporting, conducting training programs relating to political \nactivities, abortion litigation, prisoner litigation--same as the \nHouse--welfare reform litigation, except to represent individuals on \nparticular matters that do not involve changing existing law.\n  I can go on with the rest. I put them in the Record last night. If \nanybody has any questions on them, I will be pleased to answer them.\n  I know sitting on the floor right now are perhaps two Senators who \nwould rather have less of these, and I understand that. But I want to \ndo one thing at a time this year. I do not want to do away with the \nprogram. I do not want a block grant program designed in an \nappropriations subcommittee which I believe essentially is destined to \nget rid of the system.\n  I have left one part of this discussion to my good friend Senator \nHollings because, obviously, the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nGramm from Texas, is going to get up and talk about the offsets. I have \nnot been privy to reading what he might say, nor has he shared it with \nme, but I can see it coming.\n  He is going to suggest, for instance, that salaries and expenses for \nthe Federal judiciary, that I took a little bit of money away from--\nyes, I did. But we have consulted regularly on that and, basically, we \nare convinced that because we have increased it sufficiently, to take a \nsmall amount off, they are going to be all right, as compared to doing \naway with legal services for the needy and the poor.\n  He is going to talk, for instance, about U.S. attorneys. Let me just \ntell you about that one. I know the argument. The argument is going to \nbe: There are a lot of criminals out there who need to be prosecuted. \nAre we going to take away prosecutions of those people to keep legal \nservices?\n  Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, what actually happened is \nthe subcommittee took the President's budget on new U.S. attorneys, \nwhich was more than adequate. All the U.S. attorneys around said, \n``That's a great number,'' and the subcommittee increased it, maybe \nincreased all of those kinds of funding, so there would not be anything \nleft for a program like this. Then we come along and say, ``Let's bring \nit down to the President's budget,'' and we are cutting U.S. attorneys.\n  Having said that, there are a number of other things. I am going to \nask if my good friend, Senator Hollings, who is my cosponsor, who has \nchaired this subcommittee and is the ranking member, might address the \nSenate now with \n\n[[Page S 14588]]\nreference to his feelings on this amendment. And with particularity, if \nhe can talk a little about the offsets, I would appreciate it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNew Mexico and former ranking member and the former chairman of our \nsubcommittee.\n  In short, Senator Domenici talks with expert knowledge, intimate \nknowledge, of this particular appropriations measure.\n  First, Mr. President, Legal Services is a many splendored thing. I do \nnot say that lightly. Yes, it was an idea that came to fruition, you \nmight say, under President Nixon. But it was long since due, if you \nplease. We had many in the vineyards who had been working over the many \nyears. In the 1920's, Charles Evans Hughes; our former President, Chief \nJustice William Howard Taft; and Elihu Root supported the formation of \na standing committee on legal aid work in the American Bar Association. \nAnd Taft wrote, in 1925:\n\n       Something must be devised by which everyone, however lowly \n     and however poor, however unable by his means to employ a \n     lawyer and to pay court costs, shall be furnished the \n     opportunity to set this fixed machinery of justice going.\n\n  Then it was some 40 years later, almost 50 years later, that our \ndistinguished former President, Richard Nixon, came in 1970 with the \nAmerican Bar Association. When I say a ``many splendored thing,'' \neverybody thinks voluntarism begins in Washington, families begin in \nWashington, and everything that is done begins in Washington.\n  The fact of the matter is that society has been very concerned about \nthe poor having their day in court. We, as old-time trial lawyers, know \nthat, yes, with respect to damage suit cases and injury cases whereby \nyou can get a verdict, there is a long since-established system that \nhas worked extremely well--and now the Brits, by the way, are coming to \nit--whereby we take it on a contingent basis because we know the poor \ninjured do not have the money to investigate, do not have the money to \npay hourly payments that they get in Washington.\n  There are 60,000 lawyers under billable hours running around this \ntown who have never been in a courtroom. On the contrary, the poor can \ncome to a trial attorney. He will take care of the court expenses, the \nmedical expenses of the doctors testifying, the experts drawing plats \nand what have you. And if he loses his case, the poor do not owe the \nlawyer anything. That is a contingent fee basis of trial work.\n  But when it comes to these smaller cases where there is not any \ncontingency to be paid--namely, a domestic case, an unemployment case, \na landlord-tenant case--for the poor, in these types of cases, there is \nno time in it or benefit with it with respect to the practicing bar. \nAnd they have been more or less shut out over the many, many years \nuntil President Nixon and the Legal Services Corporation under the \nAmerican Bar Association got started.\n  Now, what has developed? Mr. President, I think there are over \n130,000 lawyers. Imagine that. Do away with this and give it to the \nGovernors with block grants and try to find the lawyers who are going \nto come in on this particular thing. They will start putting tanks on \nthe lawn again and buying airplanes and everything else of that kind. \nAs the distinguished chairman of my subcommittee knows, you get that \nfish--what do we call it, the ``funk'' or the ``monk'' fish, whatever \nit was.\n  I refer, Mr. President, to when we had the stimulus bill and they had \nasked the poor mayors what they would like to do to stimulate the \neconomy. They came up with cemeteries. They came up with golf courses. \nThey came up with parking garages down there for the youngsters to park \nat Easter-time on Fort Lauderdale beach. We had to put in all kinds of \nrestrictions there on the local effort and what local people can spend \nfor legal services, or not spend.\n  What you are doing is really destroying, if you please, one of the \nfinely honed societal developments, led, if you please, by the American \nBar, and former Associate Justice Lewis Powell when he was the \npresident of the American Bar Association, and President Richard Nixon.\n  I remember it well. I had been involved in this since the early days. \nWe have had stormy times. After it got started, everybody was jumping \nup and down on the Capitol steps, saying ``Hey, hey, go away; how many \ndid you kill today?'' and all of that. Yes, we were paying them--Legal \nServices were paying them. I had to treat that with amendments and say, \nno, let us get back. We are not paying for demonstrating groups to \ncome.\n  As the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has referred to, and as \nconcerned as the Senator from Texas and the Senator from South Carolina \nare, the next thing you know a couple years ago, there went Legal \nServices suing the State of New Jersey.\n  That is not the intent. There are plenty of moneys for class actions \nfor these other groups. You have to keep it couched and carefully \ncontrolled in order to maintain the credibility and the effectiveness \nof the program.\n  So I welcome the restrictions that have been put on by Senator Gramm \nand others here with respect to class actions and illegals and \notherwise. Let us make sure that we maintain the integrity of the \nprogram. There were 250,000 cases last year, and, yes, with a $400 \nmillion appropriation. The communities come, the local governments and \nState governments, and the various bar associations, and they pitch in \nover $255 million--over half again what we appropriate at the Federal \nlevel. If you put in a Federal program--if you put in block grants--I \ncan tell you right now they are not going to come with any moneys. You \nreally are messing up a many, many splendored thing.\n  So the Senator from New Mexico is following right now in the \nfootsteps of the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Rudman. I will \ntell you right now, do not get in Senator Rudman's way if you were \ngoing to challenge the Legal Services. He would knock over chairs and \ntables and come at you. I used to get out of the way. I am glad to get \nout of the way now under the leadership of Senator Domenici for the \nmost worthwhile program that has been developed in a bipartisan fashion \nand should be maintained as such.\n  What about these offsets? First you have to understand that the \nmoneys taken from the Department of Justice have to be understood. I \nthink I have the exact figure here. After all of the offsets are taken \nin the Domenici-Hollings amendment, what happens is we still have \nincreased the Department of Justice a tremendous amount in percentage--\nsome 18-percent increase over this year. In other words, let us not \nargue. Let us take and try on the offsets from the Department of \nJustice, because I am a champion of that particular Department, having \nbeen the chairman, and ranking member now, and on this subcommittee for \nover 25 years. The FBI will have an 18.3-percent increase. The FBI, \nwith its attorneys and otherwise, will be left with a $418 million \nincrease in this budget for 1996 over 1995.\n  So, in no way are we cutting back. It is a tremendous increase. The \ntruth of the matter is, I was actually amazed--and I have sworn I am \nnot going to ever use any charts around here. I am tired of it. If we \nwant to balance the budget, we ought to put a tax on charts used by us \npoliticians on the floor of the Senate and I think we could balance the \nbudget. Every time I look around, somebody is running out with one of \nthese mischievous charts.\n  It is jogging my memory here. By 1983, after almost 200 years of \nhistory, we got to a $3 billion budget in the Department of Justice. \nMind you me, having been the chief law enforcement officer, having been \na Governor of a State, we have argued, and still argue, that the police \npowers--those that belong rightfully at the local level--that the \nprimary function of the State government is its police powers to \nenforce the law.\n  So we have been very askance about the Federal Government coming in \non all of these particular initiatives because we in Washington like to \nget reelected.\n  We identify with the hot-button crime issue and we throw money at it. \nWe have had more crime bills come spewing down the road. We have $1 \nbillion backed up there in the Bureau of Prisons. We are building them \nlike \n\n[[Page S 14589]]\ngangbusters all over the land, all because crime is a hot-button item.\n  It took 200 years to get to $3 billion. This budget here for 1996 \nwill carry us to $16.95 billion--17 billion bucks.\n  Actually, the increase--taking the offsets in our Legal Services \namendment--the increase will exceed $3 billion, even accounting for \nthese offsets in the Department of Justice. In other words, in 1 year \nwe are increasing the Justice budget by the amount that the total \nbudget was just a few short years ago.\n  We think it is needed. As I say, I was on the committee. I did not \njust do it willy-nilly, but we wanted to respond to immigration, border \npatrol, the prison system, the Marshals Service, the FBI, Drug \nEnforcement Administration, and on down the list. We have been working \nand working and working.\n  Here we come with an offset respecting the particular crime lab. Now, \nwith respect to that crime lab, I know full well that the Department of \nJustice is working with the Department of Defense to get that new \nlaboratory. It is a technical support center. That is over $300 million \nin new initiatives.\n  Earlier this year, Judge Freeh came up with that particular need \nafter the tragic incident down there in Oklahoma. Just sort of like a \npinata, broke it, and all the gifts went in all directions. We just \nstarted anywhere that anybody came up from the Justice Department. We \nvoted aye, we said you got that, do not worry about it, and everything \nelse.\n  Looking at that laboratory which we support out there at Quantico, we \nknow full well that the Justice Department is conferring now with the \nDepartment of Defense, and they do not even have the site and the land \nand everything else.\n  What we are trying to do is support the requirement as needed, and to \nback up the money and the particular offset. It is not a question of us \nnot supporting the technical support center, but once we get the site \nwe have to draw the plans and everything else of that kind. What we \nneed to do is go in a deliberate fashion there.\n  With respect to the topography lab, it is a new one. There is an \neffort in this Government along that line. You have to speak advisedly \nbecause most of this is classified, but I can tell you here and now if \nyou have served on the Intelligence Committee--I served with the Hoover \nCommission back in the 1950's investigating these type of activities--\nthat they are awfully, awfully expensive. The effort, I think, that we \nhave now in the Government is more than adequate without starting a new \none.\n  I defer to the chairman of our Intelligence Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and our \nranking member, Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska. I am confident that \nthe offsets there are not going to injure in any fashion the efforts of \nlaw enforcement or the Department of Justice.\n  With respect to the working capital fund, what we need to do is get a \nlittle bit of discipline there. We have been liberal. In fact, we like \nit when we handle these appropriations. If we had a working capital \nfund in everybody's subcommittee, the chairman and the ranking member \ncould allocate around, somewhat like Plato's famous saying that a \npolitician ``makes his own little laws and sits attentive to his own \napplause.'' All we need to do is not tell people about this working \ncapital fund and we can sit around and divide money up all year long. \nThe offset here is not going to hurt the Department of Justice, in any \nfashion.\n  With respect to the conference success, I want to quote to you the \ninspector general's observations contained in the annual report: ``We \nare concerned that a successful decennial census could be jeopardized \nif the Bureau attempts to accomplish too much too soon.''\n  Now, we never had any hearings on the census on our side of the \nCapitol. The distinguished chairman, Mr. Rogers of Kentucky, over on \nthe House side did have deliberate hearings that went into the census \nbudget in detail, and the amounts offset in the Domenici-Hollings \namendment provide $67 billion that we came in on this particular \nappropriations over the House, which is $60 million above the current \nyear.\n  In reality, Mr. President, what we are doing is almost like \nconferees--we can see ahead down the road when we confer with our House \nfriends on a conference of committees to finalize the figure that we \nare going to reconcile this backwards.\n  What happens is that Senator Domenici has very wisely come and said \nwe should do a little of the reconciling at this particular point to \nsave an awfully important entity. We do not want to change this to any \nkind of block grant. We do not want to be cutting it back.\n  These lawyers--they are inspired. I commend the law schools of the \ncountry over for inspiring these young attorneys coming out to do good, \nto offer public service--with many of them wanting the experience and \nsaying, ``I will give a little bit of time now to the public. I will \nlearn and be able to better represent, and I will be doing some good \nfor the communities in which I live.'' So they come in there.\n  I think the average fee of any legal service lawyer--they are earning \naround $30,000 to $33,000 a year. No, that does not take these Ivy \nLeague boys who come and go into downtown Washington and downtown New \nYork who start out at $80,000 a year and everything else. That is not \nthe case. We are not enriching any lawyer. We are enriching society.\n  This amendment is well conceived. The offsets, I can say, will never \ncause injury. On the contrary, what is still left is over and above the \nHouse side. Even though our budget, our 602(b) allocation was $1 \nbillion below the House, we still come in $750 million above the House \nwith these particular offsets. We are in good, strong shape. I think \nthe Senator from Texas would want to join us in this amendment.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes as \nthe chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, the \nauthorizing committee for the Legal Services Corporation, to express \nstrong support for the Domenici-Hollings amendment.\n  I want to say why I do so. We have had an extensive hearing in the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee. We heard from witnesses on both \nsides of the issue. I have introduced legislation in the Senate as a \ncompanion measure to the McCollum-Stenholm bill that is under \nconsideration in the House. We will soon be marking up this legislation \nin the Labor Committee.\n  As Senator Domenici pointed out quite correctly, the language in the \nDomenici-Hollings amendment is agreed to by some and not by others. It \nis language that returns the Legal Services Corporation to its original \nmission. It is language that reforms the program in a way that restores \nit to what it was supposed to be when the legislation was passed and \nbecame law.\n  The most important part of this amendment is that it restores funding \nfor the Legal Services Corporation. That point has already been well \nmade by Senator Domenici and Senator Hollings. As Senator Domenici also \nnoted, this amendment has important reforms and tight restrictions on \npermissible activities. I would just like to reiterate those, if I may, \nvery briefly. In terms of operational reforms:\n\n  Frist, a competitive bidding system will be required for awarding LSC \ngrants based on quality and cost effectiveness of service; second, the \ngoverning board of LSC grantees will establish priorities for the types \nof cases to be handled. thrid, the LSC grantees will be required to \nkeep time sheets identifying the client and matter under consideration; \nfourth, LSC grantees will be restricted in their use of non-LSC funds. \nand fifth, finally, there are new safeguards requiring the \nidentification by name of plaintiffs and statement of facts underlying \nthe case before initiating litigation or settlement negotiations.\n  On the restrictions side, Legal Services grantees: May not lobby for \npassage or defeat of legislation, may not represent illegal aliens, may \nnot participate in training programs and political activities, may not \ntake redistricting cases, may not participate in abortion litigation, \nmay not participate in class actions, may not challenge welfare reform, \nmay not defend tenants evicted from public house projects because of \ndrug dealing, may not take fee-generating cases, and may not solicit \nclients.\n  These are all very important restrictions. Some, as Senator Domenici \npointed out, were far too restrictive for \n\n[[Page S 14590]]\nsome of our colleagues. Nevertheless, I believe these restrictions \nprovide the necessary guidance to take Legal Services back to its \nprimary mission, which is providing assistance to those who need legal \nrepresentation and cannot afford it.\n  It is very important that low income individuals have the same access \nas anyone else to the legal system. But it seems to me, over the years, \nthe Legal Services Corporation has gone far beyond its initial mandate \nwhen the law was passed under President Nixon's leadership.\n  So, for all of those reasons, I strongly support and have high regard \nfor the legislation that has been put forward as an amendment by \nSenator Domenici and Senator Hollings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is correct, is it not, that the competitive bidding \nof grants is in this amendment? You stated it as being part of your new \nreauthorizing, but you have noted it is in this amendment also, is that \nnot correct?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. That is right, the competitive bidding is based on \nquality and cost effectiveness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there are an awful lot of points to make in \nopposition to this amendment. Let me begin by saying it is very \ninteresting that those who came here today to defend the Legal Services \nCorporation refuse to defend it. The best they can do in the way of \ndefense is to give us a list of outrageous abuses that they propose \nthat we try to stop. That is a very weak defense indeed.\n  But I do not want to begin by talking about legal services, and going \nthrough the list of numerous organizations who support the committee's \nposition and strongly oppose the Domenici position to bring back a \nFederal Legal Services Corporation. There are really several issues in \ndebate here, and the one I want to begin with is about the choices that \nare made to allow Senator Domenici to fund the Legal Services \nCorporation at $340 million.\n  Our dear colleague from South Carolina glosses over those decisions \nby simply saying that we are providing a lot of money to fight violent \ncrime and drugs, and so taking some of that money away from that battle \nin order to fund legal services is probably a good thing. This is one \nof those occasions where I wish we could sit around the kitchen table \nof every working family in America and discuss this issue. If we could, \nthis amendment, and probably those who advocate it, would be thrown out \nof the kitchen. But let me go through the programs that are cut by the \nDomenici amendment, and their ramifications.\n  Because our colleagues are so desirous of preserving the Legal \nServices Corporation as a Federal entity, many of them, who have stood \non the floor of the Senate and argued for block granting decisionmaking \nback to the States when it served their purpose, now oppose letting \nStates run a program which is a renegade program, which has abuses that \nprobably equal or exceed that of any other similar Government program \nfunded in the modern era by our Government. But let me start by going \nthrough what is being cut, what is being denied to the American people \nto provide $340 million to legal services. And then I will try to talk \nabout why legal services does not deserve the $340 million.\n  First of all, the Domenici amendment cuts the general legal \nactivities of the Justice Department by $25,131,000. In listening to \nSenator Hollings, you get the idea we are just throwing so much money \nat the Justice Department they do not know what to do with it, they \nhave all the prosecutors they need to prosecute every drug dealer and \nevery violent criminal in America. The only problem with that argument \nis the American people know that does not reflect reality.\n  In fact, our bill, which Senator Domenici cuts from, already provides \n$10 million below the level requested by President Clinton in his \nproposed appropriation for the Justice Department. So, before we would \ncut the $25 million from the legal activities section of the Justice \nDepartment, as Senator Domenici proposes, we already, because of lack \nof funds, had cut it by $10 million.\n  Where is this money coming from? Since the average person in America \ndoes not understand what the general legal activities of the Justice \nDepartment does, here is what it does.\n  It prosecutes organized criminals, it prosecutes major drug \ntraffickers, it prosecutes child pornographers, it prosecutes major \nfraud against the taxpayer, it prosecutes terrorism and espionage \ncases. These cuts will mean that we will have 200 fewer prosecutors in \nAmerica next year, if this amendment passes, who will be prosecuting \norganized crime, major drug traffickers, child pornographers, major \nfraud against the taxpayer, and terrorism and espionage cases.\n  I remind my colleagues, we are already providing $10 million less \nthan what the President has requested. But the Domenici amendment would \nfurther cut the level of funding for those prosecutors to prosecute \norganized crime, major drug traffickers, child pornographers, and fraud \nagainst the taxpayer, terrorism and espionage by another $25 million.\n  Legislating is about choosing. And what the Domenici amendment says \nis a federally run Legal Services Corporation, a program that is so \nfilled with outrageous actions that even in this amendment Senator \nDomenici seeks to curb their abuses--the Domenici amendment says that \nfunding that Federal program is more important than providing \nprosecutors to prosecute organized crime and the other crimes that I \nhave outlined.\n  The second cut made by the Domenici amendment, in order to fund legal \nservices, is cutting $11 million from the U.S. attorneys office.\n  I remind my colleagues, and the American people who might be watching \nthis debate, that our U.S. attorneys are our first line of defense. \nThey are the people who try cases in Federal court. They are the people \nwho prosecute major drug dealers. The amendment that is offered by \nSenator Domenici, to preserve the Federal Legal Services Corporation, \nwill terminate at least 55 assistant U.S. attorneys who otherwise would \nhave been employed in prosecuting violent criminals and drug felons, \npornographers, and terrorists.\n  I believe that legislating means making choices. I ask my colleagues, \nis preserving the Federal Legal Services Corporation rather than \nletting the States run it through a block grant program worth taking 55 \nassistant U.S. attorneys out of prosecution in America? My answer is \nno.\n  We had a discussion about construction for the FBI. As I read the \namendment, what is being cut here is not crime labs, though I strongly \nsupport them, what is being cut is the very heart of new facilities \nconstruction at the FBI Academy. The Domenici amendment, in the name of \npreserving a federally run Legal Services Corporation, a corporation \nwhich as of today has filed a lawsuit against every State in the Union \nthat is trying to implement welfare reform by requiring welfare \nrecipients to work, which is funding drug dealers who are trying to \nstay in public housing units so that they can more efficiently market \ndrugs, in seeking the preservation of this Federal program, the \nDomenici amendment would require cutting the FBI Academy and its \nconstruction at Quantico by some $49 million.\n  I have a letter from the head of the FBI. Unfortunately, as Senator \nHollings noted, it is a classified letter. But it is certainly not \nclassified material that the head of the FBI has said that our \nfacilities are becoming antiquated; that as we have cut the President's \nrequest for the FBI in recent years, we have not kept up our \ninfrastructure and that we are not going to be able to maintain our \ntraining if we do not build new facilities. I remind my colleagues that \nby a vote of 91 to 8, we passed the Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention \nAct, which authorized the expenditure of these moneys. I remind my \ncolleagues that the FBI Academy does not just train FBI agents and \nFederal law enforcement officials, but in fact, last year, it trained \n1,225 State and local law enforcement officials.\n  Obviously, the question that we have to ask is this: Is preserving \nthe Federal Legal Services Corporation rather than \n\n[[Page S 14591]]\nblock granting it to the States--as we are block granting aid to \nfamilies with dependent children, as we are block granting Medicaid--is \npreserving this program as a Federal program run out of Washington, DC, \nworth denying the facilities we need in Quantico to train FBI agents \nand to train 1,225 State and local law enforcement officials?\n  Mr. President, my answer to that question is clearly no. Anyone who \nhas found themselves in the jurisdiction of a Federal court knows that \nwe have a real problem in the Federal court system because it is very \ndifficult to get a case to trial.\n  In terms of getting civil justice, we are now talking about years of \nwaiting to get a case before the court. In terms of criminal justice, \nin bringing violent criminals to justice, we are talking about a long \nwait because we do not have enough courts, we do not have enough \njudges, and we do not have enough prosecutors.\n  The Domenici amendment, in order to preserve a federally run Legal \nServices Corporation--which is opposed by every organization in America \nfrom the Farm Bureau Federation to Citizens Against Government Waste--\nwould cut $25 million from our Federal courts. That $25 million, for \nexample, could fund 400 probation officers to supervise convicted \ncriminals in America.\n  I ask my colleagues, is it worth denying 400 probation officers \nsupervising criminals in order to fund the Federal Legal Services \nCorporation? My answer is no. Let me remind my colleagues that the \nfunds that would be cut include funds that provide mandatory drug \ntesting for all convicts who are released to assure that while they are \non parole and on the streets, they remain drug free. Is a cut in \nfunding for this program worth making to preserve a federally funded \nLegal Services Corporation? My answer is no.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of other programs that have been cut \nhere. Strong cases can be made for them. I want to make one more case. \nIt is not a case that is going to sway anybody because if you are not \nswayed by these other cuts, then you are not going to be swayed by \nthis. If you have long ago decided that this agency we call Legal \nServices, which has such a poor record that not even those who would \nfund it can defend it, then no amount of prosecutors, no amount of \ntraining police officers, no amount of drug testing for convicted \nfelons who are walking the streets on probation, no amount of \nsupervision is going to change your position.\n  But I do want to mention one other offset which very few people find \nmoving, but I think it is important; that is, substantial cuts in \ncensus are included in this offset. Most people do not understand the \ncensus. It is obvious that Alan Greenspan understands the census \nbecause Alan Greenspan, in testimony before the Banking Committee, \nasked that we fully fund data gathering. The apportionment of \npopulation in terms of measuring the number of people in America to \ndecide how many Congressman each State has depends on the census.\n  The allocation of funding for programs, from the FBI to the new \nMedicaid Program to virtually every other program undertaken by the \nFederal Government, depends on the census. We are getting ready to have \nthe 2,000 census, the millennium census. It is the only millennium \ncensus that we are ever guaranteed to take in the United States of \nAmerica. I hope it will be the first of many. But this is a critically \nimportant census.\n  If we take the recommendations of Senator Domenici and we cut funding \nfor this census, we are going to have to make the funding up in future \nyears as we get closer to the year 2000. If we make this cut now, the \n2000 census will be more inefficient. It is going to cost more money. \nAnd I do not believe that this is an exchange that should be made.\n  Let me talk about the amendment itself, and then turn to the Legal \nServices Corporation.\n  It is interesting to me that this amendment has a great big budget \ngimmick in it. And the great big budget gimmick in it is that it has a \ndelayed obligation. For those who do not understand what that means, \nlet me try to explain. One of the things some people often do in \nCongress when they want to spend money but do not want people to know \nthat they are spending money is to use a delayed obligation, which \nmeans they provide money but do not let the money kick in at the \nbeginning of the fiscal year. In this case, the money would kick in a \nmonth from the end of the fiscal year, on September 1, so that there is \na huge surge of $115 million that would become available on that date, \n30 days before next year's budget would have to be written.\n  Now, what is the purpose of this budget gimmick? The purpose of this \nbudget gimmick is not only to commit a huge surge of contracts for \nlegal services a month before the new budget, but it also makes it \ndifficult next year for us not to fund those programs because they will \nalready be underway, and so when the chairman of this subcommittee next \nyear writes a budget, that chairman will be looking at $115 million of \nprograms that will kick in just 30 days before the end of the fiscal \nyear.\n  What is the purpose of this gimmick which we have denounced over and \nover and over again? I have heard many Members of the Senate stand up \nand denounce these delayed obligations as basically perverting the \nbudget process itself.\n  What is the purpose of this? The purpose of this is basically to try \nto get the level of spending in this program up at the end of the year \nso that next year it will be harder to achieve the savings to which we \nhave already committed in trying to achieve our balanced budget.\n  Let me talk about legal services, and I want to begin by asking \nunanimous consent that letters from the Citizens Against Government \nWaste in opposition to any attempt to restore or increase funds to the \nLegal Services Corporation, the Christian Coalition, the American Farm \nBureau, the Family Research Council, the Traditional Values Coalition, \nthe Coalition for America, the Eagle Forum, that these letters strongly \nopposing the Domenici amendment and supporting the action of the \ncommittee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Letters in Opposition to the Legal Services Corporation\n\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The Council for Citizens Against Government \n     Waste (CCAGW) and our 600,000 members support H.R. 2076, the \n     Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations \n     for FY 1996. CCAGW commends Subcommittee Chairman Phil Gramm \n     and Appropriations Chairman Mark Hatfield for sending to the \n     floor a bill which spends $4.6 billion less than the budget \n     request and $1 billion less than the House version of H.R. \n     2076.\n       The $26.5 billion spending bill prioritizes the budgets for \n     each agency under its jurisdiction. For example, the Justice \n     Department receives $15 billion for FY 1996, almost $3 \n     billion more than in FY 1995, to fight our nation's crime \n     problem. But with a nearly $5 trillion national debt, there \n     is always more to cut from spending bills.\n       CCAGW supports the following amendments:\n       The McCain amendment to mandate the Federal Communications \n     Commission to auction the one remaining block of Direct \n     Broadcast System spectrum. If this spectrum is auctioned, \n     communication industry experts believe it will sell for \n     between $300 to $700 million.

On \n     behalf of the 1.7 million members and supporters of the \n     Christian Coalition, I urge you to vote against any \n     amendments that would weaken the committee-approved provision \n     regarding the block grant for Legal Services Corporation \n     (LSC).\n       LSC is a failed agency. Elimination of the Corporation and \n     instead providing legal services to the poor through block \n     grants to the States, as the Appropriations Committee \n     approved, is the minimum that Congress can do to begin to put \n     an end to the well known abuses of the Corporation. The block \n     grant alternative provides a better delivery system for legal \n     services to the poor and breaks up the monopoly currently \n     enjoyed by the Corporation.\n       Christian Coalition opposes any amendments that would \n     restore the Corporation, increase funding or in any way water \n     down the restrictions currently provided for in the bill. \n     Before the 1996 election, Christian Coalition will distribute \n     50-60 million voter guides and congressional scorecards. \n     Weakening amendments regarding LSC will be key votes.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Brian C.

Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: In a very short time, the Senate will \n     consider H.R. 2076, the Commerce, Justice, State \n     Appropriations bills, as amended by the Senate Commerce, \n     Justice, State Appropriations subcommittee. The portions of \n     this bill which pertain to delivery of legal services for the \n     indigent will create an entirely new program for this \n     purpose. This program is designed to function, much like \n     public defender programs which provide legal representation \n     for indigent criminal defendants. We believe this program \n     will meet the goal of ensuring civil legal assistance for the \n     poor without the many problems which have plagued the Legal \n     Services Corporation since its inception in 1974. With \n     specific respect to the delivery of legal aid to the \n     indigent, we urge you to support H.R. 2076 as reported by the \n     Appropriations Committee.\n       The operative provisions of H.R. 2076 with respect to legal \n     services were modeled on a bill introduced by Rep. George \n     Gekas (R-PA) and recently reported to the House by the \n     Judiciary Committee. This legislation was carefully crafted \n     to ensure that the federal program would finance \n     representation for causes of action for which there is no \n     other provision for payment of attorney's fees, or where it \n     is highly unlikely that the ``target'' would have resources \n     with which to pay attorney's fees. Thus, the bill did permit \n     grantee attorneys to pursue ``deadbeat dad'' cases, but not \n     employment law cases (because most employment discrimination \n     and other types of employment laws provide for the recovery \n     of attorney's fees for a successful plaintiff). We urge you \n     to oppose any effort to add to the bill provisions allowing \n     causes related to employment law, constitutional challenges, \n     and consumer fraud.\n       We believe the Gekas legal services bill, as included in \n     H.R. 2076, will create a federal program that will provide \n     basic legal services for indigent people.\n                                                    Dean Kleckner,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Family Research Council,\n\n                                               September 14, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than 250,000 families \n     which the Family Research Council represents, I would like to \n     urge you to expedite the intent of the House-passed budget \n     resolution by declining to reauthorize the Legal Services \n     Corporation (LSC). Reform of the Corporation is not an \n     acceptable option due to the fact that it has not been \n     successful within the last fifteen years, particularly since \n     liberal activists who favor a militant agenda have been \n     charged with the oversight of the program. Past experiences \n     have shown that merely adding restrictions to the program is \n     a futile gesture.\n       The LSC was created to perform legal services for the poor \n     and the underprivileged, yet the liberal agenda of its \n     proponents has overtaken for its original mission. The \n     antifamily litigation that the LSC supports is appalling. We \n     have found cases where LSC has litigated with a pro-abortion \n     agenda, they have been active in blocking attempts to reform \n     welfare, aiding the homosexual agenda, supporting the notion \n     that children have rights independent of their parents, and \n     representing convicted criminals in civil cases.\n       The Legal Services Act, as amended in 1977 and in \n     subsequent appropriations acts, prohibit LSC from being \n     involved in abortion related cases. Nonetheless, LSC has \n     remained firmly committed to abortion on demand and has \n     worked around the law in an attempt to secure unlimited \n     taxpayer-funded abortions. LSC has worked against waiting \n     periods, physicians' consent, parental consent, parental \n     notification and spousal notification. This blatant disregard \n     for the congressional intent is another facet in the argument \n     to not reappropriate.\n       Attempts to reform LSC have failed and it should be \n     abolished. During consideration of the Commerce-Justice-State \n     Appropriations bill, the Appropriations Committee passed a \n     compromise proposal that provides $210 million for state \n     level legal assistance in FY 1996. While we believe that \n     these funds would be better dedicated to deficit reduction, \n     we can accept the Committee's action. I strongly urge you to \n     oppose any effort that may be made to undermine the \n     Committee's proposal through the amendment process, including \n     efforts to restore funding for the fatally flawed Legal \n     Services Corporation.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                    Gary L. Bauer,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Christian Coalition et al.,\n\n                                               September 14, 1995.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate will soon be voting on the \n     Commerce, Justice State and Judiciary Appropriations bill. \n     The subcommittee bill includes a proposal to provide legal \n     services to the poor through a state administered grant \n     structure, rather than through the Legal Services \n     Corporation.\n       On behalf of the millions of members of our collective \n     organizations, we strongly urge you to vote in favor of the \n     state grant proposal. Here are several strong reasons to \n     support a state grant rather than the Legal Services \n     Corporation:\n       There is accountability. Attorneys are required to keep \n     time records. These records are subject to audit. Currently, \n     Legal Services Corporation grantees are accountable to no \n     one--no time records, no audits. That leads to mischief.\n       Attorneys will receive funds after they perform legal \n     services, not before. Currently, Legal Services Corporation \n     grantees receive a pot of money up front, and spend it as \n     they see fit without accountability. That lead to mischief.\n       The state grant proposal breaks up the Legal Services \n     monopoly. It enables attorneys and law firms all across \n     America to openly compete for legal services contracts. If \n     ever there was a case for open competition and against a \n     monopoly, this is it. The Legal Services Corporation has not \n     credibility when it comes to being wise stewards of the \n     taxpayer's money.\n       The state grant proposal restricts the legal causes of \n     action for which taxpayer funds can be used to a specified \n     list of noncontroversial legal needs such as bankruptcy \n     actions and cases of spousal abuse. There would be no more \n     taxpayer funded lawsuits related to abortion, labor strikes, \n     etc.\n       Restrictions to prohibit mischief are included. There would \n     be no more taxpayer-funded lobbying, grass roots organizing, \n     class action lawsuits, etc.\n       We strongly urge you to vote against any amendments to \n     strip out the bill's state grant proposal for legal services. \n     Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christian Coalition,\n     Family Research Council,\n     Traditional Values Coalition,\n     Eagle Forum,\n     Concerned Women for America,\n     American Family Association,\n     Life Advocacy Alliance.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Coalitions for America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Office of the Majority Leader,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Office of the Speaker,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Bob and Newt: In the budget-cutting atmosphere on \n     Capitol Hill these days, it is important not to overlook the \n     Legal Services Corporation. Here the need is not merely to \n     cut some of its programs, reduce its budget or to try yet \n     again to reform it, but rather to eliminate it entirely. This \n     year, President Clinton has proposed $415 million for the \n     Legal Services Corporation budget. That amount, however \n     significant, pales in comparison to the trouble and expense \n     this agency causes.\n       The agency charged with providing legal services for those \n     who could not afford to pay for them instead because a hotbed \n     of judges and legal activities who used their authority to \n     interpret the law to fit their personal ideology. The Legal \n     Services Corporation has an agenda that includes providing \n     benefits for illegal aliens, alcohol and drug addicts, and \n     criminals. It accomplishes this task by suing any and all \n     levels of government to prevent them from putting the brakes \n     on any kind of welfare spending, and indeed to increase \n     welfare benefits whenever and wherever it can do so.\n       Here are some examples of the Legal Services Corporation at \n     work:\n       In 1992, Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services won \n     disability benefits for a 40-year old heroin addict by \n     making the case that his addiction kept him from being \n     able to work.\n       In North Carolina, an LSC grantee stopped the eviction from \n     a public housing unit of a tenant who had shot and killed a \n     child in the complex.\n\n[[Page S 14593]]\n\n       The LSC has blocked eviction of drug dealers from public \n     housing units on technicalities such as the charges being \n     ``too vague.''\n       In Virginia, a public housing tenant who had acted in a \n     violent and dangerous manner won her case with aid from LSC \n     because some minor mistakes were made in the attempted \n     eviction.\n       In addition, the LSC has blocked efforts by states to \n     establish paternity for child support payments, opposed \n     Medicaid program cuts, and demanded that criminals in mental \n     health facilities be granted the right to vote.\n       In short, the Legal Services Corporation has sought to \n     subvert every federal, state or local effort to penalize, \n     restrict, reform or otherwise hold accountable an individual \n     for his or her behavior. Measured by the exact nature of its \n     ``legal services,'' it has been estimated that the true cost \n     of the Legal Services Corporation since its founding has been \n     some two trillion dollars, with no end in sight.\n       We understand that in normal Congressional politics it is \n     easier to reduce an agency's funding than to eliminate \n     entirely both the funding and the agency. In this case, \n     however, no other solution will do. The Legal Services \n     Corporation is wholly bad, and if now, in the time of a \n     Republican majority in both Houses of Congress, it is merely \n     reduced, it will certainly spring back to life later with \n     greater vigor. It must be killed, dead.\n       We stand ready and willing to work with the leadership of \n     both Houses in pursuing this objective, but we will accept no \n     lesser goal nor outcome. Quite simply, if the Legal Services \n     Corporation is not eliminated in this year's budget--funded \n     at zero--we cannot be credible in arguing to our members and \n     supporters that the Republican Party means that it says about \n     creating change in Washington.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Weyrich,\n                                                National Chairman.\n\n\n                     coalitions for america members\n\n       Morton C.

Mr. President, I think it would be useful for the American \npeople to get some idea what the Legal Services Corporation is doing. \nThe Heritage Foundation has put together a list of lawsuits that \ndescribe the horror stories that have come into existence as a result \nof the Legal Services Corporation and its actions. Let me just read the \nfirst one, but I am going to ask that all of these be put in the \nRecord. The first one is a Georgia Legal Services lawsuit June 15, \n1995. Here is a short summary.\n  The Legal Services Corporation defended a Miss Whitehead from \neviction after crack cocaine was found in her apartment, arguing that \nshe had not violated her lease because she was not present at the time \nthe search warrant was executed.\n  I have page after page after page of these horror stories, and let me \nturn to the last page. Here is a lawsuit--I will just pick the second \none on the page. The Legal Services Corporation sued to obtain \nunemployment benefits for a teacher fired for drug possession, arguing \nthat the teacher had not lost his job through misconduct.\n  I am perfectly aware--and I do not want anybody to be confused--that \nSenator Domenici has nothing like the restrictions on legal services \nthat I would impose in the committee bill, but he cannot stand here and \ndefend the Legal Services Corporation, and instead he has proposed \nlimiting actions they can take.\n  I should like to remind my colleagues that this is the same Legal \nServices Corporation that President Reagan was not able to rein in as a \nFederal program. I am hopeful that if the amendment is successful, \nwhich I hope it will not be, we can at least enforce some of these \nrestrictions.\n  I also can go through other examples of Legal Services misconduct. \nLet me just pick one here on agriculture because the American Farm \nBureau very strongly opposes this amendment. This is a lawsuit filed by \nthe Legal Services Corporation on June 23, 1995. All these examples are \nfrom this year or last year. You do not have to go back 20 years to \nfind horror stories.\n  The Legal Services Corporation sued a tomato farmer, the neighbor who \nrented the labor camp to the farmer, their crew leaders, and the tomato \npacking company when a farm worker got injured while reaching under a \nmoving truck at a labor camp.\n  Every day in America the Legal Services Corporation is hassling \nAmerican agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this very short, concise \nlist of abuses, most of which occurred in 1994 and 1995, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      LSC LITIGATION HORROR STORIES                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       LSC grantee and source                    Description            \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        \n                       DEFENDING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY                      \n                                                                        \n   Legal Services Corporation litigation has prevented public housing   \n  authorities from evicting drug dealers in Georgia, New York, Florida, \n  and Connecticut.

Finally, \n  one LSC grantee even contested the eviction of a tenant whose son had \n    shot and killed a child living in a neighboring apartment in the    \n  complex.

Mr. President, I also have another letter by a former \nLegal Service Corporation president, Terry Wear, explaining why in his \nexperienced opinion the Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed \nand should either be turned over to the States or be eliminated \nentirely. Frankly, he recommends that it be eliminated. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this comprehensive letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Law Offices of Terrance J. Wear,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n     Senator Phil Gramm,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: My purpose in writing is to outline \n     some of the problems that I encountered during my tenure as \n     President of the Legal Services Corporation during portions \n     of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, and to comment on S. \n     1221, the Senate companion bill (introduced by Senators \n     Kassebaum and Jeffords) to HR 1806, the McCollum-Stenholm \n     legal services bill.\n       By way of background, the federally funded component of the \n     legal services program is one of Lyndon Johnson's poverty \n     programs, having originated in the Office of Economic \n     Opportunity in the Johnson Administration's Department of \n     Health, Education & Welfare. The program was taken out of HEW \n     in 1974, and set up in a free standing non-profit corporation \n     similar in structure to that of the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting.\n       The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) now disburses \n     approximately $400 million annually in taxpayer funds, in the \n     form of grants to local legal services providers, which in \n     turn use these funds to hire full-time lawyers, who in turn \n     provide civil legal services to eligible poor persons. Over \n     the last fifteen years, the existing grantees have been able \n     to insulate themselves from competition for these grants, and \n     the same grantees now receive the monies year after year.\n       The President nominates candidates to the Corporation's 11-\n     member Board of Directors, and these nominees are subject to \n     Senate confirmation. Other than that, the President (and the \n     Executive Branch) has no control over the actions of the \n     corporation, its Board of Directors, or its approximately 320 \n     grantee legal services providers.\n       Some believe that the LSC, and the federal component of the \n     legal services program, was structured this way purposely; so \n     no one (other than the local legal services grantees) could \n     control which cases they handle. The grantee providers pick \n     and choose the specific cases they handle, in order to \n     ``raise the consciousness'' of the persons being sued, as \n     well as the communities in which these persons reside. They \n     sue to ``strike a blow'' for a favorite cause, or to create \n     legal precedents that they believe are ``favorable'' to poor \n     persons as a class, rather than to the individual poor client \n     whose name appears on the court pleadings. Cases are pursued \n     for purposes of setting these kinds of legal precedents, even \n     when such action is not in the best interest of the client \n     being represented. (See e.g., ``War on the Poor,'' National \n     Review, May 15, 1995; pp. 32-44.)\n       Often, these programs refuse to serve poor persons with \n     ``run of the mill'' or ``mundane'' legal problems; preferring \n     to concentrate on the ``sexy,'' ``snazzy,'' or ``high \n     profile'' cases that promote their view of ``how society \n     should be.'' Let me cite just one example: A legal services \n     program in Washington state refused to help a poor single \n     mother (and her three children) with a landlord-tenant \n     problem (and the woman lost her rental unit as a result), \n     because the program was ``too busy'' with other matters.\n       The ``other matters'' that the program chose to handle at \n     the time this woman was seeking legal assistance included:\n       Helping an alcoholic father, who claimed he was unable to \n     work because of his ``disability,'' avoid paying child \n     support for his children;\n       Preventing a public housing authority from evicting two \n     tenants who had not disclosed their prior criminal histories \n     in their rental applications, as they were required to do; \n     and \n\n[[Page S 14596]]\n\n       Obtaining a nationwide permanent injunction blocking \n     federal reductions in the cash and medical welfare benefits \n     given to newly arrived refugees.\n       These examples clearly demonstrate the desire of many legal \n     services programs to handle the ``high profile'' cases, in \n     which they can ``strike a blow'' for a particular cause, at \n     the expense of individual poor persons with ``mundane'' legal \n     problems.\n       The ``housing authority'' example deserves further \n     examination: Oftentimes, legal services programs try to block \n     the eviction of known drug dealers from public housing units; \n     effectively allowing these people to ply their trade for \n     these housing units, and effectively putting the other \n     tenants (and their children) into a drug war ``free fire \n     zone.'' Under the existing legal services system, there is \n     nothing anyone can do to prevent these government-funded \n     lawyers from doing these things, regardless of the suffering \n     they inflict on the innocent families who live in these \n     housing units.\n       There are dozens of other examples of legal services \n     lawyers inducing or aiding and abetting conduct that is self-\n     destructive. Space does not permit me to mention them all, \n     but some of the most egregious examples include:\n       Several legal services programs routinely advise poor \n     parents to get a divorce, and poor non-abused teenagers to \n     set up households of their own, all for purposes of \n     maximizing the total amount of welfare payments that the \n     group can obtain.\n       Other legal services programs work to obtain federal \n     disability payments (amounting to hundreds of dollars per \n     month) for alcoholics and drug addicts, who then use these \n     funds to ``feed'' their self-destructive habits.\n       A legal services program obtained government disability \n     payments for a convicted burglar; using as the basis for his \n     claim the injuries the burglar sustained during the course of \n     committing his crime.\n       Another legal services program helped a convicted rapist \n     get custody of the child he sired as a result of the rape, \n     even though a psychologist testified that the rapist was \n     likely to harm the child.\n       Lastly, a legal services program employee being paid by the \n     U.S. taxpayers used his position to organize civil unrest in \n     New York's Attica Prison, in order to use this unrest to \n     ``commemorate'' the anniversary of the 1971 Attica Prison \n     riots, in which 43 inmates and guards were killed.\n       Based upon my experiences with the federal legal services \n     program, I do not believe the current program is salvageable; \n     consequently, it should be ended now. Some Members of \n     Congress, such as Congressman McCollum, have suggested that \n     the corporation and the current program should be continued, \n     with restrictions placed on what the legal services lawyers \n     could do, the kinds of cases they could handle, etc. This \n     approach does not take into account the history of the \n     program, and the past failed attempts to do the very same \n     thing. Let me mention some examples:\n       When the federal legal services program was set up under \n     the corporation in 1974, restrictions were written into the \n     statute saying that legal services lawyers could not engage \n     in political activities; or handle abortion \n     cases, desegregation cases, etc. During the Reagan and \n     Bush Administrations, similar attempts were made to limit \n     the kinds of activities and cases that could be handled by \n     legal services personnel. These restrictions were \n     implemented through Appropriations Acts ``riders'' that \n     were added to the bills that funded the program.\n       Many of these restrictions were effectively circumvented by \n     the legal services lawyers; or were openly violated in the \n     case of the handling of abortion cases. The plain facts are \n     that the legal services activities are not interested in \n     having their activities restricted in any way; and will not \n     abide by the McCollum restrictions:\n       For example, certain legal services grantees handled \n     several abortion cases during my tenure as LSC President, and \n     refused to stop when I ordered them to do so. These programs \n     then used the money, which I had given them to help poor \n     people, to pay for a law suit to block imposition of the \n     discipline I imposed on them. They successfully stalled my \n     attempts to curtail their activities, even through they were \n     clearly in violation of the federal Legal Services \n     Corporation Act. These law suits dragged on for several \n     years, and were subsequently settled by one of my successors, \n     on condition that no disciplinary action be taken against \n     these programs.\n       In 1980, after completion of the national census, the legal \n     services programs spent over 28,000 hours and over $600,000 \n     in federal funds on Congressional redistricting activity. \n     Their purpose was to redistrict ``in'' those Members or \n     candidates who were sympathetic to the political and social \n     goals of these activists, and redistrict ``out'' those who \n     were not. During the 1980s, many legal services programs \n     tried to carry out this same sort of activity at the State \n     and local levels.\n       In 1989, I caused the corporation to enact a regulation \n     prohibiting the involvement of the legal services programs in \n     redistricting, as it was clearly ``political activity'' which \n     was forbidden under the Legal Services Corporation Act. I was \n     then promptly sued by three of the legal services programs \n     that I was funding. These programs used the money, which I \n     had given them to help poor people, to pay for a law suit to \n     keep me from enforcing this regulation; and successfully tied \n     up its enforcement for more than three years.\n       The Congress should not be fooled by the McCollum attempt \n     to reform the existing legal services program. There is no \n     reason to believe a new set of restrictions of the kind \n     proposed by Congressman McCollum (and Senators Kassebaum & \n     Jeffords) will be any more effective than the earlier sets of \n     restrictions were. These activist lawyers will simply exploit \n     the ``loop holes'' in the McCollum restrictions, ignore them, \n     or file law suits to challenge those they do not like; and \n     the restrictions will be suspended for 4 or 5 years, while \n     these cases work their way through the courts. The activists \n     will use the courts to effectively gut any attempt to \n     regulate their behavior, and will ``wait the Congress out'' \n     until it gives up and goes on to other things.\n       This conclusion is particularly noteworthy, in light of the \n     announced intent, on the part of the legal services lawyers, \n     to make ``the road to welfare reform a legal obstacle \n     course'' for the Congress. In the April 1995 issue of the \n     American Bar Association (ABA) Journal (pp. 82-88), the \n     activists threw down the gauntlet to this Congress, by \n     outlining just how they intend to sue the legal system, and \n     the federal dollars they are given, to attack any effort to \n     reform the current welfare system.\n       I'm also heartened to note, however, that ending the \n     current legal services program will not end legal services \n     for the poor:\n       The Gekas legal services bill (H.R. 2277), as introduced, \n     provides for a transitional system of block grants to the \n     States, which will be used to fund legal services for poor \n     persons. I'm aware that you have incorporated this bill into \n     the Senate version of the State, Commerce, Justice \n     Appropriations bill, and that the Gekas bill will become law \n     if this appropriations bill is enacted.\n       Among other things, the grants authorized in the Gekas bill \n     will be awarded competitively; and, while existing grantees \n     will be eligible to compete for these grants, the grant \n     awarding process will not be ``stacked'' in their favor.\n       I believe viable grant candidates, who have no ``social'' \n     agenda but who are genuinely interested in helping individual \n     poor persons with their legal problems, will compete for \n     these grants; will win large numbers of them, and will do a \n     good job for their poor clients.\n       The Gekas bill will also pay grantees after they have \n     finished their work; rather than giving the grantees money up \n     front, as the McCollum bill would do. Under the Gekas \n     approach, if a grantee does things that are prohibited, the \n     grantee will not be paid for them, and its grant will be \n     terminated. This should be a particularly effective way to \n     ensure that taxpayers' funds are used only for the kinds of \n     activities permitted in the Gekas block grant program.\n       Even the liberal Washington Post agrees that downsizing of \n     the federal legal services program is inevitable, and that \n     the block grant approach in the Gekas bill will allow more of \n     the ordinary problems of poor people to be handled, leaving \n     the ``high profile'' cases of interest groups like the ACLU. \n     (See, Washington Post Editorial, September 18, 1995.)\n       Many of the current legal services programs receive \n     substantial funding from IOLTA (Interest on Lawyers' Trust \n     Accounts), private charities and endowment funds, the United \n     Way, and State and local governments. I'm advised that, in \n     1993, non-LSC funding for legal services amounted to $246 \n     million; as compared with $357 million in funding from the \n     federal government. Consequently, the two-year phase out of \n     the federal legal services program, as provided for in the \n     House Budget Resolution and in the Gekas legal services bill, \n     will not end legal services for the poor.\n       There also are approximately 900 legal aid programs that \n     are not affiliated with the federal legal services program; \n     these programs will help ``take up any slack'' that may \n     result from the termination of the federal portion of the \n     legal services program.\n       There also are other substantial private pro bono efforts \n     that are underway to aid poor persons. For example--\n       The American Bar Association has suggested to its 375,000 \n     members that they donate 50 hours per year of free legal \n     services to low-income people.\n       The New York City bar association recently raised $3 \n     million for its own legal services program, which provides \n     free legal services for indigent families, and others.\n       The Iowa State Bar Association has adopted a resolution \n     urging its members to donate ``a reasonable amount of time, \n     but in no event less than 20 hours per year'' to pro bono \n     legal activities.\n       These kinds of activities are underway in many states; and \n     will cushion the termination of federal funding for legal \n     services. Also, virtually all the states have formal or \n     informal systems under which lawyers in private practice \n     provide pro bono legal services to poor persons.\n       Whenever the Congress or the States attempt to revise any \n     ``poverty'' program; the proponents of the program rail about \n     ``mean-spirited attacks on the poor.'' These attacks are \n     usually the ``knee-jerk'' responses of people and \n     institutions with special interests to protect. In this \n     situation, it is not the poor who are complaining, but rather \n     the lawyers who benefit from the program. In fact, this \n     program has become a general welfare program for lawyers, \n     rather than one primarily benefiting poor people; and it is \n     the lawyers who are lobbying for its retention.\n       The ``knee-jerk'' responses about ``mean-spirited attacks \n     on the poor'' are usually \n\n[[Page S 14597]]\n     overstated; cases in point are the attacks that were levied on the \n     welfare reform programs instituted in the States of Michigan \n     and Wisconsin. When these reforms were proposed, there was a \n     great ``hue & cry'' about hurting the poor, but this has \n     proven not to be the case at all. I believe this earlier \n     pattern is being repeated here, and that the Legal Services \n     Corporation and its 320 grantees will not be missed when they \n     are gone.\n       It is interesting to note that there have been no ``poor \n     persons'' who have come forward to testify in any of the \n     Congressional hearings held on the legal services program. I \n     believe this is true, at least in part, because poor people \n     do not rank legal services as a high priority in their lives, \n     and do not believe the current program has been all that \n     helpful to them.\n       In fact, the lawyer-activists who have used the funds in \n     this program to promote their view of ``how society should \n     be;'' do so without regard to the effects of their actions on \n     the poor, i.e., the poor persons who must live next to the \n     drug dealer whom legal services has kept from being evicted. \n     These poor people have to live with the consequences of the \n     ``social experiments'' of these activists; and, I suspect, \n     are getting tired of them.\n       If someone must ``take the blame'' for the demise of the \n     Legal Services Corporation and the federal funding for its \n     grantees, it rightly must be the legal services activists who \n     have abused the program through their irresponsible behavior, \n     and their past refusal to accept common sense reform. The \n     facts speak for themselves; they clearly demonstrate that the \n     Legal Services Corporation and its grantees, at a minimum, \n     use federal monies for a lot of ``stupid'' things. The \n     current program is not susceptible to reform because of the \n     attitudes and behavior of the activists who receive these \n     federal funds; serves no useful purpose, and should be \n     terminated.\n       I hope these thoughts are helpful to you. I stand ready to \n     meet with you at any time if I can be of service to you as \n     you consider this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Terrance J. Wear.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am sure there will be others who want to \ndebate this amendment, and so let me summarize my arguments and then \nyield the floor so that we can continue the debate.\n  Legislating is about choosing. Legislating is about deciding what is \nworth doing and what is not worth doing. Although it sometimes appears \nthat the same laws of economics do not apply to the Federal Government \nthat apply to families and businesses. Every day families have to say \nno. Seldom does Government say no. One of the reasons that families \nhave to say no so often is because Government cannot; $1 out of every \n$4 earned by the average American family with two children now goes to \nWashington so that Government can say yes so often.\n  However, even in the Federal Government, we have to make choices. The \nDomenici amendment asks us to choose. It asks us to choose between \nfunding legal services and providing funds for the prosecution of \norganized crime, drug trafficking, child pornography, fraud against the \nGovernment, terrorism, and espionage. It asks us to choose between \nfunding the Legal Services Corporation over funding 55 U.S. attorneys \nand 55 support personnel that in each of the judicial districts in \nAmerica could use to make our streets safer, that could be prosecuting \npeople who have preyed on innocent men and women, who could be \nprosecuting people who are selling drugs at the door of every junior \nhigh school in America.\n  The Domenici amendment asks us to choose. It asks us to choose a \nfederally funded Legal Services Corporation over funding for an FBI \nAcademy at Quantico, VA, which is critically important to maintaining \nour ability to train 1,225 State and local police officers every year.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the highlight of a law enforcement \ncareer in America is coming to the FBI Academy. My proposal would allow \neach and every one of these 1,225 people, who are chosen because they \nare the finest America has in law enforcement, to come to the FBI \nAcademy, to be trained so they can go back and train other State and \nlocal law enforcement officials, in things that are critical--when to \nuse deadly force and when not to, how to exercise judgment, how to \ncarry out their function. They need this sort of training so that when \nsome brutal predator criminal kills one of our neighbors, we are able \nto apprehend them, convict them, and hopefully, if they are richly \ndeserving, put them to death.\n  And, Mr. President, this is not a priority that just I as a Member of \nthe Senate have set; 91 Members of the U.S. Senate, including the \nauthors of this amendment which would cut this program, voted for the \nComprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995, which authorized us to \nbegin to upgrade the infrastructure of the FBI Academy.\n  I do not believe that reasonable working Americans would choose to \nspend $49 million on the Legal Services Corporation over spending that \nmoney to upgrade the FBI Academy, thereby allowing us to train more and \nbetter law enforcement officials for America.\n  I do not believe, Mr. President, that the average working American \nfamily would support taking $25 million away from our Federal courts, \nmoney that could be spent on 400 probation officers to supervise \nconvicted felons who are walking the streets, in order to fund a \nFederal legal services program.\n  We all heard of this case--one of the cases, in fact, that President \nClinton ran a TV ad on--about a brutal murder that occurred. What he \ndid not tell us was that this brutal murderer had been convicted of a \nviolent crime, was in prison, had been released, and was being \nsupervised by a parole officer. He had to meet with the parole officer \nonce a year--once a year he had to show up for a meeting. And he went \nout and killed somebody. And the President tells us as a result of that \nwe ought to ban guns.\n  But the point is, we do not have so many probation officers that we \ncan simply afford a cut that would lead to 400 fewer.\n  This is a critically important area, and I urge my colleagues in \ntheir zeal to preserve the Legal Services Corporation as a Federal \nprogram to ask themselves, not would you want it if it were free, but \nare you willing to cut funding for the Federal judiciary by $25 million \nknowing that with $25 million we could fund 400 more probation \nofficers, that we could have funding that is needed for such programs \nas mandatory drug testing of criminals that are on release walking the \nstreets of America? Those are the choices that we have to make and \nthese are the questions we must ask.\n  Now, I have not gone into great lengths in talking about the Legal \nServices Corporation. Many of the areas that they are engaged in are \nthose in which the public perceives to be an abuse of power, whether \nyou are talking about suing every State in the Union that has tried to \nreform welfare--the provisions in our bill, in allocating a block grant \nto the States to provide legal services, have very, very stringent \nlimits that say, if you take any of this money for legal services, you \ncannot use it, nor any other money in this bill, to try to block \nwelfare reform in America.\n  The Domenici language is not as strong as our language in terms of \nlimiting the action or the use of legal services funding. It is a step \nin the right direction, but why not give this program back to the \nStates? What is it about this program, other than the political base \nthat it enjoys, that is so different from aid to families with \ndependent children? Can we trust the States with seeing that poor \npeople are fed cannot we trust the States to see that legal services \nare provided?\n  What is it about this program that makes it so different than \nMedicaid? I assume that those who support this amendment, at least some \nof them, will support block granting Medicaid. We called for it in our \nbudget and I assume we have the votes to do it. That has to do with \npeople's health, with their access to medical care. How is it that can \nwe trust the States to run Medicaid but yet we cannot trust them to \nadminister funds for legal services?\n  Well, let me say this, Mr. President. I believe the Legal Services \nCorporation is a renegade agency which has spent a tremendous amount of \nresources promoting a political agenda. I think the superstructure of \nthe agency which will be preserved by the Domenici amendment is engaged \nin an activity which is the right of every free citizen. Every free \ncitizen has a right to advocate their views, no matter how extreme \nsomeone else may feel they are. And I defend that right. But they do \nnot have the right to do it with taxpayers' money.\n  If they object to reforming welfare, let them run for the legislature \nand explain to people that they do not want welfare recipients to have \nto work. But \n\n[[Page S 14598]]\nthey should not be able to take taxpayer money to file those lawsuits.\n  If they believe that the Government ought to be involved in \nelections, or they believe the Government ought to be involved in other \nareas, let them get out and engage in the public policy debate, but not \nwith the taxpayers' money.\n  I do not believe that we are going to be able to solve these problems \nif we keep this infrastructure in place. I think that the only thing \nthat is going to change the focus of the Legal Services Corporation to \nthe legal needs of poor people is to eliminate the Federal \nsuperstructure, a superstructure and bureaucracy which has proven \nbeyond a shadow of a doubt that it has a social and political agenda. I \noppose its agenda. It has a right to an agenda, but not at the \ntaxpayers' expense.\n  I believe we can meet the legitimate legal needs of the poor by \nsetting up a block grant which was supported by the subcommittee and by \nthe full committee. That block grant will give the money back to States \nand, within the guidelines which will say that no entity taking this \nmoney can file lawsuits to block welfare reform, keep drug dealers in \npublic housing, or any of all the other things that this agency is \nfamous, or infamous, for. It would be administered by the States, with \ngreater supervision and control, where people in an area who are \noutraged about an action cannot just write their two Senators and their \none Congressman, but actually get the legislature and the Governor to \nmake a change.\n  Is that not logical reform? Is that not what the Contract With \nAmerica was about? Is that not what the party I represent stands for? I \nthink it is.\n  I think this is a clear-cut choice. And I want our colleagues to look \nvery closely at these offsets and understand the damage we are doing to \nlaw enforcement, to our anticrime and anti-violence efforts by \nproviding this funding level to the Legal Services Corporation. The \n$340 million that would be provided under the Domenici amendment is \ntaken away from programs that, not only in my opinion, but I would \nassert in the opinion of virtually any reasonable working American, are \nof much greater importance.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nlet me just respond to three or four of the Senator's points.\n  First of all, Mr. President, so everybody will understand, I will try \nto address a couple issues of the Senator from Texas with reference to \nwhat we are cutting.\n  It is interesting, when this side of the aisle, including my \nwonderful friend from Texas, when you are not really cutting something, \nbut merely reducing its growth, you like very much to tell everybody, \n``We're not really cutting, we're just reducing the growth.'' In \ndiscussing my chosen offsets for this amendment, he chooses to ignore \nthat. So let me give you a couple of examples. I think you ought to \nknow that if these examples strike home--and every one of the Senator's \nexamples is festered with the same problem, every one of them has the \nsame problem in terms of how they are attempting to mislead us.\n  First, let us talk a minute about the U.S. attorneys. The amendment \nthat we have funds the U.S. attorneys at $28 million above the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. Frankly, I do not believe the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives would be cutting U.S. attorneys knowing the \nsubcommittees over there and what their desires are about \ncrimefighting.\n  The U.S. attorneys, under this proposal, will increase $87 million. \nNo cut. U.S. attorneys in America will have a 10-percent increase. So \nwhatever the good Senator from Texas said, we are providing $87 million \nin new money for U.S. attorneys; not a cut, an increase.\n  Frankly, if you want to increase something in a committee so that you \ncan say you are the greatest crime-fighter in the world and one up \neverybody, then go ask the Justice Department, ``Well, if you don't get \nthat, how many are you going to lose?'' that is, in essence, every \nargument the Senator has made.\n  The truth of the matter is, there will be many, hundreds of new U.S. \nattorneys, even after we provide legal services for the poor.\n  Let me talk about the FBI. The discussion here sounds like this 1,225 \npeople from the hinterland that we train we are not going to be able to \ntrain because of the Domenici amendment. Absolutely untrue. They will \nall be trained, there is no question about it. So you can strike all \nthat talk. They will all receive education and training.\n  This proposal that is funded in the bill is the following: $52 \nmillion for some additions to their training center at Quantico. They \ndo not have a site yet, they do not have a plan yet, and the estimates \nare they will spend $5 million of the $52 million at the most this \nyear. All of it will be spent next year and the year after.\n  What is wrong with saying since you cannot spend it, since you do not \nhave a plan, is there anything wrong with saying, let us provide legal \nservices for the poor, if that is what it takes? Frankly, I do not \nbelieve, if the Director of the FBI was sitting across the table and \ntold about this, that he would stand up and say, ``I insist on $52 \nmillion that I don't need, that won't be spent until next year and \nbecause I want it so much, I would like no poor people to have any \nlegal services in America.'' Does anybody believe that?\n  Let me go on to just a couple more.\n  General legal activities. My good friend from Texas has made an \nargument about all these professionals they are going to lose. Under \nthe committee bill general legal activities is slated to increase by \n$13.4 million.\n  I could go on with each one of them. I have tried my very best to be \nas honest as I can about U.S. attorneys. They are going up \ndramatically, not coming down. FBI construction; the now named \ncandidates from around the country will be trained. We are just not \ngoing to put money in for a building they do not have a plan or site \nfor. We can do it next year if we find, indeed, they are prepared to \nallocate the funding.\n  My last point has to do with my good friend from Texas talking about \na budget gimmick. Frankly, Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, \nI do not let too many gimmicks get through, but they get through. Every \nappropriations bill has some kind of forward funding in it. In fact, I \nsuggest, and if my good friend from Texas would like me to pull the \nbill, I will, but I suggest it is way back in my recollection that the \nlast time he was ranking member for the HUD and NASA bill, that there \nwas over $1 billion forward funded in order for them to get a bill \nthrough.\n  Check the number. Maybe it is $850 million, but it is close to a \nbillion. And it was praised on the floor by my good friend from Texas.\n  But mine is not the gimmick he describes. As a matter of fact, we \nphased our funding because we want to encourage the Legal Services \nCorporation to implement a competitive bidding system for grants in a \ntimely manner. The first $225 million will be released in order for the \nCorporation to continue service. The additional money at the end is \ngoing to be used as incentive money to implement competition and to \nsupplement earlier funding for legal services.\n  Last but not least, Mr. President, I looked at all these letters my \ngood friend from Texas has submitted for the Record in opposition to my \namendment. I have copies of them now. I am about as close to the Farm \nBureau as anybody in this Senate. Frankly, if the Farm Bureau knew that \nthe Domenici prohibitions, which are similar to the House, were going \nto be adopted as part of the law, they would not write this letter. And \nthat is what it is going to be, because both bills prohibit the kind of \nactions that the farming community, and many others, are arguing about, \ncomplaining about the abuses, which I acknowledge. They would say, \n``Great, if you want to have legal services with these prohibitions, we \nare not against helping the poor.''\n  There is not a single one of these organizations who wants to go on \nrecord saying, ``We don't want any legal services for the poor of the \nUnited States.'' They do not want the abuses.\n  Why are we apt to stop the abuses this time when we never have \nbefore? I \n\n[[Page S 14599]]\nwill say it plain and simple. I do not intend to in any way antagonize \nmy Democratic friends, but the fact of the matter is, we never had a \nRepublican House, that is why we never got the prohibitions.\n  They are in the House bill. They put the prohibitions in. We are \ngoing to put them in. There will not be a Commerce, Justice bill \nwithout the prohibitions in, and there will be no funding for legal \nservices without the prohibitions. When you put all the prohibitions \nin, when you understand the nature of the reductions we had to make, I \nam sure many who listened to the Senator from Texas will take another \nlook. They will clearly decide that even the average working man that \nmy friend from Texas uses so wonderfully in talking about not wanting \nto pay taxes and they are the ones that are working and that they ought \nto get out and pull the wagon, that if you put an average working man \nor woman in a room and you say, ``If these abuses are not there and it \nis just providing an attorney for a poor person whose opponent has an \nattorney and they are desperately in need, average working man and \nwoman in America, would you like to say to those people, you get \nnothing, you go defend yourself, do away with legal services?'' Well, I \nwill take that issue to the average working men and women in this \ncountry, and I believe by an overwhelming majority they are decent \npeople and understand if you are in litigation, you have to have some \nhelp. If you are a poor person and getting sued, you are involved in a \nlandlord-tenant dispute, any of the thousands they handle--let me tell \nyou, they are handling, on an individual basis, huge numbers--\nthousands--if somebody knows, maybe they can insert it into the Record. \nThey have nothing to do with class actions.\n\n  My closing remark is if you are worried about the abuses, about class \naction, about suits against legislators or Governors, or welfare, those \nare gone in the Domenici amendment, finished, they are not around \nanymore.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me respond to the points Senator \nDomenici has made. First of all, the committee bill does not eliminate \nlegal services. It eliminates the Federal entity, the Federal \nbureaucracy, but gives funds to the States with stricter prohibitions \nthan the Domenici amendment, so that the funds can be used through \nState-run programs, without this overarching Federal bureaucracy and \nits political agenda, so that the funds available can truly go to help \npoor people with real legal needs.\n  So the suggestion that the alternative is the Domenici way or no way, \nsimply does not bear up under scrutiny.\n  Now, with regard to the gimmick used when we are talking about \nfunding, the question is not do we have more prosecutors than we had \nlast year after the Domenici cuts are made. The question is, Do we have \nmore prosecutors than we need? The point is, for example, in the \ngeneral legal activities of the Justice Department, we have provided \n$10 million less than Bill Clinton says we need to prosecute organized \ncrime and major drug traffickers and child pornography and major fraud \nagainst the taxpayer and terrorism and espionage. We have provided $10 \nmillion less than the President says we need. The Domenici amendment \nwould take away $25 million more, eliminating 200 prosecutors from the \nJustice Department. Now, those are 200 additional prosecutors who would \nhave been there were we not maintaining the Federal Legal Services \nCorporation.\n  That is the choice. Do you want them there or not? Senator Domenici \nsays, well, look, they were not there last year, were you not happy \nwithout them? No. The American people want more prosecutors. The \nAmerican people want to go after organized crime and drug traffickers \nand child pornographers and fraud against the taxpayers and terrorism \nand espionage. So the question is: Do you want 200 more prosecutors \ndoing these things, or do you want a Federal Legal Services \nCorporation? That is the question.\n  Senator Domenici says, well, you will end up with more U.S. attorneys \nunder the bill even with his cut. That is true, but it is not very \nrelevant. The point is, the American people want to grab criminals by \nthe throat and not let them go in order to get a better grip. The \nAmerican people, I believe, given a choice of spending $11 million so \nthey can have 55 more assistant U.S. attorneys and 55 more support \npersonnel to go after people selling drugs at every junior high school \nin America, I think given that option, they would choose to have them \nthere.\n  In terms of the FBI Academy, the argument made is that they do not \nneed new facilities. Well, everybody associated with the FBI says they \ndo. They say that the infrastructure is becoming antiquated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will yield, I did not say they did not \nneed it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I believe the Senator said they just will not be able to \nbuild a new facility as soon.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I said they cannot build it because they do not have a \nlocation or a plan, and they cannot spend the money.\n  Mr. GRAMM. All I know is that the head of the FBI asked me both in \ntestimony and in a letter, to provide the funds because he said it was \nneeded. I think the Senator is talking about the technical support \ncenter. I am talking about the FBI Academy. As I read the amendment, it \nis cutting the academy and not the technical support center.\n  In any case, our infrastructure and our effort to fight violent crime \nand drugs is getting old. When we had testimony before the \nsubcommittee, the head of the FBI said that one of his top priorities \nwas to try to upgrade the training facilities, which is desperately \nneeded. I think that is a priority item.\n  Look, it is a matter of choice. You may want a Federal Legal Services \nCorporation more than you want to modernize the training of the FBI \nAcademy. That is a perfectly legitimate choice. But it is a choice, \nthis is not a free amendment. This amendment will mean fewer \nprosecutors and fewer convictions. It will mean facilities that will \nnot be modernized as rapidly. It will mean a lower quality of training. \nIt will mean fewer people will get trained. That is the choice that you \nare making and it is not a choice that can be wished away.\n  Now, you can say, well, we still would be doing more than we were \ndoing last year. But the point is, we will not be doing as much as we \nare capable of doing.\n  In terms of the Farm Bureau, I would be happy to call in the Farm \nBureau and ask Senator Domenici, if they do not support his position, \nif they would rather do it my way, if he would pull his amendment down. \nMy feeling is that they would rather eliminate this Federal \nsuperstructure, which basically has, since the beginning of the Legal \nServices Corporation, pursued a political agenda, a political agenda \nthat we are trying to deal with right here in this very amendment. This \namendment is not as strong in dealing with this agenda as we are in the \ncommittee bill, which is why I want to preserve the committee bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the poorest \nof the poor of this land. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of \nthe first Americans of this land, the native American, the Indian.\n  In 1788, our forefathers, the elected representatives of the first \nnine States of this Union, gathered to ratify and adopt the \nConstitution of the United States. This noble document has served us \nfor over 200 years. In the first article of this great document is a \nprovision that recognizes the important role and the specific role \nplayed by the Federal Government of this United States to carry out \nobligations that we solemnly promised by treaty and by law. It also \nrecognizes the sovereignty of these people. These were proud people. \nThey numbered at that time in excess of 50 million in North America. \nToday, I am sorry to say they number less than 3 million. At the moment \nof the signing of the Constitution, these great people exercised \ndominion over 550 million acres of land, and we recognized and honored \nthat at that moment.\n  Today, the descendents of these Indians exercise dominion over 50 \nmillion acres of land. Because these Indians, who exercise dominion \nover all these lands--including the land on which we are standing at \nthis moment--we the \n\n[[Page S 14600]]\npeople of the United States, because of their granting of title to \nthese lands to us, promised by treaty that as long as the Sun rises in \nthe east and sets in the west, we will make certain that their lives \nwill never be placed in jeopardy, that we will provide them with \nshelter, health, and education.\n  I am sorry to say we have not lived up to these obligations. In fact, \nour predecessors, the U.S. Senators of the older days, were faced with \nthe ratification of 800 treaties. Of the 800 treaties, our predecessors \nfelt that 430 were not worthy of our consideration. These treaties were \nsigned by the President of the United States, or a proper \nrepresentative, and signed by the chiefs and great leaders of Indian \nlands.\n  We said, ``You give us this land, and we will provide you with \nhelp.'' Mr. President, 430 are still in the files. The reasons are very \nsimple. After these treaties were ratified and signed by the President \nand sent to the Senate, they found gold or they found oil or people \nwanted to settle on their lands. I am happy to say we did ratify some--\n370 of them.\n  History shows that we proceeded to violate provisions in every single \none of them. The reasons are easy. Whenever this Nation was confronted \nwith a choice of priorities--what is more important, U.S. attorneys or \nthe plight of the Indians--the Indians always came out at the end. It \nnever failed.\n  That is the history of the United States. So today, instead of owning \nthis land, they have dominion over 50 million acres. Last August, a few \nweeks ago, it was announced by the Labor Department that the \nunemployment rate of this land was 5.6 percent; in Indian country, the \naverage is over 40 percent. In some of the reservations, it gets closer \nto 90 percent. It is a sorry sight, but 13 percent of the families of \nthis land live in poverty below the poverty line; in Indian country, it \nis 51 percent, half of the families. In most instances, the only legal \nassistance available in Indian country is through this program, the \nlegal services program.\n  I am not speaking of $340 million. I am not speaking of offsets. I am \nspeaking of $10 million. The Domenici amendment includes $10 million, a \nprogram that has paid for the services of 150 lawyers to deal with the \nproblems of Indians throughout this land. There are 33 legal service \nprograms and they service 2 million Indians living on reservations.\n  Without these resources, Mr. President, these tribes and these \nIndians would have no access to legal assistance. I do not think any of \nmy colleagues would think for a moment that law firms would open up \ntheir branches in a Hopi mesa or in some Pueblo Tribe. I cannot think \nof any law firm opening up their practices in Navajo land. There they \nare almost always located far away from the urban centers of this \ncountry.\n  Lawyers do not find it profitable to go to Indian country; 80 percent \nare unemployed, 50 percent of the families are below the poverty line--\nthey cannot pay any lawyers's fee. They have to depend upon legal \nassistance and legal services program.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the Domenici amendment because it \nhas the sensitivity to recognize our obligations. It is a small amount, \n$10 million. I am sorry to say the committee bill does not involve $10 \nmillion. I believe a clarification of this point is necessary.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas noted that this amendment, the \ncommittee amendment, was adopted by the subcommittee and adopted by the \nfull committee. Technically, that is correct.\n  In the subcommittee, we were all told, ``Let's not take up matters of \ncontroversy.'' That is a practice of the Appropriations Committee. \n``Let's not waste our time. Let's not take up matters of controversy. \nLet's wait until we get to the floor.''\n  The same thing happens in the full committee. Otherwise, we would \nstill be in that room, S-126, debating this measure.\n  Mr. President, I have no idea, because the votes were not taken, but \nI have a feeling that if votes had been taken in the full committee, \nthe Domenici amendment would have been adopted.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will not place too much weight \nupon the statement that this was adopted by the subcommittee and \nadopted by the full committee. This is where the controversy is \ndebated. This is where the major decisions of the Appropriations \nCommittee are determined.\n  Mr. President, I speak and I rise to support the Domenici amendment. \nIt fulfills our obligations as those who followed our forefathers. I \nthink it is about time we maintain and keep our promises.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I want to thank the Senator from Hawaii for \nhis very powerful statement about conditions in Indian country. It has \nbeen my great honor and privilege to work with him for many, many years \non Native American issues. I know of no greater advocate for native \nAmericans than my dear friend from Hawaii.\n  However, he and I have a very different view of the impact of the \nlegislation as proposed. I will ask my friend from Texas in a minute to \nrespond to a couple of questions.\n  The fact is, in this present legislation, we have for the first time \ncarried out the intent of the government-to-government relationship and \nrespectful tribal sovereignty which we have sought for years.\n  This legislation, as crafted by the Senator from Texas, provides for \ndirect block grants to tribal governments for legal services on the \nsame terms as State governments.\n  To me, that is a major and important step forward. The present \nlegislation also calls for the State or tribal governments with \nsignificant numbers of Indian households below the poverty line to \nreceive 140 percent of what they would otherwise receive. I have not \nseen that before. Now, the Domenici amendment, as I understand it, \nstrikes that provision of the bill. It strikes section 120 of the bill \nas reported.\n\n  If the Domenici amendment is adopted, then we will lose that \ngovernment-to-government relationship. We will lose the 140 percent of \nwhat they would otherwise receive. Frankly, I do not understand why all \nof us would not be supporting provisions that provide direct block \ngrants to the tribal governments--which is entirely in keeping with \nwhat I have been trying to do for the last 13 years, that is, respect \ntribal sovereignty--and provide the funds directly to those tribes.\n  If the manager of the bill, my friend from Texas, would respond, is \nit not true that in this legislation, in his proposed legislation, the \nStates or tribal governments with significant numbers of Indian \nhouseholds below the poverty line would receive 140 percent of what \nthey would otherwise receive? Is that a correct statement on my part, I \nask the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is a correct statement. States that have substantial \nIndian population will receive 140 percent of what would be their \nnormal allocation. This was the amendment offered in committee by \nSenator Stevens, aimed specifically at dealing with this problem.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it not true that this is the first time that we have \nmade this kind of special consideration for native Americans, that \nwould give them as much as 140 percent of what they otherwise would \nreceive? Is that a correct statement?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is correct. As far as I am aware, this is the first \ntime a special provision has ever been made for Native Americans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it also not true the tribes are block granted these \nfunds outside of any involvement on the part of the State, which is in \nkeeping with the government-to-government relationship that we are \ntrying to achieve?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is true. In fact, the money goes directly to the tribe, \nbypassing the State.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Domenici amendment, as I understand it, strikes the \nprovision in section 120 of the bill we were just talking about; is \nthat correct also?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have to say, in all due respect to my friend from \nHawaii, my dear, dear friend from Hawaii, and my friend from New \nMexico, why we would want to destroy what is clearly a very important \nstep forward in this process, it is something, frankly, I cannot \nsupport. I hope Senator Domenici will modify his amendment, would seek \nto modify his amendment to give 140 percent of present funding to areas \nwhere \n\n[[Page S 14601]]\nIndian households, significant numbers of Indian households below the \npoverty line, would receive those extra benefits; that he would modify \nhis amendment that would provide for direct block granting.\n  It is not so important to me, very frankly, how much money there is, \nwhich is obviously one aspect that is important. But, for us to filter \nthese moneys through the States, simply does not work on any program.\n  I urge my colleagues, who are interested in how this legislation \ntreats native Americans, to reject the Domenici amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if I may briefly comment on the statement \njust made, the committee amendment contributes funds to States on the \nbasis of the census. Yes, it does say Indians should get 140 percent \nmore than other Americans. Under the present program, the program that \nis now in effect at this moment, Indians receive about 5 times what we \nin Washington, or New York, or Chicago receive. For obvious reasons, \nMr. President: 51 percent live in poverty; 80 percent are unemployed. \nIt should be 5 times. If we adopted the committee amendment, it will \nnot be 5 times; it will be less than 2 times. In fact, the present \nscheme is not sufficient but it is much, much better than what the \ncommittee amendment proposes.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Domenici \namendment. I would like to address a comment made by the Senator from \nTexas. I think he is exactly right. This is a matter about choices. We \nare called upon to make choices each and every day in this Chamber.\n  When it comes to priorities, for example, the Senator from Texas \ncited requests from the FBI Director or from the Clinton White House. \nIf we look at the defense bill, the Clinton White House did not request \nmoney for the B-2 bomber. The Secretary of the Air Force did not \nrequest money for the B-2 bomber. Somehow, $500 million is added for \nthe B-2 bomber program, just another downpayment on a $30 billion \nproject. That is a choice that has been made. It does not apply to this \nparticular bill, but we make choices.\n  Would I rather see $500 million applied to other programs? Low-income \nheating assistance? Assistance for the poor? Feeding programs for \nchildren? I would put my priority over there. But soon we will be \npresented with a measure that will add another $500 million to keep a \nprogram alive, a program the Pentagon is not even requesting.\n  So, we are faced with choices. I took the floor the other day in \nopposition to the space station--a $100 billion program. I think we can \nfind better ways of spending $100 billion--such as satisfying our \nresearch and development needs in medicine--than to put it in a space \nstation which is going to cost us more and more as our European \npartners decline to make their contributions.\n  As the Senator from Texas has articulated the issue, he said, \nbasically, if you are for more prisons and prosecutors and taking drug \naddicts and pushers and terrorists off the streets, then you will \nsupport him. But if you are in favor of protecting the poor or \nproviding legal services to the poor, if you want to have that kind of \na dichotomy, that kind of a balance, then you will support Senator \nDomenici.\n  Really, it is a nice positioning on the part of the Senator from \nTexas. But it seems to me that we have an obligation to provide poor \npeople in this country with an opportunity to get to the courthouse. It \nis something that every one of us enjoys. We can afford it. But in this \nbill, we are saying, ``Poor, no longer will you have a Legal Services \nCorporation. We do not like this structure. It has a left-wing agenda. \nWe do not want any left-wing agenda.'' But I submit, if we genuinely \naspire to have a system of ``Equal Justice Under Law,'' as it is \nwritten on the front of the Supreme Court, then our neediest citizens \nmust have access to that system.\n  The facts simply do not support the contention that legal services \norganizations are promoting a left-wing agenda. About one-third of the \ncases involve family violence. We have a serious problem in this \ncountry dealing with family violence. People are being abused. There \nare 52,000 clients seeking protection from abusive spouses, who are \nrepresented by attorneys funded through the Legal Services Corporation. \nThere are 240,000 poor senior citizens who are represented by legal \nservices attorneys. Tens of thousands are represented in landlord-\ntenant disputes. Tens of thousands were assisted in applications for \npublic benefits. But our answer is, ``We do not want this structure \nanymore. We do not want a Federal hand in this anymore. We want to turn \nthis all back to the States.''\n  By the way, you do not just turn a Federal program back to the States \nat no cost. Under the block grant proposal, 50 separate States, with \ntheir own bureaucracies, will have to administer the funds. And unless \nthe Domenici amendment is passed, none of the funds can go to a legal \nservices organization; they can only go to individual lawyers. If you \ntake away the Federal structure and you prohibit money from going to \nestablished organizations within the State, the funds must go to \nindividual attorneys. Then, eventually, you will find very little \nrepresentation for the poor.\n  ``Let the private lawyers take care of this,'' you say--pro bono \nwork. I used to do a lot of it myself. I used to think I had an \nextension of the Pine Tree Legal Assistance operation in my law firm \nbecause there were a lot of poor people who came to the door who simply \ncould not afford to pay the legal fees, and I represented them.\n  But we are deluding ourselves if we think we are going to see an \nexpansion of these points of light, that many thousands and tens of \nthousands of law firms are going to undertake representation for all of \nthe needs of the poor or take on and fight the landlord-tenant \ndisputes. How many poor people have complaints against the landlords--\nslum lords, in many cases--of uninhabitable, rat-infested, asbestos \nridden residences. We say, ``Well, tough luck. You are poor. You do not \nget representation.''\n  The law firms are not going to give you their youngest attorneys. \nThey are on corporate mergers now. That is a higher priority at the law \nfirm. They say, ``We have big mergers taking place. We do not have time \nto allow you to engage in bringing a lawsuit to protect people from \nuninhabitable conditions.''\n\n  Mr. President, I am not entirely satisfied with the Domenici \namendment, as it places unprecedented restrictions on legal services \norganizations such as Maine's Pine Tree Legal Assistance. Unlike \nprevious LSC legislation, this bill not only places restrictions on \nFederal funds, it also restricts how organizations such as Pine Tree \nmay spend money received from State grants, State bar associations, and \nprivate donations. This is a Federal mandate. We are telling States \nlike Maine that they cannot give grants to legal services organizations \nto represent immigrants or pursue class action lawsuits.\n  There are times, in my own State, when State legislators ask legal \nservices attorneys for advice about how they should shape laws and \nregulations to help out people in need. We cannot do that under the \nDomenici approach. These attorneys cannot be called to testify before \nlegislative hearings. They cannot file class action suits. So basically \nit is pretty restrictive. The amendment does not go as far as I would \nlike to see it go.\n  Let me provide one example. A number of years ago there was a lapse \nin a Federal program that provided assistance for displaced workers. \nThe Maine Legislature requested advice from Pine Tree Legal Assistance \nto determine how the law could be changed to ensure that these workers \ncould qualify for State unemployment benefits. But under the amendment, \nPine Tree would have to remain silent; its expertise would be wasted.\n  I am going to support the Domenici amendment, however, because I \nbelieve we have an obligation to see to it that poor people in this \ncountry have access and keys to the courthouse. There is a major trial \ntaking place right now which thankfully is coming to a close. Not many \npeople in this country can afford that kind of representation. \n\n[[Page S 14602]]\nThat is in a criminal case. I am talking about the civil actions now. \nNot very many people in this country, especially those at the very \nlowest of the economic strata, can call up an attorney and say, ``Would \nyou represent me against this claim? Would you represent me against my \nhusband or against my wife? I am being abused. I need help.'' ``Sorry. \nWe do not have any money to help you.''\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the Domenici \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senators from New Mexico and South Carolina. This \namendment will allow continuation of legal services to low-income \nindividuals.\n  The credibility of the American legal system demands that all \nAmericans, regardless of their economic station in life, have access to \nthe courts. To put the promise of justice beyond the reach of a group \nof people because they cannot afford proper representation defies the \nnotion of equal justice for all.\n  Since its inception in 1974, the Legal Services Corporation has \nworked to provide equal access to the justice system to a group of \nAmericans which is sadly growing larger in number and increasingly \ndisenfranchised from our democratic way of life.\n  An editorial in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel recently noted that \nthe Legal Services Corporation helps people in very basic, and \nimportant ways. They help:\n\n       . . . the child who needs health care, the elderly couple \n     negotiating their way through Medicare, the battered woman \n     who needs help getting a divorce and child custody, the \n     victims of consumer fraud.\n\n  I think we would all agree that these are all laudable goals. And \nyet, if you look at the language contained in H.R. 2067, you will see \nthat the battered woman who needs help getting a divorce and child \ncustody is foreclosed from utilizing Legal Services for that purpose. \nWhat could be so controversial about helping a battered woman and her \nchildren out of a violent and abusive situation? Nothing. And yet, the \nlanguage contained in the bill currently being considered, prohibits \nthe use of funds to obtain a divorce.\n  However, Mr. President, this very troubling provision is but one \nexample of the shortsightedness of eliminating the Legal Services \nCorporation. Although it is not without its detractors, the Legal \nServices Corporation provides basic legal services to the poor of this \nNation in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\n  As has been noted many times, only 3 percent of the total Legal \nServices appropriation is used for administrative purposes. The \nremainder is sent out to the various legal service organizations \nthroughout this Nation. Ninety-seven percent of the Legal Services \nCorporation's funding goes directly to local programs to address \npriorities established at the local level.\n  Throughout this Congress we have heard time and time again that \ndecentralization is the key to many of our problems--let the people in \nthe communities make the decisions. Legal Services does that now and \nthis bill eliminates it.\n  Ninety-seven percent of the Corporation's funds are distributed \ndirectly to organizations like Legal Action of Wisconsin, Western \nWisconsin Legal Services, Wisconsin Judicare, and Legal Services of \nNortheastern Wisconsin. All of these local organizations know and \nunderstand the needs of the poor throughout the State of Wisconsin and \nare dedicated to addressing them. Under the present system, they make \nthe decisions, they set the priorities.\n  Not only does the language in the bill eliminate the decentralized \nsystem that exists today, it replaces it with a more onerous and \ntraditional inside the beltway style bureaucracy. Under the proposed \nlanguage, the Department of Justice would become the primary grant \nadministrator to the States. The money no longer goes directly to the \nproviders, it goes to the States. The States in turn establish their \nown administrative structure to oversee and administer the money to the \nlocal organizations, which ultimately provide legal services for the \npoor. These additional layers of bureaucracy will increase \nadministrative costs and result in less money being available to help \nthe poor.\n  If the goal of this body is to slow delivery of legal services to the \npoor and to create more bureaucracy, then we should support the \nproposed block grant. However, if the goal is, as it should be, to \nmaintain a workable delivery system of legal services to the poor in \nthis Nation, then the efficiency, flexibility and the decentralization \nof the current Corporation is the obvious choice.\n  Mr. President, we often hear about the need for private enterprise to \npick up where Government leaves off. The citizens of Wisconsin are very \nfortunate to have a private bar dedicated to ensuring legal \nrepresentation to all people. I know that other Senators can say the \nsame of their home States.\n  But we delude ourselves if we think these dedicated private attorneys \nalone can meet the enormous needs of the poor. I have been contacted by \nmany organizations from Wisconsin, all concerned about, and working to \nhelp, the poor in our State. Each of these groups, be it the Wisconsin \nState Bar, the Association for Women Lawyers, the Milwaukee Bar \nAssociation or any of the others that contact me, knows that the \nelimination of the Legal Services Corporation will seriously hamper the \nability of this Nation's poor to obtain legal representation.\n  If we follow the committee language, and effectively exclude millions \nof poor Americans from one of this Nation's most important \ninstitutions--the justice system--we risk creating a society where \njustice exists only for those above the poverty line. Such a result is \nunacceptable.\n  I appreciate that no one approves of every case that legal services \nundertakes, but the proposed amendment seeks to address some of the \nconcerns that people have raised regarding the scope of Legal Services \nactivities. Some may think the restrictions in the amendment go too \nfar, others, not far enough. However, we must not lose sight of the \nfact that our goal should be to maintain a system of legal \nrepresentation for the poor that allows them to avail themselves of the \nprotections of the American justice systems.\n  Protections that many of us, the more fortunate in our society, may \ntake for granted. However, imagine the importance we all would place in \nthese protections should they disappear or be placed just beyond our \ngrasp. And yet, the language in this bill potentially subjects millions \nof poor people in this Nation to just such a reality.\n  The amendment offered by the Senators from New Mexico and South \nCarolina acknowledges the essential fact that we must preserve the \naccess of the poor in this Nation to the judiciary. This amendment \nallows this Nation to move ahead toward equal justice for all, rather \nthan retreat from this noble goal. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article in the July 19 edition of the \nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel entitled ``Legal Services for Poor Need \nProtection'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 19, 1995]\n\n                Legal Services For Poor Need Protection\n\n       The Legal Services Corp., which gives the poor access to \n     lawyers, has been fighting for its survival this year as \n     never before. The agency still stands. But in House action so \n     far, its funding has been lopped by a third and major \n     restrictions have been placed on its activities.\n       A weakened agency still does not satisfy the extreme right, \n     which has put, you might say, a contract out on the \n     organization. Some congressmen are expected to try to make \n     good on that contract in House action this week.\n       House members most certainly must rebuff this attempt to \n     kill Legal Services, the major source of funds for Legal \n     Action of Wisconsin. America will have no hope of being a \n     fair society if the poor lack reasonable access to lawyers; \n     justice simply won't be served.\n       We are not talking big bucks here, at least not by federal \n     standards. The proposed budget for next year stands at $278 \n     million, down from the current $415 million. Legal Action's \n     share currently is $2.4 million.\n       Like its counterparts across the country, Legal Action of \n     Wisconsin represents poor people in myriad civil cases--the \n     child who needs health care, the elderly couple negotiating \n     their way through Medicare, the battered woman who needs help \n     getting a divorce and child custody, the victim of consumer \n     fraud.\n       The firm doesn't handle frivolous cases. Most are settled \n     without even going to court. And for want of staff Legal \n     Action serves only a small share of those who need its help.\n\n[[Page S 14603]]\n\n       Though only a tiny fraction of Legal Action's work, class \n     action lawsuits draw the most attention because of their wide \n     impact. Far-right critics act as if federally financed law \n     firms think up exotic challenges to the status quo just to \n     promote a far-left agenda. But these legal challenges flow \n     out of the real needs of poor people.\n       For instance, mothers complained to Legal Action that \n     because they couldn't afford child care, they were having a \n     tough time getting training or education to get off welfare. \n     Legal Action successfully sued the state, forcing it to \n     satisfy its obligation to the federal government to pay for \n     child care for 4,000 parents.\n       Unwisely, restrictions in the current House bill would \n     prevent such lawsuits in the future. Class action suits \n     against government and welfare mitigation would both be \n     banned.\n       The most immediate threat, however, is a move to kill Legal \n     Services altogether. Fairness demands that the House turn it \n     back.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Texas for his \nleadership and what he has done to make the changes in the Legal \nServices Corporation.\n  Mr. President, House and Senate conferees are expected to begin \nmeeting soon to consider welfare reform legislation. I sincerely hope \nthat the conference report contains illegitimacy provisions like a \nfamily cap and a restriction on cash benefits to unwed minor mothers.\n  But no matter how strong the welfare conference report turns out to \nbe, it will not succeed in ending welfare dependency unless we also \nreform the Legal Services Corporation, the agency which has for years \nfurnished the rope to hang welfare reform efforts in the States.\n  For example, the State of New Jersey was granted a waiver in 1992 by \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to institute a family \ncap provision denying an increase in welfare benefits for women who \nhave more children while already receiving welfare.\n  The Legal Services Corporation sued the New Jersey Department of \nHuman Services to challenge the family cap. Rightly, the U.S. District \nCourt decided that it is perfectly legitimate for the State of New \nJersey to implement a family cap.\n  But they had to defend it against the Legal Services Corporation.\n  Welfare reform is not the only arena where Legal Services attorneys \nhave defied common sense and hurt the very people whose interests they \nclaim to represent and have sued the people who are paying them.\n  In my own State of North Carolina, in a pattern that is repeated all \nover the country, Legal Services attorneys have caused growers who \nemploy seasonal workers to lose millions of dollars defending \nthemselves against frivolous nonexistent lawsuits. They have extorted \nmoney from growers by threatening them with lawsuits unless they settle \nup--to the tune of $500 per nonexistent violation, per worker.\n  As the Senator from Maine talked about some of the people not having \nthe money to sue and the need for legal services, what we are talking \nabout here are small people trying to make a living defending \nthemselves against legal services, and they do not have the money to \nhire the lawyers either.\n  Even for a small family farmer with 10 acres or less of crop acreage, \nthis can add up to tens of thousands of dollars. For a small farmer, \nthat can add up to bankruptcy. And a bankrupt farmer can not hire \nseasonal laborers or anybody else.\n  In recent years, North Carolina produce farmers have been a target of \nLegal Services attempt to destroy the Department of Labor's H2A \nProgram, which brings in temporary foreign workers to harvest crops for \nfarmers who cannot find enough domestic workers.\n  But Legal Services have harassed these people to the extent that the \nprogram is no longer functioning. This program is designed to help \nfarmers and workers. But they have been harassed by the Legal Services \nso often that they have simply stopped using it or the farmers have \nbeen put out of business.\n  Legal Services is nothing more than an entitlement program for \nactivist lawyers. We simply subsidize them and pay them.\n  My colleague and friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, has a reasonable \nand innovative block grant solution which I strongly support. I \npersonally would feel better to end the disastrous program of Legal \nServices altogether. But we cannot do that.\n  Therefore, I oppose adamantly the amendment by the Senator from New \nMexico, and I urge my colleagues to do the same and to support the \nSenator from Texas. He is doing what needs to be done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Maine, Senator Cohen.\n  Mr. President, what is at issue here, when all is said and done, is \nwhether or not we as a nation are going to support the idea that each \nand every person, regardless of their income, is going to receive equal \nprotection under the law. That is really what having a Legal Services \nCorporation is all about. Ensuring that people are treated equally \nunder the law. Not just the wealthy but, everyone.\n  Mr. President, this is in the very best of the tradition of our \ncountry. Speaking for Minnesotans, this is the Minnesota ethic. \nMinnesotans believe in equal protection under the law. Minnesotans \nbelieve that regardless of a person's station in life he or she should \nbe entitled to representation in our court system.\n  Mr. President, I will reluctantly support the Domenici amendment. To \ndo otherwise is to have a proposal that will essentially eliminate what \nI would call the heart and soul and integrity of the Legal Services in \nthe United States of America. In that sense, I believe Senator Domenici \nhas made an enormous contribution. But I have some serious misgivings \nabout the Domenici amendment albeit, I admire what the Senator from New \nMexico is trying to accomplish. I believe he has made a real \ncontribution toward fairness in our country through his amendment. But \nby the same token, this is a very steep price we will pay for rescuing \nLegal Services. There is a price for agreeing to the restrictions in \nthe Domenici amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, we had this debate before in this Chamber last \nCongress. A debate that I was very active in. It was a debate with my \ncolleague from Texas, as a matter of fact.\n  When you have a restriction that says you are going to have a \nprohibition on welfare reform litigation, then I would ask the \nfollowing question: Has this just become a kind of mean season on the \npoor of this country?\n  Mr. President, we are talking about children. The most vulnerable \nmembers of our society. Not too long ago we made a profound mistake in \nagreeing to the so-called welfare reform measure that passed this body. \nAt that time, I think Senator Moynihan said it better than anyone. He \nessentially said that for the first time in over a half a century, we \nas the U.S. Senate, will say there will be no floor beneath which \nchildren could fall.\n  Mr. President, you and I have had a debate on this issue. It has been \nan honest difference of opinion. But if we are going to say that, and \nwe are also going to say there is no kind of national community \ncommitment, no sort of obligation, responsibility or standard in \nrelation to nutrition, in relation to making sure that every child at \nleast has an adequate diet, that in and of itself I think is a turning \nback of the clock, away from the very best of this country, because I \nthink it will be more children are going to go hungry and more children \nare going to be impoverished.\n  Now what we have is a restriction that says in addition to no \nnational standard, no floor, there will be restrictions on Legal \nServices lawyers who rightfully want to challenge any of the laws or \npractices that are called welfare reform.\n  How can we argue that Legal Services lawyers will not be able to \nissue any challenges when we do not know exactly what is going to \nhappen back \n\n[[Page S 14604]]\nin the States and back at the county level.\n  There are all kinds of examples. Suppose, for example--I had an \namendment which dealt with the whole issue of domestic violence--you \nhave a woman who has been battered. Imagine what it would be like if \nyou had been battered steadily for 2 years. You have two small \nchildren, and you are told you go into a work program or you lose your \nassistance. Suppose she could not because she had not healed; she is \nnot ready to work physically or mentally. Under these draconian \nrestrictions a woman would not be able to receive Legal Services \nrepresentation to challenge this particular restriction. Where is the \nfairness in that? Is this just? I submit to my esteemed colleagues, \nthat this is not justice and it is not fair.\n  Mr. President, this strikes me as just being a mean season on the \npoor. Senator Domenici has made a real contribution because he is \nattempting to make sure we do not pass any extreme proposals, which is \nI believe the Gramm proposal is about. But these restrictions trouble \nme, and these restrictions should not be the price people pay to \nreceive the most basic legal representation to protect their rights.\n  I hope that when it comes to authorization we will have a debate, and \nwe will be able to come up with constrictive solutions to some of these \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, what happens if a mother is told she has to work but \nbecause of a prior work experience she has a bad back? People quite \noften think it is an excuse--she has a herniated disk, and she cannot \ndo the kind of physical work she used to do. She says I can no longer \nperform this type of work, or there is no one to take care of my small \nchildren, and she might be cut off. She has no legal representation?\n  What happens if we go back to what used to be the man-in-the-house \nrule, and it is decided at the county level that a woman who is single \nnow, has been through a divorce, and a male friend visits her one day, \nand somebody is there from the welfare department who determines she \nshould be cut off because there is a man in her house that can support \nher. Will she have legal representation to challenge this kind of \ndetermination? No.\n  I do not know how we can have this kind of restriction when we do not \neven know how it is going to be at the State and local level. What if \nit is repressive? What if it is harsh? What if it is degrading? What if \nit violates the Constitution of the United States of America? Are we \nsaying a whole group of citizens, which, by the way, are women and \nchildren, are not going to have legal representation?\n  Mr. President, the Gramm proposal goes beyond the goodness of \nAmerica. The Gramm proposal to essentially gut legal services goes \nbeyond the goodness of Minnesota. I believe the Gramm proposal will be \nvoted down. I think the Domenici amendment will pass, and it should \nbecause the whole idea of equal protection under the law is an idea \nthat fires the imagination of Americans. This about basic fairness and \njustice.\n  What I worry about as I look at these restrictions, whether it be \nwelfare or whether it be a broad definition of lobbying, or whether it \nbe advocacy or no class action lawsuits, is that I believe we are \nheading in the wrong direction because ultimately what this debate is \nabout--is about power and powerlessness in America. And if you are \ngoing to say that, yes, there will be funding for Legal Services but we \nwill so severely restrict what you can do that those who are powerless \ndo not have the ability to challenge some of the powerful institutions \nin America, then we just deepen all of the inequalities.\n  Hospitals are supposed to take care of sick people. Welfare agencies \nare supposed to be concerned about the welfare of the people they \nserve. Schools are supposed to educate children, all children. Housing \nagencies are supposed to be concerned about housing, housing for all \npeople. It is written somewhere that just because you are poor, you do \nnot get adequate representation.\n  Are we now saying that a whole group of citizens in America, \ndisproportionately women, disproportionately children, are no longer \ngoing to have access to lawyers who can challenge some of those \ndiscriminatory policies?\n  I will tell you what this is going to do, Mr. President. It is going \nto breed contempt for our legal system among the very citizens we do \nnot want to see have that contempt.\n  We have young people who are growing up in communities across our \ncountry, in more brutal circumstances and conditions than any of us \nwant to admit. I think the Senator from Hawaii, [Mr. Inouye], has \nprobably been the champion for people in Indian country. He knows their \ncondition better than maybe any other Senators here.\n  If we have young people growing up in more brutal circumstances than \nany of us want to face up to, and we are now going to severely restrict \nwhat Legal Services lawyers can do, we are just going to breed contempt \non the part of those young people in this system. They are going to see \nno way that they can seek redress of grievances through our system; \nthey are going to see a legal system they are not going to believe in; \nthey are going to see a political system they are not going to believe \nin; they are going to see a nation that they believe betrays the very \nidea of equal justice under the law. Where do you think that is going \nto take us?\n  When young people growing up in poverty, growing up in impoverished \ncommunities, growing up under brutal circumstances do not see any way \nthrough the legal system that they can seek redress of grievances, do \nnot see a system through which there is an opportunity for them working \nwithin our system in a nonviolent way to improve their lives, it \ncreates an enormous vacuum.\n  I will tell you what fills that vacuum. I have been to a lot of these \ncommunities. What fills that vacuum is the politics of despair, the \npolitics of cynicism, and all too often the politics of hatred.\n  Mr. President, the Gramm approach is to extreme; it goes too far. \nWhat the Senator from Texas has done is to belie the best of America. \nSenator Domenici is right with his amendment. But as to the \nrestrictions in the Domenici amendment, I hope later on as we move \nforward on legal services, we will be able to have a good discussion \nand we will be able to make the kinds of changes that will provide poor \npeople in America with strong legal representation.\n  Just because you are poor does not mean you should not be able to \nchallenge those who have the power in America. Just because you are \npoor or just because you are living in a poor community or just because \nyou are a whole community that is denied a voice or just because you \nare a whole community that does not have the power, does not mean you \nshould not be entitled to some legal services lawyers that can work \nwith you. It should not mean you cannot be entitled to challenge the \npolicies and practices that discriminate against your families, that \nhold your families down, that lead to inadequate housing, that lead to \nyour children not having an adequate education, that lead to health \ncare institutions that sometimes do not take care of you.\n  You should be able to challenge those policies and practices. You \nshould be able to challenge those institutions. That is the best of \nAmerica. That is equal justice under the law. With these restrictions, \nthat is not going to happen. So, Mr. President, to conclude, I will not \ncosponsor the Domenici amendment because of the restrictions, but I \ncertainly will vote for it.\n  I think the Senator from New Mexico, my friend, is making a real \ncontribution: A little more fairness, a little more justice, a little \nmore compassion, a little bit more of what is right in America.\n  My God, Mr. President is this the mean season on the poor? I hope \nwhen it comes to authorization, we will be able to look at these \nrestrictions and we will be able to make the kinds of changes that will \nlead to legal services, and will provide people in this country, poor \npeople, whether they live in urban America or rural America or suburban \nAmerica, with equal protection under the law. That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I support the Domenici-Hollings amendment \nrestoring funding for the Legal \n\n[[Page S 14605]]\nServices Corporation. This amendment will ensure that poor people in \nunderserved ares continue to get legal advice. The Domenici-Hollings \namendment contains important restrictions on the use of funds by the \nLegal Services Corporation. These restrictions, which were also \nsupported by the House, are necessary to ensure that abuses that have \noccurred in the past do not continue. The funding that is provided \nunder this amendment can not be used for things like class actions, \nlobbying, or representing illegal aliens. These restrictions are to \nensure that funding is used to provide the traditional legal services \nthat are most needed by poor people.\n  I want to thank the Senator from New Mexico and his staff for \naccommodating the special needs of Native Americans and those in areas \nlike Alaska where travel to remote villages increases costs. Last year \nthe Alaska Legal Services Corporation successfully completed 4,629 \ncases. In most cases the people who the Corporation represented had no \nwhere else to turn for legal advice because they could not afford to \nhire an attorney.\n  The poor people in my State--and across America--need the help of the \nLegal Services Corporation. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there are few examples that better \nillustrate the case of good intentions gone awry than the Legal \nServices Corporation.\n  Created in 1974 to relieve the burden of an expensive legal system \nfor poor Americans, the Legal Services Corporation has become in many \ninstances the instrument for bullying ordinary Americans to satisfy a \nliberal agenda that has been repeatedly rejected by the voters.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make clear at the outset that I support \nefforts to help low-income Americans by ensuring that they are not shut \noff from legal redress, especially where important constitutional \nrights are concerned. And I also have no doubt that the existing legal \nservices framework has produced good programs and employs good people \nwho are devoted to providing the very best representation to those who \notherwise could not afford it.\n  But as the Washington Post noted on September 18, 1995, the model of \nproviding legal services to the poor has become twisted into something \n``more ambitious: a powerful network of poverty lawyers funded by \nWashington and backed up by university-based centers of expertise, that \nwould help not just individual clients but `the poor' as a whole.''\n  There are two points to be made about this outcome: First, despite \nmany dedicated lawyers who have undoubtedly helped poor clients through \nLegal Services grants, the inevitable result of this shift in focus has \nbeen to hurt those whom the Corporation was created to help. The \nimpoverished individual who has run-of-the-mill, but important, legal \nneeds is shunted aside by Legal Services lawyers in search of sexy \nissues and deep pockets. And in some cases the agenda of helping the \npoor as a class has perpetuated and deepened the worst aspects of a \nwelfare state that has utterly failed poor Americans.\n  Second, this twisting of the original purpose of the Legal Services \nCorporation is antidemocratic. In most cases, what passes as a class \naction lawsuit--whether it addresses welfare benefits, or employer-\nemployee relations--is nothing more than a policy dispute that should \nbe, and often has been, the subject of the legislative process. To \nsubvert the legal system in order to overturn legislative judgments is \nfundamentally at odds with our system of government.\n  How did this happen? A lack of accountability. The very structure of \nthe Legal Services Corporation has produced this result. Although the \nCorporation has an 11-member board, the reality is that money flows to \nover 300 local nonprofit groups with attorneys accountable to no one. \nThis is not an accident. With the best of intentions, the idea was that \nthe Corporation should be insulated from political pressures. But this \nlaudable goal was taken too far. Laws addressing the misappropriation \nof Federal funds, for example, are not even applicable to the \nCorporation under the terms of the act creating it.\n  Thus, this is not a case of passing more laws and creating an \nincreasingly complex regime to govern the operation of the Legal \nServices Corporation. The problem cannot be papered over. The problem \nflows from the present structure of how we provide legal services to \nthe poor.\n  The time has come to end this abuse of the legal process and return \nto the original purpose--providing the means to help the poorest among \nus to cope with their genuine and individual legal needs.\n  I am committed to providing some mechanism that provides legal \nassistance to the impoverished among us. But in this, as in so many \nother areas, it is time to return power and responsibility back to \nwhere it belongs--the States. Supporters of the present Legal Services \nframework will undoubtedly claim that the poor will suffer. I believe \nthat is wrong. The legislation before us provides a responsible \nresponse to the legitimate legal needs of the poor--a block grant \nprogram that can be run by those closest to the needs of their citizens \nand implemented with the appropriate safeguards that have heretofore \neluded the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support repeal of the Legal \nServices Corporation Act.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as we enter into the debate as to whether \nwe should convert yet another Federal program into a block grant, it \nwould behoove us to consider fully the wise comments of our former \ncolleague, Gov. Lawton Chiles. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing letter from Governor Chiles, which questions the wisdom of \ntransforming the Legal Services Corporation into a block grant, be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Office of the Governor\n\n                              Tallahassee, FL, September 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Congress, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to inform you of my \n     position on the Legal Aid Block Grant Act of 1995 contained \n     in the State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations bill (HR 2076) \n     which would provide that funds in FY 1996 for the legal \n     services organizations be routed through the governor's \n     office of distribution.\n       First, I urge you to consider the efficiency of the current \n     system. Only 3% of the funds which are allocated are spent on \n     overhead, and the remainder reaches the direct delivery \n     system in the states. This efficiency would be difficult to \n     duplicate at the state level, especially as we will have to \n     invent a delivery system at a time of fiscal change.\n       Second, after a review of this matter and its implications \n     for State government responsibility, I have determined that \n     the burden to Florida is great and that there is no increased \n     benefit to the state in channeling such funds through this \n     office.\n       In summary, I am asking you to vote against a block grant \n     proposal for legal services. As usual, I appreciate your \n     efforts to achieve fiscal responsibility while providing for \n     the needs of our less fortunate citizens.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lawton Chiles.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I stand here to pledge my support for the \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator Domenici, which preserves \nthe Legal Services Corporation.\n  This organization has been both efficient and effective in providing \nlegal services to the poor, so that those who are most vulnerable in \nour society have access to the courts, not just those who can afford \nit.\n  Contrary to the rhetoric of some of my colleagues who oppose the \nDomenici amendment, the vast majority of cases handled by the Legal \nServices Corporation are not controversial--they are individual cases \narising out of everyday unfortunate problems--losing a job, suffering a \nserious illness, facing the breakdown of family relations of simply \ndealing with Government redtape.\n  As someone who has long sought to do what I could do to prevent and \nto fight against family violence, I am most grateful for the help that \nthe Legal Services Corporation provides to victims of family violence.\n  In fact, representation of victims of family violence is the single \nlargest category of cases handled by local legal services programs--\naccounting for one out of every three cases processed last year.\n  In 1994 alone--the year we passed the Violence Against Women Act--\nlocal \n\n[[Page S 14606]]\nlegal services programs handled more than 50,000 cases in which women \nsought legal protection from abusive husbands, and over 9,000 cases \ninvolving neglected and abused children.\n  This amendment places a number of prohibitions on the Legal Services \nCorporation, but keeps this much-needed organization intact, enabling \nit to continue to provide traditional legal services to those who \ndesperately need them.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting Senator \nDomenici's amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I speak on behalf of the Legal Services \nCorporation.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, the Legal Services Corporation has a \nproven track record. Without this program, there are few alternatives \nif any for the poor to have access to the legal system. Many of the \npeople who benefit from Legal Services were once considered part of the \nmiddle class. However, as a result of unemployment, illness, divorce or \naging, these people are now left without the means to afford a private \nattorney. Some of the people who are helped by this program are: the \nsenior citizen living on social security in rural New Mexico who is a \nvictim of a consumer fraud scam; the disabled veteran who has had VA \nhealth benefits denied; the woman who has children and is trying to \nescape form an abusive relationship.\n  There are many reasons to vote against the block grant approach \nadopted by the appropriations committee. By eliminating the Legal \nServices Corporation, a new bureaucracy is created because States now \nhave to set up administrative structures to fund and oversee legal \nservices programs. This new bureaucracy with higher administrative \ncosts will soak up much needed resources. Further, the block grant \nproposal limits legal representation to the ``most basic needs.'' For \nexample:\n  A person may still be represented in an eviction case; there will \nstill be services available to probate a will; in cases of child abuse; \nin seeking a protective order; file a petition for bankruptcy; a quiet \ntitle action.\n  However, the question becomes: Are these the only legal services that \nthe poor seek? Obviously, the answer is no. Other possibilities have \nbeen prohibited by the block grant and that is the heart of the problem \nwith this appropriations bill. Here are some types of things that will \nnot be permitted under the block grant: assistance in a divorce \n(applies to abusive situations); abortion; applying for veterans \nbenefits; obtaining home ownership; credit access; Indian/Tribal Law \nissues; paternity; adoption; rights of the physically disabled; and \nconsumer-related law (elderly scams).\n  There are many reasons to support the Legal Services Corporation, but \nthe primary one remains the reason this program was created in the \nfirst place--it is the most cost efficient way to allow the poor to \nhave access to our legal system. If the goal of a block grant is to \nallow local control and flexibility, then the Legal Services \nCorporation is already accomplishing this objective.\n  Mr. President, this particular system is not broken. The Legal \nServices Corporation uses only 3 percent of its budget towards \nadministrative expenses. The decision making is divided among those \nwith knowledge in poverty law. Currently, the mid-level bureaucracy is \neliminated because grants do not have to be approved by State or local \ngovernments.\n  In essence, this appropriations bill is placing the burden on the \nshoulders of those who are not represented in this debate, the poor, \nand I urge my colleagues to restore the Legal Service Corporation.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President I would like to inquire of the Senator from \nNew Mexico as to the intent of his amendment with regard to the \nInternational Trade Commission.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As my colleagues know, I intended this amendment to be \nthe first amendment before the Senate.\n  I intended for some weeks to offer an amendment to retain the Legal \nServices Corporation and to provide it with adequate funding to \ncontinue providing legal assistance to those who could otherwise not \nafford it.\n  That amendment was drafted to the bill reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Last night the distinguished full committee chairman filed a \nreallocation of funding to the subcommittee, and the Senate adopted an \namendment to restore some $400 million to various programs in the bill \nincluding $4 million for the ITC.\n  This amendment made significant changes to the bill as reported, and \nthus affected the amendment that I am offering with other Senators.\n  I would like to clarify that the intention of the Domenici amendment \nis to take a reduction in the International Trade Commission [ITC] by \n$4 million from the level approved in the managers amendment rather \nthan from the level of funding reported in the original bill.\n  It is not my intention to reduce the ITC by 30 percent as some may \nassume from a literal reading of the amendment.\n  I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues over the use of \nthe ITC funding as an offset. As a conferee on the bill, I will work \nwith Chairman Hatfield to sustain a level of funding that will be \nadequate to support the work of the International Trade Commission.\n  Mr. ROTH. I appreciate the clarification from my distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico. I am greatly concerned about the impact of \nthe proposed appropriations reductions on the ITC. I hope the conferees \nwill provide the maximum level of funding possible for the ITC in the \nfinal bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to \nincrease funding for legal services, and to retain the Legal Services \nCorporation.\n  Mr. President, the debate over this bill, when you get right down to \nit, is a debate about priorities.\n  And in my view, little is more important than ensuring that all \nAmericans have access to justice.\n  After all, the principle of ``Equal Justice Under Law'' is at the \nheart of our democratic system. Every American is supposed to have the \nsame legal rights. No matter their race. No matter their religion. No \nmatter whether they are rich or poor.\n  Today's Legal Services Corporation helps make this principle a \nreality.\n  It protects victims of domestic violence.\n  It defends senior citizens and veterans against bureaucrats who \narbitrarily deny them benefits.\n  It forces landlords to follow the law in eviction procedures.\n  It stops nursing homes from dumping patients who have become \nexpensive or difficult to serve.\n  It helps the mentally ill and disabled get the benefits to which they \nare entitled.\n  And it helps ensure that Constitutional rights are real for all \nAmericans, whether or not they can afford their own lawyer.\n  Mr. President, the need for legal services among low-income people is \nintense. Over 50 million Americans are living near the poverty level, \nand potentially eligible for legal services. One of every four children \nunder six lives in poverty.\n  For people like these, Mr. President, legal services can mean access \nto critical support from an absent parent. It can mean a decent home to \nlive in. Access to health care. Access to education. Or escape from a \nviolent home.\n  Despite these critical needs, Mr. President, 70 percent of our \ncountry's least fortunate lack access to any legal services. One reason \nis that the number of legal services attorneys has been cut by one-\nthird since 1981.\n  A recent survey found that, on average, legal services programs \nturned away 43 percent of eligible individuals because they lacked \nsufficient resources. For some programs, the rate was as high as 60 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, given these shortfalls, we ought to be increasing \nfunding for legal services, not cutting it. Yet the bill approved by \nthe Appropriations Committee would cut funding from legal services from \n$400 million to $210 million. That, in my view, would be an outrage.\n  This amendment would increase that level to $340 million. That does \nnot go far enough, and would leave the Legal Services Corporation with \na significant cut. Still, it is a big improvement. And, from all \nindications, it is the best we can do for now.\n  I also want to express my concern about the restrictions on legal \nservice \n\n[[Page S 14607]]\nlawyers that are included in this amendment. For example, the amendment \nwould prohibit LSC lawyers from pursuing class action suits. I think \nthat is a mistake. If a group of poor people are harmed by wrongful \nconduct, why should each person have to pursue a remedy individually? \nThat only increases litigation, increases costs, and makes it more \ndifficult for poor people to get justice. I do not think it makes \nsense.\n  But having said that, Mr. President, I realize that many of my \ncolleagues feel strongly about this and other restrictions. And it \nappears that at least many of these restrictions are necessary to \nensure that the program as a whole is supported and funded.\n  So, in conclusion, I want to commend Senator Domenici for taking the \nlead in this area, and I would urge my colleagues to support the \namendment. The Legal Services Corporation deserves our support. Because \neach and every American deserves access to justice.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have had an opportunity now to review \nsome of the restrictions on the Federal Legal Services Corporation and \nits national bureaucracy that would be imposed under the Domenici \namendment.\n  As I said earlier, I believe these provisions are far less \nrestrictive than those that are in the bill, but there are several that \nI want to comment on and, I think, in commenting really make the point \nthat as long as you have this national superstructure, you are not \ngoing to curb these abuses.\n  One of the restrictions in the Domenici amendment is to limit the \nability of the Legal Services Corporation to file lawsuits that have to \ndo with redistricting; that is, lawsuits that have to do with deciding \nwhere lines are drawn in terms of State legislatures and in terms of \ncongressional redistricting.\n  The only problem with this restriction is it is already the law of \nthe land. We currently have a ban on the ability of Legal Services \nCorporation to engage in lawsuits that relate to representation and to \nredistricting in legislatures and in Congress. But a perfect example of \nhow this fails is that this restriction was in place in 1990 when the \nTexas Rural Legal Aid, which is funded by the Legal Services \nCorporation, challenged a redistricting plan in Texas in that year, in \nwhat the Bush administration saw as a violation of the congressional \nprohibition on lawsuits involving redistricting.\n  When the Bush-appointed Legal Services Board attempted to discipline \nthe Texas Rural Legal Aid by reducing their funds, the Texas Rural \nLegal Aid sued the Legal Services Corporation. As a result, funds \ncontinued to be provided to the Texas Rural Legal Aid for the remainder \nof the Bush administration, when the new Clinton board was seated, they \nsettled the case out of court.\n  So here is a perfect case in point where there has been a violation \nof a restriction on legal services funding. They clearly violated the \nrules in 1990, and when the Legal Services Board, appointed by \nPresident Bush, tried to step in and penalize them for violating the \nrules they went to court and continued to receive funds. Then the \nClinton Legal Services Board settled the case out of court.\n  That is a perfect example of where we already have the restriction \nand, yet, with a Federal bureaucratic overlay on this program, we are \nunable to enforce the intent of Congress.\n  A second provision I look at is a prohibition against legislative \nlobbying, but there is a major loophole in the Domenici amendment on \nthis issue as well. The major loophole is subsection 14(b) where funds \nare allowed to be used to lobby for more money and for fewer \nrestrictions. I am not sure what else they would lobby for, but I think \nthat is exactly what most people have in mind when you say that you are \nlimiting their ability to lobby. If they can lobby to get more money \nand to get fewer restrictions, then they are clearly free to lobby.\n  The Domenici amendment has a requirement that there be timekeeping, \nthat there be separate accounting, that there be monitoring, that there \nbe no attorney-client waiver. And yet, routinely, these provisions are \ncircumvented from monitoring on the grounds of the attorney-client \nprivilege. I think it is a legitimate concern of whether we are going \nto be able overcome the assertion of that privilege when the Legal \nServices Corporation does not want to abide by the rules and when its \nclient does not want to abide by the rules. I would like to have some \nassurances that, in fact, the rule is going to be abided by.\n  Another major problem has to do with public housing. In the list of \nabusive cases by Legal Services Corporation, probably no list is longer \nof those that I had included in the Record than the list of cases that \ninvolves public housing.\n  The Domenici amendment would prohibit legal services from defending a \ntenant who was charged with drug violations. But I want to remind my \ncolleagues that often the tenant who has the contract with the public \nhousing project is not the person who is charged. Often, they are \nsimply abetting the crime by allowing a friend or children to use their \nunit of public housing for that purpose.\n  As I read the amendment, if they are charged with shooting and \nkilling someone, there is no provision prohibiting a legal services \ndefense. We deal only with drugs, not with guns, and not with violence. \nBut I think, again, when you start looking at each one of these things, \nyou find how very difficult it is to enforce these provisions, so long \nas there is a governing entity that basically wants the Legal Services \nCorporation to do these things.\n  I think these are very real concerns, and I think that these are \nconcerns that need to be dealt with.\n  Finally, I just want to make note, I did not mention it before, and \nnot that I expect that anybody is going to be greatly moved by it, but \nwhen we adopted a budget in the Senate and in the House we called for \nLegal Services Corporation funding at $278 million. The Domenici \namendment would raise that funding level to $340 million. While it is \nnot technically a violation of our budget, it is interesting to note \nthat we are being called upon here to cut Federal prosecutors, to \nreduce Federal courts, to reduce funding for U.S. attorneys, to reduce \nFBI funding for construction at the FBI Academy in order to fund a \nlevel for the Legal Services Corporation which is above the level which \nwas called for in the budget that was adopted in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Texas a \nquestion, just from the standpoint of those who have other amendments \nand those who are calling and asking me as to where we are. I think we \nhave had a good debate. I compliment him on the quality of his debate, \nand I wonder if there is any thought that he might have as to when we \nmight vote. It does not matter to me. Last night, I indicated a genuine \ninterest in voting quickly. Frankly, if we do not want to get a bill, \nthat is up to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say to the Senator, it is my understanding that \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Lautenberg are on their way here to speak \non behalf of the bill.\n  Let me call those who have suggested to me that they might be \ninterested, and it may well be at that point that we could reach a \ndetermination as to whether I want to make a motion or whether I just \nsimply want to have a vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we withhold on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Texas withhold?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to read one more time and \nmake one more observation, there is no doubt that the principal concern \nabout \n\n[[Page S 14608]]\nthe Legal Services Corporation has been class action lawsuits, \nlobbying, soliciting work, and a number of issues, and I will go \nthrough a list in a minute.\n  But I want to remind everyone again, we have never been able to \nliterally write all of these prohibitions into the law.\n  Again, I want everyone to know the reason for the prohibitions is \nbecause legal services, when it was founded by Richard Nixon in \nassociation with the American Bar, intended this to represent \nindividual poor people in individual cases, not to represent a class of \npoor people suing a welfare agency or suing a legislature or suing the \nfarmers as a class.\n  We have never been able to put those kinds of prohibitions into law \nbecause we never had agreement between the House and the Senate. So I \nwant everyone to know that, with few exceptions, the House has already \nagreed to the same kind of prohibitions that are in this bill. The \nHouse does not block grant this in their appropriations bill. They have \nfunded it.\n  So with reference to the House, the only difference is that we seek \nto add some money so that this program gets cut 15 percent, which we \nthink, in comparison to other things, is clearly fair, and we put the \nsame prohibitions and some additional ones in.\n  So if this bill ever gets signed into law, and unless it does, there \nwill be no funding unless we have an ongoing continuing resolution for \nthe whole year, and it will be close to last year's level--10, 15 \npercent like we have. If a bill is going to come out and get signed, it \nis going to have these prohibitions and, once and for all, that is \ngoing to be the law.\n  Having said that, just a budget remark because my friend from Texas \nsaid it right. He said, technically, that this bill calls for more \nmoney than the budget resolution. I would not want anybody to think \nthat is a rare exception around here either. Frankly, what is really \nbinding is the total amount of the dollars. If we were able to write in \nthe budget resolution and designate the funding level for every \nprogram, then there would be no need for annual appropriations. The \nappropriators could go out of existence. Some might say that is a good \nidea. I know the occupant of the chair is wondering, and I also believe \nwe ought to appropriate every 2 years instead of every 1. I do not know \nwhy we do not change that. It has been proven very worthwhile in many \nStates. But we still have a law that says the appropriators decide with \nfinality. So there is no violation of the budget. If that were the \ncase, every bill appropriations bill that came through here would be in \nviolation because they all have items with different funding levels \nthan the assumption in the budget resolution--maybe 20, 30 times in \neach bill. That is the prerogative of the Appropriations Committee, and \nthe Senate as an institution. Only if we breach the cap, go over the \ntotal amount allowed, is it subject to the budget resolution, which is \nseeking not specificity but overall control.\n  So, indeed, if one were to talk about legal services being somewhat \nhigher than the assumption, one could also say that almost all of the \nJustice Department and the anticrime measures in the bill are higher \nthan the budget resolution. In that context, technically, they are \ndoing much the same thing, letting the appropriators seek what they \nthink is the appropriate level. So I think everybody should know on the \nup side and the down side of funding, that goes on in every \nappropriations bill. It does not violate the budget, so long as you do \nnot breach the overall budget target.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico. I do so after having had \nconsiderable experience as a lawyer. I think I understand the need for \nrepresentation of the poor in America on many of the complex legal \nissues and problems which they face.\n  My first exposure to representation of the poor came as a volunteer \ndefender when I was a year and a half out of law school. That was \nbefore the Gideon versus Wainwright case, which established a \nconstitutional right for defendants to have lawyers in criminal \nproceedings. It is unthinkable in 1995 that there was ever a time when \nsomeone would be ``haled into court,'' as Justice Black put it, and not \nhave an attorney represent him when his liberty was at stake. But there \nwas a day, and I was a year and a half out of law school and at a big \nPhiladelphia law firm. There was an enormous backlog of criminal cases, \nand people were held at detention at the Montgomery County prison. I \nwent over for a month to represent indigent criminals in the courts of \nPhiladelphia.\n  It was a real eye-opener for me in many, many ways. The first way was \nto learn that these people had nobody to represent them in a courtroom. \nThey were faced with two counts of rape, four burglaries, and I was a \nyear and a half out of law school, and I was better than nothing, but \nbarely, under those circumstances; and I saw at that time how people \nhad to volunteer, how the community had to come forward to provide \nlegal assistance to people who needed to have their rights represented \nin a courtroom. It also did something very profound for me, and that \nwas it opened my eyes to public service and to the criminal courts. I \nhad been there for only a month. Notwithstanding that, I was in a very \nprominent law firm. It was wall-to-wall life. I soon became an \nassistant district attorney because I wanted to learn to be a trial \nlawyer, and I wanted to participate in the public process. And it has \nall been downhill since then, to district attorney and U.S. Senator. \nBut that was a real experience for me to see the importance of legal \nrepresentation.\n  Now we have legal services. The first year I was here in 1981, there \nwas an effort to reduce the funding to $100,000, which would have been \ngrossly inadequate. Senators Rudman, Domenici, and a few of us stood \nup, and my recollection is that we had $261,000 for community legal \nservices in that year. Last year, we had a battle on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate when there was an effort to limit community legal services \nfrom representing people in welfare reform cases, because the community \nlegal services had gotten into a New Jersey case over welfare reform. \nIt seemed to me unthinkable to limit community legal services from \nparticipating in representing poor people in challenging Federal or \nState laws. Now we have just gone through welfare reform in this body, \ndealing with matters which are tremendously complicated and have raised \nvery many important legal issues. And you have to have representation \nfor the poor in America. It is something we ought to be doing. The \namount of money involved, in comparison to the scope of the problem, is \nminimal.\n  Senator Domenici is the leading expert on the budget. I cite him all \nthe time, and I have great confidence in our glidepath for a balanced \nbudget, because Senator Domenici is a man I have seen operate for over \n6 years as chairman of the Budget Committee, from 1981 through 1986 and \nagain this year. These dollars for legal services are very, very well \nspent.\n  I, frankly, have some concerns about the limitations which are \npresent in this bill. I talked to Senator Domenici about them, \nespecially the limitations on the use of non-Federal funds, and I know \nthat this is a compromise to try to get the extra funding, to have some \nlimitations. I have grave reservations about these limitations. But I \ndo know this--even with the money which is left, this is not enough to \nhandle individual cases where individuals need representation on \ncomplex legal matters.\n  I have tried to hold my comments to a few moments in the hope that we \nmay act on this amendment. I do not think any souls are going to be \nsaved or any votes are going to be changed on this amendment on my \nspeech, the speeches before mine, or the speeches going back to about \n11 o'clock this morning. We have a lot of other amendments which I hope \nwe can take up. I hope we will move to conclude this amendment. I hope \nmy colleagues will support this amendment because it is important for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I see my friend from Hawaii on the \nfloor. Did he want to say something?\n  Mr. INOUYE. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Since there is no business coming before the Senate, I \n\n[[Page S 14609]]\n  ask for 6, 7, minutes as in morning business at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nbalanced budget that we have put forth and that we all worked so hard \nfor--at least on this side of the aisle. I am going to put it into the \nframework of the Secretary of Treasury, Mr. Rubin, talking to the \nAmerican people and us about that day sometime after October 20, \nperhaps before November 15, in that timeframe, when the debt limit that \nwe have imposed upon ourselves expires, and in order to borrow \nadditional money, Congress has to act to raise that debt limit. \nEssentially, that is being discussed with the American people. I am not \nsure they all quite understand what that means.\n  I want to, in a sense, respond as I see it to the fear that the \nSecretary of the Treasury is pushing across this land in terms of that \ndebt limit day.\n  First of all, Congress has never given up the power to tell the \nPresident and those who work for him, like the Secretary of Treasury \nhow much they can borrow. Occasionally, it seemed kind of strange to me \nbecause Congress passes all these laws to spend money, and everybody \nvotes on those, and then when it comes time to extend the debt, people \nsay, ``We will not extend the debt.'' But I am beginning to understand \nthat power to control the debt limit is very important, especially in \nthis year and years like this one.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is saying to us, ``You'd better agree \nto extend that debt limit because if you do not, something very ominous \nmight happen.'' Then he talks about such things as default and we will \nnot be able to pay interest on some bonds.\n  First of all, let me make it very clear from the standpoint of the \nSenator from New Mexico, who put this budget resolution together, and \nlook at it from my vantage point as to the seriousness of that \ncontention on the part of the Secretary that we had better be prepared \nto let that go up.\n  Now, I see it this way. I think there are two major events that are \ncoming together in the month of November. One is described by the \nSecretary of the Treasury with all of those ominous tones about what \nwill happen; the other is whether we are going to get a balanced \nbudget--no smoke and mirrors--and entitlement reform.\n  Frankly, many people are now experts on this Federal budget. Interest \nrates out there on bonds affect our standard of living because it \naffects interest rates on many things. Those who look at that know \nprecisely what is a balanced budget and what is not a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, we know precisely what the big ingredient in a \nbalanced budget is. The big one is reforming the entitlement programs \nthat are out of control--Medicare, Medicaid. I did not say cut them, I \nsaid reform them. In addition, we must look at commodity price supports \nand a whole list of programs that are on automatic pilot.\n  If we do not stop them and change them, they just spin, some at a 10-\npercent increase a year, some 12. We had Medicaid in some States, \nincreasing as much as 19 percent a year. I think we had as high as a \n28-percent increase in one year in Medicaid--28 percent, automatic. \nExperts on the Federal budget know if you do not fix those and if your \nassumptions are not honest, then you have a budget that is smoke and \nmirrors, and ineffective.\n  Now, what I am saying to Members on the other side and others who \nwill listen is do not jump to the conclusion that the most serious \nevent is the day that we do not extend the debt limit when it needs to \nbe extended.\n  Actually, an equally important day is coming when the President of \nthe United States has to decide whether he wants to help us get a \nreal--no smoke and mirrors--entitlement reform budget. Both of them are \nimportant events.\n  I will not place one above the other because I believe we must do \neverything we can this year--not next year, that is an election year; \nnot 2 years from now; right now, this year. We have to get a balanced \nbudget, with no assumptions that are too optimistic, and one that \nchanges entitlement programs to reduce their ever dramatic increases.\n  Now, I cannot put it any better than that. I am not suggesting I am \nfor a default. I am suggesting that is an important event. I believe we \nhave to put the other event right up there alongside it. We have to \nserve notice on the Secretary of the Treasury and the President that we \nare not just going to run out on this balanced budget. We think we have \ndone a job. We think it is positive. We think it is right.\n  Let me close by saying the reason that this is a big event is because \nfor the first time in 31 years, elected officials are saying, ``We care \nabout the future. It is not about today only. It is about the future. \nAnd we care about our children, not ourselves. We care about those yet \nunborn as much as ourselves.'' If we really believe that, we cannot \ncontinue to spend at what is currently, believe it or not, $482 million \na day--a day. That is the amount we are adding to the debt every day--\n$482 million. That is a lot.\n  Who will pay it? If we are standing up saying we do not care, well, \nsomebody is going to pay it. Do you know who is going to? The next \ngeneration, with a lost standard of living, because too much of the \nincome has to come back up here and pay for our profligacy.\n  That is not right. That is a big event for adult leaders. It is just \nas big an event as the event that is closing upon us on whether we \nincrease the debt limit, to let us borrow more or not.\n  I do not think the Secretary or the President should read anything \nmore into my statement than what I have said. It is pretty clear that I \nam not running off in some kind of trepidation because we are being \ntold about this need to extend the debt limit. For those who wonder \nabout that debt limit extension, let me suggest--none of which I \nadvocate--but there are a number of ways the Secretary of the Treasury \ncan pay some bills out there after that debt limit is extended, without \nextending it. They know it. The Secretary knows it.\n\n  There are at least four. A couple of them have serious political \nramifications. A couple of them they could use. It may be they do not \nwant to do that, even when push comess to shove. But we do not want to \nabandon our balanced budget. And I am repeating, the kind of balanced \nbudget we are talking about involves no optimistic economic \nassumptions, no smoke and mirrors. It is entitlement reform that is \nconsistent with what is happening to the budget under current \nentitlement programs which, run unabated, have no relationship to what \nwe can afford, just merrily run along, causing the debt to increase at \n$428 million a day.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while we are trying to arrange a vote \nhere on this important amendment, I would just revisit what our \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee was talking about: the \nbudget and spending.\n  Mr. President, the present budget for the fiscal year is $1.518 \ntrillion, in other words, one trillion five hundred eighteen billion \ndollars. The budget under consideration, of which this State, Justice, \nCommerce appropriation is a part thereof, is $1.602 trillion. So, one \ntrillion six hundred two billion dollars means spending is going up $84 \nbillion.\n  Which reminds me of my distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, \nthe Senator from Texas, always talking about those in the wagon who are \ngoing to have to get outside the wagon and start pulling it. The funny \nthing, like Pogo, ``We have met the enemy,'' we have met those in the \nwagon, ``and it is us.'' We have been spending literally hundreds of \nbillions more than we are taking in each year. While the budget itself \nincreases some $84 billion, interest costs increase $348 billion, or $1 \nbillion a day, as has just been referred to by the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee. \n\n[[Page S 14610]]\n\n  That is what is bothering this Senator--the reality of it all. We \npush and pull and tug and talk about those in the wagon, out of the \nwagon, and hard choices and biting bullets. But the comeuppance is that \nwe continue to spend way more, and we act like we can actually \neliminate the deficit by cutting spending. That is absolutely false. It \nis going to take taxes.\n  They do not want to say the word ``taxes'' around this town except to \ncut them, because a little poll you take, whether it is a Republican \npoll or a Democratic poll, says that is political poison. A hot-button \nitem is what they call it. So what you do is you get out and you are \nfor the family and you are against taxes. You are against crime and for \nprisons and on and on, this nonsensical charade we are engaged in.\n  The truth is, having been in the vineyards here, trying our dead-\nlevel best with others. We tried a freeze. Then we tried a freeze and \nspending cuts. Then we tried a freeze, spending cuts and loophole \nclosings. Then we tried a freeze, spending cuts, loophole closings and \na value-added tax. And then just most recently, we opposed new programs \nthat we cannot afford--AmeriCorps.\n  I stated yesterday the AmeriCorps Program took away 346,000 student \nloans in order to fund 20,000 to 25,000 student loans. Actually, it is \nthe Federal Government cost of some $20,000 per student on AmeriCorps, \nplus $6,000 from private and local government resources, so it is \n$26,000. I remember when I got out of law school, if I could have \ngotten paid $26,000 I would have jumped for joy. I would have jumped \nfor joy.\n  I can tell you now--voluntarism? At $26,000 a head, you call it \nvolunteer? Let us cut out the charade and get down to brass tacks and \nrealize it is going to be way, way more than any kind of spending cuts.\n  The idea of a broad-based consumption tax I proposed over 10 years \nago, almost 15 years ago. Now they are copying the idea to replace--I \nhave been through about seven tax reforms in my 28, almost 29 years. \nThe need is not to replace; the need is to replenish. What we need is \nmore money, not different money. So the flat tax is now a wave--a hot-\nbutton item, again in the poll, where we are just going to do it one \nway and replace the income and replace the corporate and replace \neverything, every other kind of tax. The truth of the matter is, rather \nthan cutting taxes, we need to increase the taxes. And the bill to \nincrease the taxes is presently, and has been, in the Finance Committee \nfor the past 4 or 5 years. I have introduced it right regularly. They \nquit having hearings on it.\n  I will never forget the one hearing we had 5 years ago with Senator \nBentsen as chairman. As I was leaving the Finance Committee room, a \ncouple of the Finance Committee members said, ``If we had a secret \nballot we would pass that thing out unanimously. We need it now.'' That \nwas before the 1992 election for President Bush's reelection.\n  Of course, we were up to then $400 billion deficits, and the \nDemocrats did not win the 1992 election so much as the Republicans lost \nthat election. I campaigned in it. I know it intimately.\n  Once again, we are going through the tortures of big talk about how \nwe are really going to balance this budget by the year--they put it out \nwhere nobody can get their hands on it--2002; 7 years hence. We used to \ndo it in a year. Then we went to 3 years. Then we went to 5 years. This \ncrowd over here has it for 7 years. And the President has it for 10 \nyears. You meet another Congress and they will have it in 15 years and \nup, up and away.\n  But they do not want to write that. They write in a very reverent, \nrespectful, studious term--the media does--that the present budget on \nwhich we are now torturing would balance in the year 2002. That is \nabsolutely false. It has no chance of doing it. Simple arithmetic--it \nis not going to take care of the interest payments. The interest \npayments are $1 billion a day. There is no plan here. The cuts? You \ntake the consummate cuts right across the board, there is not $1 \nbillion a day to get on top of the increases.\n  Like the famous character in ``Alice in Wonderland'', in order to \nstay where we are, we have to run as fast as we can. In order to get \nahead, we have to run even faster.\n  That is the reality. Nobody wants to talk about it because the poison \nin politics is taxes. I will never forget, back in 1949, 1950, when \nJimmy Byrnes--former Senator Byrnes, Secretary of State, Supreme Court \nJustice, Governor--he had just come in as Governor. I had a little \ncommittee. I said, ``This is South Carolina, our little lowest per-\ncapita income State next to Mississippi. We have ground to a halt. We \nneed money. We are going to have to put in a sales tax.''\n  We could not even get the senators to meet with us. We just had House \nmembers. I chaired that House group. We sold the idea to Governor \nByrnes, and he put it over. Mind you me, we never could have done it \nwithout the Governor's leadership. But we put in a sales tax at that \nparticular time for public education, so that then, when we went out \nand solicited industrial development in South Carolina, we could talk \nnot only of good schools, but fiscally-responsible government.\n  We did not balance that budget in South Carolina until I finally came \nin, in 1958. I again raised taxes over the objections. What we did was \nwe got the first triple A credit rating from Texas all the way up to \nMaryland. So, as a young Governor, I had, as a calling card, a triple A \ncredit rating, which South Carolina has now lost, again with this item \nof growth--growth. And we are going to have a property tax cut and we \nare not going to pay the bills and we are going to put the nuclear \nfacility up for sale and start storing nuclear waste all over again at \nSavannah River; going backwards.\n  That virus is at the local level, at the Federal level and throughout \nthe land. We have to kill it if we are ever going to get competitive \ninternationally.\n  If we can pay our bills, develop a competitive trade policy, cut out \nthis nonsense about free trade and join the real world and get a \ncompetitive trade policy--Cordell Hull said reciprocal trade policy--\nthen we will begin to survive and rebuild this economy and clean up our \ncities and get rid of the drug and crime problems and come forward like \na great America that I came into in my early years.\n  With this plan, these programs now have been taken over by the \npollsters and we are going right straight down the tubes. We are \ntalking nonsense. The media is going along with it. They think it is \ngreat progress. It is not great progress--a half a hair cut--because we \nhad that great progress last year and we had that great progress the \nyear before. We had the great progress the year before that. Like \nTennessee Ernie Ford, ``another day older and deeper in debt.'' The \ndebt continues to go and grow and go and grow. It took us 200 years of \nour history before Ronald Reagan came to town. When he came to town \nafter that 200 years and 38 Presidents, Republican and Democrat, we \nwere less than $1 trillion. And $903 billion was the deficit and debt. \nWe had with President Ford an economic summit, and everything else of \nthat kind after the OPEC cartel crisis, and what have you. When \nPresident Reagan came to town, he said, ``First I am going to balance \nthe budget in a year,'' and then said, ``Oops--this is way worse than I \nthought. It is going to take 3 years. We are going to get rid of waste, \nfraud, and abuse.''\n\n  We had the Grace Commission. I served on the Grace Commission. I got \nme a picture here earlier this year, but Peter Grace and I started \nimplementing his savings. We had to report annually. By 1989 we had \nimplemented some 85 percent of the Grace program. But then we stopped, \nand we quit reporting.\n  But the truth is the Budget Committees have come along. Republicans \nand Democrats have voted for taxes in the Budget Committee. We got \neight votes for a value-added tax because back 5 years ago, we could \nsee the coming default and the debt growing up, up, and away.\n  So now after Reaganomics, voodoo, riverboat gamble, now we have \nvoodoo all over again. We are talking about it again by the very author \nof voodoo, the chairman of the Finance Committee. That started off as--\nwhat is that football player's name? Kemp. Yes. That is right. Kemp-\nRoth. I remember when the distinguished majority leader said we are not \ngoing that direction. He said, ``You cannot go that way. We have got to \nstart paying the bills.'' But the Presidential political pressures that \ncome from Gingrich to go to Gramm to come to Dole have got us all \n\n[[Page S 14611]]\ntalking nonsense here on the floor of the U.S. Congress. We are talking \nagain in the Finance Committee of devastating health care. Last year, \nthey were saying, ``Oh. What is the matter? We have the best health \ncare on the planet.'' Last year, we had a survey by the very group they \nquote this year that said Medicare was going broke by the year 2001. \nThis year they are saying it is going broke by the year 2002. Now they \nsay what they are trying to do is save it.\n  Well, they come in with a contract that increases the deficit and \nMedicare some $25 billion because, yes, without that contract crowd, we \nvoted to increase taxes on Social Security, liquor, cigarettes, \ngasoline, and everything else and cut spending $500 billion which has \nthe stock market and the economy, they say, going up and away. But the \ntruth is that of that $25 billion that we got from the increase in \nSocial Security taxes, we allocated it to Medicare and they said, \n``Abolish that.'' No. We do not believe in that. They are playing the \ngame, the pollster proposition of Social Security and saying that we \nare trying to frighten the American people.\n  The debt now has gone not just to $1 trillion as it did in 1981, but \nto $2 trillion, to $3 trillion, to $4 trillion. It is right now at $4.9 \ntrillion, and it is going up $5 trillion and on and away, because of \nwhat? We are in the wagon. The kids, the children, the grandchildren \nare the ones pulling the wagon. We are acting like the taxpayers are \nthe ones pulling the wagon. Well, they can hardly move the wagon. The \nwagon is drifting back. It is not being pulled. It is gradually going \nbackward into debt, and we are on board.\n  For the last 15 years, the Senator from New Mexico and I have been \nworking in the Budget Committee, and it has gotten worse and worse. The \nrhetoric has gotten better. We really have them fooled--everybody out \nin the land, particularly in this editorial column crowd saying we are \nmaking progress, that we are going to balance the budget.\n  We are not even near it. We are doing some cutting. We are \ndevastating programs. But we are not balancing any budget because we \nwill not do all of the above, and all of the above includes taxes. And \nwe need that tax increase allocated to the deficit, and the debt.\n  Let us get on top of this fiscal cancer, excise it once and for all, \nand then start spending the amount of money that we need on Government \nitself rather than on past profligacy and waste. If you had a $74.8 \nbillion interest cost in 1980 and in 1996 in the President's budget, it \nis $346 billion, that means the interest cost alone has gone up to $273 \nbillion. That is exactly the level of domestic discretionary spending. \nYou take Congress, the courts, the Presidency, you take the Department \nof Commerce, Agriculture, Interior, Treasury--go right on across the \nGovernment itself, take the departments and domestic discretionary \nspending, it is right at $273 billion. We could double that budget, if \nwe were not wasting it on the interest cost on the national debt.\n  That interest is what I call ``taxes.'' This crowd that says they are \nnot against taxes is really for taxes. There are two things in life: \nDeath, and taxes. You cannot avoid them. There is a third thing. It is \nthe interest cost on the national debt. It cannot be avoided.\n  So what we are doing talking about no, we are not going to increase \ntaxes, is, yes, we are going to cut taxes. The truth of the matter is \nwe are going to cut taxes in order to increase the taxes more so the \ndebt can go up so the interest costs or the taxes on that debt go up. \nYou pay it, not avoid it, and you do not get anything more.\n  But we are in the wagon. All of us are in the wagon, and the children \nand the grandchildren, are hopefully going to pull it. I hope the \ncountry just does not come down in fiscal chaos. But whatever it is, we \nare in the wagon, and we are raising taxes every day $1 billion. We \nhave a tax increase on automatic pilot in this Government of $1 billion \na day. We are talking about cutting taxes. That is how ludicrous, \nridiculous, and outrageous this whole rhetoric has gotten in the \ntreatment by the media itself. They do not want to report the truth. \nThey do not want to report the facts. They go along with the political \ncharade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14609-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14611-S14629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2819\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico to restore funds for the Legal \nServices Corporation.\n  The words inscribed on the wall of the Supreme Court building capture \nthe idea at the very heart of our constitutional democracy: ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.''\n  The Constitution guarantees to every man and woman in this country \nthe same rights and privileges before the law. Indeed, we require \nFederal judges to take an oath to render justice equally to the poor \nand to the rich.\n  But our courts are largely powerless to render justice to persons who \nare too poor to afford a lawyer to assist them in protecting their \nlegal rights. And a constitutional right without a remedy is no \nconstitutional right at all.\n  The bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee would \nunleash an unprecedented assault on the rights of our most impoverished \ncitizens. It would eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, which \nCongress established more than 20 years ago with the active support of \nPresident Richard Nixon.\n  And though it would authorize the Attorney General to make civil \nlegal assistance block grants to the States through the Office of \nJustice Programs, it would not earmark one penny of funds for this \nprogram and it would impose unprecedented and excessive restrictions on \nthe ability of legal services programs to represent poor people.\n  There are compelling reasons why the legal services program should be \nadministered by an independent Federal corporation. First, and \nforemost, litigation to protect the legal rights of poor people often \nantagonizes powerful interests in the community. President Nixon \nrecognized this when he introduced what later became the Legal Services \nCorporation Act. He said,\n\n       The program is concerned with social issues and is thus \n     subject to unusually strong political pressures * * * if we \n     are to preserve the strength of the program we must make it \n     immune to political pressures and make it a permanent part of \n     our system of justice.\n\n  Many of my colleagues will recall that Federal support for civil \nlegal services for the poor was first provided by the Office of \nEconomic Opportunity [OEO] and later by the Community Services \nAdministration, each of which was part of the executive branch. But in \nthe early 1970's, the Federal program became the subject of heated \npolitical debate.\n  During this period, President Nixon's Commission on Executive \nReorganization concluded that the legal services program should not be \nmaintained in the executive branch and that a new structure should be \ncreated to administer the program.\n  Congress responded to that recommendation with passage of the Legal \nServices Corporation Act of 1974. In its Statement of Findings and \nDeclaration of Purpose, Congress found that ``to preserve its strength, \nthe legal services program must be kept free from the influence of or \nuse by it of political pressures''; and ``attorneys providing legal \nassistance must have full freedom to protect the best interests of \ntheir clients in keeping with * * * [professional responsibility] and \nthe high standards of the legal profession.''\n  An independent Federal corporation remains the best way today to \nassure that powerful constituencies do not pressure legal services \nlawyers not to protect their clients' legal rights. A block grant \nprogram simply cannot insulate these lawyers from political pressure.\n  Nothing in the bill requires States to apply for block grant funds. \nNothing in the bill prohibits States from denying block grant funds to \nprograms that challenge unlawful State actions.\n\n[[Page S 14612]]\n\n  Suppose a Governor issues an Executive order that violates the \nconstitutional rights of a poor person. A legal services program that \nrepresents that poor person runs the risk of antagonizing the political \nestablishment and losing its funding.\n  Let me say to my colleagues: Put yourself in the position of that \nclient. Suppose your Governor issued an order that violated your \nconstitutional rights. Suppose you went to your lawyer and asked that a \nsuit be filed. Suppose your lawyer said to you that the law firm \ndepended on the Governor for its funding. You would want to get another \nlawyer, would you not?\n  Poor people cannot get another lawyer. They depend on legal services \nprograms. Those programs must be free to protect their clients' legal \nrights, without fear of losing their funds.\n  The committee bill is also unacceptable because it would drastically \ncut the level of Federal support for legal services. Last year, the \nLegal Services Corporation received $400 million. The fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations bill passed by the House allocates $278 million for the \nCorporation. The Legal Services Corporation is eliminated by the Senate \nbill, and only $210 million are earmarked for the Office of Justice \nPrograms to pay for the block grant program the bill would establish.\n  This is far less than is necessary to support this important program. \nLegal needs studies from numerous States across the country have \nconsistently shown that only 15 to 20 percent of civil legal needs of \nthe poor are met by current funding levels.\n  The proposed cut in the legal services program is far more draconian \nthan those experienced in the early 1980's, when President Reagan \nproposed abolishing the Legal Services Corporation, and Senator Warren \nRudman and others successfully fought to preserve the program. In 1981, \nCongress slashed LSC funds by 25 percent, to $241 million. The \ncommittee bill contemplates $210 million for 1996, nearly a 50-percent \ncut from last year's appropriation, and less than half in real terms of \nwhat was appropriated in the leanest years during the Reagan \nadministration.\n  The proposed restrictions on the activities of legal services lawyers \nin the committee bill make it clear that the bill is not merely an \nassault on the Legal Services Corporation. It is an attack on poor \npeople across America, and on the very concept of equal justice under \nlaw.\n  The bill would forbid legal services programs that receive Federal \nfunds to file suit on behalf of poor people who have been denied public \nbenefits. And it sharply restricts other actions that programs can \nbring against poor people:\n  If a mother with small children lost her job and was illegally denied \nfood stamps, this bill would forbid legal services programs to sue to \nget her family the food stamps they need.\n  If a poor widow was denied her Social Security benefits, this bill \nwould forbid legal services programs to represent her in court.\n  If a poor family is ripped off by a merchant who sold them shabby \ngoods, this bill would forbid legal services programs to bring that \nmerchant to justice.\n  If an indigent veteran has his electricity wrongfully shut off in the \nmiddle of winter, this bill would forbid legal service programs to \nrepresent him in an emergency proceeding to have his power restored.\n  Perhaps the most offensive limitation on legal services lawyers \ncontained in the committee bill is the prohibition against ``any \nchallenge to the constitutionality of any statute.'' Poor people would \nbe denied counsel to protect their constitutional rights.\n  No longer would it be true that, as Justice Jackson wrote more than \nforty years ago, under our system of laws, ``[t]he mere fact of being \nwithout funds is a neutral fact--constitutionally an irrelevance, like \nrace, creed or color.'' Instead, the committee bill would place a brand \nnew amendment in our Constitution: ``The foregoing does not apply to \npersons too poor to afford counsel.''\n  The Domenici amendment also contains restrictions on the activities \nof legal services offices, and I do not agree with all of these limits. \nBut the Domenici restrictions are far less severe, and far less \nintrusive than the restrictions in the underlying bill. Many are in \ncurrent law already.\n  It is clear that some restrictions are necessary to ensure support \nfor the program, and the Domenici restrictions on the use of funds in \nthis bill are reasonable under these circumstances.\n  Almost 45 years ago, Judge Learned Hand said that ``[if] we are to \nkeep our democracy, there must be one commandment: Thou shall not \nration justice.'' The committee bill would not simply ration justice, \nit would put it out of reach for many of our poorest citizens.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico would correct \nthe harsh injustice of the committee bill and enable the Corporation to \ncontinue its important work of securing justice in the courts for poor \npeople. I urge the Senate to support the Domenici amendment.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment of my friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from New Mexico, which would continue the commitment of \nthis Nation for the development of legal services for low-income \nAmericans. I am very hopeful that his amendment will be adopted. I am \ntroubled by some of the restrictions that have been placed upon the \nactivities of legal service lawyers in his proposal. But I think that \nit is a commendable amendment. I hope that it will be accepted by the \nMembers.\n  Listening to those opposed to this amendment, I was thinking about \nthe availability of lawyers to those who have financial resources. The \nfact of the matter is we have a legal service program for the \nwealthiest individuals and the wealthiest companies in this country, \nand it is subsidized by the taxpayers. When any corporation is in \ntrouble, for example, at the time of the Ill-Wind procurement scandals, \nthat company hires every single lawyer in sight and writes it off as a \nbusiness expense. So who do you think helps pick up the tab? The \ntaxpayers.\n  When we have an investigation about the $200 toilet seats in the \nmilitary, and those companies hire expensive lawyers and then deduct \nthose as business expenses, who do you think subsidizes that? It is the \ntaxpayers.\n  And so the wealthiest, most powerful interests, the major financial \ninterests in this country have at their fingertips the best available \nlawyers and those salaries are being paid, in part, by the taxpayers. \nThe poorest of the poor do not have that particular luxury. They are \npaying out of their pockets and pocketbooks.\n  Some of us who have been longtime supporters of the legal service \nprogram. As the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, this has been a \nlongstanding bipartisan commitment. President Nixon understood the \nimportance of the development of an independent corporation that would \nbe guided by a board composed of outstanding lawyers, carefully \nselected over a long period of time under Republican and Democrat \nPresidents. The Legal Services Corporation has tried to give the words \n``equal justice under law,'' a principle enshrined on the walls of the \nSupreme Court of the United States, meaning for all Americans, not just \nwealthy Americans.\n  I am not going to spend the time to go through and rebut every \nargument offered by the program's opponents. They talk about \nbureaucracy in the legal services program. But the most recent \nevaluation by the GAO indicates that only about 3 percent of the LSC \nbudget goes toward administrative costs.\n  I will just take a moment of the Senate's time to talk about \nsomething that is interesting and ironic. About 2 hours ago, we passed \nby a vote of 99 to 0 an amendment to fully fund a program to help \nbattered women. But look at what is out there in terms of the legal \nservice programs that really implement the spirit of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. Look at what is happening to those who provide some \nprotection for the battered and the violence against women and family \nviolence against children in our society.\n  Family law, which includes the representation of victims of domestic \nviolence, is the single largest category of cases handled by legal \nservices programs across the Nation. One out of every three of the 1.7 \nmillion cases that legal services programs handle each year involves \nfamily law.\n  Mr. President, I will just read portions of a note from Judith \nLennett of \n\n[[Page S 14613]]\nthe Massachusetts Coalition of Battered Women Service Groups. I think \nit fairly typical of legal services, how they spend their funds:\n\n       Legal assistance aimed at protecting women and children \n     from the devastating impact of domestic violence is the \n     highest family law priority of virtually every local legal \n     service project in Massachusetts. Based on fiscal year 1994 \n     data collected by the Massachusetts legal services program, \n     4,600 low-income people received legal assistance in family \n     matters from Massachusetts legal services programs. The \n     overwhelming majority of these individuals are adult victims \n     of domestic violence.\n       Without civil legal assistance in custody and visitation \n     cases, the children of domestic violence are vulnerable to \n     being ordered into the custody of the men who beat their \n     mothers. There is a solid body of clinical literature \n     describing the severe trauma suffered by these children, and \n     many of them will be even more deeply damaged without legal \n     advocacy of the kind provided by the legal services program.\n       In addition, the studies show that economic dependence is \n     one of the most powerful barriers to escape for battered \n     women. Without legal services in child support actions, many \n     victims of violence will be forced to remain in or return to \n     extremely dangerous situations. Sixty thousand people are \n     likely to lose access to this critically needed legal \n     assistance if these cuts go into effect.\n\n  This is what we are talking about. This is a third of all the legal \nservices resources out there. And do not fool yourself, Mr. President. \nWith the Gramm block grant proposal, you are leaving it up to the \nStates. Some States may provide it; some States may not, just as \nSenator Gramm has pointed out.\n  Many of us believe that the concept of equal justice under the law \nmeans equal justice under law. And while there is 1 attorney for every \n305 members of the general population, it is 1 attorney for every 500 \npoor people.\n  Mr. President, the Domenici amendment reaffirms this Nation's \ncommitment to equal justice under law. It deserves the strong \nbipartisan support that it will receive.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, after consultation with the two leaders, I \nwould like to ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 3 o'clock I be \nrecognized to make a motion to table the Domenici amendment No. 2819, \nand that the time between now and 3 o'clock be equally divided between \nSenator Domenici and myself to complete debate on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object. I wonder if the manager \nwould be amenable to permitting me to offer two very brief amendments \nat this time?\n  This pending amendment has been debated now for several hours. We \nhave a lot of amendments to complete. And I would very much appreciate \nthe chance--I have two amendments we could complete debate on between \nnow and 3 p.m. if the distinguished manager and the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico would forgo further debate. We have had hours \non it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, if I might respond, Mr. President.\n  I have been informed by the floor staff that we have other people who \nhave been waiting to offer amendments. We have two others who were \nplanning to be here after 3 to offer their amendments. So I could not \nagree to a unanimous-consent request to put the Specter amendments \nbefore them, though, obviously, after 3, if the Domenici amendment is \ntabled, then the floor will be open for another amendment. If it is not \ntabled, it is going to be the pending business and another amendment \nwill not be in order.\n  So, I am not in a position at the moment to add that to the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, continuing to reserve the right to \nobject, the amendments that I have are right behind Senator Hatch and \nSenator Cohen. And if we proceed to further debate on the pending \namendment, which we have been debating for hours, neither Senator Hatch \nnor Senator Cohen will have an opportunity to offer their amendments.\n  If either was here, I would say, fine. But it is now 2:25 on Friday \nafternoon. We have accomplished almost no business today, and I suggest \nthat if we take my two amendments, we could proceed to get something \ndone.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Amen.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, Mr. President, I have asked unanimous consent to try \nto expedite matters by being recognized to make a motion to table the \nDomenici amendment at 3 p.m. I do believe that Senator Domenici is \ngoing to want to restate his case, and it is a case that needs \nrestating many times if it is to be persuasive.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Further reserving the right to object, if the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, would not re-re-re-restate--that is \nnot stuttering; that is how many times he stated it-- we could move on \nto something else.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the Senator from Texas ought to speak for the \nnext 35 minutes to see if he could convince anyone.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Minds are not going to be changed here.\n  Why do we not move on with this bill? We have two amendments. Let us \ntake them and get going.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues, in addition to \nthe Domenici amendment, we have the Kerrey amendment which is pending \nand we have a Biden amendment which is pending.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What is wrong with taking this up? We can take this up \nand kill the half hour.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, the problem is--I do not have to have unanimous \nconsent, Mr. President, to move to table the Domenici amendment. I was \nsimply trying to tell my colleagues what the procedure was going to be, \nto try to bring a little order to it. It is not my intention to see the \nDomenici amendment withdrawn prior to my motion to table that amendment \nat 3 p.m.\n  We have another amendment that is the pending business, a Kerrey \namendment. We have a Biden amendment. So I think the best thing for us \nto do is to try to finish the debate on the Domenici amendment, have a \nvote to table it, see where we are on that amendment. And at that time, \nif it is tabled, we will revert back to these other amendments. If the \npeople who have offered them want to proceed with them at that point, \nthey have standing to do so.\n  If they would be willing to step aside and allow the Senator from \nPennsylvania to get the floor, set aside their amendments, and offer \nhis amendment, if that is something he can work out with them, then I \nwould certainly be happy to see that happen. The problem is we have a \nwhole bunch of people who have been waiting for an opportunity to offer \ntheir amendments. We do not have an agreed-to time schedule set.\n  So basically that is where we are. So let me renew my unanimous \nconsent request. If there is an objection, I would just notify my \ncolleagues that at 3 p.m., or as near to that as I can get the floor, I \nwill move to table the Domenici amendment. But to try to convenience \nour colleagues, I would like to ask again unanimous consent that at the \nhour of 3 p.m., I be recognized to make a motion to table the Domenici \namendment No. 2819 and that the time between now and 3 p.m. be equally \ndivided between Senator Domenici and myself.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object. I would make one more \neffort to ask that the unanimous consent request be amended to ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the Domenici amendment, if the Senator \nfrom New Mexico agrees not to have further debate, and to set aside the \nother pending amendments, and in the course of the next 30 minutes to \ncomplete two amendments, 15 minutes equally divided on each side.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest by the Senator from Texas, first?\n  Hearing none, so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the unanimous consent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes of debate, equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S 14614]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes off my time to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the clash between ideas, which is \nevidenced in this amendment, is a difficult one, because there are \nvalid points to be made on each side of that argument.\n  On the side of the Senator from New Mexico is the obvious proposition \nthat it is an important priority for society to provide access to the \ncourts in civil litigation or in civil claims for those who are too \npoor, who do not have the economic wherewithal, to hire their own \nlawyers.\n  We, as a society, wish to see that justice is done. We do not wish to \ndeny that justice to people simply on economic grounds, and we know of \nlarge numbers of people in many classes who need the kind of assistance \nwhich they can get, not solely but frequently, almost alone from an \norganization like the Legal Services Corporation.\n  On the other side is the argument that lawyers of the governing body \nof the Legal Services Corporation have misused the money and the \nauthority that they have been given by Congress to bring lawsuits \ndesigned primarily to meet social or political ends of those lawyers or \nof that governing body in which the poor plaintiffs are not much more \nthan nominal parties, to use that money often for political or \nideological ends which may clash not only with conservative thought but \nwith any administration, no matter how liberal that administration may \nbe.\n  In that clash, Mr. President, it seems to me that the Senator from \nNew Mexico has the better of the argument because he preserves that \nfirst social goal of seeing to it under many circumstances the poor can \nbe represented in court while attempting, and I think attempting with a \nlarge degree of success, to prevent the misuse of this Federal money.\n  It is rightfully not only annoying but regarded as an outrage by many \npeople in our society that they, as employers or as landowners or as \nindividuals, are sued by use of their own money.\n  May I have another minute from Senator Domenici?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is a justified objection, Mr. President. But I am \nconvinced that we have an opportunity, if we go along the road that the \nSenator from New Mexico has set out for us, to retain what is good and \nwhat is important in the Legal Services Corporation and prevent the \nexcesses to which many of our citizens have been subjected in the past \nand about which we have heard.\n  If it turns out that these requirements, that these limitations do \nnot work, that these injustices continue, well, we are dealing with \nonly a 1-year appropriations bill. We can deal with those objections at \na another time relatively soon in the future.\n  So it is for that reason, Mr. President--that we can retain what is \nappropriate about the Legal Services Corporation, and we can at least \nbegin, and perhaps succeed, in reining in the excesses of that \ncorporation--that I support the position outlined so well by the \nSenator from New Mexico and ask that we accept his amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. The Senator from Texas \nhas 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank you for your recognition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will Senator Gramm yield for 10 seconds?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Gorton, I want to thank \nhim for his remarks. I very much appreciate it. It is very helpful to \nme hearing that statement from him. He is one of the most renowned of \nthe attorneys around here, even though he is not an attorney or lawyer \nany longer, and I very much appreciate it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me go back, because we have had a lot \nsaid, a lot of intellectual sparring, from people who spoke with \npassion on both sides of the issue. This is an important issue, because \nyou have busy people who are in the process of debating it. But let me \nremind my colleagues of how we got to this point.\n  First of all, we adopted a budget that set out a goal of balancing \nthe Federal budget in 7 years, and in that budget, we set out a target \nnumber, not binding but set out as a guideline, to fund Legal Services \nCorporation at $278 million.\n  In the allocation of funds to the Commerce, State, Justice \nSubcommittee, we were given $3.4 billion less money than President \nClinton had to write his budget; we were given $1.2 billion less than \nthe comparable committee in the House. And in spreading that reduction \nin spending, I reduced the funding level for Legal Services Corporation \nproportionately to $210 million.\n  Senator Domenici is proposing raising the funding level to $340 \nmillion. I think there are a lot of issues that are important here. Let \nme just go through each of them.\n  The first issue has to do with offsets. In order to increase the \nlevel of funding for Legal Services Corporation to $340 million, \nSenator Domenici has to cut other programs in order to make that \npossible.\n  I think it is important my colleagues decide not whether or not they \nwant to fund the Legal Services Corporation, but whether or not it is \nworth it to take the money away from other programs in order to pay for \nit. I want to ask my colleagues look at those other programs.\n  In order to fund the Legal Services Corporation, a corporation that \nSenator Domenici, in his own amendment, says needs to be dramatically \nchanged, its actions need to be reined in--I submitted for the Record \nletters from everybody, from the Farm Bureau to Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, letters from outside groups that would like to \neliminate or dramatically reduce funding for legal services. But quite \naside, the question is, is it worth taking money away from those things \nthat Senator Domenici proposes taking money away from in order to fund \nthe program? Let me review a few of those proposed offsets.\n  In order to fund a Federal Legal Services Corporation, Senator \nDomenici proposes to reduce general legal activities in the Justice \nDepartment by $25 million. I remind my colleagues that we are already \n$10 million below the President's request. This will take us to $35 \nmillion below the President's request, and this will eliminate roughly \n200 prosecutors in the following areas: Prosecutors in the area of \norganized crime, major drug trafficking, child pornography, major fraud \nagainst the taxpayer, terrorism and espionage, and other types of \nactivities that fall within the Federal jurisdiction.\n  The first question I would like to ask is, is it important enough to \nyou to fund Legal Services Corporation above the level set out in the \nbudget that we adopted in the U.S. Senate; is it important enough that \nwe ought to take 200 prosecutors away from prosecuting organized crime, \nchild pornography, major drug trafficking, major fraud against the \ntaxpayer, terrorism and espionage? I think that is the first question.\n  The second question is, in order to fund a Federal Legal Services \nCorporation at a level above the level that we set out in the budget \nthat we adopted, the Domenici amendment cuts the U.S. Attorney's Office \nby $11 million. That means that with the adoption of this amendment, we \nwill have 55 fewer assistant U.S. attorneys and 55 fewer support \npersonnel than we will have if the amendment is not adopted.\n  So the relevant question is not do you want to give the Legal \nServices Corporation more money, but do you want the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice to have more prosecutors to prosecute people who are selling \ndrugs at the door of every junior high school in America?\n  The Domenici amendment to fund the Legal Services Corporation at a \nlevel above the level contemplated in the budget that we adopted in the \nU.S. Senate proposes cutting the FBI by $49 million. These funds will \nlargely come out of the FBI Academy at Quantico, VA. This academy is \nthe most important training facility for law enforcement in the United \nStates of America. This project was endorsed by 91 Senators who voted \nfor the Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995.\n  The question is not do you want to give more money to legal services, \nnot do you want to fund legal services at a level above the level we \ncontemplated in the budget we adopted in the Senate, \n\n[[Page S 14615]]\nbut are you willing to take $49 million away from the FBI, away from \nthe principal construction project at the FBI Academy which, each year, \nfunds the training of 1,225 of the most outstanding law enforcement \nofficials in America.\n  The Domenici amendment, in order to fund the legal services \nCorporation at a level above the level contemplated in our budget, cuts \nthe Federal judiciary by $25 million. Let me put that into people. That \nis 400 probation officers, who could supervise convicted felons who are \nout on the street under supervised parole. That is 400 probation \nofficers who, in conjunction with the overall program, could carry out \nthe mandatory drug testing of all released convicts to assure that they \nare not on drugs.\n  I could go on, Mr. President, but the basic point is that the \nDomenici amendment is cutting prosecutors, courts, the FBI, and \nprobation officers in order to fund the Legal Services Corporation. \nWhat does the bill that Senator Domenici would amend do? What it does \nis it funds Legal Services Corporation at $210 million. It block grants \nthat money back to the States exactly as we block grant AFDC, exactly \nas we are going to block grant Medicaid, and it allows the States to \nset up a system to contract with attorneys to represent poor people. It \neliminates a superstructure, which is largely responsible for the use \nof this agency to promote a political agenda which is largely not the \nagenda of the American people.\n  Senator Domenici claims in his amendment to tighten up on what the \nagency can do with this money, but the restrictions imposed are less \nrestrictive than the provisions that are actually in the bill now. And \nin several areas, they simply have major loopholes. For example, the \nDomenici amendment says legal services is banned from legislative \nlobbying. But there is a major loophole, section 14B, that allows funds \nto be used to lobby for more funds and for fewer restrictions.\n  The Domenici amendment prohibits the use of money for legal services \nfor filing lawsuits having to do with congressional and legislative \nredistricting. As I pointed out, that is the law of the land. In 1990, \nwhen the Texas Rural Legal Aid filed a lawsuit against redistricting in \nTexas and the Bush-appointed Legal Services Corporation Board attempted \nto cut their funding, they filed a lawsuit; the funding continued, and \nwhen President Clinton's Legal Services Board took office, they settled \nthe suit out of court, and the funding continues for Texas legal aid.\n  The problem is that this is an agency which has not carried out the \nwill of Congress, and despite the fact that literally a dozen times we \nhave tried to rein in the Federal superstructure of this agency, we \nhave never been successful in doing it. The proposal that I made--the \nlanguage that is in the bill--is taking the funds, giving the funds to \nthe State, cutting out this bureaucracy and this Federal infrastructure \nand letting the funds be used to represent poor people who need legal \nassistance.\n  I think this is an amendment that should be defeated. I know that \nthere is strong support for a Federal Legal Services Corporation. I \npersonally do not share the philosophy or the views of those who are \nfor it. But I ask my colleagues--even those who are for it--to look at \nthe cuts that are instituted to pay for it and ask themselves: Do we \nwant more prosecutors? Do we want more funding for FBI? Do we want more \ncourts? Or do we want to give more money to a Federal program that has \nprobably been more abused than any other Federal program that was born \nin the Great Society era?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not know if there are any others on \nthe Domenici-Hollings amendment side who would like to speak. So, in \nprecaution, because there may be some, will the Chair tell me when I \nhave used 7\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When the Senator has used 7\\1/2\\ minutes or \nhas 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Tell me when I have used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me first start and make sure that everybody \nunderstands that when this bill cleared the subcommittee under the \nleadership of Senator Gramm, when this amendment came out of his work \nproduct, it had no money in it for legal services, none. Senator \nHatfield put an amendment in to put some in it.\n  What actually happened, Mr. President, is that Senator Gramm decided, \nas I see it, not to fund legal services, so he went along the line on \nevery justice program, every prevention program, every law enforcement \nprogram, and he put a lot of extra money in it, so he could come to the \nfloor and say, if you take some away, you are cutting it. What he had \nactually done is eliminate all the money from this program and bump up \nthe funding levels on the above.\n  Let me give you an example. Let us talk about U.S. attorneys. The \nDomenici amendment is so bad for U.S. Attorneys that the U.S. House is \n$28 million worse. They have put $28 million less in U.S. attorneys \nthan when we are finished with the amendment of the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Let me tell you what my amendment does. It leaves an increase of $87 \nmillion. Who would have thought that from the argument made by my good \nfriend from Texas? If his numbers are correct, then what we have done \nis we have added 440 new U.S. attorneys. The Senator speaks of losing \n55. There are 440 new ones. No U.S. attorneys office, including my own, \nhas called me saying that the 440 additional U.S. attorneys, with all \ntheir support, was inadequate.\n  You see, if you put all the money in for these other purposes so \nthere is nothing left for legal services, then when legal services \ncomes to talk about needing funds, it looks like you'd have to cut \nother programs because there was no money left.\n  Let me go on with just one other one: the FBI building. First of all, \nI have never said we do not need modernization and new infrastructure \nand buildings for the Academy. I am one of its staunchest supporters. \nAs a matter of fact, 2 years ago, I believe Director Freeh will tell \nyou that it was Senator Domenici's amendment that added 350 people to \nthe FBI so they would have adequate support. Director Freeh called me \nup and thanked me profusely for helping the FBI. These 1,225 American \nFBI policemen who are going through that Academy are going to go \nthrough this Academy without any problem if the Domenici amendment is \nadopted.\n  What the Senator from New Mexico said is that there is over $80 \nmillion in here for a building that is not ready to be built. They will \nnot need the money until next year. Why do we have to put it all in \nthis year again? If you put all the money in that, there is no money \nleft for legal service.\n  When Senator Domenici comes to the floor and says, ``Put a little in \nlegal service,'' you have the FBI Academy. I cannot do any better than \nthat. My friend from Texas is eloquent in his ability to draw analogies \nand all the other kinds of things that are good in debate, that I do \nnot excel at. I am merely here as best I can, stating the facts.\n  Now, on another matter, my friend from Texas said we fund this \nprogram in this bill to the tune of $210 million. Once again, what is \nimportant about a program is not how much you fund it but how much you \nlet it spend.\n  The Senator from Texas has $210 million but what you can spend in the \nwhole year on lawyers for the poor is $53 million. That is what is \nallowed under this bill.\n  Now, having said that, clearly I want to repeat that President \nRichard Nixon was not afraid to say Republicans are concerned about \npoor people. He joined with the bar and said, ``Let us help poor people \nwho need lawyers. The American system of justice is built around equal \nrepresentation under the law.''\n  This program has gone far afield from Richard Nixon's day. My \namendment will bring it right back where it should have been, and the \nlist of prohibitions have been categorized unfairly by my friend from \nTexas as less strong than in the bill. I will just tick off the \nprinciple prohibitions. No class action \n\n[[Page S 14616]]\nlawsuits, no advocating of policies relating to redistricting, no \nadvocacy-influencing action by any legislation, constitutional \namendment referendum, no legal services for illegal aliens and on and \non. I will print the list in the Record again.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Summary: Domenici Legal Services Amendment\n\n\n                               in general\n\n       The amendment restores the Legal Services Corporation, \n     provides $340 million in funding for fiscal year 1996 and \n     adopts House Appropriations restrictions on use of funds. \n     Appropriate offsets will be found throughout the \n     appropriations bill.\n\n\n                                funding\n\n       Provides $340 million in FY 1996, $225 million through \n     August 31, 1996 and $115, to be provided upon the September \n     1, 1996, implementation of a competitive bidding system for \n     grants, as outlined in the amendment.\n\n\n       restrictions on use of funds by corporation and recipients\n\n       Advocating policies relating to redistricting (same as \n     House)\n       No class action lawsuits.

(same as House)\n       All non-LSC funds used to provide legal services by \n     recipients may not be used for the purposes prohibited by the \n     Act. (same as House)\n\n\n                           special provisions\n\n       Competitive bidding of grants must be implemented by \n     September 1, 1995, and regulations must be proposed 60 days \n     after enactment of the Act. Funds will be provided on an \n     ``equal figure per individual in poverty.''\n       Native Americans will receive additional consideration \n     under the act but no special earmarks are provided as have \n     existed in the past.\n       Restrictions shall apply only to new cases undertaken or \n     additional matters being addressed in existing cases.\n       Lobbying restrictions shall not be construed to prohibit a \n     local recipient from using non-LSC funds to lobby for \n     additional funding from their State or local government. In \n     addition, they shall not prohibit the Corporation from \n     providing comments on federal funding proposals, at the \n     request of Congress.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will return this to a slimmed-down legal services \nonly representing poor people in their individual cases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think the record should show not only the leadership \nof Senator Domenici but the leadership on behalf of the Senate here, \nbecause in essence what we have is Senator Gramm's position is not in \naccordance with the authorization.\n  There is no authorization. There have been no hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee to change over and abolish the Legal Services \nCorporation.\n  The fact is this Senator was waiting for a markup of this particular \ncommittee. My distinguished colleague, Senator Gramm, told me 2 or 3 \ndays before we were due he had one and would submit it to me, and we \nwaited those 2 or 3 days, and finally on the afternoon before we \nsubmitted the next morning I finally called the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Senator Hatfield, who said he was just getting together with \nSenator Gramm.\n  In essence, when we faced this particular markup, the subcommittee \nhad not met over it, and when we got to the full committee, the full \ncommittee said we would take it up on the floor. This is not a \ncommittee markup being amended. The truth of the matter is the \namendment of Senator Domenici really brings about the committee into \nits normal course of the treatment in accordance with the \nauthorization.\n  The fact is if this thing persists under the position of Senator \nGramm I will have to raise a point of order that it is an appropriation \nfor an unauthorized amount, because there is no authorization for the \nblock grant program that he conceived in his own mind.\n  The U.S. Senate in orderly procedure, in the Judiciary Committee and \notherwise, has not had a chance to have hearings. This is such an \noutstanding program that has brought civic leadership and \nparticipation--not just the $400 million that we are appropriating but \nsome $255 million that comes from the cities, the counties, the States, \nthe American bar and different private groups.\n  This has really engendered quite a contribution and an effort of some \n130,000 legal services lawyers paid at an average of around $30,000 a \nyear. You are not going to get that in block grants. We worked with the \nblock grants before, and to our embarrassment this is a subcommittee \nthat finally had to abolish it because it was whitewater rafting and \nmonkfish and tanks on the lawn, and airplanes so the Governor could fly \nto New York and everything else but law enforcement.\n  I am absolutely opposed to any block grants back to the States. Keep \nthe so-called cops on the beat on the one hand and the legal services \nattorneys representing the hungry poor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 3 minutes and 13 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me try to sort out the facts from the fiction.\n  First of all, there is no authorization for the Legal Services \nCorporation, period; nor has it been authorized since 1980. This is a \nprogram that Congress has consistently refused to authorize, but every \nyear we have appropriated for.\n  Now, we are getting a lot of gamesmanship on these numbers because in \nreality the proponents of this amendment want to act as if it is free \nto give $340 million to the Legal Services Corporation. It is not free.\n  Under the bill that is before the Senate, we are providing $10 \nmillion less for general legal activities in the Justice Department \nthan President Clinton asked for. The Domenici amendment will cut that \nfunding $25 million further.\n  What does that mean? That means eliminating 200 prosecutors and \nlitigators that are prosecuting organized crime, major drug \ntraffickers, child pornography, major fraud against the taxpayers, \nterrorism, and espionage cases.\n  Now, the question is, you can jimmy the numbers however you want. \nWould you rather spend $25 million prosecuting organized crime, drug \ntraffickers, child pornographers, fraud against the taxpayers, \nterrorism, and espionage, or fund a Federal legal services corporation? \nThat is the question.\n  This bill will provide 55 fewer assistant U.S. attorneys, 55 fewer \nsupport personnel than the bill that is before the Senate, in order to \nfund the Legal Services Corporation.\n  Would you rather have 55 more assistant U.S. attorneys to prosecute \npeople selling drugs at every junior high school in America, or would \nyou rather fund the Legal Services Corporation?\n  Finally, in terms of the FBI, Senator Domenici constantly confuses \ntwo projects. One, a technical support center which he cuts; but \nanother which is the upgrade of the FBI Academy, a project that we do \nhave plans for, a project that is desperately needed. In order to fund \na Federal legal services corporation, the Domenici amendment cuts the \nFBI by $49 million, denies the upgraded facilities at the FBI Academy, \nwhich is the most important law enforcement training center on the \nplanet.\n  Now, the question is this: Is it worth it to you to have a Federal \nlegal services corporation; and is it worth taking $49 million away \nfrom the FBI and the FBI Academy to fund it? I think the answer to that \nis no.\n  We have in the committee bill a block grant of legal services.\n  Our colleagues say you cannot block grant legal services because the \nStates will not do it right. Why do we trust them to do aid to families \nwith dependent children? Is having the ability to get legal \nrepresentation when you are drug dealing in public housing, to keep \nthem from kicking you out, more important than eating? Why do we trust \nthem to administer Medicaid? Is getting medical care less important \nthan getting a lawyer? I do not think so. \n\n[[Page S 14617]]\n\n  I think what we are seeing here is a commitment to a program which is \nthe most abused program of any program that was developed in the great \nsociety. Not even the proponents of maintaining the Federal program \nwill defend its record.\n  I believe this program should be block granted. I believe we should \nnot cut law enforcement to fund the Legal Services Corporation.\n  Mr. President, under the previous order I move to table the Domenici \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment No. 2819.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What was the vote, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas were 39 and the nays \n60.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Domenici \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have 60 votes. I wonder if the \nSenator would consider vitiating the yeas and nays on an up-or-down \nvote?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it had been my determination to continue to \nfight this amendment if it did not have the 60 votes in order to get \ncloture. Needless to say, I am disappointed. I think we are making a \nmistake here, but it is clear to me, as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I am never going to be able to eliminate the Legal Services \nCorporation. Since this is my last day as a member of this committee, I \nwill allow Senator Domenici to proceed with a voice vote. Having a \nrecorded vote, I assume, would produce the same result, would simply \ntie up the Senate's time, and as a result I ask unanimous consent to \nvitiate the requested rollcall vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm for his \ngentleness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate? I wish \nSenators would just stop and look around at what is going on in the \nSenate. There should be order in the Senate. The Senator has a right to \nbe heard, and other Senators have a right to understand what he is \nsaying.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will desist until the \nChair gets order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator will desist----\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Until there is order in the Senate. The Chair has the \nresponsibility to get order in the Senate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Whether or not it is requested from the floor. And I hope \nSenators will assist the Chair in getting order. This looks like the \nfloor of the New York Stock Exchange.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will carry their conversations \noutside the Senate.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have nothing to say. Why not vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 2819.\n  The amendment (No. 2819) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me first indicate that we are making \nprogress. I am not certain where, but somewhere we must be making \nprogress. It is still our hope we might be able to complete business \nsometime tomorrow or Monday. We are still in the Finance Committee. We \nhave 40 or 50 amendments left in the Finance Committee to deal with. I \ndo not see how we are going to do all that today.\n  In addition, one urgent thing we need to address is the continuing \nresolution because we have about 435 House Members who would like to \ndepart and they cannot do that until we pass the continuing resolution. \nI am advised by the Senator from New Hampshire, [Mr. Gregg], that he \nintends to offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment with reference to \nBosnia on the continuing resolution once it is before the Senate.\n  It is our hope, if it is necessary to offer that amendment, it can be \noffered on the State-Justice-Commerce bill. And also to notify the \nSenator from Texas his last day on the Appropriations Committee is when \nwe finish this bill. So if the Senator is in a hurry to leave, why, we \nhope he will cooperate in any event.\n  So I do not know precisely what to do here. I would like to expedite \nthis and everybody be able to go home tonight and not come back for 8 \ndays. But to do that we have to make some accommodations one way or the \nother. And we would like to pass the pending bill yet today. Senator \nHatfield is insisting we pass the Labor-HHS appropriations bill so all \nthe appropriations bills and the CR will have passed the Senate. This \ndoes not mean they are not going to be vetoed. They may not get to \nconference.\n  So if the Democratic leader has any suggestions, I will be happy to \nhear them.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would like to propound the unanimous-consent request \non the CR. I think we are prepared to enter into that arrangement. And \nI would like to work through the remaining amendments on Commerce, \nState, Justice. I think we have come to the point where we might be \nable to put most amendments in a package and dispose of that bill. And \nif we could work out some understanding of Labor, HHS, I think we could \neven do a voice vote on that one. So we are prepared to cooperate. And \nI think the first step would be the passage of the UC on the CR.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the leader entertain a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. It had been my original intention to offer this amendment, \n\n\n[[Page S 14618]]\nwhich simply states what I believe is the administration's policy, \nwhich is they should come to the Congress before they introduce 25,000 \nAmerican troops into Bosnia. I do think it our legitimate right as \nCongress to request that they do come to the Congress before that \noccurs.\n  It had been my intention to put this amendment on the continuing \nresolution, and put it on as a matter of law, raising that point. Now I \nhave agreed to move to a sense-of-the-Senate, which is a fairly \nsignificant reduction of position on my part.\n  Second, I even agreed to put it on the Commerce bill, which was an \neven more significant reduction on my part. What I am not getting is \nany cooperation on this from the other side for a time agreement. \nBasically, I am told there will be no agreement on a time agreement on \nthis.\n  Now, I can get this up now by putting it on the continuing \nresolution, which I think would be very appropriate. I think the House \nshould have a chance to act on this before they go home for a week and \nwe might find American troops moved into Bosnia while we are away.\n  But, as a practical matter, I am not willing to take that position if \nwe can get a vote on this today before we adjourn and before we get too \nfar into any further consideration of the Commerce bill, as I would \nhave had the opportunity to have such a vote had I put it on the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I do not feel this is being unreasonable. I think it is being very \nreasonable in the light of the timeframe here and in an attempt to work \nwith leadership.\n  Mr. DOLE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from New \nHampshire. I understand the Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, \nindicated a willingness to sit down with the Senator from New Hampshire \nto try to work out some language that could be supported. I do not have \nany idea what he has in mind. Maybe it is precisely what the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire already has.\n  Does Senator Nunn have a copy of your resolution?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, he does. We would like to work with it in view of the \nWhite House. It is basically language that already existed in another \npiece of legislation that I believe came through this body.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do not know why that language would \nhave to be offered on this legislation. It is not germane to the \nJustice-State-Commerce bill. It is not germane to the CR.\n  We are willing to try to accommodate the Senator if we can have some \ntime to look at the language and find out whether this is in keeping \nwith past precedent. We want to be sure that we are not cutting new \nground here. And I think perhaps over a period of time we might be able \nto resolve this matter.\n  We cannot do it now. There is no way we can agree to any time \nagreement until many of us have had a chance to look at it. So it will \nprobably be some time prior to the time we can give any assurance to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. But we will certainly look at it and \nsee if there is a way to do it in spite of the fact we do not think it \nbelongs on this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may respond to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is clearly germane because it is in terms of spending \nmoney for purposes of introducing troops into Bosnia. Now, that is \nclearly germane to a continuing resolution which involves spending \nmoney. And it is clearly topical and timely in light of the rather \nintense discussion that is going on about moving American troops into \nBosnia. It does seem appropriate that this body should speak on that \nissue before it occurs.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me first yield to the Senator from South Carolina, \nseeking recognition. I know it is for an accommodation.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, the reappointment of General \nShalikashvili we will take up this afternoon, that nomination, in order \nfor him to continue in office. It will not take over 10 minutes, I do \nnot think. I just wanted to remind everyone we will have to take it up.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will take it up before we recess because it is important \nand should be done.\n  I will be happy to yield to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who would like us to complete action on these two bills.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the leader.\n  Let me just reiterate the procedure we are in at this moment on these \ntwo appropriations bills.\n  To put it very bluntly, these are corpses, and all the prayers and \nall the amendments that you can pray or offer are not going to change \nthe reality that these two bills have been clearly identified as two \nbills to be vetoed. I, for the life of me, cannot understand the wasted \neffort that is going on on the floor and for the last 48 hours in \ntrying to revive a corpse. It just does not happen this way. It only \nhappened once. [Laughter.]\n  So consequently, it seems to me, if we could voice vote these two \nbills out, move the process with the CR, the reality is the White House \nand the Members of Congress, the Budget Committee people, the \nAppropriations Committee people, are going to have to revisit Defense; \nLabor-HHS; State, Justice, and Commerce; HUD and independent agencies; \nand possibly, although the House has now rereferred the bill back to \ncommittee, the report on the Interior. Those are veto bills.\n  Now, we are going to have to find more money. It is not a simple \nproposition to satisfy the White House on those three nondefense bills. \nSo I say, for one who cannot get a plane reservation on a moment's \nnotice like some can--I do have to go clear to the west coast--and my \ncolleagues like me, we cannot just find an hour and say, well, we are \ngoing to be finished in the next hour, and get a reservation. So have \nsome consideration, please, on that basis as well, the personal basis.\n  But I just want to say--there is no more blunt way I can put it--we \nare wasting our time on these two appropriations bills.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First of all, I am very responsive to the Senator's \npersonal plea. It strikes me this may be in the way of being an autopsy \nin order to find out why these bills are corpses, and that is the \nprocess we are engaged in, trying to discover what it is about these \nbills that made them corpses.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I could tell you simply, in conjunction with \ndiscussions with people at the White House and people representing the \nWhite House position, we did not have enough nondefense discretionary \ndollars for the 602(b) allocations. We had cut too much out of our \nbudget resolution of the program needs and the priorities of the White \nHouse, the dollars necessary to get their signature to these bills.\n   Mr. DOLE. As I understand it now, based on conversations with people \nI have confidence in at the White House, the President will not sign \nthese two bills. They are essentially dead. And I would like to remove \nthem from the Senate Chamber for last rites.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I think everybody here is extremely sympathetic to the \nmajority leader's problem in trying to get these bills passed and to \nget us out of here for a recess that everybody is looking forward to. \nNow, the chairman of the committee has just said that these bills are \ndead on arrival at the White House.\n  But here is the problem I have with that, and in not offering a \ncouple of amendments I feel very strongly about. The President, like \nevery Member of the Senate, reserves the right to change his mind. One \nof the prime objections he had to this bill was legal services, \ntorpedoing the Legal Services Corporation. We have just taken a giant \nstep toward satisfying one of the objections the President had to this \nbill.\n  If we legislate in a diligent way here, we might address a couple of \nothers, and he might sign it. If I do not offer my amendments and the \nPresident does sign the bill, I am out until 1996, as is every other \nSenator here. I want to be as cooperative as possible. I have a couple \nof amendments. I think one will be accepted; I will agree to a short \ntime agreement on the other. But I am reluctant to quit or to withdraw \nmy amendments or not offer them on the proposition that the President \nis going \n\n[[Page S 14619]]\nto veto all of them because, as I say, he may change his mind.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DOLE. My understanding is he will not change his mind, but I will \nbe happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, unless there is a resurrection that occurs \nhere, talking in metaphorical terms, there is no possibility that the \nPresident will sign the bill with your amendment in it or not--zero, \nnone, no possibility. I have been told that by the White House. There \nis not enough money, there is not enough time, there is not enough \ningenuity and enough anything to make this bill palatable to the \nPresident, in just talking about the criminal justice side of things.\n  So I think the majority leader is absolutely, positively correct. I \nthink we should do a managers' amendment on a few of the major chunks \nof the bill and get on with the show. This really is an exercise in \nfutility.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the leader for yielding. I just discussed with \nthe chairman of our Labor-HHS committee, Senator Specter, and consulted \nwith our side and on Labor-HHS, with the knocking out of that one \nprovision--and we all know what that is--we can voice vote that in the \nnext 3 minutes. We would be willing to do that. I checked with Senator \nSpecter, and I believe I am representing him correctly.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the majority leader. I consulted with the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, who said that he \nwould be willing to, at least speaking for himself, withdraw the \namendment on striker replacement, which would set the stage for a voice \nvote. And here we are dealing again with a corpse that is a pro forma \nmatter.\n  It seems to me what the distinguished majority leader has said is \npreeminently correct, backed up by almost everybody, that we ought to \nvoice vote these two bills and move on to the continuing resolution and \nconclude our business.\n  For the bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, we \nare prepared to move in that direction right now.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate first, I think what we are engaged in--and \nI do not quarrel with anybody, I talked with the leader about it, and \nwe do waste time periodically in the Senate--but this is a total waste \nof time to continue on these two bills because they are not going \nanywhere.\n  I know some want to make a point. We are going to have to do that in \nabout 6 weeks when we have a real live bill on the floor. I do not see \nany reason to take today, tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday of next week to \nfinish two bills that are already in the ash can. If people insist on \nit, we can accommodate them.\n  I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa \nthat we ought to pass that bill on a voice vote. We cannot get cloture. \nThere were two votes, 54-46, party-line votes. So my view is we ought \nto do it, pass it and find out what happens after the veto in the next \nround.\n  I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to just see if I understand \nthe situation here. It seems that the coroner has pronounced these two \nbills dead, and we all wanted to look at the body and we have all \nconcluded that they are dead, or most of us have concluded that they \nare dead.\n  In that light, it is hard for me to understand why the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution of the Senator from New Hampshire is something that \nneeds to be delayed. He feels, as a matter of law--and I daresay that \nwould be supported by a strong majority of people on both sides of the \naisle--that the President ought to seek congressional authorization for \nputting 25,000 American troops in Bosnia, something the President has \nalready indicated he wants to do.\n  But the Senator from New Hampshire has said he will not offer that as \na matter of law, nor will he offer it on the continuing resolution, \nwhich is a bill which is not dead and will go through here. He will put \nit on a bill that we have all agreed is going nowhere, and yet \nobjection is raised to the Senator doing that, that the bill has to be \nexamined.\n  It is a sense of the Senate and something we have already voted on. \nIt is being put on a bill that we have all agreed is going nowhere. The \nPresident has already signified his support for the notion, but the \nSenator is not allowed to go forward with it.\n  Can anybody explain to me why we now need to delay to examine \nsomething that is going nowhere?\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield, I think there is discussion \nright now with someone on the other side at least to look at the \nlanguage to see if they can reach some agreement. I think Senator Nunn \nhas a copy of the resolution. Hopefully, we can work it out in a few \nmoments.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. But I am not going anywhere this weekend, so I do not care.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the leader yield for an observation? It will take \nlittle time. I think the discussion we have been having is a good one. \nBut I do not think the White House ought to gather from this discussion \nthat the U.S. Senate is ready to give them more money on the domestic \nside for these bills. That is not a foregone conclusion. We would be \nbreaking the budget we worked very hard to pass.\n  I just want to make sure everybody knows that there is no easy \nsolution to the bills the President vetoes. That is his prerogative. \nBut obviously, sooner or later, we have some prerogatives, like maybe \nwe do not get a bill and maybe something happens; maybe Government is \nnot alive and kicking all at the same time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire and then the \nSenator from Massachusetts. Then I hope we can work out some agreement \non the CR and pass the other bill, and then we only have one left.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I just ask the leader, it would be the \nintention, after the President vetoes this bill, that we would have the \nopportunity to debate and vote on the various issues of concern that \nsome Members have regarding this bill; is that his intention?\n  Mr. DOLE. Is the Senator talking about the Labor-HHS bill?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there are three provisions we are both \nconcerned about that were stripped from the bill, and the answer is \nyes. My point is we can make that fight now, but it is not going to \naccomplish anything. We can make the fight the next time around, and I \nthink it is for real.\n  So the answer is yes, and I support the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator for that clarification.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think that the Senator from New Hampshire \nhas made a very fair downscaling of a request. What I want to suggest, \nI ask the leader, is if we can take a few minutes to see if we can try \nto come to some agreement with respect to language that might be able \nto expedite the process, and then conceivably have a managers' \namendment and a vote up or down. That might be able to expedite it. I \nwonder if it might be possible to take the time to do that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Are you talking about State, Justice, Commerce?\n  Mr. KERRY. State, Justice, Commerce, and with respect to the State \nportion of that, if we can spend a minute on the Bosnia issue, we might \nbe able to resolve that, hopefully, with Senator Nunn and other \ninterested parties and come up with language quickly on which we can \nmove forward.\n  Mr. DOLE. I certainly have no problem with that. Let me indicate, I \nam not going to ask consent now on the continuing resolution. There \nwill be an objection or an amendment. I hope we can resolve it. There \nis not an amendment on the CR. A sense of the Senate would not require \nconcurrence by the \n\n[[Page S 14620]]\nHouse. But I hope we can pass a clean CR. We promised our colleagues in \nthe House we would try to do that if they do that, because they had \npeople who wanted to offer amendments, too, and they were not permitted \non the House side, and they have different rules.\n  I will not make that request at this time. I hope in the meantime \nthose Senators who have an interest in the Bosnia resolution can come \ntogether and work out some language. It cannot be that difficult. We \npassed it before, and the President has indicated to us today at the \nWhite House he intends to consult with Congress.\n  So I think it is a fairly moot point, but if we want to vote on a \nmoot point, we have done that from time to time here, too. So I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Currently the majority leader has the floor. \nHe has just yielded the floor. The Biden amendment is pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2818, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think the Biden amendment is pending. I \nalready debated the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto amend my amendment. The managers are aware of the amendment. It \nrelates to a $60 million offset--not offset--$60 million offset to \naccommodate the Senator from Ohio. I ask unanimous consent that I be \nable to so amend my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am ready to vote on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send the modification to the \ndesk?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Delaware \nyield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. The manager of the bill is not on the floor right now. I \nwonder, has the Senator had an opportunity to discuss and clear this \nwith the manager of the bill?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I beg the Senator's pardon?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am just inquiring about the manager of the \nbill. Has the Senator had an opportunity to discuss it with the \nmanager?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have a second issue. I do not want to confuse the \nSenator. There are two amendments: One, the Biden amendment referred to \nearlier was debated yesterday. That amendment has a number of offsets \nin it which we discussed for 2 hours yesterday. That is the one I just \namended to accommodate a DeWine proposal.\n  There is a second issue here and that is a managers' amendment going \nto the funding in this bill for the police program.\n  I have reached an agreement, to the best of my knowledge, with the \nSenator from Kansas, with the Senator from Texas, the manager of the \nbill, and with the Senator from South Carolina. I have that agreed upon \nlanguage between the manager and the parties I suggested. That goes to \nanother big chunk of the difference of the debate. All that relates to \nis, one sentence --it takes out the block grant language for the police \nand reinstates the original language. That is a separate issue than the \nBiden amendment. I am not sure if I am answering the Senator's \nquestion. If that is the answer, I am prepared to move that amendment \nright now. That is, the so-called managers amendment and ask for a \nvoice vote on it.\n  I am not looking for a rollcall vote because we have all agreed as of \nat least 10 minutes ago. Does that answer the question of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it does. Let me inquire, Mr. President, so the \npending business then is a modification of the managers' amendment, is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. A modification of the Biden amendment, which is the \npending business. The Biden amendment, which was introduced and debated \nfor an hour and a half yesterday, relates to the drug courts, relates \nto drug treatment in prisons and to boot camps. The modification I am \nsending to the desk is a modification of Mr. DeWine in the Biden \namendment which, in a nutshell, I will explain to my colleagues. In the \nterrorism bill that passed the Senate, Senator DeWine----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We need to have the modification sent to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The amendment (No. 2818), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, line 10, after ``Act;'' insert the following: \n     ``$27,000,000 for grants for residential substance abuse \n     treatment for State prisoners pursuant to section 1001(a)(17) \n     of the 1968 Act; $10,000,000 for grants for rural drug \n     enforcement assistance pursuant to section 1001(a)(9) of the \n     1968 Act;''.\n       On page 28, line 11, before ``$25,000,000'' insert \n     ``$100,000,000 shall be for drug courts pursuant to title V \n     of the 1994 Act;''.\n       On page 29, line 6, strike ``$750,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$728,800,000.\n       On page 29, line 15, after ``Act;'' insert the following: \n     ``$1,200,000 for Law Enforcement Family Support Programs, as \n     authorized by section 1001(a)(21) of the 1968 Act''.\n       On page 44, lines 8 and 9, strike ``conventional \n     correctional facilities, including prisons and jails,'' and \n     insert ``correctional facilities, including prisons and \n     jails, or boot camp facilities and other low cost \n     correctional facilities for nonviolent offenders that can \n     free conventional prison space''.\n       On page 20, line 16 strike all that follows to page 20 line \n     19 and insert:\n       Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255(i)) is amended--\n       (1) in the second sentence of paragraph (1), by striking \n     ``five'' and inserting ``ten''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting before the period at the \n     end the following: ``or, notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, may be deposited as offsetting collections in the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'' appropriations account to be available to support \n     border enforcement and control programs''.\n       The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply to funds \n     remitted with applications for adjustment of status which \n     were filed on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       For activities authorized by section 130016 of Public Law \n     103-322, $10,300,000, to remain available until expended, \n     which shall be derived from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust \n     Fund.\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n       Sec.     . (a) State Compatibility With Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation Systems.--(1) The Attorney General shall make \n     funds available to the chief executive officer of each State \n     to carry out the activities described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Uses.--The executive officer of each State shall use \n     the funds made available under this subsection in conjunction \n     with units of local government, other States, or combinations \n     thereof, to carry out all or part of a program to establish, \n     develop, update, or upgrade--\n       (A) computerized identification systems that are compatible \n     and integrated with the databases of the National Crime \n     Information Center of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n       (B) ballistics identification programs that are compatible \n     and integrated with the Drugfire Program of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation;\n       (C) the capability to analyze deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) \n     in a forensic laboratory in ways that are compatible and \n     integrated with the combined DNA Identification System \n     (CODIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and\n       (D) automated fingerprint identification systems that are \n     compatible and integrated with the Integrated Automated \n     Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation.\n       (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     this section, a State shall require that each person \n     convicted of a felony of a sexual nature shall provide a \n     sample of blood, saliva, or other specimen necessary to \n     conduct a DNA analysis consistent with the standards \n     established for DNA testing by the Director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation.\n       (c) Interstate Compacts.--A State may enter into a compact \n     or compacts with another State or States to carry out this \n     section.\n       (d) Allocation.--The Attorney General shall allocate the \n     funds appropriated under subsection (e) to each State based \n     on the following formula:\n       (1) .25 percent shall be allocated to each of the \n     participating States.\n       (2) Of the total funds remaining after the allocation under \n     paragraph (1), each State shall be allocated an amount that \n     bears the same ratio to the amount of such funds as the \n     population of such State bears to the population of all \n     States.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are hereby \n     appropriated to carry out this section $60,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 1996.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. This is a modification being proposed at the request of \nSenator DeWine. When the terrorism bill passed several months ago, \nSenator DeWine, with the unanimous consent of the U.S. Senate, \nauthorized a technical assistance program for the FBI to upgrade their \ncomputers and a number \n\n[[Page S 14621]]\nof other things, a technical upgrade for the FBI. Senator DeWine has \ncome to me and asked me whether I would be willing to include not the \nfull funding of that amount, but $60 million as opposed to the $200 \nmillion that was authorized. I am more than happy to do that.\n  The offset for that is the money that, quite frankly, has been saved \nas a consequence of the adoption of the amendment by the Senator from \nNew Mexico relating to Legal Services. So it does not require an \noffset. It has been agreed to by Senator Hollings--agreed to in the \nsense that I am able to modify this amendment, and I believe it has \nbeen agreed to by the majority to modify it.\n  I am asking to be able to modify my amendment, which is pending, with \nthe DeWine language that I have sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for 5 minutes for consideration of a Brown \namendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I cannot grant a unanimous-\nconsent until I have seen the amendment and know what we are doing. I \ndo not mind it being brought up if the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska is willing to step aside, but I cannot agree to a time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 \nminute to describe the amendment that I would like the body to \nconsider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, many Members will be surprised to learn \nthat we have a different standard for legal conduct that is written \ninto the Legal Services Corporation Act than exists in our law.\n  Under our law, under rule 11, we permit sanctions in the event an \nattorney engages in bringing frivolous actions and the sanctions are \ndiscretionary in rule 11. Nevertheless, there is at least some \npotential penalty if someone abuses the legal process.\n  Under the Legal Services Corporation statute, however, Legal Services \nis responsible for their action on a much more limited area that \ninvolves very, very extreme action. My hope is the body would consider \nan amendment that simply brings the Legal Services standards into line \nwith what we impose on every other attorney, that we would put Legal \nServices under exactly the same standards as any other person who \nappears in person.\n  It is one that I think merits the consideration. I assume I would \nhave the support of all Members. It would be my hope the body would \nallow it to be considered while we are awaiting further action.\n  Having given that brief explanation, I have given copies of this \namendment to both sides. I renew my request in asking unanimous consent \nto set aside the pending question for 5 minutes only for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. I object.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the manager of the bill, my \namendment is the amendment after Senator Biden. I am willing to go \nimmediately to it and ask unanimous consent that the Biden amendment be \nset aside for consideration.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the modified Biden \namendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And the Biden amendment has been modified?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If there is no debate, I am ready to move to table the \nBiden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry. What is the business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Biden amendment \n2818 as modified.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As modified by Senator DeWine?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I personally do not object to the \nmodification, but it was my understanding that there had been an \nobjection on our side and that it had not been modified.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair granted that request previously. \nThat request can be vitiated.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to not have it vitiated if it had been agreed \nto.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So that we can get things moving, why do you not go ahead \nand start debating the amendment. Let me notify the Senator who thought \nhe had objected that the unanimous-consent request was agreed to, and \nif he wants to do something about it, he should come over.\n  In the meantime, we will begin the business.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do not have an objection to that.\n  Let me review quickly, and hopefully this will take just a moment. We \ndebated this amendment at length yesterday, although I have the right \nto continue to debate it unless there is a motion to table. I do not \nwant to take more time on the part of the Senate.\n  Let me just briefly, very briefly, explain what this amendment does. \nFirst, it reinstates two-thirds of the money for drug courts, mandatory \ndrug testing, drug treatment backed up by certain punishment for 55,000 \noffenders now on probation. They would all be put into this program. It \nprovides for two-thirds of the funding that we originally agreed to.\n  The second thing it does is allow States to continue to have the \noption to have drug treatment in their prisons. We are not talking \nabout drug treatment for people out on the street; we are talking about \ntreatment for people in prisons, administered by States in prisons.\n  The third thing it does, it reinstates the money--$10 million--for \nrural drug enforcement. That function was zeroed out. Again, I will not \ngo into all the arguments, but yesterday we spent a lot of time and I \npointed out that the violent crime rate and the drug problem in rural \nAmerica is increasing at a faster rate than it is in urban America.\n  Every single, solitary Governor that I am aware of, every single, \nsolitary local official that I am aware of, has said on drug matters, \nin rural areas, we need help. When you have a 2- or 3-person or 10-\nperson police force facing what is happening, particularly in the \nMidwest, in the Rocky Mountain West, where drug gangs are moving to \nthose rural areas setting up methamphetamine labs, they say they need \nhelp.\n  This allows the control of the cooperation between Federal and local \nlaw enforcement officers to drug enforcement. It also reinstates what I \nthink may have been unintentionally taken out of bill; that is, $1.2 \nmillion for law enforcement family support. What that is all about is \nfunds to support families who have had their loved ones slain as peace \nofficers. That is, cops who are killed, their families, their husbands, \nwives, children.\n  They, in fact, are involved in and have made available the counseling \nfor families killed in the line of duty, post-shooting debriefings for \nofficers and \n\n[[Page S 14622]]\ntheir spouses and marital support groups that relate to the outcome of \nwhat happens when an officer is killed and/or wounded. Many have \nattended along with me every year the police memorial. Every year we \nhonor slain officers that are killed that year. Every year the families \nline up and are greeted by the President and me and others who are \nthere--Senator Thurmond. Every year immediately after that occurs, they \nall get on a bus and they go to these counseling services for 2 days.\n  If you speak to the families of those officers, slain officers, you \nwill find they say it is the single most important thing the Government \ndoes for them, the single most important thing for them to cope with \nthis tragedy.\n  The last piece of this amendment is $60 million for technology grants \nto the FBI.\n  Those technology grants to the FBI are moneys that allow the FBI to \nupgrade all of their, what the average person would say is their very \nsophisticated technology capabilities and facilities. Frankly, they \ncould use $200 million, which the distinguished Senator from Ohio put \nin the terrorism bill for them. But that has been stalled. The only \nreason we are going with only $60 million is so we do not have to go \nout and seek offsets to get this money. The offsets to pay for the \nentirety of this amendment come from reducing the State prison money \nfrom $750 million in this bill to $729 million. The House bill only has \n$500 million in it. The President only requested $500 million. And the \nsecond piece comes from increasing the fees related to acquisition of \ngreen cards. So, there are the offsets.\n  Senator Bond and Senator Specter and a number of my Republican \nfriends, including Senator DeWine, have spoken to pieces of this \namendment. Again, the only reason I am continuing to speak is, not \nbecause I like to hear my voice and not because it needs further \nexplanation, it is because I am told we are waiting to determine \nwhether or not the modification will be accepted.\n  If it was accepted--I think it is important we all exercise comity \nhere--if, in fact, the DeWine amendment that I sent as an amendment to \nthe Biden amendment was accepted and it was accepted without the \nknowledge of one of my Republican colleagues, I will not insist that be \ndone. I would withdraw the modification because I do not want to catch \nanyone unawares here. But maybe my friend from Texas has been able to \nfind out whether or not the modification, including the DeWine \nprovision, is acceptable, whether I have unanimous consent to modify my \nown amendment to that extent.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The modification is certainly acceptable to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to withdraw his motion \nto table?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I withdraw the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think Senator Hatch is coming over to \ndebate this amendment. What I suggest is that we set this amendment \naside and that we take up the Kerrey amendment. I think we can make \narguments on both sides very briefly, and then we can have a vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection to that, Mr. President. That is fine \nwith me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2817\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think having that vote and getting everybody over here \nwill move us in the right direction.\n  So I ask unanimous consent the Biden amendment be temporarily set \naside and that the Kerrey amendment be the pending business. I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 10 minutes of debate equally divided on \nthe Kerrey amendment, to be controlled by Senator Kerrey and by myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2817, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a \nmodification, I say to the Senator from Texas, to my amendment. Let me \nsend a copy of it over to him.\n  Essentially the modification enables me to strike the offset, as a \nconsequence of the Domenici amendment. He was going to take an offset \nthat I originally identified, and that was dropped. As a consequence of \nthat, I no longer need an offset, I am told by staff on the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I also ask, as part of that unanimous consent, that Senator Daschle \nand Senator Jeffords be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send the modification to the \ndesk?\n  Mr. KERREY. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I did not \nhear the motion. I am sorry.\n  Mr. KERREY. The unanimous consent request is to modify the \namendment--I sent the modification to the desk--and to add Senator \nDaschle and Senator Jeffords as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nsimply like to add to that that there be no amendment in order as a \nsecond-degree amendment to the Kerrey amendment--so we are sure we are \ngoing to go to a vote--prior to a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2817), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 73, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n\n                   information infrastructure grants\n\n       For grants authorized by section 392 of the Communications \n     Act of 1934, as amended, $18,900,000, to remain available \n     until expended as authorized by section 391 of the Act, as \n     amended: Provided, That not to exceed $900,000 shall be \n     available for program administration and other support \n     activities as authorized by section 391 of the Act including \n     support of the Advisory Council on National Information \n     Infrastructure: Provided further, That of the funds \n     appropriated herein, not to exceed 5 percent may be available \n     for telecommunications research activities for projects \n     related directly to the development of national information \n     infrastructure: Provided further, That notwithstanding the \n     requirements of section 392(a) and 392(c) of the Act, these \n     funds may be used for the planning and construction of \n     telecommunications networks for the provision of educational, \n     cultural, health care, public information, public safety, or \n     other social services: Provided further, That in reviewing \n     proposals for funding, the Telecommunications and Information \n     and Infrastructure Assistance Program (also known as the \n     National Information Infrastructure Program) shall add to the \n     factors taken into consideration the following: (1) the \n     extent to which the proposed project is consistent with State \n     plans and priorities for the deployment of the \n     telecommunications and information infrastructure and \n     services; and (2) the extent to which the applicant has \n     planned and coordinated the proposed project with other \n     telecommunications and information entities in the State.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the modification basically was done as a \nconsequence of really not needing an offset now, as I explained \nearlier, from the Domenici amendment. Staff informs me the $18.9 \nmillion we are adding back is available in the bill.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment. This program, in 1994, had \n90-some individual community organizations that filed applications. \nThey match two for one.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from many, many community-based \norganizations who have indicated they support this amendment, be \nprinted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 28, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: We write on behalf of a diverse coalition of \n     education, library, arts, disability, civil liberties, trade \n     unions and other civic organizations to urge you to vote for \n     the Amendment to restore $18.9 million of funding for the \n     Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance \n     Program (TIIAP) to be offered by Senators Bob Kerrey (D-NE), \n     Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and others, with bipartisan support, to \n     the Senate Appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, State, \n     and the Judiciary (H.R. 2076).\n       TIIAP, a program administered by the National \n     Telecommunications and Information (NTIA), matches private \n     contributions with government funds to promote the \n     development and widespread availability of advanced \n     telecommunications technologies. Through TIIAP projects, \n     people who may not otherwise have the means or opportunity--\n     like citizens in rural and low income areas \n\n[[Page S 14623]]\n     and citizens with disabilities--are able to tap into the wealth of \n     information that is accessible via advanced \n     telecommunications technologies. TIIAP dollars are used to \n     purchase equipment for connection to communications networks \n     such as the Internet, train people in the use of equipment \n     and software, and to purchase telephone links and access to \n     commercial on-line services.\n       Resouces such as the Internet play an increasing role in \n     many facets of the lives of all Americans. Schoolchildren are \n     able to benefit from a wealth of educational information not \n     otherwise available to them. Citizens are able to engage in \n     an active discussion of public issues. And Americans in rural \n     areas are able to access health care-related and other \n     important information without having to travel far distances. \n     To fully realize the benefits of advanced technologies, \n     however, every American must have the opportunity to access \n     these resources. TIIAP-funded support helps to realize this \n     goal by extending advanced telecommunications capabilities, \n     in conjunction with the private sector, to people and places \n     that would otherwise be left out.\n       Recipients of the grants have included local governments, \n     universities, schools, and libraries. Listed below are just a \n     few examples of how TIIAP has helped these groups utilize \n     telecommunications systems for education, community \n     development and ultimately for economic empowerment:\n       The University of Oregon, along with fifteen other \n     educational, governmental, health care, community and \n     industrial partners, have received funds for equipment \n     necessary to complete construction of the Lane Education \n     Network. This Network will be fully accessible by the \n     community, and will be the conduit for such educational \n     programs as network mentoring among high schools and on-\n     line training.\n       In West Virginia, TIIAP funds served to help complete a \n     computer network infrastructure at the College of Human \n     Resources and Education at West Virginia University. This \n     network would both provide the Professional Development \n     Schools with access to the Internet, as well as allow the \n     College of Human Resources to provide information via the \n     Internet on professional development for teachers.\n       In Montana, TIIAP funds have enabled the Hall Elementary \n     School District to install the town's first Internet \n     connection in the school building which will give the entire \n     town and the students access to Montana statewide \n     information, as well as national services.\n       In a time of significant budget cutting, TIIAP provides the \n     seeds to help forge partnerships with the private sector to \n     ensure that telecommunications technologies live up to their \n     potential to enhance education, library services, health \n     care, community services, civic participation and much more. \n     The TIIAP is a modest program which can contribute \n     significantly to the development of a truly National \n     Information Infrastructure.\n       We urge you to support the Kerry/Snowe Amendment to H.R. \n     2076 and restore partial funding to the TIIAP program for \n     fiscal year 1996.\n           Very truly yours,\n       AFL/CIO Department for Professional Employees.\n       Alliance for Community Media.\n       Alliance for Public Technology.\n       American Arts Alliance.\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       American Association of Law Libraries.\n       American Association of School Administrators.\n       American Association of School Libraries.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       American Civil Liberties Union.\n       American Federation of Teachers.\n       American Library Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       Association for Educational Communications and Technology.\n       Association of Art Museum Directors\n       Association of Research Libraries.\n       Berinstein Research.\n       Catalyst Project.\n       Center for Democracy & Technology.\n       Center for Information, Technology & Society.\n       Center for Media Education.\n       Civic Access, Bellingham Washington.\n       Communications Workers of America.\n       Computing Research Association.\n       Consortium for School Networking.\n       Consortium of Distance Education.\n       Consumer Interest Research Institute.\n       Council for Advancement and Support of Education.\n       Council for American Private Education.\n       Council of the Great City Schools.\n       Davis Community Network.\n       Davis Community Television.\n       Delaware Association of Non Profit Agencies.\n       Delaware Service Provider Network/Diamond Net.\n       Educational Products Information Exchange (EPIE).\n       Educational Teleconsortium of Michigan.\n       Florida Community College Television Consortium.\n       Higher Education Telecommunications Association of \n     Oklahoma.\n       Independent Sector.\n       Instructional Telecommunications Council.\n       Instructional Telecommunications Foundation.\n       International Society for Technology in Education.\n       Intelecom Maryland College of the Air Teleconsortium.\n       International Telecomputing Consortium.\n       Learning and Information Networking for Community \n     Telecomputing (LINCT) Coalition.\n       Libraries of the Future.\n       Media Access Project.\n       Media Consortium--Media Democracy in Action.\n       Museum Computer Network.\n       National Association of Independent Schools.\n       National Association of Secondary School Principals.\n       National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges.\n       National Association of State Arts Agencies.\n       National Campaign for Free Expression.\n       National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of \n     History.\n       National Education Association.\n       National Federation of Community Broadcasters.\n       National School Boards Association.\n       National Writers' Union (UAW Local 1981)\n       NILRC--A Consortium of Midwestern Community Colleges & \n     Universities.\n       OMB Watch.\n       Oregon Community College Telecommunications Consortium.\n       Organizations Concerned about Rural Education.\n       People For the American Way Action Fund.\n       Playing to Win Network.\n       Public Service Telecommunications Corporation.\n       Texas Consortium for Educational Telecommunications.\n       United Cerebral Palsy Association.\n       United Church of Christ, Office of Communication.\n       United Way of Delaware.\n       Urban Libraries Council.\n       Western Consortium for Distance Education.\n       World Institute on Disability.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this particular program is a very small \nprogram. It has strong support from the Republican leadership in the \nHouse. There is $40 million in the bill on the House side. It does \nenable us to expand not only educational opportunities in \ntelecommunications, but it empowers local communities to be able to \ncreate jobs and, as I said, create an understanding of how this \ntelecommunications technology can be used in a variety of different \nways. There are lots of organizations that have used it, educational \ninstitutions K-12, and universities.\n  I hope my colleagues will be able to support the amendment. It has a \nvery simple, straightforward purpose. It is consistent with the \nessential message we have been trying, I believe successfully, to use, \nwhich is we are trying to empower people at the local level, shifting \npower away from the Federal Government.\n  I think it is a program, thus far at least, that has proven its \nmerit, and it needs to be continued.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the argument against this amendment is very \nsimple. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration \nis not, nor has it ever been, authorized. There is no offset in this \namendment because it is picking up excessive authority under another \namendment. I think, in terms of the budget that we face in this bill, \nthis is not something we ought to be spending money on. As a result I \noppose the amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I do not know if the Senator from Maine \nwants to speak on this amendment. I will be pleased to yield time. If I \nmay take just an additional 30 seconds, there is not a need for an \noffset with this amendment. As a consequence of the Domenici amendment, \nan offset is not needed. That is what my modification did, was to \nstrike it.\n  His is a straightforward argument against this amendment. It can only \nbe made on the basis the Senator from Texas used, that this is a \nprogram that Members do not want to fund and do not support.\n  As I said, it has very strong support from a wide variety of \ncommunity organizations that matched the Federal dollars, used the \nFederal dollars two to one. I think this program not only deserves to \nbe supported, but has very strong support from the Republican \nleadership on the House side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska's amendment to restore funding for the Telecommunications \nInformation and Infrastructure Administration \n\n[[Page S 14624]]\nProgram [TIIAP]. This amendment is fully offset.\n  In today's world of innovative telecommunications, this program helps \nus meet the demands of keeping up with this constant change. TIIAP \ndevelops partnerships with local governments, schools, hospitals, \nlibraries, and the business community to increase access to advanced \ninformation and communications infrastructure. These partnerships will \nbe the key to our educational and economic success in the remainder of \nthis decade and into the next millennium.\n  Unfortunately, this bill terminates TIIAP. Some are trying to abolish \nthis program to claim they have ended an unnecessary, big-government \nprogram. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  TIIAP is more than necessary in today's world. It is essential. The \nworld has shrunk because of advances in telecommunications. Today, \nAmericans do not just compete with each other, they compete with \nJapanese, Germans, New Zealanders, and the other citizens of our global \neconomy. To meet the demands of this new global economy, we must \ndevelop and maintain world-class telecommunications networks and \ninfrastructure.\n  Moreover, TIIAP is not big government. Because of its Federal seed \nmoney, private companies and public players have come together to form \ncommunity-based projects. Each project must have at least 50 percent \nmatching funds from the private sector. This requirement had led to \ninnovative networks with groups that have never worked together before. \nThere is no Government redtape restricting these partnerships. Instead, \nGovernment seed money is making these partnerships happen.\n  Let me describe just a few of these innovative partnerships from \naround the country that have gotten off the ground because of TIIAP's \nhelp:\n  The State of Alaska, the University of Alaska, the K-12 educational \nsystem, public broadcasting, and the library community are working \ntogether to integrate networks that will result in 81 percent of \nAlaskans having non-toll access to an education-government-library \nnetwork;\n  In South Dakota, 47 rural schools are working together to combine \nforces to provide distance learning programs;\n  Youth service organizations in New Haven, CT, and East Palo, CA, are \nworking together to link teenagers in the two cities to keep them off \ntheir streets and in their schools;\n  Schoolchildren right here in the District of Columbia are studying \ntogether on virtual visits to museums in New York by using two-way \nvideo and teleconferencing technology;\n  In my home State, the citizens of Fairfax, VT are working together to \ndevelop an electronic bulletin board so this small, rural community can \nshare information on the Internet; and\n  Physicians from big city medical centers in North Carolina are \nworking together with rural hospitals to provide video \nteleconsultations and diagnostic images for emergency care.\n  TIIAP is about finding new ways to learn, to practice better \nmedicine, and to share information. It spurs the growth of networks and \ninfrastructure in many different fields of telecommunications with only \na small Federal investment. It is essential and innovative.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Kerrey's \namendment to restore this vital program.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 4 minutes 16 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me remind my colleagues where we are. There may very \nwell be the votes on this amendment, but I am still going to oppose it, \nand let me tell you why.\n  First of all, we passed a budget that contemplated the elimination of \nthe Commerce Department. We have passed a bill out of committee that \ncalls for the elimination of the Commerce Department. We have a budget \nthat sets out, over a 7-year period, a plan which would achieve a \nbalanced budget by cutting spending, and possibly by eliminating the \nCommerce Department. Given these facts, we have set out in this bill a \nprocedure to eliminate the Commerce Department.\n  We are now talking about providing funding for a program that has \nnever been authorized and that represents the Government, basically, \nbeing involved in the whole area where we have the largest private \ninvestment, in history, underway. So this is basically an issue as to \nwhat is the role of Government and what do we mean when we write a \nbudget which says that we are going to eliminate a department. When we \nset out on a program to balance the budget, and we count on savings \nfrom eliminating a department, are we serious or are we not?\n  I believe that if you are serious about reducing funding for the \nCommerce Department, and if you are serious about eliminating this \nDepartment, then you cannot be serious about supporting funding for the \nNational Telecommunications Information Administration.\n  This was one of the hard choices we had to make in committee, and it \nseems to me that it was the correct choice. I do not want to go back on \nthat choice.\n  So when the Senator finishes his debate time, I will yield my time \nand move to table.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, one quick point, and then I will yield \nwhatever time the Senator from Maine wants to take, and we will finish.\n  There is already in this bill a continuation of this program with $3 \nmillion for salaries and expenses. This money provides restoration to \nthe grants.\n  I yield whatever time is left to the distinguished Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. How much time is left, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 2 minutes and 24 \nseconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Nebraska on this amendment because I do think it is very, very \nimportant that we do everything that we can as a Government to support \nthe communities, public school systems, and our health care systems in \njoining the information superhighway.\n  Frankly, I believe that the grants provided to local communities, \nStates, and public entities by the Telecommunications and Information \nInfrastructure Assistance Program [TIIAP] play a very important role in \nenabling these public entities to do everything they can to help serve \ntheir communities with advanced technology.\n  As I said during the telecommunications debate when we are reforming \nthat area of our policy, one of the most important aspects is to make \nsure that we transmit information across traditional boundaries of time \nand space. Even the House recognized the importance of these grants to \nthe States and local communities and public entities. They understand \nthat we have to do everything that we can to help serve those \npopulations, particularly those in rural areas that do not have access \nto this technology.\n  In 1994, half of the grants went to the rural areas and rural States \nof our country. One-quarter of the 1994 fund went to the underserved, \noften low-income areas to enable school children, the elderly, and the \nother at-risk groups to connect with information resources from their \nhomes, schools, and communities centers. In fact, the House \nappropriation include report language that said this program:\n\n       is critical to the development of the national information \n     superhighway which will be of particular value to underserved \n     rural areas. This emerging telecommunications infrastructure \n     will allow more remote areas to gain access to enhance \n     education, health care, and social services, as well as \n     provide enhanced economic opportunity.\n\n  I think that characterizes very well the importance of these grants \nto communities. In my State of Maine, a 1994 planning grant of more \nthan $113,000 was awarded. This grant will be utilized to develop a \ntelecommunications plan that will link the State to the national and \nglobal networks. Involved in this planning effort will be not only the \nUniversity of Maine, but also Maine Public Broadcasting Corporation and \na consortium of public, private, and nonprofit organizations--including \nNYNEX and Central Maine Power. Telecommunications can also help us \nprovide a world class education to children across America. If we want \nyoung people to actively use and understand the technology of the \nfuture, then we must ensure that schools are part of the National \nInformation Infrastructure. \n\n[[Page S 14625]]\n\n  For starters, telecommunications will enable students and teachers to \ngain access to libraries across the country, and will allow them to \ncommunicate with experts and other students around the world. It will \nensure that small schools in remote areas, and schools with limited \nfinancial resources will have equal access to the same rich learning \nresources.\n  It is also in the Nation's best interest to ensure that all schools \nand libraries, even those in rural areas, have access to educational \nservices. In the 21st century, our children will be competing in a \nglobal economy where knowledge is power. Our future as a nation depends \non our children's ability to master the tools and skills needed in that \neconomy. I agree with House Speaker Newt Gingrich who said that if the \ncountry doesn't figure out a way to bring the information age to the \ncountry's poor, that we are buying ourselves a 21st century of enormous \ndomestic pain.\n  Consider that only 30 percent of schools with enrollments of less \nthan 300 have Internet access, while 58 percent of schools with \nenrollments of 1,000 or more reported having Internet access. Only 3 \npercent of classrooms in public schools are connected to the Internet, \nand cost is cited as a major barrier to access. Seventy-seven percent \nof libraries serving a populations base of more than 1 million--almost \nthe total population of Maine, I might add--had Internet access, \nwhereas just 13.3 percent of libraries serving communities of 5,000 or \nfewer people had Internet access.\n  In addressing these needs, TIIAP grants have served an integral role \nin connecting our schools to the information superhighway. In Montana, \nTIIAP funds enabled the Hall Elementary School District to install the \ntown's first Internet connection in the school building. A TIIAP grant \nin Oregon aided in the construction of the Lane Education Network--a \nsystem that is fully accessible to the community and will serve as a \nconduit for educational programs among high schools.\n  If we are going to ensure that all of the areas of this country are \ngoing to have access to educational telecommunications services, if we \nare going to be competing in a global economy where knowledge is \npower--and our future depends on our children's ability to master the \ntools and skills needed in that economy--then I think that we have to \ndo everything as a Government to promote and to serve that program and \nthose interests.\n  Mr. President, the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure \nAssistance Program works to ensure that rural and low-income regions \nare not passed by. So I encourage my colleagues to support the Kerrey-\nSnowe amendment that would restore the funding to this program as the \nHouse did in a recent vote in their appropriations bill. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, do I have any remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and twenty-five seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let finish by saying--and then I will move \nto table--that we eliminated this program because it has never been \nauthorized, because it is not part of the budget we adopted that \ncontemplated moving toward eliminating the Commerce Department as part \nof balancing the Federal budget.\n  It is almost comical that somehow the Government, with $19 million, \nis going to open up telecommunications and information systems for \nAmerica when the private sector is already investing tens of billions \nof dollars in this area. This is another Government program which is \nunauthorized, and which does not fit in any program to balance the \nFederal budget.\n  So if you are serious about the budget we adopted, if you are serious \nabout saying no to Government programs, then this is one of the easiest \nplaces to start.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Texas to lay on the table the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on the \nBiden amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will just urge adoption of my amendment \nand ask for a voice vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one more parliamentary inquiry. The \namendment is modified by the DeWine language; correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the Biden amendment is \nmodified.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I urge adoption of the amendment and ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2818), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  \n[[Page S 14626]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it appropriate to send up an \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee amendments are still pending.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ncommittee amendments be set aside so that I can send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2838\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for appropriate remedies for prison condition \nlawsuits, to discourage frivolous and abusive prison lawsuits, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Dole, \n     Mr. Reid, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Abraham, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Grassley, and \n     Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 2838.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask the managers of the bill how much \ntime they want us to take on this amendment.\n  Let me ask my colleague from Nevada how much time he thinks he needs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's courtesy. I will \nbe happy to do whatever is appropriate. I would like 15 or 20 minutes \nmyself.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask my colleague if we can do it in a half hour equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment \ntake a half hour equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, and I shall \nnot object, I just want to tell my colleagues, there are two of my \ncolleagues on this side who are going to seek to modify the Senator's \namendment. I am not sure that is going to actually happen, so he is not \ncaught blindsided by that. I am not at liberty to agree to a time \nagreement that is not subject to an amendment in the second degree. I \ndo not know that will happen, so I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request that there \nbe 30 minutes equally divided?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Delaware is going to \noffer a second-degree amendment to this, I am not sure it would be in \nthe best interest of the proponents of the amendment to agree to a 30-\nminute time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, if I \ncan get the same time limit pertaining to a second-degree amendment, if \nthere is a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, what \nis the subject matter of the amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. This is the prison litigation reform amendment to do away \nwith frivolous lawsuits. It should not take a lot of time, and if there \nis a second-degree amendment, we will just have to face that when that \nhappens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to say a few words in support of the \namendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator \nHatch.\n  Unfortunately, the litigation explosion now plaguing our country does \nnot stop at the prison gate. The number of lawsuits filed by inmates \nhas grown astronomically--From 6,600 in 1975 to more than 39,000 in \n1994. These suits can involve such grievances as insufficient storage \nlocker space, a defective haircut by a prison barber, the failure of \nprison officials to invite a prisoner to a pizza party for a departing \nprison employee, and yes, being served chunky peanut butter instead of \nthe creamy variety.\n  These legal claims may sound far-fetched--almost funny--but \nunfortunately, prisoner litigation does not operate in a vacuum. \nFrivolous lawsuits filed by prisoners tie up the courts, waste valuable \nlegal resources, and affect the quality of justice enjoyed by law-\nabiding citizens. The time and money spent defending these cases are \nclearly time and money better spent prosecuting violent criminals, \nfighting illegal drugs, or cracking down on consumer fraud.\n  The National Association of Attorneys General estimates that inmate \ncivil rights litigation costs the States more than $81 million each \nyear. Of course, most of these costs are incurred defending lawsuits \nthat have no merit whatsoever.\n  This amendment will help put an end to the inmate litigation fun-and-\ngames. It establishes a garnishment procedure so that prisoners, like \nlaw-abiding citizens, will have to pay the court fees associated with \nfiling a lawsuit. It requires State prisoners to exhaust all \nadministrative remedies before filing suit. It would allow Federal \ncourts to revoke the good-time credits accumulated by a prisoner who \nfiles a frivolous suit. And it prohibits prisoners from suing for \nmental or emotional injury, absent a prior showing of physical injury.\n  The second major section of this amendment establishes some tough new \nguidelines for Federal courts when evaluating legal challenges to \nprison conditions. These guidelines will work to restrain liberal \nFederal judges who see violations of constitutional rights in every \nprisoner complaint and who have used these complaints to micromanage \nState and local prison systems. More specifically, by requiring Federal \njudges to meet a high burden of proof before imposing a prison cap \norder, this amendment will help keep convicted criminals behind bars \nwhere they belong.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need, and \nI will try to reserve time for the Senator from Nevada.\n  I am pleased to be joined by the majority leader and Senators Reid, \nKyl, Abraham, Gramm, Specter, Hutchison, Thurmond, Santorum, and \nGrassley in offering this amendment. Our amendment is virtually \nidentical to the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, S. 1279, which \nwe introduced yesterday. This landmark legislation will help bring \nrelief to a civil justice system overburdened by frivolous prisoner \nlawsuits. Jailhouse lawyers with little better to do are tying our \ncourts in knots with the endless flow of frivolous litigation.\n  Our legislation will also help to restore a balance to prison \nconditions litigation and will ensure that Federal court orders are \nlimited to remedying actual violations of prisoners' rights, not \nletting prisoners out of jail. It is time to lock the revolving prison \ndoor and to put the key safely out of reach of overzealous Federal \ncourts.\n  As of January 1994, 24 corrections agencies reported having court-\nmandated population caps. Nearly every day, we hear of vicious crimes \ncommitted by individuals who really should have been locked up. Not all \nof these tragedies are the result of court-ordered population caps, of \ncourse, but such caps are a part of the problem. While prison \nconditions that actually violate the Constitution should not be allowed \nto persist, I believe that the courts have gone too far in \nmicromanaging our Nation's prisons.\n  Our legislation also addresses the flood of frivolous lawsuits \nbrought by inmates. In 1994, over 39,000 lawsuits were filed by inmates \nin Federal courts, a staggering 15 percent over the number filed the \nprevious year. The vast majority of these suits are completely without \nmerit. Indeed, roughly 94.7 percent are dismissed before the pretrial \nphase, and only a scant 3.1 percent have enough validity to even reach \ntrial. In my own home State of Utah, 297 inmate suits were filed in \nFederal courts during 1994, which accounted for 22 percent of all \nFederal civil cases filed in Utah last year. I should emphasize that \nthese numbers \n\n[[Page S 14627]]\ndo not include habeas corpus petitions or other cases challenging the \ninmate's conviction or sentence. The crushing burden of these frivolous \nsuits makes it difficult for the courts to consider meritorious claims.\n  Indeed, I do not want to prevent inmates from raising legitimate \nclaims. This legislation will not prevent those claims from being \nraised. The legislation will, however, go far in preventing inmates \nfrom abusing the Federal judicial system.\n  In one frivolous case in Utah, for example, an inmate sued demanding \nthat he be issued Reebok or L.A. Gear brand shoes instead of the \nConverse brand being issued. In another case, an inmate deliberately \nflooded his cell and then sued the officers who cleaned up the mess \nbecause they got his pinochle cards wet. And in a third case, from \nUtah, a prisoner sued officers after a cell search, claiming that they \nfailed to put his cell back in a fashionable condition, and mixed his \nclean and dirty clothes.\n  Mr. President, these examples from my State are far from unique. I \nbelieve each of my colleagues could report numerous similar examples \nfrom their States as well, and we had a number of attorneys general \nhere yesterday who gave us a whole raft of bizarre incidents and \nlitigation.\n  It is time to stop this ridiculous waste of taxpayers' money. The \nhuge costs imposed on State governments to defend against these \nmeritless suits is another kind of crime committed against law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, this legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support from \nStates attorneys general from across the Nation. We believe, with them, \nthat it is time to wrest control of our prisons from the lawyers and \nthe inmates and return that control to competent administrators \nappointed to look out for society's interests as well as the legitimate \nneeds of prisoners.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I look forward \nto securing its quick passage by the Senate.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nsenior Senator from Utah, and especially to his staff. The staff has \nworked on this legislation for many, many weeks. And I publicly express \nmy appreciation to them and to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  I also thank the majority leader, who has been with us on this \nlegislation from the beginning. I appreciate his being with us \nthroughout the development of this legislation.\n  I also wish to thank our Nation's attorneys general who have worked \ndiligently to bring this problem to our attention. I understand they \nwould like to see some minor modifications made to this amendment as it \nworks its way through conference and I hope the conferees will consider \ntheir expertise.\n  Mr. President, when I was a new lawyer in Las Vegas, I was appointed \nby a Federal judge to represent someone charged with stealing cars, a \nviolation of taking a car across State lines. I went to see this man as \na young lawyer, very anxious to help him. When I got to the prison, \nthis man said, ``Don't bother, I committed this crime on purpose. I \nwanted to go back to a Federal prison. I did not want to go to a State \nprison. I like being in a Federal prison.'' Ever since that, Mr. \nPresident, I have thought to myself, there is something profoundly \nwrong with a criminal justice system where people look forward to going \nto prison.\n  Now, this amendment deals with a lot of things. One of the things it \ndeals with is frivolous lawsuits by prisoners. I wrote an article for a \nLas Vegas newspaper. I would like to recite part of what I wrote.\n\n       Life can be tough. Mom brought home creamy peanut butter \n     when you asked for extra chunky? You didn't get that fancy \n     weight machine you wanted for Christmas? Don't like the type \n     of music they play over the stereo system at work.\n       Well, heck. Why not file a lawsuit?\n       Oh, I know what you're thinking: ``I can't afford a \n     lawyer.''\n       Suppose, though, I told you about a plan that provides you \n     with an up-to-date library and a legal assistant to help in \n     your suit. This plan not only provides legal research, it \n     also gives you, absolutely free, three square meals a day. \n     And friends, if you get tired of legal research, you can \n     watch cable TV in the rec room or lift weights in a nice \n     modern gym.\n       ``OK, OK,'' you're saying. ``What's the catch? How much do \n     I have to pay to sign up for the program?''\n       Well, folks, that's the best part. This assistance plan is \n     absolutely free. All you have to do to qualify is to commit a \n     crime, get caught and go to the pen.\n\n  That is like the man I met, Mr. President, a number of years ago in \nthe Clark County jail.\n  Mr. President, prison inmates are abusing our system. I have behind \nme a chart that shows the lawsuits that have been filed. In 1970, we \nhad a few. Here it is, Mr. President, our last recorded number. There \nare certainly far greater than that. I will bet that today they are up \nto 50,000. Here we only go up to about 40,000.\n  What kinds of lawsuits do they file? Well, Mr. President, as the \nsenior Senator from Utah said, all States have some examples. I would \nlike to give you what we have had in Nevada. These are the top 10 \nlawsuits in Nevada filed by prisoners.\n  Inmate's claim: He should not be required to open his window slot \nwhen meals are delivered. He filed a lawsuit.\n  Inmate's claim: Limiting the receipt of stamps in mail violates his \nreligious belief in writing letters.\n  Inmate's claim: The prison's delivery of mail interfered with his \nusual sleeping pattern. A lawsuit was filed.\n  Mr. President, 40 percent of the lawsuits--the litigation handled in \nour Federal judiciary in the State of Nevada is prison litigation--40 \npercent of it. Lawsuits like: ``Prison destroyed his hobbycraft \nitems.'' What were they? Woman's clothing. This was a man, of course.\n  Inmate's claim: Forced to wear a size 5 tennis shoe when the actual \nsize of his foot was 4 3/4.\n  He filed a lawsuit.\n  Inmate's claim: The prison chaplain refused to perform same-sex \nreligious ceremony.\n  Mr. President, if these were not so serious, we would laugh about it. \nForty percent of the Federal judiciary in Nevada spends their time on \nthis garbage.\n  Inmate's claim: He filed a lawsuit claiming the cake he was served \nfor dessert was hacked up.\n  Inmate's claim: Jeans fit him improperly, and because of that he \nsuffered an epileptic seizure.\n  Those must have been tight jeans.\n  Inmate's claim: Prison denied him incense and jewelry to use in the \npractice of his religion.\n  This next one is a dandy.\n  Inmate's claim: He ordered two jars of chunky peanut butter from the \nprison canteen and was sent one jar of chunky and one jar of creamy.\n  He filed a lawsuit.\n  You know, Mr. President, this is just horrible. And to think that we, \nthe taxpayers, are paying for all of this--not only in the time of the \njudiciary but, as I indicated in my narrative to begin with, we are \noften supplying the lawyers. And, the prisoners have better law \nlibraries than 90 percent of the lawyers in America.\n  Almost 100 percent of these claims are dismissed, but the judges have \nto go through all of them. Yet, notwithstanding the odds against \nprevailing, inmates continue to file suits. They laugh about it. On one \nnational TV program, a man bragged that he filed hundreds of them \nhimself. With our rate of incarceration increasing, this will go up. \nFew would back a solution that reduces our prison population. \nIronically, this is practically what some judges are doing through the \nordering of prison population Caps.\n  There is much that this amendment has in it, Mr. President. It is \nsomething that we should adopt. Some may ask, is there a need to curb \nthis? I have gone over the reasons I think we need to curb it. I have \ntalked about some of the cases in Nevada. But these are only a few \nNevada cases. There are hundreds of them. The attorney general--every \ntime she talks, she talks about her staff time being used on these \nkinds of cases. She cannot render opinions that legal constitutional \nofficers in the State of Nevada want her to do because she is defending \nchunky peanut butter. One prisoner filed a claim as to how many times \nhe should be able to change his underwear.\n  This problem, as the Senator from Utah indicated, plagues all States.\n  In California, an inmate alleged that prison officials implanted an \nelectronic \n\n[[Page S 14628]]\ndevice in his brain to control his thoughts. He claimed that his \nthoughts were then broadcast over the prison PA system.\n  Another California inmate claimed he suffered mental anguish worrying \nthat tear gas would be used if he refused to exit his cell.\n  An Indiana inmate sued the State of Indiana for $3,000, but he was \nnot sure why. He asked the court to determine what the cause should be.\n  An Iowa inmate sued for the right to lobby the legislature to approve \nconsensual sex between minors and adults.\n  A Massachusetts inmate brought suit claiming the State should not \nhave thrown out the personal property he left behind after he escaped \nfrom prison.\n  A Missouri inmate sued because the prison did not have salad bars and \nbrunches on weekends.\n  Well, Mr. President, this is the worst. I feel very strongly about \nthis legislation, and we can go into detail about what it does. But, \nbasically, without going into a lot of detail, it would stop this kind \nof foolishness. This foolishness costs tens of millions of dollars \nthroughout the States. The taxpayers finance this litigation.\n  A report on ABC suggests the cost of inmate litigation hindered the \nexpansion of Head Start and the rebuilding after Hurricane Andrew.\n  The attorney general of California has 50 attorneys working full-time \ndoing this. Dan Lungren, who I served with in the House of \nRepresentatives, now the attorney general, has 50 lawyers working on \nthis, all the time. They do not do anything else.\n  We need to make sure that the prisoners, when they file these \nlawsuits, they pay. There is no reason they should get the legal docket \nfree. If they have money in the bank, let them pay. If they have a \nmeritorious lawsuit, of course they should be able to file. I support \nthat.\n  Today, our attorneys general deal with thousands of these lawsuits. I \nhave indicated that almost none of them have any merit. The amendment \nestablishes procedural hurdles that will prevent frivolous lawsuits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I want to say, because I saw on the floor the Senator from \nArizona, Senator Jon Kyl, who has been extremely helpful in preparing \nthis legislation based upon his experience in the law and the work his \nstaff has done, and I want to compliment and applaud the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nGrassley, Brown, and Helms be added as a cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 and was pleased to join Senator Hatch as \nan original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  We have an opportunity here to put a stop to the thousands and \nthousands of frivolous lawsuits filed by the prisoners across this \nnation. They have tied up the courts with their jailhouse lawyer antics \nfor too long. This amendment will allow meritorious claims to be filed, \nbut gives the judge broader discretion to prevent frivolous and \nmalicious lawsuits filed by prison inmates.\n  In my home State of South Carolina, the State government last year \nspent well over $1 million to defend against frivolous lawsuits filed \nby inmates. Compare that to 10 years ago when South Carolina spent only \nabout $20,000 to defend these types of lawsuits. The problem is getting \nworse, not better.\n  Mr. President, the overwhelming majority of these cases are \ndismissed, in fact well over 95 percent. We need to put a stop to these \njailhouse lawyers who are making a mockery of our criminal justice \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, the other provisions in this bill will place limits on \nFederal judges who have been micromanaging prisoners with population \ncaps. Our amendment requires a strong showing from the judge to justify \npopulation caps as the least intrusive means as a judicial remedy. We \nneed this legislation. I commend Senator Hatch for offering it and I \nurge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our colleague \nfrom Arizona--I do not know that there is any opposition to it. In \nfact, I believe we can probably get this accepted by voice vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Arizona who has been a \nmajor mover in this area, whose attorney general was one of the major \ncauses of this legislation be granted, I ask unanimous consent that 4 \nminutes be granted to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, and 1 \nminute to the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, and 3 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nhave an amendment and I have a speech. I have no problem with it being \naccepted. If other people are going to speak to it then I will speak to \nit.\n  I hope that we all will have learned by now, when you win, accept the \nvictory, put the speeches in later. I hope we do that.\n  Stemming the tide of frivolous prisoner lawsuits is certainly an \nimportant goal.\n  Our courts are flooded with lawsuits brought by prisoners. The \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts reported that in fiscal year \n1994, 39,100 Federal and State prisoner civil rights cases were filed \nin Federal court. This volume of cases drains precious court resources, \nfurther burdening an already overburdened court system.\n  But in solving these problems, we must not lose sight of the fact \nthat some of these lawsuits have merit--some prisoners' rights are \nviolated--some prisons are terribly overcrowded.\n  In one case, for example, children in a severely overcrowded juvenile \ndetention center in Pennsylvania--a facility that was at 160 percent of \ncapacity--were beaten by staff--sometimes with chains and other \nobjects. These problems were not resolved until a court order was \nentered.--(Santiago versus City of Philadelphia.)\n  In a recent case right here in the District of Columbia, Judge June \nL. Green found that correctional officers had routinely sexually \nassaulted women prisoners--one had raped a woman prisoner, another had \nforced a prisoner to perform oral sex. When these conditions were \nreported to the D.C. correction officials, nothing was done. It was \nwhen court entered an order that the district take steps to prevent \nthese incidents from recurring that the prisoners were able to get \nrelief.--(Women Prisoners of D.C. Dept. of Corrections versus D.C.)\n  Senator Hatch's amendment has two overriding problems--first, in an \neffort to curb frivolous prisoner lawsuits, the amendment places too \nmany roadblocks to meritorious prison lawsuits.\n  Second, in an effort to relieve the courts and State and local \ngovernments from the overwhelming task of dealing with frivolous \nlawsuits, Senator Hatch's amendment, in fact, creates restrictions on \nthe power of those governments from voluntarily negotiating their own \nagreements and would place an even greater burden on the courts to \nlitigate and relitigate these suits.\n  Because Senator Hatch's amendment makes only marginal improvements \nover what is already in the bill, I oppose this amendment, just as I \noppose the similar provision in the committee bill.\n  I am willing to withhold if others are. I ask that the Senator maybe \nreconsider his request and accept it by voice vote and make speeches \nlater.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. If my colleagues would forgo so we can pass this--we are \nall interested in passing it and establishing once and for all that we \nhave to get rid of frivolous prisoner litigation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator withdraw the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent 2 minutes be given to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes right now and speak in \nsupport of this legislation. I appreciate the Senator from Utah \nbringing it to the floor, and I also appreciate the kind comment from \nthe Senator from Nevada. \n\n[[Page S 14629]]\n\n  This is clearly a bipartisan effort. Obviously, this legislation is \ngoing to pass.\n  I just wanted to indicate where this came from. The attorney general \nof Arizona, Grant Woods, brought this matter to my attention several \nmonths ago, and we brought it to the majority leader, and we introduced \nlegislation to cut the prisoner litigation.\n  It has been in effect now in the State of Arizona pursuant to State \nlaw for about a year, and the prisoner litigation there has been cut in \nhalf as a result of the requirements that we place on the filing of \nlawsuits, by the inmates in the Arizona State system.\n  If you can extrapolate from the same statistics, it clearly ought to \nresult in the reduction of delays and expenses in our Federal court \nsystem if we are able to impose the same requirements on our Federal \nprisoners when they attempt to litigate.\n  All we are doing is asking they pay the same kind of filing fees and \ncosts that a citizen who has not committed any violation of law has to \npay, and that their suits be subject to the same kind of requirements \nin terms of meeting the tests of a legitimate lawsuit rather than just \nbeing a frivolous lawsuit.\n  I think if we can extrapolate the figure to all 50 States, from the \nexperience we had in the State of Arizona where the litigation has been \ncut in half, we ought to be able to save about $81.3 million. That is a \nsignificant chunk of change that would save the United States taxpayers \nin addition to the benefit of unclogging the courts.\n  Mr. President, there is one other thing that this will do. I think it \nbegins to send a message that prison is not necessarily a nice place. \nYou do not have extra privileges when you go to prison. You certainly \nought not to be treated any better than the average citizen.\n  Another part of this bill is to put impediments on ``special \nmasters,'' and I think by doing that we also make it clear we regain \ncontrol of the Federal court system, and we do not just allow the \nFederal judges to dictate to the States how their prison systems will \nbe run. I am pleased the legislation will be adopted and pleased to \nexpress my views.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have frivolous lawsuit lists printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Top 10 List: Frivolous Inmate Lawsuits in Arizona\n\n       (10) Death row inmate has sued corrections officials for \n     taking away his Gameboy electronic name. (Donald Edward Beaty \n     v. Bury)\n       (9) An inmate brought a suit demanding $110 million because \n     of a delay in receiving a dental appointment for a toothache. \n     (Beasley v. Howard)\n       (8) An inmate convicted of murder and a subsequent escape \n     attempt brought a suit based on the denial of dental floss. \n     Anzivino v. Lewis)\n       (7) An inmate brought suit for damages to his electric \n     typewriter and fan. He alleges the damage was done because \n     prison officials did not allow him to have a surge protector \n     in his cell. (Prison officials disallow surge protectors \n     because they can be easily fashioned into lethal weapons.) \n     (Souch v. State)\n       (6) An inmate alleged his First Amendment right to freedom \n     of religion was being denied because he was not allowed to \n     have conjugal visits. (Jamison v. ADOC)\n       (5) An inmate alleged he was libeled and slandered by a \n     female prison official who referred him to disciplinary \n     action after he continually walked into the restroom she was \n     using. (Holt v. Grant)\n       (4) An inmate sued because he was not allowed to reside \n     with his spouse, who is a fellow prison inmate. The inmate is \n     a convicted murderer, while his spouse, whom he has met only \n     at their prison marriage ceremony, is a convicted kidnaper. \n     (Boyd v. Lewis)\n       (3) An inmate alleges that the Department of Corrections \n     failed to properly rehabilitate him. Therefore, when he was \n     released on parole he was arrested and convicted of another \n     crime, which resulted in more jail time. (Kabage v. ADOC)\n       (2) A male inmate sued alleging his constitutional rights \n     were violated by the refusal of prison officials to allow him \n     to have and wear a brassieres. (Taylor V. Adams)\n       (1) An inmate alleges that the correction officials have \n     retaliated against him. Part of that retaliation he alleges \n     occurred when he was not invited to a pizza party thrown for \n     a departing DOC employee. (Dickinson v. Elliott)\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              Top 10 Frivolous Inmate Lawsuits Nationally\n\n       (10) Inmate claimed $1 million in damages for civil rights \n     violation because his ice cream had melted. The judge ruled \n     that the ``right to eat ice cream . . . was clearly not \n     within the contemplation'' of our Nation's forefathers. [NT--\n     Clendenin v. State]\n       (9) Inmate alleged that being forced to listen to his unit \n     manager's country and western music constituted cruel and \n     unusual punishment. [OK--Watkins v. Sutton]\n       (8) Inmate sued because when he got his dinner tray, the \n     piece of cake on it was ``hacked up.'' [NV--Banks v. Hatcher]\n       (7) Inmate sued because he was served chunky instead of \n     smooth peanut butter. [TX--Thomas v. State]\n       (6) Two prisoners sued to force taxpayers to pay for sex-\n     change surgery while they were in prison. [PA--Brown v. \n     Jeffes and Doe v. Vaughn]\n       (5) Inmate sued for $100 million alleging he was told that \n     he would be making $29.40 within three months, but only made \n     $21. [KS--Williams v. Dept. of Corrections]\n       (4) Inmate claimed that his rights were violated because he \n     was forced to send packages via UPS rather than U.S. mail. \n     [CA--Alcala v. Vanquez]\n       (3) Prisoner sued demanding L.A. Gear or Reebock ``Pumps'' \n     instead of Converse. [UT--Winsness v. DeLand]\n       (2) Prisoner sued 66 defendants alleging that unidentified \n     physicians implanted mind control devices in his head. [MI--\n     Doran v. McGinnis]\n       (1) Death row inmate sued corrections officials for taking \n     away his Gameboy electronic game. [AZ--Donald Edward Beaty v. \n     Bury]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues a very insightful and compelling portrayal of the U.S. \nMarine Corps. In yesterday's Washington Post, George Will provides a \nheartfelt tribute to the culture and character our Nation's premier 911 \nforce. It is an excellent editorial which I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to review.\n  As Mr. Will so appropriately points out, the U.S. Marine Corps is a \nvery unique institution. Its culture is rich with tradition, its \ncharacter strong on conviction. Honor, discipline, valor, and fidelity \nare its virtues; dedication, sacrifice, and commitment its code. To \nthose who willingly join this elite society, service is not merely an \noccupation, it is a way of life.\n  Mr. President, as we grapple with the challenges of balancing the \nFederal budget and downsizing our military force structure, there is \nmuch we can learn from the U.S. Marine Corps. The men and women of our \nCorps have experienced fiscal adversity first hand. For decades they \nhave endured shortfalls in procurement, operations, and \n\n[[Page S 14630]]\nmaintenance and qualify of life programs. Yet, amidst the challenges of \nausterity, they have remained true to their convictions and determined \nin their vow to be the most ready when the Nation is least ready. They \nhave always delivered on this promise, and answered the Nation's call.\n  Whether rescuing American citizens in Rwanda, maintaining the watch \noff Somalia, conducting migrant rescue and security operations in the \nCaribbean, and ashore in Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti, responding to crises \nin the Persian Gulf, or rescuing downed pilots in the hills of Bosnia, \ntoday's Marine Corps continues to deliver on its commitment to the \nAmerican people and the United States Constitution. We owe them a \nprofound debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent that yesterday's \nWashington Post oped piece by George Will be printed in the Record, I \ncommend Mr. Will for his thoughtful observations on the U.S. Marine \nCorps, and I encourage each of my colleagues to read this article and \nreflect upon the service these brave men and women provide to our \nNation.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     The Military's Counterculture\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Quantico Marine Corps Base, Va.--President Truman was a \n     former Army captain and given to pungent expression of his \n     prejudices, one of which was against the Marine Corps, which \n     he derided as ``the Navy's police force'' with ``a propaganda \n     machine almost equal to Stalin's.'' He said that in August \n     1950. Note that date.\n       During the postwar dismantling of the military, other \n     services grasped for the Marine Corps' missions and budget. \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Omar Bradley, a \n     Missourian and Truman confidant, said, ``large-scale \n     amphibious operations . . . will never occur again.'' He said \n     that in October 1949.\n       In the summer of 1950 the Korean War vindicated the Marine \n     Corps' vow to be the most ready when the nation is least \n     ready. While Truman was criticizing the Corps, Marines were \n     rushing to Pusan to help stop the North Korean sweep, then \n     going to Inchon in September for the great amphibious landing \n     that reversed the tide of the war. The ``propaganda of \n     deeds'' was the Marines' decisive argument regarding their \n     future.\n       Today, in another military contraction, there again are \n     voices questioning the Corps' relevance. Critics should come \n     here, to these 60,000 acres devoted largely to a stern \n     socialization of a few young men and women. The making of a \n     Marine officer amounts to a studied secession from the ethos \n     of contemporary America. The Corps is content to be called an \n     island of selflessness in a sea of selfishness, and to be \n     defined by the moral distance between it and a society that \n     is increasingly a stranger to the rigors of self-denial.\n       The commanding general here, Paul K. Van Riper, says \n     Quantico begins by teaching officer candidates four things--\n     discipline, drill, knowledge of the service rifle and the \n     Corps' history and traditions. The last is not least in a \n     small institution that subscribes to Napoleon's dictum that \n     ``In war the moral is to the material as three to one.''\n       Marines tell young men and women thinking of joining one of \n     the military services that there are three choices and one \n     challenge--that the Corps is a calling, not just a career. On \n     this day, a cluster of young officers--from Harvard, the \n     University of North Carolina, as well as the Naval Academy \n     and other fine colleges and universities--eating a lunch of \n     field rations in a grove of trees agrees. Says one, other \n     people tell you what they do, Marines tell you what they are.\n       A barracks poster portraying the Trojan horse proclaims \n     that ``Superior thinking has always overwhelmed superior \n     force,'' and officers are impatient with the stereotype of \n     (as one puts it) ``Marines with their knuckles dragging on \n     the ground.'' ``Why would the Marine Corps need a library?'' \n     asked an incredulous congressman when the Corps asked for the \n     one it subsequently got. The answer is that this nation, with \n     its vast human and material resources, has often waged wars \n     of attrition, but the Marine Corps, the smallest service, \n     must be, like Stonewall Jackson in the Valley, imaginative.\n       Being so is a tradition. During the 1930s the Marines \n     refined the amphibious tactics that soon were used from North \n     Africa to the South Pacific, and after 1945 were particularly \n     innovative regarding the use of helicopters.\n       True, there has not been an amphibious assault since \n     Inchon, and Iraqi sea mines--inexpensive leverage for second-\n     rate nations--prevented one during Desert Storm. However, the \n     Marine Corps, which 50 years ago was in danger of being \n     consigned to largely ceremonial roles and embassy protection, \n     is the service least affected by the end of the Cold War.\n       Lt. Col. Thomas Linn dryly estimates that about once every \n     11 years since 1829, someone in the White House or the other \n     services has declared the Marine Corps dispensable. However, \n     it is the nation's forward deployed expeditionary force and \n     will not want for work in a world increasingly ulcerated by \n     small, low-intensity conflicts fueled by religious, ethnic, \n     and other cultural passions.\n       Speaking of cultural conflicts, what makes the Corps not \n     only useful but fascinating is, again, its conscious \n     cultivation of an ethos conducive to producing hard people in \n     a soft age. Toward the end of their 10-week program, officer \n     candidates arrive in the predawn gloom at the Leadership \n     Reaction Course--a series of physical and mental problems \n     they must try to solve under the stress of short deadlines. \n     The candidates arrive after a two-mile run they make after \n     they make an eight-mile march, which they make after being \n     awakened after just two hours sleep. What is their reward for \n     choosing this steep and rocky path in life? Life-and-death \n     responsibilities at age 23.\n       Looking for today's ``counterculture''? Look here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2840\n\n     (Purpose: To provide funding for the U.S. Travel and Tourism \n    Administration for implementing certain recommendations and for \n                       carrying out a transition)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself, Mr. \n     Burns, Mr. Hollings, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, \n     Mr. Graham, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Daschle, \n     and Mr. Thurmond, proposes an amendment numbered 2840.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n            United States Travel and Tourism Administration\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the United States Travel and \n     Tourism Administration, for implementing the recommendations \n     from the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism and for \n     carrying out the transition of that Administration into a \n     public-private partnership, $12,000,000, to be transferred \n     from the amount for deposit in the Commerce Reorganization \n     Transition Fund (established under section 206(c)(1) of this \n     title) that is made available in the item under the heading \n     ``commerce reorganization transition fund'' under the heading \n     ``General Administration'' under this title, notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to report the floor manager \nhas indicated that this amendment will be accepted. I want to \nacknowledge the support of the distinguished Senator from Montana, who \nhas been most helpful in working through this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, if I may, to him. I made remarks earlier this \nmorning. This deals with the USTTA. The distinguished floor managers \nhave accommodated that.\n  I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I do not \nthink there is anybody on the Commerce Committee who is any more \ndedicated to the health of the industry we call tourism. If the \nAmerican people would look around, this happens to be one part of the \nCommerce Department that produces an export that is $20 billion to this \ncountry in the black--not in the red. In fact, if it was not for \nagriculture and tourism, our balance of payments would look really bad.\n  But when any industry produces around $77 billion in foreign exchange \nearnings every year, we have to take note, especially since this \ncountry probably makes less investment in this part of our national \neconomy than any other part.\n  Mr. President, 7.7 million people visited our State of Montana. \nSometimes \n\n[[Page S 14631]]\nwe think we are pretty authentic, but I also understand where the \nSenator from Nevada is coming from, too, because they have a very \nactive tourism part of their State government and he has been \nsupportive of that.\n  If this amendment is accepted, it is only an increase of around $5 \nmillion, because there is already $7 million of transition funds in \nthere. Also, the plans and preparations are being made to privatize \nthis department because the tourism industry wants to put together the \nfunds. They think they can do a better job in establishing this \ncommission than the Government can, and we agree with them. But let us \ngive them the time, some funds, and a transition period and let them do \nit.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as a former Governor of Florida, where the \ntourism industry is the State's largest employer, I am amazed at the \nfact that an industry with such tremendous economic impact can \ncontinually be so under-appreciated and misunderstood. Travel and \ntourism is the second largest industry in the United States behind \nhealth care, employing more than 13 million Americans both directly and \nindirectly. Last year, foreign spending on U.S. travel accounted for 39 \npercent of all service exports and 9 percent of total U.S. exports \nresulting in a $22 billion trade surplus.\n  The work of the administration gives our country international \npresence. USTTA plays an important role in helping States and the \nprivate sector to develop its international travel market, a part of a \ncoordinated national marketing and economic strategy. State governments \nand private industry depend on USTTA research to assist them in \nmarketing activities and spending decisions.\n  In Florida, tourism represents a $33 billion a year industry, \nemploying 750,000 residents. International visitors, who make up 20 \npercent of Florida tourists, also have a regional impact. Often, \ntourists first visiting the United States will travel to Florida or \nCalifornia. On subsequent visits, however, statistics show they are \nlikely to travel throughout the region or the country.\n  Yet while we are debating this issue today it is imporant to note \nthat the National Governors Association at their 1995 summer meeting, \nadopted a resolution supporting the USTTA and their proposal to \ntransition the agency into a public private partnership at the end of \nfiscal year 1996.\n  The resolution states:\n\n       The Governors believe that a strong public private \n     partnership is essential to promote tourism abroad and \n     increase visitation to the United States. The Governors also \n     believe that in a number of areas, the federal government \n     bears responsibility for functions that can ensure benefits \n     for state and national economies and international visitors.\n\n  This resolution like the Bryan-Burns amendment has bipartisan support \nbecause in the final analysis international tourism promotion is an \ninvestment in economic development and job creation. The United States \ncannot afford to be the only one of 157 developed nations without an \nofficial National Tourism Office.\n  Additionally, the first ever White House Conference on Travel and \nTourism will bring together the recommendations of over 15,000 travel \nand tourism representatives from the 55 States and territories. One of \nthe key recommendations to be announced is the strong support for a \nnational tourism office that will serve as a catalyst for implementing \na national tourism strategy for the 21st century.\n  Please join me in supporting the Bryan-Burns amendment which provides \none additional year of funding at the $12 million level to allow the \nagency to transition itself in a businesslike and professional manner \nwhile implementing the recommendations of the first ever White House \nConference of Travel and Tourism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have worked out a good agreement \nhere. We have decided in the committee to terminate this agency. Our \ndear colleagues asked for a provision that would allow them to phase it \nout over a year's period with a definite commitment that at the end of \nthe year it is gone, with a transition into a private partnership \nprogram. I think it is an excellent amendment. I am happy to accept it.\n  I know Senator Hollings feels the same way, so we are happy to accept \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I acknowledge publicly my appreciation for \nthe response of the Senator from Texas.\n  I ask unanimous consent the junior Senator from California, Senator \nBoxer, be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2840) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2841\n\n     (Purpose: To protect the reproductive rights of Federal women \n                               prisoners)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendment is set \naside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Cohen, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Mikulski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2841.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 34, strike lines 1 through 7.\n\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Hampshire on the condition I do not lose my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I seek to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest at this time that I will present a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to this amendment that is pending, there will be 20 minutes \nof debate equally divided, that there will be a vote at 6 o'clock on \nthe sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I am prepared to accede \nto the vote at 6 o'clock providing there is a consent to my amendment \nwhich I discussed with the manager.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Which is this?\n  Mr. SPECTER. This is the amendment to strike the language which \nprohibits the expenditure of funds to pay for abortion for a woman in \nprison.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will not object with the understanding it has been \ncleared on our side. Is that the understanding of the Senator from \nPennsylvania?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No; it has not been cleared on that side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Then we have to object until I have had the opportunity \nto consult with our manager.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I object to the interruption of the pendency of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment which I have sent to the \ndesk--I had not sought clearance from Senator Hollings because Senator \nGramm objected to it so there was no point in seeking clearance. But \nthe amendment provides we strike lines 1 through 7 on page 34. The \namendment would strike the following language:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated by this title shall be \n     available to pay for abortion except where the life of the \n     mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, \n     or in the case of rape, provided that should this prohibition \n     be declared unconstitutional by a court of competent \n     jurisdiction, this section shall be null and void.\n\n  Mr. President, the law at the present time is that a woman in prison \nmay obtain an abortion under circumstances where the prison authorities \nthink it is appropriate to do so. The use of this procedure has been \nvery, very limited.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The procedures have been used on a very limited basis. \n\n[[Page S 14632]]\n   From April of 1995 through July 18, only nine abortions were performed \non Federal women prisoners.\n  The restrictions on the ban were lifted in late 1993, but when \nlanguage was not included in the appropriation bill, the Bureau took \nmore than 1 year to reestablish procedures for funding abortion \nservices. In 1994, I am advised that there were 73 live births to \nFederal prisoners. In 1995 there have been 21 births.\n  The Bureau of Prisons advises that there are nearly 7,000 women \nincarcerated for Federal crimes, and about 70 percent of those are \nthere on drug offenses.\n  The situation would exist, if this language were to become law, the \nlanguage which I seek to strike, that women in prison who have a \nserious medical need would be denied an abortion. They obviously are \nnot in the position to pay for their own abortions when they are in \njail and unable to earn any money.\n\n  By way of background, in 1995, an amendment was offered to prohibit \nfunding to the Federal prison system for abortions on pregnant inmates \nexcept when the life of the mother was in danger. A tabling motion \nfailed on a 46 to 46 vote. Then the amendment was defeated on a \nconstitutional point of order--may we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will be in \norder.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment was then defeated on a constitutional point of order 47 \nto 48, that prisoners are legally entitled to adequate medical care \nwhen there exists a serious medical need.\n  The thrust of this amendment would place women in prison in a very \ndisadvantaged position, and it is my view this language ought to be \nstricken.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment \noffered by the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The amendment would strike from the bill before us the provision \nwhich prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortion services for \nwomen in Federal prison.\n  But, let me be clear. The amendment would leave intact language in \nthe bill which provides a conscience clause for those opposed to \nabortion. That language, which this amendment does not touch, ensures \nthat no person would be required to perform, or facilitate in any way \nthe performance of, any abortion.\n  Let me tell you why I believe this amendment must be adopted.\n  The provision contained in the committee-passed bill is part of a \nwideranging assault on women's reproductive rights. Mr. President, it \nis going to be a long autumn for America's women. Let us look at what \nhas happened already.\n  The Senate has voted to deny women who are Federal employees coverage \nunder their health plans for abortion services.\n  A Senate/House conference committee has voted to ban abortions for \nwomen in the military stationed overseas.\n  The House has voted to let States deny Medicaid abortions for victims \nof rape and incest.\n  The House version of the D.C. appropriations bill would tell the \nDistrict of Columbia that it can not use its own, locally raised, \nrevenues for abortions for poor women.\n  Legislation to ban certain late term abortions, even when severe \nfetal abnormalities are present or the woman's life or health is at \nserious risk, is under consideration in both the House and Senate.\n  And now, under the bill before us, no abortions for women in Federal \nprisons.\n  Action after action, vote after vote, we have seen yet another attack \non women's reproductive rights. We are facing a full scale assault on \nwomen's constitutionally protected right to choose.\n  Those who oppose reproductive rights know better than to launch a \ndirect attack. The public strongly supports the right to choose, and \nthe antichoice forces know it.\n  So, instead they chip away at the right, hoping perhaps that no one \nwill notice that yet another group of women have lost their rights.\n  The bill before us today picks upon a particularly vulnerable \npopulation. Women in prison. Women who are totally dependent on health \ncare services provided by the Bureau of Prisons.\n  Let us be honest. There is no significant Federal expense involved in \nproviding abortions for women in Federal prisons.\n  Only nine women have obtained abortions since earlier prohibitions \nwere repealed in 1993. So this is of no real consequence to the Federal \nbudget.\n  Yet, it is a huge issue for the few women who do find themselves in \nthis desperate circumstance. These are not women who have the resources \nto ever afford private medical services. So by including this provision \nin this bill we are voting to deny these women access to a legal \nmedical procedure.\n  And who are these women?\n  Over two thirds of the women in Federal prisons are drug offenders. \nMany of them are in poor health, perhaps HIV-infected, or suffering \nfrom AIDS--with all the risks this entails for a developing fetus. Many \nare themselves victims of abuse.\n  To add to all this, if these women are forced to carry a child to \nterm, they face the certainty that the child will be taken from them. \nHow can we force women facing these circumstances to bear children \nagainst their will?\n  To deny these women the right to make their own decision on \nabortion--a decision carefully arrived at after consultation with a \nphysician and appropriate counseling--is unconscionable.\n  The provision included in this bill is bad policy. It is one more \nattack on women's reproductive rights.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n in opposition to back-door approach to undermining the constitutional \n                          right to an abortion\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to sections 103 \nto 105 of the Commerce Justice State appropriations bill. These \nsections would further undermine the constitutional right to an \nabortion.\n  The right to an abortion was first articulated by the Supreme Court \nin the 1973 Roe versus Wade decision. This decision balanced the \ninterests of protecting the fetus with the important interests of the \nmother, establishing a trimester system under which the right to choice \nin this country was delineated. Subsequent decisions have held that the \nGovernment may not place an undue burden on the woman's right, prior to \nfetal viability, to make a decision whether or not to have an abortion.\n  There is no right to choose without access to choice. Restricting \nwomen's choice on these appropriations bills, and on other unrelated \nlegislation, is a circumspect, back-door approach to prohibiting \nabortions.\n  For women who cannot afford an abortion on their own, for poor women, \nthis back-door approach to limiting abortions is just one more step to \na back alley abortion.\n  The many efforts to undercut the constitutional right to an abortion \nin this Congress, and earlier Congresses, have been documented by the \nNational Abortion Rights Action League in their publication, ``The Road \nto the Back Alley.'' I recommend that interested individuals consult \nthis publication.\n  Efforts to undercut a woman's right to choose have included:\n  Blanket restrictions on Federal funding for abortions. As an \nalternative to unsuccessful congressional efforts to prohibit abortion \noutright, abortion opponents have worked to ban the use of Federal \nfunds to pay for abortions. These restrictions, popularly referred to \nas ``Hyde amendments,'' have been attached to appropriations bills ever \nsince Roe Versus Wade. The most recent of such measures was \nRepresentative Istook's amendment to give States the option of not \nproviding funds to Medicaid recipients in cases of rape and incest.\n  Banning U.S. aid to international family planning groups performing \nabortions or abortion counseling. In June, the House approved an \namendment to a foreign affairs bill that would ban U.S. aid to any \ninternational organizations that perform abortions, counsel women on \nabortions, or lobby on abortion issues.\n  Prohibiting health insurance companies from paying for abortions for \nFederal employees. On July 19, the House approved reinstatement of \nlegislation \n\n[[Page S 14633]]\nprohibiting the Federal Employees Health Insurance Program from paying \nfor abortions, except when a woman's life is in danger. The Senate \napproved similar language on August 4, with exceptions for rape and \nincest.\n  Barring abortions at military hospitals, even when paid for \nprivately. On June 16, the House voted to restore a ban President \nClinton had lifted against privately funded abortions in overseas \nmilitary hospitals.\n  Prohibiting certain types of late-term abortions. On July 18, the \nHouse Judiciary Committee reported legislation that would make it a \ncrime for doctors to perform a late-term abortion procedure called \nintact D This procedure is extremely rare, and almost exclusively \nlimited to cases in which tragic fetal deformities have been detected.\n   This is only a partial list of the back-door assaults on a woman's \nright to choose. The proposed language is just one more step in the \nlong line of rollbacks on women's reproductive freedoms. I urge my \ncolleagues to strike this language from the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is House language in the bill. The \nHouse language is very clear. We are talking about taxpayers' money. \nBoth the House and the Senate have taken the position that when the \ntaxpayers' money is being spent to fund abortions, that abortion should \nbe restricted, that it ought to be restricted to rape, to incest, and \nto the life of the mother.\n  What the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania will do by striking \nthe Hyde language from this bill is to basically give taxpayer funding \nfor abortion on demand. I do not believe that the House or the Senate \nsupports that action, and I am opposed to it.\n  Let me see if any of my colleagues want to speak on the issue. If \nnot, we will have a motion to table.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to make another attempt at \npropounding this unanimous consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the debate and \ndisposal----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will Senators and \nstaff please take their conversations to the cloakrooms?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire may proceed.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of debate \non the present Specter amendment, that my sense-of-the-Senate \nproposal--which would be to the underlying bill which will be offered \nand not be subject to a second degree--would be debated for 20 minutes, \nwith 10 minutes on both sides, and that there would then be a sequence \nof votes should there be a vote ordered on the Specter amendment. If \nthere is not a vote ordered on the Specter amendment, then there would \nbe just a vote that would occur on my sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will agree to that time agreement, and \nI think 10 minutes on each side is adequate. I will only modify it with \nthe one additional request, that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator \nKohl, be recognized to offer the next amendment following the \ndisposition of the Specter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I want to be sure I \nunderstand this. At the conclusion of the debate on this amendment, \nthen the Gregg amendment would follow, and there would be back-to-back \nvotes on my amendment and the amendment by the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. There would be 20 minutes of debate on my sense of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, is there an understanding \nas to how long we will be debating the Specter amendment? Could we get \na time agreement on that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is our intention to move to table the amendment now.\n  Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield?\n  I say to the minority leader, I have no intention to debate. I am \nprepared to move to table. But I do not want to cut the debate off if \nthere are others who wish to speak. At this time, if it is appropriate, \nI move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \noffered by the Senator from New Hampshire, as modified by the \nDemocratic leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to table the Specter amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from New Hampshire hold off on that for \na brief reply to what the Senator from Texas had to say?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief reply, the \nlanguage in this bill is even more restrictive than the Hyde amendment. \nAs the Senator from Texas has propounded, the language of the Hyde \namendment limits abortion except for rape, incest, or the life of the \nmother, and that amendment does not even permit an abortion in the \nevent of incest. Rather, the current language of the bill does not \npermit abortion even in the event of incest.\n  The language is that none of the funds appropriated by this title--in \nprison, my colleague from Texas says. But a prisoner can be impregnated \nas a result of incest before coming to prison. This language is even \nmore restrictive than the Hyde language. This language says that none \nof the funds appropriated by this title shall be available for an \nabortion except for the life of the mother----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senate will \nplease come to order.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Except when the life of the mother would be endangered \nif the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape.\n  It is entirely possible that a woman might be the victim of incest \nprior to the time she is incarcerated. It still takes 9 months from the \ntime of impregnation to give birth to a child. Incest is a distinct \npossibility within that time limit.\n  Contrary to what the Senator from Texas has said, this is not a \nmatter of abortion on demand. This is a matter of abortion when the \nprison authorities permit the abortion to be carried out. It is not a \nmatter that a woman can simply demand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order?\n  Mr. SPECTER. And if there is a case of serious medical need, a woman \nought to be entitled to have an abortion. These women are in prison. \nThey are obviously not able in most cases--in many cases--to earn \nenough money to have an abortion. When the matter is left within the \ndiscretion of the prison officials considering all the circumstances, \nit has been used on a very, very limited basis, with the statistics \nshowing that only seven abortions were conducted in a period of several \nmonths since they were begun in April 1995 through mid-July.\n  I think this is a very reasonable position leaving the decision in \nthe hands of the prison authorities, and I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if no one seeks recognition for further \ndebate, I move to table the Specter amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2842\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2842.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with. \n\n[[Page S 14634]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that none of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act \n     should be used for the deployment of combat-equipped forces \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground \n     operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina unless--\n       (1) Congress approves in advance the deployment of such \n     forces of the Armed Forces; or\n       (2) the temporary deployment of such forces of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States into Bosnia and Herzegovina is \n     necessary to evacuate United Nations peacekeeping forces from \n     a situation of imminent danger, to undertake emergency air \n     rescue operations, or to provide for the airborne delivery of \n     humanitarian supplies, and the President reports as soon as \n     practicable to Congress after the initiation of the temporary \n     deployment, but in no case later than 48 hours after the \n     initiation of the deployment.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment which I proposed originally I \nhad planned to offer as to the continuing resolution, as an act versus \na sense-of-the-Senate, but in an attempt to accommodate my colleagues--\n--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. Staff \nand Members will please take their conversations to the Cloakroom.\n  Mr. GREGG. To accommodate my colleagues----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I cannot \nhear the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. The \nSenators to the left of the Chair, please take their conversations to \nthe Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, in an attempt to accommodate my colleagues, who I \nunderstand wish to move on to other business but who I also think \ndesire to speak on this issue in some manner before we break for a \nweek, I have made this----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may say, there are conversations on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate when the Senator is trying to speak about \na very crucial issue that is a matter of life and death, and I urge, if \nthe Chair could, the Chair to be even stronger than he has been to get \nsome order because it is hard for me to hear sitting right across from \nthe Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is attempting to be strong. I hope \nthe Senators will be strong in holding forth their conversations \nelsewhere.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair for his strength.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to raise the issue of how this \nlegislative body should address the pending potential introduction of \ntroops into Bosnia, American troops.\n  The administration has stated on a number of occasions that it is a \ndistinct possibility that up to 25,000 American soldiers will be asked \nto serve on the ground in Bosnia. That, of course, creates a \nsignificant issue first for those soldiers who would be putting their \nlives at risk but also for us as a country as to whether or not it is \nappropriate for us to be asking our men and women to put at risk their \nlives in this conflict.\n  It seems, when there has been such a clear statement of purpose and \npotential risk for American troops, it is appropriate that we as a \nCongress act to either approve that action or disapprove that action. \nClearly, the power to undertake actions which put American soldiers' \nlives in harm's way lies primarily and first with the President, but \nobviously we as a Congress also play a major role, not only on the \nappropriating side but, more importantly, on the side of being \nconcerned for our soldiers, many of whom will obviously be our \nconstituents.\n  Therefore, I feel strongly that prior to the President taking this \naction, he should come to the Congress and ask for our approval. I \nbelieve he should meet three tests before we give him that approval.\n  First, he should be able to define what it is that the soldiers will \nbe asked to undertake, what the conflict is that we will be entering \nand what our role is in that conflict.\n  Second, he should be able to explain to us the length of time and the \nmanner in which they are going to serve when they are on the ground and \nwhat sort of risks they will be put at.\n  And, third he needs to be able to express to us how we will be \ngetting our soldiers out.\n  I think it is very important that he define in this process what our \nnational interest is in putting American lives at risk. That is the \nbottom line, I believe, that he must satisfy as President.\n  In addressing that issue, the appropriate body to address it to, \nobviously, is the American people but also the Congress of the United \nStates as the representative of the American people. Therefore, I do \nfeel it is absolutely critical that before troops are deployed in this \nregion, especially in the numbers which are being considered by the \nadministration--25,000--we have a full and open debate of the matter \nhere in the Congress and that we get from the President a clear and \nprecise and understandable definition of purpose in undertaking this \nvery serious act.\n  So this sense-of-the-Senate resolution essentially addresses that \nissue. It says that the President shall come to the Congress before he \nsends troops into harm's way in Bosnia except in certain limited \ncircumstances.\n  The language which I have agreed to is actually language which I \noriginally drafted and then presented to the other side, which was \nreviewed, and to which they made some adjustments, and I understand it \nis now acceptable to the Democratic leader. As such, I hope we could \nhave strong support of this because it is clearly the role of the \nCongress to undertake this sort of debate and pursue this sort of \naction before our troops are deployed in this type of situation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who controls time in opposition to the \namendment?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe I am in control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, could I be notified after 4 minutes?\n  Mr. President, I agree with this amendment expressing the sense of \nthe Senate that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \navailable pursuant to this act shall be used for deployment of combat \nequipped forces of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground \noperations in Bosnia unless, and then the two conditions as set forth: \nCongress approves in advance deployment of such forces of the Armed \nForces and the temporary deployment authority.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does not have the effect of law and \ndoes not tie the President's hands. It does state the sentiment and \nview of the Senate of the United States. If it did tie the President's \nhands at this critical juncture while the peace negotiations are \nunderway, I would oppose it and vote against it. We should not tie the \nhands of the President at this critical juncture. If the word went out \nthat there was going to be no U.S. participation after a peace \nagreement is entered into, then there likely would be no peace \nagreement entered into by the parties.\n  Mr. President, America must lead. We have seen what happens when we \ndo not lead. We have recently seen what happens when we do lead. Our \nleadership must be in NATO and through NATO. Our objections to \ndeployment, if there are objections to deployment, of troops by the \nUnited States should also be applicable to NATO troops because we are \npart of that alliance. It is not just the United States we are \nconcerned about. It is also our allies and the alliance itself. Our \nconditions for deployment should be made known through NATO and that \nforum.\n  Before any decision is made to deploy U.S. forces or in my view NATO \nforces pursuant to a peace agreement, we should ask a number of \nquestions, a very difficult set of questions, a very important set of \nquestions regarding that deployment.\n  The first question that I would have--and there would probably be \nothers that would occur to me as time goes on--are the borders between \nthe various factions under the peace agreement both definable and \ndefendable? Is \n\n[[Page S 14635]]\nthis a sound peace agreement? If we are deploying pursuant to a peace \nagreement, the key question is, what kind of peace agreement? Is it a \nsound peace agreement? Does it have a reasonable chance of success? And \ncan U.S. forces and NATO forces enhance the prospects of success?\n  The second question I would have: Has the President clearly made the \ncase to the American people that the deployment of U.S. ground forces \nis important to America's national security? That case must be made. \nThe American people must understand this. They must support it. That is \na condition that has to be fulfilled if we are going to have a \nsustainable position if things get rough in Bosnia. And they could get \nrough--no one should be mistaken about that--although the risk has gone \ndown substantially compared to a month ago when the lines were not as \nclear as they have been since the recent ground action.\n  Mr. President, the concern I have would not be simply the rights of \nthe Bosnian Moslems versus the Bosnian Serbs but also the rights of the \nBosnian Moslems vis-a-vis the Croatian-Bosnians, if that kind of \nfederation breaks up. And it is very important that federation not \nbreak up.\n  Another question, Mr. President, that I think has to be discussed by \nour executive branch and by Congress, do we have an exit strategy? By \nthat I mean, do we know when the mission will be successful, when it \nwill end and how we define success?\n  That involves at least deciding in advance with our allies whether we \nare going to arm the Bosnian Moslems before we exit--before we exit--or \nwhether we are going to find another way to level the playing field so \nthat the parties can defend their own territory including the \npossibility of a build down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield myself 1 more minute, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the other question that occurs to me at this moment is \nwhether NATO is clearly going to be in charge. NATO must be in charge. \nThere must be no dual key. We cannot have a repeat of what we have had \nin the last 2 years with the United Nations having the dual key. I \nbelieve it is also imperative, if we are going to deploy NATO forces \nand U.S. forces, that we deploy a robust force, a force that is big \nenough and tough enough and well enough equipped not to be pushed \naround and to defend itself in the event of any kind of conflict.\n  There must be clear rules of engagement. And those rules of \nengagement must permit a very vigorous response to any attack on U.S. \nforces or NATO forces.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few of the questions that I believe \nare important.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nLieberman and Senator Domenici as cosponsors.\n  I yield 2 minutes to Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution because I \nthink it is indispensable that advance approval be given by Congress \nbefore U.S. troops are deployed, absent the emergency situation \ndescribed in subparagraph 2.\n  When the distinguished Senator from Georgia talks about impeding the \nultimate peace agreement, it seems to me that we ought to put everyone \non notice that congressional approval is required before there will be \na commitment of 25,000 U.S. personnel. What we are really involved in \nin modern times is that the constitutional authority of the Congress to \ndeclare war has been undermined by the conflict in Korea, which was \nreally a war without a congressional declaration, and by the Vietnam \nwar, which was really a conflict there without a congressional \ndeclaration, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution not really being a \nsubstitute.\n  There was very serious debate on the floor of this body in January of \n1991 when the use of force was authorized. I took the position, as did \nmany Senators, that the President, a Republican President, George Bush, \ndid not have the authority to go into the gulf war without \ncongressional authorization.\n  The questions which have been posed by the Senator from Georgia are \nvery important questions for congressional debate. We should not have a \ndecision made to obligate U.S. personnel without congressional \nauthority. And everyone who is a party to the negotiations there ought \nto understand that that is the position of the Congress.\n  Without support from the American people, the military action cannot \nbe sustained. That support is determined by the action of the Congress \nof the United States. So this is a very important resolution to put \neveryone on notice, including the President of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Georgia yield me 1 minute?\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield the Senator from Michigan 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair.\n  I wonder if the Senator would be willing to answer a question \nrelative to his understanding of this resolution.\n  I, first of all, think he laid out a series of very important \nquestions, and I concur that those are critical questions that need to \nbe answered prior to the use of ground forces in Bosnia.\n  But my question of the Senator is this: He pointed out this is not \nlegally binding because it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. If this \nsame language at a later time were offered without the words that it is \na ``sense of the Senate'' so that it did then become a legally binding \ndocument or language, would it be consistent for those of us who might \nvote yes today to vote no at a later time because of the timing of the \noffer of that language or for any other of a number of possible \nreasons?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield me 30 additional seconds?\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I will respond to the Senator from Michigan that his question should \nbe answered, yes, it would be consistent. There is a great deal of \ndifference in expressing to the President what the view of the Senate \nis and then passing a law that binds the President, particularly when \nthis kind of negotiation is going on. So it would be consistent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I went to the White House today and met \nwith the President and Members of the Senate on this particular \nsubject. I took the occasion at that time to make three points:\n  First, the American public needs to fully and completely understand \nwhat U.S. national security interests are at stake before the United \nStates commits or sends United States service men and women to Bosnia.\n  Next, the President of the United States should not commit or send \nU.S. troops without congressional approval.\n  Now, if that congressional approval is given--this is the third \npoint--any U.S. forces will have to be under the NATO operational \ncontrol with robust rules of engagement. And I feel that this is such a \nserious situation, that these three points should be observed in \nconsidering this important matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I thank \nthe Senator from New Hampshire also for working out language with us. \nThis is precisely the same thing we have already voted on in the Senate \nby 99 to 1. We basically already approved this language. It is a \nvariation in the language here today. But it is the same principle. And \nthe principle is very simple; that if we are going to engage in a \nlarge-scale peacekeeping effort, the country is better off and the \nPresident \n\n[[Page S 14636]]\nis better off with approval from Congress.\n  I think it is very important to note that the meeting that the \nSenator from South Carolina just talked about today was attended \nbroadly by House and Senate Members, bipartisan leadership.\n  The President made it very clear, saying that he thought President \nBush did the right thing in coming to Congress to ask for approval. He \nthought the Congress did the right thing in giving it. But we should \nremember that President Bush sent 500,000 troops to the gulf prior to \nany approval from Congress. All he had was a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution saying this was OK after the fact. The President \nappropriately has reserved the right with respect to constitutional \npower not to make a commitment. And we should not hold him to that.\n  So I think it is entirely appropriate here today to say that a sense \nof the Senate should have unanimous approval. But if this were a law \ntying the hands of the President, I think many Members on the other \nside would also join us in disapproving it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NUNN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 55 seconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, of that time, I yield to the Senator from \nIllinois 1 minute and I yield to the Senator from Connecticut 55 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I agree with everything the Senator from \nGeorgia had to say. I reach a different conclusion. And I may be the \nonly one voting against this. Tom Friedman of the New York Times had a \ncolumn recently in which he said, ``France acts like a great power but \ndoes not have the resources. The United States has the resources but \ndoes not act like a great power.''\n  We cannot have effective foreign policy if Congress micromanages it. \nThe Senator from Georgia asks a series of questions. I think there is \none other question. Does it help peace in Bosnia to adopt this \nresolution? I think it unnecessarily raises questions, and I am going \nto vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \nthe remaining time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I am privileged to be \na cosponsor of it because I think it ought to be the beginning of \nbipartisan cooperation on this question of authorizing American troops \nto be part of a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. The fact is that this \namendment is consistent with what President Clinton has said. He has \nclearly said he expects and would welcome congressional action prior to \nany dispatch of American troops to Bosnia to enforce a genuine and just \npeace agreement.\n  Mr. President, I want to make very clear that I view the exercise of \nAmerican leadership to bring about the NATO strikes which have brought \nBosnia now to the verge of peace as an exercise of leadership which has \nrevived NATO's credibility.\n  There is no way, if there is a peace agreement, that we can maintain \nour credibility and NATO's if we do not contribute American troops to \nthat peacekeeping force.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes \n40 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Let me take a moment to challenge the notion that somehow \nthe U.S. Senate is engaged in micromanagement.\n  We are talking about the President of the United States, who is \nconsidering deploying 25,000 troops to one of the most hostile regions \nin the world, that has been filled for centuries with ethnic hatred, \npoison and death. And we are talking about deploying those troops to \nthat region without having any sort of defined plan presented to us, \nwithout knowing what the ground rules are going to be, so to speak, \nwithout knowing who is in charge, without knowing what the Russian role \nis going to be.\n  If ever there was a case in which we ought to be consulted and give \napproval, it is this one.\n  Let me also take issue with those who said, ``Well, President Bush \nfinally came to Congress.'' It was only after we insisted day in and \nday out and by going down to the White House, that the President \nfinally agreed to come to Congress to get authority. Before that \nPresident Bush was determined to say, ``I only have to get authority \nfrom the United Nations, that's where I get my authority.'' We resisted \nthat, and we actually forced the administration to come to us. Not only \nwas it politically wise for him to do so, but we believe he was \nconstitutionally mandated to do so.\n  So the notion that somehow we are micromanaging is misconceived. We \nare the ones who raise and support the Army, and we have a coequal \nresponsibility, not just the President, if we start deploying 25,000 \ntroops to a region that has been afflicted over the centuries with \nhatred and conflict.\n  Mr. President, I support the Senator's resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this resolution lays down the ground rules \nfor any major American involvement in Bosnia, and essentially they are: \nThe President must explain to this Congress and the American people \nwhat the national interest is which justifies putting American lives at \nrisk, and must receive the approval of this Congress before those lives \nare put at risk.\n  That is a reasonable request in a democracy, and I appreciate the \nsupport of the Members of the Senate in this matter.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will use 2 minutes of my leader's time \nto comment on the pending matter.\n  We had a good meeting with the President this afternoon. Many of us \nwere there, Republicans and Democrats. I think he understands the \nadministration needs to present their case to Congress.\n  I asked three questions, very short questions: How many? How long? \nAnd how much? How many American troops, men and women are going to go \nto Bosnia? How long are they going to be there? And how much will it \ncost? That is the first thing the American people want to know.\n  I believe we are making progress in that part of the world because of \nthe bipartisan efforts of Members of Congress who have stood firm in \nsupport of a small nation, an independent nation, a member of the \nUnited Nations, Bosnia and Herzegovina. That plus the Croatian military \naction a couple of months ago, in my view, moved us along, plus the \nnegotiating efforts by the administration.\n  So I think everybody can take some credit. But the case has not been \nmade to this point. It may be made, perhaps it will be made. The view I \nhad from the President, without quoting anything he said, is that he \ncertainly understood that they would have to come up and make their \ncase. They are going to ask for money, and I think they will go before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, maybe the Armed Services Committee and \nmaybe make an excellent case.\n  I know how bitter some of the debate was during the gulf crisis, and \nI know many in this body said we ought to have sanctions, that \nsanctions would work. We still have sanctions, and Saddam Hussein is \nstill there. It has been years and years, so that was not the right way \nto go.\n  In any event, I hope that we will do what we should do. We are \ntalking about American lives, American young men and women, and we do \nneed to make a very careful judgment, and I think this sends a strong \nsignal that we will make that careful judgment. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 14637]]\n\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted \n1 minute for debate before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I wish to congratulate the majority leader \nfor the remarks he just made. I thought it was an excellent meeting at \nthe White House today.\n  I will simply say that I think the President unquestionably has \nagreed to consult with the Congress. I believe that commitment was made \nagain today.\n  This is a very critical time. I hope and believe that adoption of \nthis measure is meaningless, but I hope and think at this particular \ntime we could do no good by adopting this once again, but, obviously, \nit will be adopted. I will oppose it because I think it is ill-timed \nfor us to be stepping into this matter once again at this particular \njuncture.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord a letter the President sent to me on October 20, 1993. Let me \nread one paragraph:\n\n       I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a \n     strong expression of support of the United States Congress \n     prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation \n     of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome \n     and encourage congressional authorization of any military \n     involvement in Bosnia.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1993.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Dear Mr. Leader:\n       The violent conflict in the former Yugoslavia continues to \n     be a source of deep concern. As you know, my Administration \n     is committed to help stop the bloodshed and implement a fair \n     and enforceable peace agreement, if the parties to the \n     conflict can reach one. I have stated that such enforcement \n     potentially could include American military personnel as part \n     of a NATO operation. I have also specified a number of \n     conditions that would need to be met before our troops would \n     participate in such an operation.\n       I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a \n     strong expression of support from the United States Congress \n     prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation \n     of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome \n     and encourage congressional authorization of any military \n     involvement in Bosnia.\n       The conflict in Bosnia ultimately is a matter for the \n     parties to resolve, but the nations of Europe and the United \n     States have significant interests at stake. For that reason, \n     I am committed to keep our nation engaged in the search for a \n     fair and workable resolution to this tragic conflict.\n       In closing, I want to express my sincere appreciation and \n     respect for the manner in which we have been able to work \n     together on important issues affecting national security. \n     Over the years, the greatest successes in American foreign \n     policy have had bipartisan support. I am gratified that we \n     have been able to sustain that tradition and thank you for \n     your leadership in that regard.\n           Sincerely,\nBill Clinton\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14630-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14637-S14639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, before moving to the vote, I would like to \ntake up the CR, which has now been cleared on each side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the consideration \nof House Joint Resolution 108.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 108) making continuing \n     appropriations for the fiscal year 1996, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, the Senate has received from the House \na joint resolution to provide funding through November 13, 1995, for \nthe continuation governmental activities carried out during fiscal year \n1995.\n  This is a clean bill, providing funding for the activities funded in \nthe 13 annual appropriations bills. The funding levels are sufficient \nto continue government activities without prejudice to the ultimate \nenactment of regular bills, but at levels sufficiently low to provide \nan impetus for successful completion of those bills.\n  The bill continues ongoing programs at restrictive rates that are the \naverage--less 5 percent--of the 1996 levels in the House-passed and \nSenate-passed bills. For those programs that are terminated or \nsignificantly affected by either the House or Senate bills, the rate \nmay be increased to a minimal level--which could be up to 90 percent of \nthe current rate. In any instance where the application of the formula \nwould result in furloughs then the rate can be increased to a level \njust sufficient to avoid furloughs.\n  I would have preferred to come here today to announce the enactment \ninto law of the 13 regular bills, rather than to urge your support for \na continuing resolution covering those 13 bills. At this point, \nhowever, non of the regular bills has been enacted into law. I am \nhopeful that before the end of the session we can resolve our \ndifferences with the administration and the House and have 13 bills \nenacted into law. The 6 additional weeks granted by this resolution \nwill give us some breathing room for addressing some fundamental \ndifferences between the executive and legislative branches.\n  This joint resolution is very restrictive. This resolution is drafted \nso that there is very little incentive to extend the resolution for a \nlonger time. For example, section 114 mandates that the resolution \n``shall be implemented so that only the most limited funding action of \nthat permitted in the resolution shall be taken in order to provide for \nthe continuation of projects and activities.'' In addition, section 113 \nmandates that, for those programs that had high initial rates of \noperation or completed distribution of funds to other entities at the \nbeginning of fiscal year 1995, no similar distributions shall be made \nor grants shall be awarded that would impinge upon final funding \nprerogatives. Also, section 109 states that no provision in the fiscal \nyear 1996 Appropriations Acts that makes the availability of any \nappropriation contingent upon the enactment of additional authorizing \nor other legislation shall be effective before the expiration date set \nforth in the resolution. These provisions help guarantee that neither \nthe executive nor legislative branches will prefer continuation of this \nresolution to the enactment of the regular fiscal year 1996 bills.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I congratulate the Republican leadership \nin the House and Senate for working diligently over the past number of \ndays in hammering out with the administration this continuing \nresolution, H.J. Res. 108. I particularly compliment the efforts of the \nchairmen of the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, \nCongressman Livingston and Senator Hatfield, for their leadership in \nworking out this agreement. These two chairmen deserve the lion's share \nof the credit for working day and night over the past several weeks in \nnegotiations with the administration on this continuing resolution.\n  Enactment of this resolution will provide the necessary funds to \ncontinue the operations of all agencies and departments of the Federal \ngovernment over the period October 1 (the beginning of fiscal year \n1996) through November 13, 1995. In addition, the resolution provides \nthat, upon enactment into law of any of the 13 regular appropriation \nbills for fiscal year 1996, that full year appropriation act shall \nsupersede the continuing resolution.\n  This continuing resolution is necessary to enable Congress to \ncomplete its work on the fiscal year 1996 appropriation bills. To date, \nonly two of the 13 regular appropriation bills have been sent to the \nPresident for his signature--namely, the Military Construction \nAppropriation Bill and the Legislative Branch Appropriation Bill.\n  There are a number of other bills upon which conferences either have \nbeen completed or are nearing completion. However, the President has \nindicated that he will veto as many as five, or possibly more of the \n1996 appropriation bills. Among the bills that he has expressed his \nintention to veto are the Defense Appropriation Bill, which, in the \nPresident's view, provides several billion dollars above what he and \nthe \n\n[[Page S 14638]]\nPentagon agree is necessary in defense spending for fiscal year 1996. \nThe President rightly believes that this excess defense spending could \nbe more wisely used to ease the dramatic reductions that are contained \nin a number of the other 1996 appropriation bills. These bills provide \nfor the investments in our Nation's physical and human infrastructure. \nThe President believes that too little funding is being recommended for \na number of these infrastructure programs in bills such as VA/HUD and \nIndependent Agencies; Labor/HHS; Commerce, Justice, State; and \nInterior. In addition to these bills, the President has objected to a \nnumber of legislative riders which are being recommended in several \nbills. Among these are: Treasury/Postal; Interior; Labor/HHS; Commerce, \nJustice, State; VA/HUD and Independent Agencies; and possibly others.\n\n  One can see that there remains a great deal of work to be done before \nall 13 of the regular 1996 appropriation bills can be signed into law.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Hatfield, has \nstated, the terms of this continuing resolution will ensure that all \nprojects and activities throughout the Federal Government will continue \nto operate at funding levels which will be reduced no more than 10 \npercent below their fiscal year 1995 levels. Furthermore, the language \nof the resolution prohibits furloughs of any Federal workers. In other \nwords, as White House Chief of Staff Leon Penetta has indicated, this \ncontinuing resolution will ensure a level playing field as very \ndifficult negotiations continue on the 1996 appropriation bills and \nwill allow us an additional 44 days to resolve the differences that \nremain in connection with a number of them.\n  I am sure that all Members share my hope and desire that all of the \nremaining differences can be resolved and that conferences can be \ncompleted and that all thirteen appropriation bills can be enacted \nprior to the expiration of this continuing resolution, so that we can \navoid the need for further continuing resolutions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this resolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I understand that the joint \nresolution would continue funding actions during fiscal year 1996, for \nHUD essentially under the provisions of the fiscal year 1995 VA, HUD, \nan Independent Agencies Appropriation Act. Funding would continue at a \nvariety of different levels, depending on the circumstances, under the \nauthority and conditions of the 1995 appropriation act. Some of the \nauthority and conditions is in the appropriation accounts themselves, \nsuch as the Stewart B. McKinney Act provision in the annual \ncontributions for assisted housing account that permits the proceeds of \ncertain refinancings to be split between PHAs and the Treasury. Other \nauthority and conditions, such as the amendments to the U.S. Housing \nAct of 1937, at section 8(c)(2)(A), that purports to sunset at the end \nof fiscal year 1995, are in the administrative provisions.\n  Is my understanding correct that the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment will continue under this joint resolution to have the \nauthority to share savings from bond refinancings with State and local \nbond issuers pursuant to the Stewart B. McKinney Act, and continue to \napply the provisions that would otherwise sunset?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator's understanding is correct. Authorities and \nconditions, such as those under the McKinney Act and the section 8 \nprograms that you cite, and all other administrative provisions in the \n1995 Act, would remain in effect during the period covered by the joint \nresolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President today the Senate is considering House \nJoint Resolution 108, the resolution to continue appropriations for \nfiscal year 1996. I would like to ask the manager of the bill to \nconfirm my understanding that the continuing resolution keeps in place \nfor its duration the moratorium on the listing of the endangered \nspecies and the designation of critical habitat enacted in Public Law \n104-6 of April 10, 1995. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am joined by Senators Gorton, Kempthorne and Kyl in \nmaking this statement in order to clarify the continuing resolution, \nand to prevent any misunderstanding of its terms.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Would the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Drinking Water, \nFisheries and Wildlife of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I am glad the Senate is clarifying the intent of House Joint \nResolution 108 to continue the moratorium placed on listing and \ncritical habitat designation under the Endangered Species Act. This \nextension will ensure consistency in federal policy as the debate on \nthe endangered Species Act [ESA] moves forward. This is important \nbecause in the next few weeks I will introduce my bill to reform the \nESA. I thank the floor leader and Senator Hutchison for their efforts \nto clarify this issue.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator from Idaho yield?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Certainly.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would just like to echo the statements of the Senator \nfrom Idaho. As a strong supporter, and one who worked with the Senator \nfrom Texas in developing her amendment to the Defense supplemental, I \nbelieve that the continuing resolution must continue the current \nmoratorium on listing and critical habitat designations under the ESA. \nThe continuation of this moratorium during the short time of the \ncontinuing resolution is even more critical because the fiscal year \n1996 Interior appropriations conference report includes language that \nextends the current moratorium.\n  As chairman on the Interior appropriations subcommittee, I included \nlanguage in the fiscal year 1996 Interior conference report that \nprohibits listings and critical habitat designations under the ESA \nduring fiscal year 1996, or until legislation reauthorizing the act is \nenacted. It is critical to maintain the moratorium during the short \ntime period covered by the continuing resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will vote for this continuing resolution \nbecause we should not shut down the government. Defeating this \nresolution would force millions of Americans to bear the weight of \npolitical intransigence. That is neither fair nor prudent.\n  However, I oppose the practice of delaying appropriations bills, and \nthen propping the country up on a temporary set of crutches without \nfirm Congressional direction. In many cases, the crutches are \ninadequate. I am most concerned about the way the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistant Program was treated by this measure. This Resolution \nessentially means that Vermont LIHEAP families, many who only earn \n$7,200/year, will not get any help to keep warm in October. While this \nCongress goes back and forth about budget numbers in warm conference \nrooms and well-appointed offices, some Vermonters will be seeing their \nbreath in the air of their homes.\n  In their third effort to kill LIHEAP this year, the House Republicans \nhave rationalized that LIHEAP funds are expended equally all year \nround, as if just as much money is spent in August as is spent in \nNovember. Therefore, the Continuing Resolution makes about 16 percent \nof the money available on October 1, 1995. In fact, in past years \nStates have received 60 percent of the money in the first quarter which \nhas amounted to $900 million, or $3.2 million for Vermont.\n  Under the extreme limitations of this Continuing Resolution, Vermont \nreceives only about $500,000 and the net effect is that LIHEAP families \nwill not receive October assistance. I welcome the LIHEAP opponents to \ncome to Vermont in late October when the leaves are off the trees, the \nground is freezing under the corn field stubble, and a cold Canadian \nwind blows under a slate gray sky. People will be cold.\n  I have been working with the White House and other members of \nCongress to get the Republicans to accept a six month schedule so that \n30 percent of money is available at a reasonable time of year. They \nhave rejected that proposal, and forced us to accept this proposal by \ndelaying the final consideration of the Resolution. I am disappointed \nby this approach to LIHEAP, disappointed by the political tactics \ninvolved in passing the resolution, and disappointed that we do not \nhave our appropriations bills finished. None-the-\n\n[[Page S 14639]]\nless, I am forced to support this resolution because of the \ncircumstances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14637-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PASS THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION NOW\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in support of House Joint \nResolution 108, the continuing resolution. I am pleased that Congress \nand the President, after long negotiations, were able to work out this \nagreement that would provide interim levels of funding for programs and \nactivities of the Federal Government until November 13, 1995.\n  I understand the President will sign this bill. Its expected \nenactment over the weekend will avert a massive shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment, and all of the many costly problems that would cause for \npeople in my State and throughout the Nation who depend on the Federal \nGovernment for Social Security, Medicare, student loans, farm payments, \nand other benefits and services--and for Federal workers who might \notherwise have been furloughed for an extended period starting as early \nas next week. I expect that the administration will exercise its \nspending authority to avoid furloughs that is provided for in this \nbill.\n  I am also pleased that at my urging, working with White House Chief \nof Staff Leon Panetta, the Appropriations Committee removed the \noutrageously unfair and arbitrary provision in the bill which would \nhave prohibited any Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) \nfunding to be distributed to the States.\n  Several days ago, I alerted Appropriations Committee Chairman \nHatfield to my concerns about this matter in a letter, a copy of which \nI ask be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the letter, I observed that LIHEAP \nis a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help 5.6 million very low-\nincome American families--or roughly 15 million individuals--to pay \ntheir energy bills. More than two-thirds of LIHEAP households have \nannual incomes less than $8000; more than one-half have incomes below \n$6000. Further, the average LIHEAP recipients spend 18.4 percent of \ntheir income on energy, compared with 6.7 percent for all households.\n  I pointed out that Minnesota is the third coldest State, in terms of \nheating degree days, in the country, after Alaska and North Dakota. \nEspecially in cold-weather states like Minnesota and Oregon, funding \nfor LIHEAP is critical to families with children and vulnerable low-\nincome elderly persons, who without it could be forced to choose \nbetween food and heat.\n  The LIHEAP program assists approximately 110,000 households in \nMinnesota, and provides an average energy assistance benefit of about \n$360 per heating season. In Minnesota, where the first snows have \nfallen in some parts of the State, that heating season is already \nunderway, and many people are relying on this funding. While I believe \nthat more should have been released, considering the unique nature of \nLIHEAP which historically releases the bulk of its funds to cold-\nweather States immediately in October, I am pleased that at least some \nof these funds--about $140 million--will be made available immediately \non Monday to help pay fuel bills, fix or replace furnaces on an \nemergency basis, and help with weatherization against the coming \nwinter.\n  While final funding levels for LIHEAP for this winter and next will \nlikely have to be settled on the Senate floor, and in a conference \ncommittee, interim funding for the first part of this winter will be \nmade available on October 1 to avoid large numbers of utility shut-offs \nand other heating emergencies that could have resulted in serious \nheating-related tragedies, including the deaths of people in cold-\nweather areas whose furnaces fail and who are unable to get them \nrepaired or replaced, or other serious problems for those who are \nunable to pay for the heating season's first fill of fuel without \nLIHEAP assistance, or who are otherwise placed at risk by this \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, this is a compromise bill. It does not provide for \nadequate funding levels for all Federal programs. But in general it \napplies its spending formulas in a way that is fair and responsible, \nand I urge its prompt enactment.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to urge you to drop from the \n     continuing resolution that is being prepared for likely \n     Senate floor consideration later this week the provision that \n     would prohibit all federal Low-Income Energy Assistance \n     Program (LIHEAP) funds from being released until enactment of \n     the FY 1996 Labor-HHS Appropriations bill, which could be \n     delayed until late November.\n       In my view, it is outrageous that recipients of energy \n     assistance are being singled out, among those who are helped \n     by all programs of the federal government, for this special \n     funding restriction. I hope you will agree that isolating for \n     especially harsh treatment families with children and \n     vulnerable low-income elderly persons, who without LIHEAP \n     assistance early this winter could be forced to choose \n     between food and heat, is deeply unfair, arbitrary, and even \n     mean-spirited, and should be opposed. It is especially \n     troubling that such an important decision could be made \n     without a single hearing, or even a public indication of the \n     Committee's intentions.\n       As you know, the huge reductions in this winter's LIHEAP \n     funding (approximately 25 percent) contained in the recently-\n     enacted rescissions bill was one of the main reasons I \n     insisted on an opportunity to try to amend the bill to \n     restore LIHEAP funding on the floor. Though that effort was \n     unsuccessful, I believe it showed the substantial support \n     which exits within the Senate for the program, and for its \n     goal of providing critical energy assistance to qualified \n     recipients.\n       While final LIHEAP funding levels will likely have to be \n     debated on the Senate and House floors, and again in \n     conference, interim funding for early this winter must be \n     made available on October 1 to avoid large numbers of utility \n     shut-offs and other heating emergencies that could result in \n     serious tragedies. These could include the deaths of people \n     in cold-weather areas whose furnaces fail and who are unable \n     to get them repaired or replaced, or other serious problems \n     for those who are unable to pay for the heating season's \n     first fill of fuel without LIHEAP assistance, or who are \n     otherwise placed at risk by this provision.\n       LIHEAP is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help 5.6 \n     million very low-income American families--or roughly 15 \n     million individuals--to pay their energy bills. As the \n     Committee's report on the rescissions bill observed, more \n     than two-thirds of LIHEAP households have annual incomes less \n     than $8000; more than one-half have incomes below $6000. \n     Further, the average LIHEAP recipients spend 18.4 percent of \n     their income on energy, compared with 6.7 percent for all \n     households.\n       Minnesota is the third coldest state, in terms of heating \n     degree days, in the country, after Alaska and North Dakota. \n     Especially in cold-weather states like Minnesota and Oregon, \n     funding for LIHEAP is critical to families with children and \n     vulnerable low-income elderly persons, who without it could \n     be forced to choose between food and heat. The LIHEAP program \n     assists approximately 110,000 households in Minnesota, and \n     provides an average energy assistance benefit of about $360 \n     per heating season. In Minnesota, where the first snows have \n     fallen in some parts of the state, that heating season is \n     already underway, and many people are expecting this funding \n     to be released, as long scheduled, on October 1.\n       This proposal to arbitrarily prohibit distribution of all \n     LIHEAP funds to the states on October 1 could wreak havoc in \n     the lives of eligible vulnerable elderly, families with \n     children, and other low-income people in my state and across \n     the nation. I urge you in the strongest terms to reject it.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Paul David Wellstone,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. DOLE.

May we have order?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, this resolution is very similar to the \nresolution we passed in 1993. If I had my way, I would not have brought \nup the resolution at this point in time. Of course, every Senator has \nthe right to bring up whatever they would like on any bill under our \nprocedure. The peace agreement is being negotiated now. This \nresolution, in my view, is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that does \nnot have the effect of law. It is not binding on the President. It does \nmake it clear the Senate of the United States expects the President of \nthe United States to, basically, have Congress speak to this issue \nbefore we have deployment of troops.\n  We had a good meeting at the White House today. I think the President \nmade it clear his position is very similar to what President Bush's \nposition was before the Persian Gulf war, that is, he would welcome an \nexpression by Congress approving this peacekeeping mission, but he at \nthis point in time certainly is going to consult with Congress in any \nevent.\n  Madam President, there are a lot of questions that need to be asked \nby the United States before this deployment takes place. We need to \nhave hearings in the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. We need to ask a lot of tough questions. Most of all, the \nAmerican people need to be informed by the President that this is truly \nin our national interest before we make any commitment under our NATO \nalliance.\n  But the United States must lead. If there is a deployment that takes \nplace after an agreement, it is important for the United States to ask \nthe tough questions before deployment within the NATO context, but it \nis also important for the United States to lead.\n  So, we have a long way to go before there is a peace agreement. We \nhave a lot to do before we, in the Congress, have done our duty by \nasking the questions. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is \nnot binding. It indicates the will of the Senate.\n  I will vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

John M. \nShalikashvili for reappointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and reappointment to the grade of general.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nnomination of Gen. John M. Shalikashvili for reappointment as Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff and for reappointment to the grade of \ngeneral.\n  We all know General Shali very well. His record is exemplary. General \nShali was only a young lad when he came to this country with his family \nas they immigrated from Poland. He began to excel almost immediately.\n  General Shali graduated from Bradley University receiving a degree in \nmechanical engineering. Later he received a Master's degree in \ninternational relations from George Washington University.\n  General Shali entered the Army as an enlisted man in August 1958. \nLater, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the field \nartillery. He served in the United States, Germany, and Vietnam rising \nto the rank of general, the highest rank attainable. He commanded a \ndivision. He was the deputy commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army in \nEurope. He also commanded Operation Provide Comfort, feeding and \npreserving the freedom of the Kurds in northern Iraq.\n  Not only did General Shali rise from the lowest enlisted rank to the \nhighest grade possible, he was selected to succeed Gen. Colin Powell as \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As such, he became the \nprincipal advisor to the President on military matters. To say that \nthis is a significant achievement is an understatement. His \naccomplishments represent what is right and good about America. General \nShali is an outstanding soldier and an outstanding American. Through \nhard work, dedication and professionalism, he became the most important \nmilitary officer in our Armed Forces.\n  Last week, the Armed Services Committee held a confirmation hearing \nat which General Shali testified. He responded fully and completely to \nevery question, many of which focused on current and potential \noperations in Bosnia. Following the hearing, the committee unanimously \nvoted to favorably report General Shali's nomination to the Senate.\n  I point out to my colleagues that General Shali's current appointment \nexpires at the end of September. In order to ensure there is no gap in \nhis appointment, the Senate will have to act on this nomination before \nthe end of the month.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm General Shali's nomination.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise not to object. I simply wish to make \na brief statement on this nomination.\n  I believe that the vast majority of the Members of the Senate are \ncommitted to confirming the very distinguished general. I, however, \nhave some concerns. Let me be specific.\n  I believe that part of the reason for America's military failures--\nand they have been few--has been a failure of leadership, not a failure \nof the American will, the American spirit, or the American fighting men \nand women.\n  This country has an extraordinary record in combat, and it has an \nextraordinary record in peace. But when you look at our failures--and \nthere have been few--you are struck by the fact that we have had a \nfailure of leadership at times. In Lebanon, President Reagan committed \nUnited States troops and literally left the guards at the gate without \nbullets for their guns. The decision was made because of diplomatic \nconcerns, but resulted in the loss of hundreds of American lives, of \nMarines who never had a chance to defend themselves.\n  That was a failure of leadership, Mr. President. It was not a failure \nof the men and women who sacrificed their lives. It was a failure of \nleadership to commit to their troops and ensure that they were never \nput in harm's way without a way to defend themselves.\n  This country's failure in Vietnam was a failure of leadership. \nAmerican troops were committed to combat. They were asked to risk their \nlives. They were asked to fly missions, they were asked to commit their \nvery lives to that combat. But our leadership was not committed to \nthem. This country followed a course of putting men and women in harm's \nway, of risking their lives, but it was not important enough for our \nleadership to stand behind them and stand with them.\n  I believe with all of my heart that it is a mistake to use military \nforce other than to fight and to win a war. It is a mistake to use them \nas social workers. It is a mistake to use them as policemen. It is a \nmistake to have them remove garbage in Haiti. It is a mistake for them \nto serve as a local police force. Our men and women in the Armed Forces \nare willing to risk their lives for us, and they deserve to have this \nUnited States stand behind them when they are committed to combat.\n  Mr. President, in 1993, October 5th to be exact, the administration \ncame forward and talked about their commitment of United States fighter \naircraft to maintain a no-fly zone over Bosnia. I specifically \nquestioned those testifying along this line: Was the administration \nwilling to stand behind the pilots that they sent into harm's way over \nBosnia? I asked for specific assurances that they would not do what \nthey did in Vietnam.\n  For those who may not recall our actions in Vietnam, the United \nStates sent planes into hazardous areas where we knew there were \nground-to-air missiles. We sent them on restricted courses, without the \nability to defend themselves and without the necessary rules of \nengagement that would have allowed our pilots to have a fighting chance \nto defend themselves. We even sent them at times into situations \nwithout any ability to retrieve them if they were shot down.\n  During the October 5 hearing, I was assured specifically that the \nmistakes of Vietnam were not to be repeated. I specifically questioned \nseveral times whether U.S. planes that were attacked would be permitted \nto retaliate and whether the retaliation would not be limited only to \nthe SAM that fired at them. In Vietnam, the United States response to \nenemy fire was limited in \n\n[[Page S 14642]]\nsuch a way that United States pilots who had been fired upon could not \nattack the supplies and the ammo depots. I was assured that in Bosnia \nthere would be a full and effective retaliation if our men and women \nwho fly the planes and the aircraft of the United States were fired \nupon.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, this was the answer of the Assistant \nSecretary of State for European Affairs, and I quote from the committee \nrecord:\n\n       They would have the necessary rules of engagement to permit \n     them to defend themselves if attacked and to carry out the \n     engagement which may require coercion. . ..\n\n  Now, some Members may have forgotten, but I do not think the family \nof our pilot has forgotten. On June 2, 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady, a \nyoung American pilot, was shot down over Bosnia by a ground-to-air \nmissile, a Serb SA6. After that shootdown, several things became clear.\n  First, that the Bosnian Serbs had made it clear in advance that they \nintended to go after our planes. This was not a secret. They had said \nit publicly, clearly and precisely.\n  Second, that the Bosnian Serbs had the capability, and we knew it; \nthat they had ground-to-air missiles, and we knew it.\n  Third, that their missile radar had painted our aircraft in that same \narea before O'Grady's plane was shot down.\n  Fourth, the plane was shot down, and\n  Fifth, we did nothing.\n  Now, this violates the very clear commitment that this administration \ngave us. They told the Foreign Relations Committee that if they sent \nour troops, our planes and our pilots into harm's way and they were \nfired upon, we would defend them. We were told specifically that United \nStates rules of engagement would not tie their hands as we did in \nVietnam, and that the United States would retaliate.\n  The truth is, we did tie their hands exactly as we did in Vietnam, \nand we did not retaliate.\n  That is wrong. If we want to risk young men and women's lives in \ncombat, if we want to do that, we ought to be willing to stand behind \nthem. If the United States is not willing to stand behind our fighting \nmen and women, do not send them to war.\n  If it is important enough to make the tough decision to send American \ntroops into harm's way--if we must do it--then do it. But if it must be \ndone, our leaders cannot tie the hands of our fighting men and women \nand we cannot desert them. We must not desert them when they are in \ncombat.\n  Now, that is what the United States did with this young Captain \nO'Grady. Thank God he came back alive. But, Mr. President, we did not \nmeet our commitment to him. We have not met our commitment to other men \nand women put into harm's way.\n  For those of you who think this is impossible, take a look at what \nhappened in Somalia. I do not need to remind you of that painful \nincident. It happened under a previous Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. The tendency exists to put combat troops into situations in \nwhich they are not permitted to defend themselves and do not have \nadequate backup.\n  For those of you who think these mishaps are over, take a look at \nwhat Haiti was, because the United States sent U.S. troops to collect \ngarbage and to act as a local police force. I think that was a mistake.\n  Mr. President, I rise because I believe the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff has a responsibility that is fundamentally different \nfrom that of other soldiers. The responsibility of soldiers in this \nNation is to follow orders. We believe in civilian control of the \nmilitary, and we ought to, and we ought to insist on it. But the \nresponsibility of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff goes \nfurther than just following orders. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff has to be the one who stands up when the political leadership \nmisunderstands the role of the military in this country.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I believe, is going to be \nthe one who says, ``Mr. President, do not use our troops to collect \ngarbage.'' ``Mr. President, do not send our troops and our planes into \ncombat situations without protection.'' ``Mr. President, if our planes \nare shot down, we must retaliate.''\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has a responsibility to \nrise above politics, to not simply follow orders. Most importantly of \nall, Mr. President, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has a \nresponsibility to every young man and every young woman in this country \nwho puts on a uniform. He has a responsibility to stand up for them, to \nspeak up for them, to be concerned about their welfare.\n  Mr. President, the Chairman has a responsibility to speak out if this \nNation ever attempts to put our combat troops in harm's way without \nstanding behind them, without giving them the ability to defend \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, I come to this nomination full of admiration for \nGeneral Shalikashvili on a personal basis, with great respect for his \nintellect, with deep respect for his military service and for his \ncommitment to this country. But, Mr. President, I do not feel that \nGeneral Shalikashvili has stood up for the men and women who wear the \nuniform of the United States. General Shalikashvili has tended to \nfollow orders from his superiors when he had a responsibility to speak \nout for conditions that will protect American fighting men and women.\n  General Shalikashvili should have insisted that if we send U.S. \nplanes to Bosnia into harm's way, the pilots have the right to defend \nthemselves fully. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has a \nspecial responsibility to America's fighting men and women. He must \nensure that every possible measure has been undertaken to ensure their \nsafety. That includes making clear to our country's leaders the actions \nnecessary for their protection. He has not fulfilled that part of his \njob. I wish to be recorded as opposing the confirmation.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Gen. John S. Shalikashvili for a second 2-year term as the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I have worked closely with General Shalikashvili or General Shali, as \nhe is usually referred to, over the years. This has been particularly \ntrue since August 1989 when then Lieutenant General Shali was the \ndeputy commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army. \nDuring that assignment, General Shali commanded the Combined Task Force \nProvide Comfort that provided humanitarian assistance to the Kurdish \nrefugees in Northern Iraq. That very difficult operation, which \ninvolved providing assistance to between 500 and 700,000 Iraqi Kurds \nwho had taken to the mountains and coaxing them back down to resettle \ntheir towns and villages, saved tens of thousands of lives.\n  From August 1991 to June 1992, then Lieutenant General Shali served \nas the Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In that \nposition, General Shali represented the then Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Powell, in interagency fora. Based upon his \nperformance in those demanding assignments, General Shali was promoted \nto four-star general in June 1992 and was assigned as the Supreme \nAllied Commander, Europe, the senior military officer of NATO, and \nCommander-in-Chief, United States European Command. General Shali has \nserved as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff since October 1993.\n  General Shali has testified numerous times before the Armed Services \nCommittee since his advancement to four-star rank. He also testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee in September 1993 in connection \nwith his initial nomination to be the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and testified again before the Committee last week in connection \nwith his nomination for a second 2-year term. The Committee voted \nunanimously to favorably report his nomination to the Senate.\n  I think that it is important to review the role of the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. I find that many people believe that the \nChairman has far more authority than he does. Under the law, the JCS \nChairman is the principal military adviser to the President, the \nNational Security Council and the Secretary of Defense. The chain of \ncommand runs from the President to the Secretary of Defense and from \nthe Secretary of Defense to the commanders of the combatant commands. \nCommunications between the President and the Secretary of Defense and \nthe combatant commanders are transmitted through the JCS Chairman. The \nSecretary of Defense has assigned to the \n\n[[Page S 14643]]\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs the responsibility for overseeing the \nactivities of the combatant commanders but that assignment does not \nconfer any command authority on the Chairman. The Chairman outranks all \nother officers of the armed services but he does not exercise military \ncommand over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any of the armed forces.\n  In other words, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the \nsenior member of our armed forces and the principal military adviser to \nour civilian leaders but he does not exercise command over any element \nof the armed forces and is not in the chain of command for our armed \nforces.\n  General Shali is responsible for giving the best military advice that \nhe can. There is no guarantee, however, that his military advice will \ncarry the day on any issue. He has agreed if asked, to give the \nCongress his personal views on any issue even if those views differ \nfrom the Administration. I have no doubt that he has fulfilled that \nagreement. As a matter of fact, General Shali's testimony before the \nArmed Services Committee last week was germaane to both of these \npoints. With respect to providing military advice he testified as \nfollows:\n\n       I am very much convinced that . . . the Secretary of \n     Defense and the President, and for that matter, the National \n     Security Council, not only welcome military advice, seek it, \n     give me every opportunity to voice my views. Again I say that \n     does not mean that my views are always the ones that prevail, \n     but I can think of only a few where they have not prevailed \n     and not in cases where I felt that whatever was decided was \n     such that I needed to walk away from it because I could not \n     in clear conscience support that.\n\n  With respect to a decision that was contrary to his advice, General \nShali testified as follows with respect to the complicated issue of \ndemarcation between theater and national missile defense:\n\n       . . . the Chiefs met on a number of occasions during this \n     period when demarcation and particularly specific limits on \n     interceptors were discussed, and we were always of the view, \n     all of us, that we should not place any limits on them. When \n     it came to the decision, everyone in the administration was \n     aware that my view and the view of the Joint Chiefs was that \n     we should not put any limits on it. The debate and the \n     decision went the other way. At the earliest possible \n     opportunity, I raised the issue that we need to reopen that \n     point and that we need to pursue without limits on \n     interceptors. I believe that is essentially where we are \n     today. So, I feel good that my view in the long term has \n     prevailed.\n\n  If the opposition is because of disagreement with the \nadministration's Bosnia policies or past Bosnia policies, then the \nopposition is misplaced because General Shali is an adviser not a \ndecisionmaker.\n  General Shali has my unqualified and strong support for confirmation \nfor a second 2-year term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Gen. John Shalikashvili to continue as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff.\n  He has the total well-being of the men and women in our armed forces \nforemost in his mind as he performs his duties. He has been a firm and \nsteady voice for assuring that when our military is used, it be only \nwith clear purpose and with the full backing of our civilian \nleadership. He has focused great resources on readiness, training, and \nmorale.\n  For these reasons, he has broad and deep support within the services, \nand enjoys the confidence of the military, from generals to privates. \nGeneral Shali is truly a soldier's soldier.\n  The General has rendered outstanding service to the Nation throughout \nhis career, and for the last 2 years as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. \nThe Armed Services Committee unanimously approved General Shali's \nnomination, and we have greatly benefited from his expertise, his \nresponsiveness to our inquiries and his clarity and directness. We \nalways get a straight answer to our questions, and get it promptly.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the nomination is \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to reconsider the vote whereby General \nShalikashvili was confirmed.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nPresident be immediately notified of this confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Just a procedural question, Mr. President.\n  Has this nomination passed the Senate by voice vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has passed.\n  Mr. NUNN. Has there been a motion to reconsider and a motion to lay \non the table?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been a motion to reconsider and to \nlay on the table.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, for allowing us to proceed with \nthis nomination ahead of his amendment. He is a gentleman and a \nscholar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14641-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2843\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the evaluation of crime prevention programs, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which I will \nsend to the desk after I explain it.\n  The amendment is being offered on behalf of myself and Senator Cohen, \nand cosponsors also include Senator Biden and Senator Snowe.\n  In last year's crime bill, Mr. President, we authorized $300 \nmillion--somewhat in excess of $300 million--for crime prevention. The \nsplit, as you recall, was 80 percent for law enforcement and 20 percent \nfor prevention.\n  The reasoning at that time was if we are going to have a balanced \ncrime bill, we have to be willing to spend some modest amount of money \non effective crime prevention measures and that an 80-20 split between \nlaw enforcement and crime prevention was reasonable, and we passed the \ncrime bill on that basis.\n  Well, what we are attempting to do today is strike virtually all of \nthat crime prevention money. It is an attempt to strike it from this \nbill so that we will have a bill devoted entirely to spending for law \nenforcement to the total exclusion of crime prevention.\n  It seems to me that is not what we intended to do and that is not \nwhat we should do and not what our country needs. There is no question \nthat spending a modest amount of money in a crime bill on trying to set \nup programs that have a proven record of success at keeping young \npeople from getting involved in crime in the first place, setting up a \nmodest amount of money in a crime bill to do these kinds of things is a \nreasonable effort. It should not be sidetracked.\n  We debated it at great length last year before we passed the crime \nbill and decided on an 80 to 20 split. There are programs like the \nblock grant programs. There are weed and seed programs. There are \nprograms which have been evaluated and demonstrated to work.\n  What I am suggesting is that we put back 25 percent, which is $80 \nmillion, out of that over $300 million that was authorized last year \nfor prevention. I and Senator Cohen, Senator Biden, and Senator Snowe \nare desiring to put back $80 million in proven effective crime \nprevention programs.\n  Now, that money is being taken from overfunding of the FBI for this \nyear. When I say overfunding, it is $80 million that the FBI did not \nask for, that the President did not ask for, that the House did not \nfund. It is an extra $80 million that has been given to the FBI. \n\n[[Page S 14644]]\n We are taking that $80 million and putting it into a very modest \naccount to fight crime by way of prevention. And that is what this \namendment is all about.\n  Before Senator Cohen speaks, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself and Mr. \n     Cohen, propose an amendment numbered 2843.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me express my support for what the \nSenator from Wisconsin is seeking to do. We have a choice to make in \nour society as to whether we are going to try to have intervention \nprograms for young people who are on their way to becoming criminals, \nor whether we are simply going to sit back and say we are going to \nbuild more prisons and more jails and have more incarceration.\n  I was interested yesterday, to read in the Washington Post--I was \nshocked, really to read in the Washington Post yesterday a story of a \nlittle town in Texas where some kids, they are not old enough to be \ncalled adolescents, they are children--whether 6 years old--the Senator \nfrom Texas may know--6, 7, 10, ranging all the way to 11--they happened \nto go by and they took a horse and beat that horse to death. They \ncrippled the horse so it could not move. Then they jammed a stick up \nits nostril. Then they took some kind of a bludgeon instrument and beat \nthe horse's head until it died. They then went on to school and they \nlaughed and joked about it. And they were telling all their friends \nwhat a joy it was they had just engaged in, beating this horse to \ndeath.\n  They finally were apprehended later that day or the next day and were \nsomewhat surprised to find themselves forced to stay overnight in a \nlocal detention facility. But what was surprising about it is these \nyoung kids were really expressing their crime, as such, against this \nanimal in a positive fashion. They were laughing about it. They were \njoking about it. And the fear that was expressed in that community is \nwhat is going to happen a couple years from now? What is happening in \nour society that we have got young people like this who take joy and \npleasure in killing an innocent animal? What is going to be the future \ndown the line when they start turning whatever is inside them toward \ntheir fellow human beings?\n  So, Mr. President, we have a choice here. We can say we are going to \nput them away, we are going to lock them up, we are going to wait until \nthey really do something serious by committing some other crime and \nthen put them in an incarceration facility. That has been one solution \nthat we are moving toward.\n  This is an opportunity to provide block grant money to States and let \nthem decide how the money should be spent. Let them decide whether or \nnot they are going to have weed and seed programs. Let Wisconsin decide \nwith its funds, whether they want to put police officers into high \nschools and junior high schools and working with kids before they get \ninto the fast lane to crime.\n  I read a book sometime ago called ``There Are No Children Here.'' It \ntalked about what is happening in our inner cities, in particular; that \nthese young kids are growing up under circumstances in which they have \nto duck bullets whizzing by in the nighttime; that they do not have any \nopportunity to ever walk the streets safely.\n  So States and local communities ought to have an opportunity to come \nup with programs. Now, I do not know much about midnight basketball. I \nam a professional basketball fan. Maybe \n\n[[Page S 14645]]\nmidnight basketball works in some inner cities, I do not know. It does \nnot apply to me. It might work in Chicago. It might work in cities in \nWisconsin.\n  Why should we make that judgment? This is an opportunity to provide \nsome limited funding for States to employ juvenile prevention programs.\n  Mr. President, it is worrisome that the number of young males who are \naged from 14 to 17 will grow over the next 5 years. We can expect to \nsee record levels of juvenile crime. There is one expert who estimates \nthat this demographic trend is going to produce a minimum of 30,000 \nmore muggers, murderers, and chronic offenders than we currently have. \nAre we going to keep building jails and prisons, and keep putting our \nkids away, or are we going to try to intervene in the early years to \nsee if we can prevent them from heading down the pathway to crime?\n  So I join with enthusiasm my colleague from Wisconsin. I think it is \na very important amendment, and I hope it will enjoy the support of a \nmajority of our colleagues.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14643-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PROVIDING FOR AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE TWO HOUSES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2843\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I hope we can dispose of the pending \namendment in short order. The committee reviewed all of these programs \nthat the amendment proposes to fund. These are all of the so-called \nprevention programs that, when we debated this bill, we discussed at \ngreat length.\n  What is being proposed here is to give money to the States for \nactivities such as midnight basketball, and to pay for it by cutting \nthe $80 million from the FBI. I remind my colleagues that when we \npassed the Anti-Terrorism Act, we authorized additional funding for the \nFBI.\n  What I have tried to do in this bill is to provide some of that \nfunding which we authorized. What we are being asked to do here is to \ngo back and fund the very programs that we passed over because we did \nnot think they were worthy, and we are being asked to pay for them by \ncutting the FBI.\n  I think that if people could take a look at this amendment and decide \nwhether they wanted these prevention programs or whether they wanted \nthe money to go into law enforcement to grab violent criminals by the \nthroat and not let them go to get a better grip, I think it would be a \nvery clear choice.\n  I am opposed to the amendment. I would be happy to have a voice vote \non the amendment if the Senator is willing to do that.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will call for a rollcall vote, but I want \nto answer briefly what the Senator said.\n  The FBI this coming year is funded at a 15-percent increase over last \nyear. There is not a single request the FBI has made for funding that \nwe have not authorized and are prepared to fund, without--without--this \n$80 million. This $80 million is over and above everything that the FBI \nhas authorized, the President has requested and the House has funded.\n  He talks about midnight basketball league, and that is a synonym for \nmoney that we think is wasted on prevention. As Senator Cohen pointed \nout, this money is block granted to States. They do not have to spend \nit on midnight basketball.\n  We have decided that much of the money we are spending at the Federal \nlevel the States can spend much more effectively. You have made that \nargument time and time again. Let the Governors, let the local \ngovernment spend the money, not Washington. That is what these crime \nprevention programs are aimed at.\n  These crime prevention programs, if the Governors so wish, could be \nspent on programs like DARE. Everyone in this Chamber understands and \nrecognizes that DARE is a program that works.\n  So midnight basketball is not where these funds are going to be \nexpended. They are going to be given to States and Governors and local \ngovernments to spend as they see fit.\n  Again, the argument is that in any crimefighting bill, a certain \namount of money, modest as it is, needs to be spent on trying to \nprevent it from occurring in the first place, and I do not think that \nthere are any Senators, or many Senators in this Chamber who would not \nagree with this principle. And that is all this amendment intends to \ndo.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, $80 million will be spent here by this \namendment, our distinguished colleague talks about letting the States \nspend it, but we are not taking it away from Federal midnight \nbasketball, we are not taking it away from Federal prevention programs. \nWe are taking the money away from the FBI.\n  We passed an antiterrorism bill by a vote of 91 to 8 authorizing \nfunds for the FBI. All I have tried to do in this bill is to provide \npart of that funding.\n  What we would be doing here is cutting the FBI to fund programs that \nmay or may not do anything to prevent crime. The intentions of the \nprogram may be good. There are people who are strong proponents, for \nexample, of midnight basketball.\n  The point is, do we want to cut the FBI to fund it? I say no. I think \nthis amendment should be rejected and it should be rejected soundly.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. First of all, this is \nnot about midnight basketball. That is a great thing to talk about. The \nStates are not using this for midnight basketball. Let me tell you what \nthey are using it for, to give you one example.\n  I can pick almost any one of your States. The thing States use this \nmoney for, for example, is boys clubs and girls clubs. Let me tell you \nabout boys clubs and girls clubs. There is a study the Judiciary \nCommittee did and it has been done by others, and no one disputes it. \nIf you put in a boys club and girls club--the study was done in Chicago \nand New York--you take two housing projects, the same type of housing \nprojects, and put a boys club and girls club in the basement of one and \nno boys club and girls club in the basement of the other, the \ndifference in the rate of crime is as follows: 31 percent fewer arrests \nin the project that has a boys club and girls club in it; 27 \n\n[[Page S 14646]]\npercent less use of drugs, arrest for drugs; and 19 percent fewer \narrests for any acts of violence.\n  As my dear old mother would say, an idle mind is a devil's workshop. \nYou put these kids out there, and you have nothing for them. Let me \ntell you what these boys and girls clubs do with the money we have in \nhere. One example: There is not a single one of these clubs that has \nmidnight basketball.\n  I will tell you what they have. They have the following deal: If you \njoin the club and you are involved--and particularly, they put them in \nhousing projects, which they are now doing in most of your States, \nputting in public housing projects. What they are required to do is to \nhave computer classes before they can play in the gym.\n  Second, they are required in a State like mine, and many of yours, to \nhave mentoring programs. They bring the mentoring programs into the \nschools. Of the people who volunteer in the boys and girls clubs, 80 \npercent are uniformed police officers.\n  Third, what they do is they get these kids into these programs, and \npart of the requirement to stay in the program and to be able to use \nthe boys and girls club is you have to stay in school and have passing \ngrades. What they have done is changed the culture in those \ncommunities. I will give you one example by limiting it to boys and \ngirls clubs. YMCAs and church groups are all involved in these \nprograms. We are not talking about midnight basketball.\n  Second, we are talking about the weed and seed program, which started \nunder President Bush. I can pick 50 quotes. I will pick one from a \nRepublican U.S. Attorney from Georgia, Joe Whitley, former U.S. \nAttorney from the northern district of Georgia:\n\n       I have said that this is the most important matter I have \n     ever dealt with as U.S. Attorney. It's a simple but \n     fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really \n     seem to believe.\n       . . . The program is responsive to the concerns of \n     citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real \n     and credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention.\n\n  I can talk about Michael Chertoff, former U.S. Attorney for New \nJersey, a Republican, and Debra Daniels, former U.S. Attorney, southern \ndistrict of Indiana, a Republican. The list goes on.\n  Crime prevention is an issue that has been the subject of more \nmisinformation and outright mischaracterization than perhaps any other \nin the crime debate--\n  Whether we should work to prevent crime before it happens, instead of \nwaiting until after the shots are fired, until after our children \nbecome addicted to drugs, until after more Americans' lives are ruined.\n  The anticrime law enacted last year answered that question \nunapologetically. In addition to fighting crime--the law made a \ncommitment to preventing crime.\n  A commitment supported by virtually every criminologist, every legal \nscholar, every sociologist, every psychologist, every medical \nauthority, and nearly everyone's common sense.\n  Those who study this issue agree that breaking the cycle of violence \nand crime requires an investment in the lives of our children--\n  With support and guidance to help them reject the violence and \nanarchy of the streets in favor of taking positive responsibility for \ntheir lives.\n  In fact, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District \nAttorneys Association, and the International Brotherhood of Police \nOfficers cite prevention programs as critical to a long-term cure for \ncrime.\n  Prevention is what cops want--what virtually everyone in law \nenforcement wants. Every police officer I have talked to, every \nprosecutor, every prison warden, every probation officer says the same \nthing--we can't do it alone.\n  And listen to local officials--the very people the Republicans say \nthey want to give greater voice.\n  Republican Mayors Giuliani of New York and Riordan of Los Angeles say \nthis:\n\n       By funding proven prevention programs for young people, the \n     crime bill offers hope--hope that in the future we can reduce \n     the need for so many police officers and jails.\n\n  Listen to Paul Helmke, the Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, IN:\n\n       It's a lot less expensive to do things on the prevention \n     side than on the police side.\n\n  And prevention of crime--particularly juvenile crime--is more \nimportant now than ever before.\n  Last week the Department of Justice released its first national \nreport on juvenile offenders and victims. The report found that between \n1988 and 1992 the juvenile violent crime arrest rate has increased by \nmore than 50 percent.\n  It further estimated that even if the crime rate ceases to grow in \nfuture years, juvenile population growth alone would produce a 22 \npercent rise in violent crime arrests. Should the violent rate continue \nto grow as it has between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles \narrested for violent crimes will double by the year 2010--to more than \n260,000 arrests!\n  Attorney General Janet Reno specifically cited prevention and \nintervention programs as one of the fundamental ways to combat this \ntype of growth in juvenile crime.\n  Prisons, though essential, are a testament to failure: They are the \nright place for people gone wrong.\n  On the other hand, when a life about to go wrong is set back on the \nright track--that is a testament to hope.\n  We build hope by showing children that they matter, by challenging \ndisaffection with affection and respect, and by contrasting the dead-\nend of violence with the opportunity for a constructive life--\n  I would now like to briefly comment on the three programs in this \namendment.\n\n\n                  local crime prevention block grants\n\n  Local crime prevention block grants were created to allow cities and \ntowns to develop their own prevention programs to combat child abuse, \nyouth gangs, drug abuse by children, and crimes against the elderly--\nincluding the D.A.R.E. Program and the boys and girls clubs.\n  Local crime prevention grants enable communities to institute \nsuccessful initiatives such as: Measures to prevent juvenile violence, \njuvenile gangs, and the use and sale of illegal drugs by juveniles, \nprograms to prevent crimes against the elderly, midnight sports league \nprograms to keep kids off the street and away from drugs, supervised \nsports and recreation programs after school and on holidays, the \nestablishment of Boys and Girls Clubs of America in public housing \nfacilities, and the creation of special crime units to deal with crimes \nin which a child is involved, to name a few.\n  These prevention strategies and programs have proven effective in \nreducing the incidence of crime in both the short and long term. Here \nare some examples of programs that have proven track records:\n  In hundreds of public housing projects across the country, boys and \ngirls clubs give kids a safe place to hang out after school--a place \nwith positive activities and positive role models.\n  A recent, independent evaluation has reported that housing projects \nwith clubs experience 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less \ndrug activity, and 25 percent less crack use, than do projects with \nclubs.\n  In Honolulu, professionals identify families at risk for neglect or \nabuse when children are born and then visit their homes regularly over \nseveral years to help parents learn to care for their children.\n  In Houston, Texas, a core of professionals provides one-on-one \ncounseling, mentoring, tutoring, job training and crisis-intervention \nservices to students at risk for dropping out.\n  And in Delaware, ``Stormin' Normin'' Oliver runs an award-winning \nsummer basketball league--in which team members must participate in \nsupervised study sessions and perform community-service work in \naddition to their time on the courts.\n  Although many communities are putting their best foot forward, the \nneed and demand for prevention programs far outpace the supply.\n  And yet the republicans have targeted prevention grants in the crime \nlaw for complete elimination--a move some charge is cold-hearted and \nmean. But I say it is just plain dumb.\n  Local crime prevention block grants are one of the best means we have \nto ensure States and localities have the funding they need to reduce \ncrime over the long haul.\n  Weed and seed is a republican, Bush administration program, the \nbrainchild of former Attorney General William Barr.\n  The program funds prevention efforts and comprehensive law \nenforcement efforts.\n\n[[Page S 14647]]\n\n  The weed and seed program has achieved notable success primarily \nbecause it requires the kind of community policing that works, and then \nrequires that law enforcement, social service agencies, the private \nsector, and the community work together to prevent crime.\n  So this is a program that works because it utilizes both law \nenforcement and community participation.\n  In a number of cities--such as Madison, Houston, Trenton, and \nCamden--notable reductions in crime have been achieved in weed and seed \nareas.\n  Many of weed and seed's biggest fans are former Republican U.S. \nattorneys. Let me tell you what a few of them have said:\n  Joe Whitley, former U.S. attorney from the northern district of \nGeorgia:\n\n       I have said that this is the most important matter I have \n     ever dealt with as U.S. attorney. It's a simple but \n     fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really \n     seemed to believe. * * * The program is responsive to the \n     concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought \n     it had real credibility--combining law enforcement and \n     prevention.\n\n  Michael Chertoff, former U.S. attorney for New Jersey:\n\n       Trenton was a pilot city. It was a very successful project \n     and I think very highly of it. * * * Community policing \n     worked very well in closing the distance between the police \n     and the community, and it deterred crime because it gave the \n     police a better reputation within the community.\n\n  Debra Daniels, former U.S. attorney from the southern district of \nIndiana:\n\n       In a nutshell, it is the kind of program that you want. \n     ``Program'' is the wrong word because it connotes money \n     only--you want to emphasize the aspect of weed and seed that \n     has to do with planning at the grassroots level.\n       Weed and seed requires collaboration of all governmental \n     agencies working closely at all levels with people in \n     neighborhoods to create a complete package of crime fighting, \n     policing, human services and economic development. * * * The \n     community leadership development was miraculous and the crime \n     rate decreased.\n  The consensus of all the law enforcement experts around the country \nis that youth gangs are a serious problem and a growing problem.\n  The most recent report on juvenile offenders from the office of \njuvenile justice and delinquency prevention at the department of \njustice reports that the number of jurisdictions affected by youth \ngangs has increased substantially in the last 20 years and that gang-\nrelated crime has increased since the late 1980s.\n  Yet very little is done to directly target youth gangs.\n  This amendment would boost funds for the two Department of Justice \nprograms that specifically target this problem.\n  One of these is the gang free schools and communities program, which \nfunds counseling, education, and crisis intervention through \ncoordinated social service, substance abuse treatment and other means.\n  The other is the community based gang intervention program, which: \n(1) develops regional task forces of state, local and community \norganizations to fight gangs; (2) encourages cooperation among local \neducation, juvenile justice, employment, and social service agencies \nand community based organizations; and (3) funds programs offering \neffective punishment options, including restitution, community service, \nhome detention, and boot camps.\n  So this amendment provides an absolutely critical prevention element \nto our overall anti-crime efforts.\n  The 1994 crime law provided over $300 million of authorized funding \nfor prevention programs for the next year but the Republican \nappropriations bill eliminated virtually all of it.\n  Offset: this amendment would restore $80 million--one quarter of the \nlost prevention funds--to fund these three programs. The money is taken \nfrom a portion of new FBI salaries and expenses that were increased \nabove the president's request.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment.\n  I will conclude by saying that I have great respect for the abilities \nof my friend from Texas. But this is about weed and seed and other good \nprograms, not about midnight basketball. Whenever I debate him on \nissues relating to guns, he pulls out his mama's gun and says, ``You \nain't going to take my mama's gun from her.'' I am not after his mama's \ngun or midnight basketball.\n  This works. I challenge anybody in this Chamber to go home and ask 10 \npolice chiefs in your State--10--and I am prepared to bet you that 9 of \nthose 10 will tell you that they desperately need these local \nprevention programs. The reason they got put in the bill in the first \nplace is because of the cops. Not a single social worker came to me and \nsaid: You have to put in prevention when this bill is written. Not one \nsingle bleeding heart liberal came to me and said: You have to put in \nprevention. The cops want the prevention money. Senators Cohen and Kohl \nare correct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \ncommittee amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, and Mr. \n     Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 2844.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 92, insert between lines 13 and 14 the following \n     new sections:\n       Sec. 305. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     none of the funds made available under this title shall be \n     used for any conference or meeting authorized under section \n     333 of title 28, United States Code, if such conference or \n     meeting takes place at a location outside the geographic \n     boundaries of the circuit court of appeals over which the \n     chief judge presides, except in the case of the Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall be \n     permitted to host conferences or meetings within a 50-mile \n     radius of the District of Columbia without regard to the \n     geographic boundaries of the circuit.\n       (b) Of the funds appropriated under this title, no circuit \n     shall receive more than $100,000 for conferences convened \n     under section 333 of title 28, United States Code, during any \n     year.\n       Sec. 306. (a) Section 333 of title 28, United States Code, \n     is amended--\n       (1) in the first paragraph, by striking ``shall'' the \n     first, second, and fourth place it appears and inserting \n     ``may''; and\n       (2) in the second paragraph--\n       (A) by striking ``shall'' the first place it appears and \n     inserting ``may''; and\n       (B) by striking ``, and unless excused by the chief judge, \n     shall remain throughout the conference''.\n       (b) In the interest of saving taxpayer dollars and reducing \n     the cost of Government, it is the sense of the Senate that \n     the chief judges of the various United States circuit courts \n     should use new communications technologies to conduct \n     judicial conferences.\n       (c) This section shall apply only to contracts entered into \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment, \non behalf of myself and Senator Kyl, that would stop a wasteful \nGovernment practice that has received a lot of press attention lately \nand has drawn sharp criticism from watchdog groups like the National \nTaxpayers Union. Mr. President, the practice I am talking about is \ntaxpayer-funded travel by Federal judges to so-called judicial \nconferences. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts, I am concerned about the budgetary propriety \nof continuing current practice with regard to judicial conferences in \nthis new era of balanced budgets and streamlined Government.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that two \nnewspaper articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. The first article is entitled ``Taxpayers Foot the Bill for \nJudges to Meet at Resort'' and the second is entitled ``Times Are \nTight, But Circuit Isn't.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I commend these revealing articles to my \ncolleagues.\n  In the first article, U.S. District Court judge, William Nickerson, \nis quoted as saying, ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' when \nasked about a judicial conference hosted at the five-star Greenbrier \nresort in West Virginia. The second article recounts that a Federal \njudge and former Congressman introduced a resolution to reduce the cost \nof judicial conferences in the ninth circuit by having them less \nfrequently. Sadly, this responsible and wise proposal was defeated by a \nvote of 5 to 3. This amendment removes the requirement that conferences \nbe held, giving Federal courts the flexibility to schedule conferences \nor, if they decide not to schedule them, just to not have a conference.\n  In brief, Mr. President, the amendment will limit the location of \njudicial conferences to the geographic boundaries of the circuit to \nminimize travel costs which obviously come when there is travel outside \nof the circuit.\n  It would also amend Federal law so that judicial conferences are no \nlonger mandatory, and express the sense of the Senate that the Federal \nJudiciary should explore the idea of using new communications \ntechnology--teleconferencing, et cetera--to conduct conferences without \ntravel.\n  I believe the amendment will save money and give new and needed \nflexibility to the Federal courts.\n  As I said, Federal judges from around the country are currently \ncompelled by law to attend a conference with other judges at least once \nevery 2 years. So, I cannot fault anyone with scheduling these \nconferences or attending them since the law requires it.\n  But I can--and do--find fault with those who choose only the most \nluxurious hotels and resorts.\n  I can--and do--find fault with some of the activities at these \npublicly funded conferences.\n  According to some press reports, less than a third of the time judges \nspend at these conferences relates to judicial work. In one case, \naccording to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper, during one 3-day \nconference at Hilton Head, SC, only 10 hours were set aside for work. \nThe rest of the time was left open so that the attendees could \nsocialize, visit with each other, or do whatever.\n  Importantly, Federal courts are continuing these expensive \nconferences at the same time judicial resources are scarce and funds \nfor representing poorer Americans are drying up. I respectfully submit \nthat these are not sound priorities.\n  The amendment that I and Senator Kyl offer today does what even some \njudges want to do. It would limit the location of judicial conferences \nto major urban areas--I want to emphasize this--within the circuit \ncourt of appeals, not outside. A few circuits, where judges are \ndissatisfied with the resorts within their circuit boundaries, have \nbeen going halfway across the country to attend a judicial conference--\nat taxpayer expense.\n  I am not the first to note the extravagance and unnecessary expense \nassociated with these conferences. Fair-minded judges have been \ncomplaining about these conferences themselves for years. To name just \na few, Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, of the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals and U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Smalkin have both \ncomplained that these conferences are unjustifiably expensive. A few \nyears ago, a district court judge in Kansas City, like Judge Wiggins in \nthe ninth circuit, was so outraged by the posh, remote resorts where \nthese conferences are hosted that he introduced a resolution to limit \nthe location of conferences. Yet another judge has referred to judicial \nconferences as a sort of ``camp.'' And U.S. District Court Judge Carl \nRubin was quoted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as saying ``there are a \nlot of things I'd rather see the taxpayers' money spent on than sending \nme to Hilton Head for 3 days.'' According to that same article, Pete \nSeep of the National Taxpayers' Union states his opinion that ``Federal \ntaxpayers are paying judges to party.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters written to me \nby Federal judges--one from Michigan and one from Texas--urging me to \ntrim the excesses associated with judicial conferences be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of \n           Michigan,\n                                          Flint, MI, July 6, 1995.\n     Re Travel/Chambers savings.\n\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \n         Oversight and the Courts, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I read in a recent article in the \n     Wall Street Journal how you were trying to effectuate needed \n     savings in the budget for the federal judiciary. As a member \n     of the lowest rung on the ladder of the federal judiciary, I \n     offer two suggestions for savings within the judicial branch.\n       I have been a bankruptcy judge for 11 years. As you know, \n     federal judges are required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 333 to attend a \n     judicial conference each year. The first year I attended such \n     a conference, it occurred to me that there was a place where \n     some savings could be effected. In my experience, the \n     judicial conferences are arranged so that the judges travel \n     usually on a Tuesday and return home on a Friday or Saturday. \n     As you are well aware, commercial airlines give tremendous \n     discounts for early booking with a Saturday night stayover. \n     The thought came \n\n[[Page S 14649]]\n     to mind long ago that if judges were required to attend the conference \n     over a Saturday night, it could save a lot of money. This \n     concept holds true for Federal Judicial Center functions as \n     well.\n       My suggestion was met with the response that judges prefer \n     to be home with their families on the weekends. While that is \n     obviously true (when I suggested this, I had two small \n     children at home, ages eight and five), I did not think it \n     was too much to ask high government officials to give up a \n     weekend once in a while, especially since such a large \n     savings would be created. Now that funding is much tighter, I \n     repeat this suggestion.\n       Another suggestion deals with the cost of furnishing \n     chambers. Due to expansion in the district court, I was asked \n     to move my courtrooms and chambers out of the federal \n     buildings in Flint and Bay City. In the process, I was given \n     a budget for furnishing chambers (which included my personal \n     office, my secretary's office and reception area, my law \n     clerk's office, the library, the media room, two attorney \n     conference rooms, and the courtroom waiting area) for $25,000 \n     total. We just about made it for that amount. I do not know \n     for sure, but I have been told that other judges are allowed \n     roughly $50,000 for furnishing a much smaller chambers' unit. \n     Perhaps some uniformity would save some money. While I am in \n     accord with the statements of the federal judge quoted in the \n     Journal article with respect to there being a need for \n     decorum and dignity in a federal courthouse, I also concur in \n     your efforts and those of Senator Baucus to provide that at a \n     lower cost.\n       By effectuating some reasonable savings in non-essential \n     areas, Congress ought to be able to reinstitute cost of \n     living increases for the judiciary. Without such regular \n     adjustments, of course, Congress is condemning the judiciary \n     to consistent decreases in take-home pay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Arthur J. Spector,\n     U.S. Bankruptcy Judge.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                    Western District of Texas,\n\n                                    San Antonio, TX, June 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Grassley: At a recent conference of the Fifth \n     Judicial Circuit, we were advised of your efforts to address \n     government expenditures for judicial meetings and \n     conferences. I applaud and encourage such efforts. All \n     branches of government must search for and find ways of \n     reducing government expense. This area can be modified, \n     relatively painlessly, with no loss in the quality of \n     judicial services provided.\n       Title 28 U.S.C. Section 333 allows an annual circuit \n     conferences and requires that one be held in each circuit no \n     more than every two years. Attendances for judges summoned is \n     mandatory. Perhaps Section 333 could be amended to reduce the \n     number of circuit conferences and/or permit participation to \n     be optional. Once per year, we also hold separate workshops \n     for circuit judges, district judges, magistrate judges, and \n     bankruptcy judges. These instructional meetings address \n     various substantive topics and can be beneficial. However, \n     the information can be provided to us in written form at our \n     offices to avoid the cost of travel, housing, meals, and \n     lectures.\n       I am sure many more ways of reducing expenses for judicial \n     meetings exist. These meetings can be valuable but are not \n     absolutely necessary to the administration of justice. \n     Particularly in these economic times, their cost is difficult \n     to justify. I wanted you to know that judges will support, \n     and even participate in, efforts to reduce the amount of \n     money allocated to the judiciary's budget.\n           Sincerly,\n                                                  John W. Primomo,\n\n                                            U.S. Magistrate Judge.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe that the costs of conferences \nare underestimated. These estimates--which range as high as one-half \nmillion dollars per conference--do not take into account lost time on \nthe bench for judges and their support staff, who also attend the \nconferences at taxpayer expense. And the taxpayers foot these expenses \nyear after year. The party's over, Mr. President.\n  There is a word for this sort of thing: Boondoggle. I have fought \nagainst wasting taxpayer money my whole career in the Senate, and I am \ncommitted to fighting unnecessary spending in the judiciary.\n  Mr. President, under current law, Federal judges are required to host \nand attend these conferences. This amendment will change that so that \njudges have the flexibility not to call a judicial conference. This \namendment would also give individual Federal judges the option of not \nattending a conference. This is fair, and permits Federal courts--which \nI believe will act responsibly in light of the Federal Government's \nbudgetary constraints--to pitch in and tighten belts along with us in \nCongress and the executive branch.\n  As I have said, Mr. President, this amendment is about saving \ntaxpayer dollars and priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Finally, I just want to say that this amendment should not be viewed \nas a general indictment of the Federal judiciary. For the most part, I \nthink that the judiciary has taken responsible and important steps to \nreduce unnecessary spending. This amendment is simply targeted to a use \nof Federal funds that, in the opinion of this Senator, should be \npruned.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, June 30, 1994]\n\n          Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort\n\n                           (by Marcia Myers)\n\n       As the federal judiciary struggles amid hiring freezes and \n     funding shortages for basic services, 150 judges from \n     Maryland and other parts of the Fourth Circuit converged \n     yesterday on the broad verandas, lush fairways and tennis \n     courts of the five-star Greebrier resort.\n       Their taxpayer-financed gathering will demand little work \n     in the afternoons and barely any at night--unless you count \n     one banquet and a sing-along led by U.S. Supreme Court Chief \n     Justice William H. Rehnquist. Of course, several hundred \n     lawyers pay their own way, and those who consider schmoozing \n     part of the job might argue that they're working tirelessly.\n       The cost to taxpayers for the four-day conference: about \n     $200,000.\n       Even some who appreciate the Greenbrier's pampering \n     question the propriety of the trip to the mountains of White \n     Sulphur Springs, W.Va.\n       ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' U.S. District \n     Judge William M. Nickerson said, while adding that the \n     meeting offers a good opportunity to talk informally with \n     other judges. ``I think a lot of the judges have some \n     concerns as taxpayers. Some feel it's more of a luxury than \n     it needs to be.''\n       Others are more direct in criticizing the annual \n     conference, for which taxpayers will pay up to $1,000 per \n     judge plus travel expenses. ``I don't think the expense is \n     justified on an annual basis,'' said U.S. District Judge \n     Frederic N. Smalkin.\n       Consider the schedule for the conference, which includes \n     district, magistrate and bankruptcy judges from Maryland, \n     North and South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia:\n       Day 1: Judges arrive--no activities are planned.\n       Day 2: Judges attend a morning session for about 3 hours to \n     discuss court business. No other activities are planned until \n     the Rehnquist sing-along that evening.\n       Day 3: A trio of one-hour lectures on ethics is scheduled. \n     At noon, the six new judges in the circuit offer brief \n     remarks. Nothing else is planned until an evening reception \n     and banquet.\n       Day 4: The morning features a panel discussion reviewing \n     major Supreme Court decisions of the 1993 term. That ends the \n     conference, although judges on committees may attend \n     additional meetings.\n       Meanwhile, conferees are encouraged to sign up for group \n     activities that include tennis, golf, bridge and hiking. \n     Among the resort's other amenities: three 18-hole \n     championship golf courses, fly fishing, skeet shooting, \n     horseback riding, swimming, and the Greenbrier Spa, Mineral \n     Baths & Salon.\n       ``Personally, I think it's of real value,'' Senior U.S. \n     District Judge John R. Hargrove said of the conference. ``Do \n     we have to cut our own throats just because Congress won't \n     give us more money? We still have to have training. We don't \n     go down there and sit around.''\n       Why not have a shorter meeting, strictly business, at a \n     less luxurious spot?\n       ``We tried that at least once in the 20 years since I came \n     here,'' said the circuit's Chief Judge, Sam J. Ervin III of \n     North Carolina. ``The afternoon sessions were not very \n     productive--nobody much came.\n       ``I think the most important thing about this conference is \n     that lawyers have an opportunity to mingle with the judges \n     and share their problems and difficulties.''\n       That talk could include concerns over the shrinking \n     resources of the federal courts. Amid a hiring freeze in \n     Maryland and across the nation, the courts are at 84 percent \n     of adequate staffing levels--the lowest ever, according to a \n     court official.\n       And the situation could get worse. Court officials worry \n     about funds for court security, courtroom deputies and \n     computers. Business that used to be done in a day in \n     Baltimore, for example, now can take several days because of \n     staffing shortages.\n       When asked how much the conference would cost taxpayers, \n     Circuit Executive Samuel W. Phillips said about $55,000. But \n     after acknowledging the $1,000 allowance for each judge, plus \n     travel and administrative expenses, he estimated the cost at \n     $175,000 to $200,000.\n       Mr. Phillips said he had checked many other hotels for a \n     better rate. But the Greenbrier includes two meals in its \n     room rate, which makes it cheaper, he said. A typical room \n     for two costs $434 a night, although the judges receive a \n     discount that he wouldn't disclose.\n       It's also one of the few hotels capable of accommodating \n     everybody--judges, spouses and lawyers--under one roof, he \n     said.\n       The government pays for judges' hotel rooms and meals. The \n     cost of recreation--at \n\n[[Page S 14650]]\n     the Greenbrier, golf fees are $80 and tennis courts are $23 an hour--\n     comes from each judge's own pocket.\n       The conference alternates every other year between the \n     Greenbrier and the Homestead, a similar resort in Hot \n     Springs, Va.\n       The judges are quick to note that attendance is required--\n     by law.\n       Congress passed a bill in the 1930s requiring judges in \n     each circuit to gather annually to consider court business.\n       As budget concerns have mounted in recent years, the law \n     was amended to require a meeting only once every two years.\n       Several circuits have cut back to biennial meetings, but \n     Judge Ervin said the Fourth Circuit had rejected that idea.\n\n                [From the Recorder, September 29, 1993]\n\n                  Times Are Tights, But Circuit Isn't\n\n                           (By Steve Albert)\n\n       Soon after money problems forced postponement of pay raises \n     for judicial employees and led federal judges to suspend \n     civil jury trials, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals \n     spent about $600,000 to send 350 judges and lawyers to a \n     four-day conference at a luxury Santa Barbara beach resort.\n       While other circuits reacted to tight budgets this year by \n     canceling their retreats or deciding to hold them every other \n     year, the Ninth Circuit opted to go forward with its August \n     1993 conference and continue holding its retreat annually.\n       Circuit chief Judge J. Clifford Wallace called the \n     conference expenditures ``money well spent.'' Congress \n     mandates that circuits hold conferences, Wallace said, and \n     the retreats provide the only opportunity ``to bring together \n     people who have responsibility to improve the administration \n     of justice.''\n       Circuit and district judges, magistrates, bankruptcy \n     judges, U.S. attorneys, federal public defenders and court \n     clerks from nine Western states attend the conference. In \n     addition, the circuit's 27 active judges get together six \n     times a year, hold an annual winter symposium, and meet with \n     different judges once every year or two for continuing \n     education.\n       Estimates of government expenses for the Santa Barbara \n     conference were released last week shortly before the U.S. \n     House of Representatives appropriated $2.8 billion for the \n     judiciary for fiscal 1994, a 10 percent increase over this \n     year. A House/Senate conference committee is expected to \n     settle on the final number this week or next. The Senate \n     wants to give this judiciary just a 5 percent increase for \n     the new fiscal year, which begins Friday.\n       The cost estimate of the Ninth Circuit conference, prepared \n     by circuit executives at The Recorder's request, shows that \n     300 judges, prosecutors, public defenders and clerks traveled \n     to Santa Barbara by air at an average cost of $550 each. \n     Another 50 traveled by car from Los Angeles at an average \n     cost of $50. The attendees spent an average of $250 for room \n     and food each day of the four-day conference and an average \n     of $34 on check-out day. Add in about $27,000 for such items \n     as speakers' travel, printing and audiovisual material, and \n     the total bill for taxpayers was about $556,000. Because \n     judges submit individual expense vouchers, that figure is an \n     estimate only.\n       The figure does not include the cost of travel during the \n     rest of the year for the 12 judges who meet four times \n     annually to help plan the conference.\n       About 100 other attendees, mostly lawyers in private \n     practice, paid their own way.\n\n\n                          $100 million bailout\n\n       The conference came just eight months after the U.S. \n     Judicial Conference--the governing body of the federal \n     courts--imposed a hiring freeze and postponed some pay \n     increases for federal court employees in the Ninth Circuit \n     and around the country. At the same time, the Judicial \n     Conference's executive committee trimmed court operating \n     expenses as well as probation and pretrial services funding, \n     citing a $100 million operating shortfall.\n       In June, citing a lack of funds to pay jurors, federal \n     trial courts around the country briefly suspended some civil \n     jury trials, Congress passed a $100 million bailout for the \n     courts in early July.\n       The budget shortfall prompted Wallace in May to propose \n     that many indigents who need court-appointed lawyers be asked \n     to repay the government for the cost of their defense, much \n     as students are required to pay off student loans for college \n     tuition. The savings, he theorized, could be used to avoid \n     funding shortfalls.\n       But Wallace said Monday that despite budgetary problems, \n     the conference remained an essential expense. He cited the \n     circuit's recently released study of gender bias in the \n     courts and its decision to study bias based on race, religion \n     and ethnicity as examples of the work the conference takes \n     on.\n       ``No one can doubt the importance of those issues,'' \n     Wallace said. ``It would be difficult to cut the conference \n     because of budget difficulty.''\n       Other circuits around the country have cancelled their \n     annual conferences, however. The New York-based Second \n     Circuit and Denver-based Tenth Circuit cancelled their 1993 \n     meetings, and the St. Louis-based Eighth Circuit has \n     cancelled its 1994 conference. Four other circuits have gone \n     to biennial conferences.\n       A call to cancel future Ninth Circuit conferences was \n     defeated by a 5-3 vote of the circuit's executive committee \n     at its August meeting in Santa Barbara. Circuit Judge Charles \n     Wiggins, a former Republican congressman, warned colleagues \n     then that the cost could engender the wrong ``public \n     perception,'' especially in tight budget times.\n       Executive committee members voted to go ahead with the \n     circuit's 1994 conference in San Diego and its 1995 \n     conference in Hawaii.\n       Exactly how much the Ninth Circuit or other circuits spend \n     on annual conferences is difficult to pinpoint, according to \n     circuit executives and a spokesman for the U.S. \n     Administrative Office of the Courts, which disburses money to \n     the federal bench. Judges submit conference expense vouchers \n     and reimbursement checks are issued in Washington. The Ninth \n     Circuit cost estimates were based on average airfare costs \n     calculated by circuit executives and the $250 maximum per day \n     charge judges and other government employees are allowed for \n     lodging and food.\n       Circuit conference expenses are subtracted from the \n     ``Salaries and Expenses'' line of the courts' budget. \n     Individual circuit expenses are never set forth in judicial \n     budget requests, said David Sellers, a spokesman for the \n     administrative office of the courts.\n       ``It doesn't get much more specific than that,'' Sellers \n     said.\n       New Jersey District Chief Judge John Gerry, who chairs the \n     Judicial Conference's executive committee, said the Ninth \n     Circuit's conference cost estimate was the first such \n     estimate he had ever heard. The executive committee, which \n     holds the Judicial Conference's purse strings, does not take \n     up or examine individual circuit expenditures, he said.\n       But the conference a year ago asked circuits to evaluate \n     the necessity of retreats and their costs. ``There hasn't \n     been any area of court operations we have not looked at to \n     save a buck here and there,'' Gerry said. His own circuit, \n     the Third, has gone to biennial conferences.\n\n\n                            a model circuit\n\n       Wallace said the work of the Ninth Circuit conference has \n     been recognized by other circuits. ``Some of us do a better \n     job than others in our efforts to improve the system,'' \n     Wallace said. If efforts were not made to improve the \n     administration of justice, he added, costs of administering \n     the courts could be higher than they already are.\n       ``The budgeting problem is very complicated,'' Wallace \n     said. ``By singling out one aspect, the overall picture can \n     be blurred. We have thrashed this out. We have been \n     responsible.''\n       But some circuit judges like Wiggins have complained that \n     the conference is not as productive as Wallace or others may \n     think. ``We don't talk about much of interest to any of us; \n     our discussions are so broad,'' Wiggins told his colleagues \n     in Santa Barbara.\n       At the Santa Barbara meeting, conferees discussed \n     cooperation with the executive and legislative branches and, \n     in addition to passing a resolution calling for a task force \n     to study bias, passed one supporting adequate funding for the \n     courts.\n       Savings in conference costs would not have offset lack of \n     funds for jury trials or public defender programs because \n     those costs come out of different budget lines than the line \n     used to pay for conferences, said Wallace and court spokesman \n     Sellers.\n       This year's conference schedule, like those in the past, \n     included such diversions as tennis and golf tournaments, a \n     spouse sightseeing and winery tour and cooking and flower \n     arranging classes.\n       Wallace confirmed that the Ninth Circuit conference next \n     August will be held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort on the \n     beach south of San Diego. The resorts offers bayside suites \n     and has three heated pools and a marina.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I shall be brief. I assume that \nthis amendment will be adopted on a voice vote, but I do think it is \nimportant to just reiterate a couple of points.\n  I am very pleased to join Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \ncourts subcommittee, in introducing the amendment.\n  What it does is to require that all circuit court judicial conference \nmeetings must be held within the circuit and that they keep the cost of \neach of those conferences not to exceed $100,000.\n\n[[Page S 14651]]\n\n  Additionally, the amendment would remove the requirement that a \njudicial conference be held every 2 years. A circuit may hold a \nconference but is not required to hold a conference under our \namendment.\n  And the reason is, as was pointed out by Senator Grassley, at a time \nwhen judicial resources are precious, money should not be used to fund \ntrips to such faraway places as Maui, Santa Barbara and Sun Valley. The \nconferences should be held in areas that are easily accessible and \nwithin the geographic bounds of the district.\n  According to a report released last week by the General Accounting \nOffice, the total cost for the circuit judicial conference meetings in \n1993 was more than $1 million, and in 1994 it was once again almost $1 \nmillion. In both 1993 and 1994, the ninth circuit, which encompasses my \nState of Arizona, ran up the largest tab, costing the taxpayers more \nthan a quarter of a million dollars each year according to this GAO \nreport.\n  The estimated cost for this year's ninth circuit conference in Hawaii \nis more than a half million dollars, according to the Legal Times. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, this comes at a time when we have to \nstart counting our pennies here at the Federal Government level, and I \nam sure that the public is fed up with such waste.\n  In fact, about a week ago, I received a letter from one of my \nconstituents about the subject. He wrote about what he called, and I am \nquoting now, ``The extravagant conference charges incurred by United \nStates taxpayers to send about 350 Federal judges to Maui, Hawaii this \nyear.''\n  He continued, and I am quoting, ``I am outraged by such extravagance. \nIs it no wonder that the every-day citizens of this Nation are cynical, \ndisappointed and feel totally helpless as this kind of abuse rages in \nall levels of Government?''\n  Mr. President, I think he is right. These conferences are an abuse of \ntaxpayers' funds and of the public trust. The ninth circuit usually \nholds its conferences at a resort in either San Diego, Santa Barbara, \nMaui or Sun Valley, ID. They are all beautiful places, but the public \nshould not be paying about $1 million each year to fund conferences in \nsuch places.\n  According to an article in the Legal Times, many judges believe that \nreform is needed. As one ninth circuit judge, Charles Wiggins, noted: \n``It's an excessive expenditure of public funds.'' Another judge--Judge \nRubin of Cincinnati--commented: ``There are a lot of other things I'd \nrather see the taxpayers' money spent on.''\n  ``[The 1993] conference schedule, like those in the past, included \nsuch diversions as tennis, golf tournaments, a spouse sightseeing and \nwinery tour and cooking and flower arranging classes,'' according to an \narticle in the Recorder, a San Francisco-based newspaper affiliated \nwith the Legal Times.\n  What is particularly galling about the excessive amount spent on \nthese conferences is that the spending comes at a time when the \njudiciary is so strapped for funds.\n  For example, the ninth circuit's 1993 conference came just 8 months \nafter the U.S. Judicial Conference, the governing body of the Federal \ncourts, imposed a hiring freeze and postponed some pay increases for \nFederal court employees in the ninth circuit and around the country.\n  At the same time, the judicial conference's executive committee \ntrimmed court operating expenses as well as probation and pretrial \nservices funding, citing a $100 million operating shortfall. \nAdditionally, in June 1993, citing a lack of funds to pay jurors, \nFederal trial courts around the country briefly suspended some civil \njury trials. In July, Congress had to pass a $100 million bailout for \nthe courts.\n  In addition to running up large bills by traveling to out-of-the-way \nplaces such as Maui and Sun Valley that are within the geographical \nboundaries of the circuit, many conferences are held outside of the \ncircuit. For example, in 1993, the sixth circuit, which includes \nMichigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky, held its conference at the \nseaside resort of Hilton Head in South Carolina.\n  As the chief judge of the sixth circuit said at the time, ``It's not \na matter of choice. It's a requirement of the Congress to hold the \nmeeting. They just don't say where.''\n  Well, not anymore, Mr. President. With this amendment, Congress will \nsay where. It is simply limited to some place within the circuit, and \ncertainly in my own case in the ninth circuit there are plenty of nice \nplaces such as the seat of the circuit, San Francisco, to hold these \nconferences. So this will certainly be no imposition on judges.\n  I support what Senator Grassley has said, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and help to put an end to this wasteful \nspending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2844) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know that this amendment was accepted by \nvoice vote, but I just want to note for the Record that I oppose it.\n  This is not the type of micromanagement that the Senate should be \nengaged in.\n  The Judiciary is an independent branch of Government and it should be \npermitted to make reasonable decisions about how to spend the money \nthat Congress appropriates to it without undue interference.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2845\n\n (Purpose: To delete funding for the National Endowment for Democracy)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, is there a pending committee amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the present \npending amendment be laid aside so I may call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Brown, and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 2845.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At page 116, strike lines 3 through 7.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wish to tell my colleagues, No. 1, this \nwill be very short and sweet, and it will not require a rollcall.\n  I am saying this to the distinguished floor managers on the \nassumption that the President is going to veto the bill and that the \nbill is going to come back here at some point in the future, in October \nor November, and I will have an opportunity to offer this amendment and \nget a rollcall vote on it.\n  Now, this amendment deals with the National Endowment for Democracy. \nA lot of the new Members are not familiar with the National Endowment \nfor Democracy.\n  Mr. President, Dante Fascell was a beloved House Member. Everybody \nknew him. He always wanted to do something to enhance democracy when \nthe Communists were riding roughshod on everybody around the world. And \nwhen Ronald Reagan came to power, Dante Fascell presented this idea of \na privately funded National Endowment for Democracy to President \nReagan. President Reagan said he liked the idea of something that would \ncounter communism with democracy.\n  And here is what Dante Fascell said, ``We had found ourselves a \npowerful ally, the President of the United States. We had a horse and \nso we rode that horse. Changed the bill around and rammed it through.''\n  And then he said they gave money to the Democratic and Republican \nparties, to the labor unions, and to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \n``Hell yeah. They were on board,'' Fascell recalled. ``They got a piece \nof the pie. They got paid off. Democrats and Republicans, the Chamber \nof Commerce, along with labor.'' They got paid off.\n  That was in 1982. It was passed in 1984. It was designed to be \nmatched with private money. Here is what happened. Just like all other \nFederal programs, look how it started off here in 1983. $18 million. \nAnd it was to be matched within a short period of time with private \nmoney. \n\n[[Page S 14652]]\n\n  Now, you talk about growing like Topsy--Topsy would blush at the way \nthis program has grown. It started out at $18 million, $18 million, \ndown to $15 million, went to $35 million, and $30 million in this year \n1995.\n  Now, how much would you guess of that budget is private money?\n  We ought to have a little game show here and let everybody guess. The \nSenator from New Mexico is indicating he thinks it is 3 percent?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Zero.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Zero. You are wrong, Senator. It is less than 2 percent.\n  Here is a program that was going to be matched 50-50 with private \nmoney and ultimately be all private money from foundations and \nindividuals. And there you have it, $30 million of the taxpayers' \nmoney, and less than 2 percent of it is private. And who gets it? And I \ndo not mind telling you, this is the most offensive part of it to me, \njust as it would be the most offensive part to any citizen in America \nif they knew about it. Now, you see most people know about the Agency \nfor International Development because that costs almost a half billion \ndollars. They know about the U.S. Information Agency because that costs \nalmost a half billion dollars. They know about foreign aid because that \nis 12 to 15 billion dollars. All of those programs are designed to \nfoment and enhance democracy around the world.\n  And then we come in with a little piddly amount here. How did we get \nthis thing passed in the first place? It is exactly like Dante Fascell \nsaid. ``We bought them off.'' Who did they buy off? You see this CIPE? \nFTUI? NDI? IRI? You see this ``R'' right here in IRI. You know what the \n``R'' stands for? Republican. The Republican party gets 11.1 percent of \nthat $30 million I just showed you. And what do you think this big \n``D'' is in NDI? Democrat. That is right. The Democrats get 11.1 \npercent.\n  The Democrats used to get quite a bit more. And now they have got us \ndown equal to the Republicans. We both get 11.1 percent.\n  And who is CIPE? That is a fancy name for the Chamber of Commerce. \nWhat is FTUI? Why that is the free trade unions, and who is that? AFL-\nCIO. Everybody got bought off. And the poor old taxpayers, they was not \neven consulted.\n  Now, I want to ask you, in this year 1995, when we are cutting \neverything under the shining sun, dramatically, we are not just \ncutting, we are cutting big dollars out of big programs. And programs \nlike this have a way of being ignored. Nobody even looks at them. Out \nof the $30 billion, only 30.8 percent is discretionary.\n  I will tell you what I am going to do. I am going to send a July 1995 \narticle from Harper's Magazine to each one of you, and I hope your \nstaffs will insist you read it. It talks about a meeting of \nnongovernmental organizations. Where? Zagreb, Croatia. They come to \nCroatia, to Zagreb. They stay in a fancy hotel. The best was in Zagreb. \nThey watch C-SPAN2. They watch CNN. They watch MTV. They have a nice \nbig opulent dinner.\n  And then the President of the National Endowment for Democracy gets \nup and they are all thinking he has a big checkbook in his pocket. He \nis going to pull that sucker out and he is going to start writing \nchecks to each one of them. What does he do? He gets up and he tells \nthem they have all kinds of data, all kinds of information about the \njoys of democracy and they are going to put it on the Internet. This \nguy who wrote the story said you could see their shoulders go slack. \nPeople could not believe they had come all that distance to hear \nsomebody say they were going to put a lot of information about \ndemocracy on the Internet.\n  And who do you think is paying for the hotel bill and the opulent \ndinner? That is right, old Uncle Sucker. I am just saying if you cannot \nkill this program--if you cannot kill this program--I am not optimistic \nabout balancing the budget in 7 years.\n  Now, I am offering this amendment on behalf of Senators Brown and \nDorgan. There are all kinds of things I would like to talk about. I \nknow everybody wants to get away, so I am not going to belabor it. But \nI want to reemphasize the point that I will be back on the floor after \nthe President vetoes this bill for a rollcall vote on this amendment or \nsomething similar to it. But anybody who votes to continue this program \ncannot be serious about deficit reduction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this will be the ninth time that the \nSenate--and before that the other body--has taken up this amendment and \ndebated it. I always enjoy and appreciate the eloquent presentation of \nthe Senator from Arkansas. I will not take much time since the Senator \nfrom Arkansas has just stated we will revisit this issue again.\n  So I would only note, Mr. President, and ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the following letter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Hon. Richard Gephardt,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       As former Secretaries of State representing both Democratic \n     and Republican Administrations, we support the continued \n     funding of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). This \n     viewpoint is based upon the NED's strong track record in \n     assisting Solidarty in Poland and other significant \n     democratic movements over the past decade. It is also based \n     upon the NED's important ongoing efforts in helping those \n     engaged in the development of institutions of democracy \n     around the world.\n       During this period of international change and uncertainty, \n     the work of the NED continues to be an important bipartisan \n     but non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and \n     freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the \n     NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding \n     twelve years ago.\n           Sincerely,\n     James Baker.\n     Lawrence S. Eagleburger.\n     Alexander M. Haig, Jr.\n     Henry A. Kissinger.\n     Edmund S. Muskie.\n     George P. Shultz.\n     Cyrus R. Vance.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is from former Secretaries of State representing both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations.\n\n       . . .we support the continued funding of the National \n     Endowment for Democracy (NED). This viewpoint is based upon \n     the NED's strong track record in assisting Solidarity in \n     Poland and other significant democratic movements over the \n     past decade. It is also based upon NED's important ongoing \n     efforts in helping those engaged in the development of \n     institutions of democracy around the world.\n       During this period of international change and uncertainty, \n     the work of the NED continues to be an important bipartisan \n     but non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and \n     freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the \n     NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding \n     twelve years ago.\n       Sincerely, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Alexander \n     Hague, Henry Kissinger, Edmund Muskie, George Schultz, and \n     Cyrus Vance.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to note with interest the \nview of seven previous Secretaries of State, both Republican and \nDemocrat, who have taken the time and effort to sign this letter in \nsupport of this very important effort to further the cause of freedom \nand democracy throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be mercifully brief. I understand \nthe hour, and people want to leave. We will revisit this and have an \naggressive debate at some point.\n  But I am struck--I am always, of course, respectful of the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I respect his opinion--I am struck by the letter put \non our desks signed by former Secretaries of State that talk about the \nnongovernmental character of NED, how relevant the nongovernmental \ncharacter of NED is.\n  The governmental character of NED is this is all Government money, it \nis all the taxpayers' money, divided up four ways: Give some to the \nRepublicans, some to the Democrats, some to the Chamber of Commerce, \nsome to the AFL-CIO and say, ``Go do some nice things in support of \ndemocracy.'' The problem is it duplicates what we are doing in half a \ndozen other programs in the State Department. \n\n[[Page S 14653]]\n\n  In the last election, Republicans won, and I applaud them for that. \nThe score was 20 percent of the American people voted Republican; \nroughly 19 percent of the American people voted Democrat; and 51 \npercent of the American people said, ``Count me out, it doesn't matter, \nI'm not going to vote at all.'' It may be that we ought to talk about \npromoting a little democracy in this country.\n  This is not all that much money, but it is enough, and it is one of \nthose programs that simply will not quit. It does not matter that it \ncannot be justified. It does not matter that it cannot be justified at \nthis point. What matters is that it is a program that is ongoing, it \ncontinues, and it is governmental money that they call nongovernmental \nin character.\n  I support the Senator from Arkansas. I hope we will have a long \ndebate on this, and I hope one of these days we are going to knock this \nout. If you care about reducing the deficit, the devil is in the \ndetails. The detail here is $32 million that we ought not spend. We \nought not spend it. It is waste, in my judgment.\n  Let us reduce the deficit. Let us zero this out and do the taxpayers \nof this country a favor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is excellent debate, great points have \nbeen made, as in all these things. But consider the fact this bill is \nnot going anywhere. What we are doing tonight is like training to fight \nthe Spanish Armada. We ought to put all these speeches in the Record. \nOf course, we will all spend the weekend reading each other's speech \nwith due diligence, but then everybody could go home.\n  I just remind my colleagues of one thing, maybe the thing that will \nmove us away from these Dracula hours of legislation more than anything \nelse around here if--if--we do not lose our nerve and do apply the laws \nof this country to the Congress as applied to everywhere else: Starting \nJanuary 1, paying time and a half for all the staff who have to stay \naround here when we go through this useless exercise. Instead of \ncosting the taxpayers $15,000 or $20,000 an hour for this, it will \nstart costing $40,000 or $50,000 an hour. Maybe--maybe--we will pass \nlegislation, have debates during the daytime and not do the Dracula \nhours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for his statement and also for printing in the Record this \njoint letter by seven former Secretaries of State.\n  I say to my colleague that the reason the NED will not go away is \nbecause it does good work. That is plain and simple the reason it will \nnot go away. It has done some extremely effective work around the world \nin strengthening and developing democratic institutions and protecting \nindividual rights and freedoms.\n  We have had any number of people come through the Halls of the \nCongress recognized as fighters for human rights, fighters for freedom, \nfighters for democracy who have manifested their support for NED and \nthe support which gave them and made them possible in their own \ncountries to lead this effort.\n  So I know a longer debate is coming, and I am prepared and look \nforward to that debate, but these Secretaries are right when they say \n``the strong track record in assisting significant democratic \nmovements.'' It does have a strong track record, and it serves an \nimportant role, because it can operate as a nongovernmental entity and \nsupport nongovernmental entities which provide opportunities that would \nnot otherwise be available if these activities were undertaken by a \ngovernmental agency.\n  So I strongly support the NED, and I hope when we actually get to the \nreal amendment, the Members of this body will support it as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying the very \norganization, the National Endowment for Democracy, dooms it. It is \nself-contradiction to give money to the Republican Party and to the \nDemocratic Party whose views on democracy are quite different.\n  We all champion democracy, but can you imagine this group in Zagreb \nallowing me on my side to describe democracy for them, and we will say \nthe Senator from Arizona on his side. We have strong philosophical \ndifferences. They would be so confused when we got through, they would \nnot know what democracy is all about. And labor and the Chamber of \nCommerce, like two hornets in a jug. We give each one of them, look at \nthat, the Chamber of Commerce, 13.6 percent and labor, AFL-CIO 29.4 \npercent. Do you want the people from the Chamber of Commerce and labor \nto sit around the same table explaining democracy?\n  Mr. President, let me repeat, we spend an awful lot of money on \nforeign aid. Frankly, this year I do not think we spent enough. What is \nit designed to do? It is designed to help people feed and clothe \nthemselves and to promote democracy. We have the Agency for \nInternational Development. I saw their work in Siberia about 2 months \nago. Some of the things they are doing are very impressive.\n  What is the Agency for International Development designed to do? To \nmake them think well of the United States and help them create and \nmaintain democracies. And then the United States Information Agency, a \nhalf-billion dollars. What do they do? Why, they broadcast all over the \nworld the joys of democracy.\n  When you add it all up, it comes to between $13 billion and $15 \nbillion. What is this $30 million doing? I want you to read that \nHarper's article. When the president, Mr. Gershman, president of the \nNational Endowment for Democracy, gets up, and these people have come \nfrom all over thinking that they were going to get a little largess for \nsome of their own programs. They needed computers; they needed \nprinters. And so the president gets up and he says to this crowd in \nthis thick-carpeted ballroom in Zagreb:\n\n       The National Endowment for Democracy is an independent, \n     nongovernmental foundation which receives a grant from the \n     Congress every year for the purpose of strengthening \n     democracy around the world.\n\n  First of all, it seems almost an oxymoron to say this is a non-\nGovernment foundation operating on a Government grant. But he goes \nahead to say:\n\n  We have a journal in which we publish essays and articles on \ndemocracy, and we organize research conferences on democracy. We're \ncompiling a database which will soon be available over the Internet. We \nwill hold our fifth World Conference on Democracy in Washington on May \n1. We do work in 92 countries around the world. In China, Uzbekistan \nand, yes, the countries of this region.\n\n  The author of this article goes on to say:\n\n       Among the more experienced of the participants, the change \n     in manner is immediately evident. They've stopped taking \n     notes. The 92 countries, the broad friendly smiles, the \n     global visions of building democracy, you can see them adding \n     it all up to conclude there will be no computers, no printing \n     presses, no radio transmitters, no money for paper, no \n     hands-on assistance of the kind the participants are quick \n     to inform you is given to them by the representatives of \n     George Soros, the American financier.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It was my understanding that the Senator from Arkansas \nsaid this debate was going to be brief. The Senator is making a lot of \ncharges that I will feel compelled to respond to. The Senator from \nArkansas said we are going to revisit this issue again.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator is correct. If he will----\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could finish the question. If the Senator from \nArkansas is going to continue to belabor these organizations, then I \nwill feel compelled to respond, and we will be here for a long period \nof time.\n  So I ask the Senator how much longer we are going to debate this \nparticular issue, in light of the fact that the Senator from Arkansas \nsaid we are going to do it again some time in the near future?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator makes a very good point. I withdraw the \namendment. \n\n[[Page S 14654]]\n\n  So the amendment (No. 2845) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for no \nlonger than 2 minutes as in morning business for the purpose of \nintroducing a bill and an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith and Mr. Chafee pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1285 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith pertaining to the introduction of S. 1286 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I believe that the Presidential candidates \nare involved in a conflict of interest in New Hampshire, since that \nState has retroactively asked for same day election day registration. \nWe have an amendment in this bill that would allow them to do that and \nbreak the word of what the leadership on the other side said the \nconference report calls an election day escape hatch. This would \nencourage States to adopt same day registration procedures as a means \nof escaping the bill's requirements. That came from the bill's manager \non the other side.\n  Mr. President, what is a Presidential candidate to do if he is on the \nrecord opposing an election provision that turns out to be supported by \nthe State where the first primary is held? By the looks of the \nCommerce/Justice/State Appropriations bill, you hope like the dickens \nthat nobody notices.\n  But, Mr. President, I noticed.\n  This appropriations bill includes a committee amendment to the \nNational Voter Registration Act Of 1993--better known as motor-voter. \nThis committee amendment benefits two States--New Hampshire and Idaho--\nby changing the effective date of the exemption in the Act of States \nthat had already enacted election day registration or had no \nregistration requirement. That specific date--March 11, 1993--was \nincluded to prohibit any other State from avoiding the law. The \ncommittee amendment would undo that prohibition for these two States.\n  New Hampshire and Idaho enacted legislation with retroactive \neffective dates in an attempt to take advantage of the limited \nexemption in the act. Because of a court challenge to the New Hampshire \nretroactive law, we are being asked to adopt an amendment to \nretroactively change the motor-voter exemption deadline.\n  So, in the case of these two States we are enacting a retroactive \nprovision to a Federal law that will validate a retroactive provision \nin a State law that was enacted to avoid that very Federal law. This a \ncurious amendment with a ridiculous result.\n  It is important to note that this specific date was not only proposed \nby the Republican floor manager, but both he and the Republican leader \nand Presidential candidate actively promoted it. In fact, they both \ncited inclusion of that deadline in the exemption provision as an \nimprovement to the bill.\n  So while the committee amendment appears to be merely a technical or \ninsignificant change affecting only two States--it is clearly an attack \nby opponents to weaken the motor-voter law by permitting more States to \navoid its implementation. But even worse, it creates an incredible \nconflict of interest for every one of our many Republican Presidential \ncandidates, because it would directly affect voter registration for the \nNew Hampshire primary.\n  A similar exemption provision in the bill vetoed by President Bush in \nthe 103d Congress was singled out for criticism in his veto message. \nPresident Bush attacked the exemption as an inducement to States to \nadopt same-day registration laws. I responded to that charge, when it \nwas made by the Republican floor manager during debate on the veto \nover-ride, by pointing out that the exemption was intended to \ngrandfather only those States that had already adopted such laws. It \nwas not intended as an inducement to other States to adopt election day \nregistration.\n  To overcome an impasse during our consideration of the motor voter \nbill, the Republican floor manager submitted nine amendments to me that \nthe opponents considered to be necessary changes to the bill. The first \n``must do'' change was an amendment to set a date certain, March 11, \n1993, as the deadline by which a State must have enacted the required \nlegislation in order to be exempt from the requirements of motor-voter. \nBecause it was consistent with, and reinforced, the original intent of \nthe exemption provision, I included it in the amendment I offered at \nthe conclusion of bill negotiations.\n  The House bill, H.R. 2, included an exemption without a specific date \nthat was intended as an option to the States. The two Houses were \nclearly not in agreement regarding the exemption provisions of the two \nbills. The conference resolved this disagreement by including the \nSenate date certain deadline version in its report.\n  When the conference report was taken up in the Senate, the Republican \nfloor manager stated, with regard to the exemption:\n\n       Republicans slammed the escape-hatch shut. No longer is \n     this bill a backdoor means of forcing States into adopting \n     election day registration or no registration whatsoever. . . \n     . Republicans succeeded in grandfathering in the five States \n     that would have qualified for the exemption prior to March \n     11, 1993.\n\n  He then related that officials from Michigan, Illinois, and South \nDakota had contacted him to urge that the escape hatch be left open so \nthey could opt out from the law. The Republican floor manager then \ncommented, with regard to these States,\n\n     . . . their constituents are better served by the closing of \n     the escape hatch than if it had been left open.\n\n  In remarks regarding the conference report, the Republican leader \ncommented that the conference report was an improvement over the \noriginal bill because among other Republican amendments, it included \nthe exemption provision. He stated,\n\n     the conference report closes the so-called election day \n     escape hatch. This loophole would have encouraged States to \n     adopt same-day registration procedures as a means of escaping \n     the bill's requirements.\n\n  It was clear that both the Republican floor manager and the \nRepublican leader considered this exemption provision with its date \ncertain deadline to be an important provision because it closed off the \nexemption for all but the five States that had enacted legislation as \nof the deadline of March 11, 1993.\n  The legislative history in the House reflects this as well. A House \nconferee who supported an open exemption as ``a strong incentive for \nStates to move toward . . .'' same day registration stated that:\n\n     some Members in the other body voiced strong concerns over \n     this language, and the conference agreed to grandfather this \n     provision, making the exemption apply only to States that had \n     same day registration as of March 11, 1993.\n\n  This committee amendment is not only contrary to the law and our \nintent, it is also bad policy and reeks of Presidential politics. It \nwill undo a clear policy decision of the Congress and invite other \nStates to avoid Federal legislation by revising exemptions. Is it the \npurpose of the proponents of this amendment to encourage election day \nregistration or the elimination of registration altogether?\n  I would remind the junior Senator from Kentucky of his comment \nregarding the requests of officials from Michigan, Illinois and South \nDakota to keep the exemption open for future State compliance. If he \nsupports this amendment, may we expect him to extend an invitation to \nthose officials from Michigan, Illinois, and South Dakota to request \nadditional extensions so their States may also be exempted? Or is this \namendment only an attempt to accommodate the State election officials \nof the first Presidential primary State?\n  The underlying assumption of this amendment appears to be that \nCongress considered election day registration to be on a par with the \nrequirements of the motor-voter law. Again, a review of the legislative \nrecord shows that this is just not the case. Those supporting the \nclosed exemption were opposed to election day registration. The \nRepublican leader attacked it with the comment that:\n\n\n[[Page S 14655]]\n\n       In many areas same-day registration is a prescription for \n     fraud and corruption.\n\n  House conferees argued for an open exemption that would encourage \nStates to adopt election day registration or no registration. Their \nposition reflects a policy that such provisions are equal to or better \nthan the provisions of the motor-voter law. I would argue that the \nconference, in refusing to accept that position and in agreeing to the \nSenate's closed exemption, did not agree.\n  I am equally concerned that the effect of this amendment is to make \nmoot ongoing litigation. In the case of New Hampshire, the State \nenacted legislation with a retroactive effective date in an attempt to \nslip in under the exemption. That action is being appropriately \nchallenged in the courts by State organizations and voters who seek \ncompliance with motor voter. I do not think it is appropriate or good \npolicy for the Senate to directly interfere with ongoing litigation.\n  It is interesting to note that when the motor voter bill was under \nconsideration in the Senate, the Republican leader praised the floor \nmanager for closing the election day registration escape hatch. Now, \njust 2 years later, Republicans propose to open that hatch for two more \nStates and permit those two States to avoid implementing the motor \nvoter law.\n  One might reasonably ask, what has happened in the past 2 years to \naccount for this change? Do Republicans now favor election day \nregistration? Or, do Republicans wish to avoid compliance with the \nmotor voter law in as many States as possible by whatever means \npossible?\n  Recent events support the latter position. Rather than comply, some \nstates led by Republican governors have initiated court challenges to \nthis law. So far none have succeeded. The courts have upheld this law \nand have ordered the States to comply. As I have already noted, New \nHampshire would directly benefit by this amendment. New Hampshire is \ninvolved in litigation to compel its compliance--and we are asked to \nintervene by changing the law to render that litigation moot.\n  This should be seen for what is clearly is, another attack on the \nimplementation of the motor voter law and an attempt to curry favor \nwith election officials in the all-important primary State of New \nHampshire. My Republican colleagues appear willing to take this route \neven though it represents a complete about-face from the position they \nfought for just 2 years ago.\n  I think it is clear why implementation of the motor voter law is \nunder such attack. The law is working. And it is working well. Since \nthe law became effective January 1, States that are implementing it are \nexperiencing extraordinary registration activity. The National \nAssociation of Secretaries of State recently adopted a resolution that \nincludes the finding:\n\n       Preliminary statistics show the voter registration programs \n     mandated by the Act to be successful at providing citizens \n     access to the voter rolls. In the first six months, over 4 \n     million new voters have been added to voter lists nationwide \n     . . . .\n\n  A recent New York Times article noted that more than 5 million \nAmericans have been added to the rolls so far this year. It notes that \npolitical experts characterize this registration activity as ``the \ngreatest expansion of voter rolls in the Nation's history.'' The \narticle also states that ``Estimates are that by the turn of the \ncentury, if the surge generated by the new law continues, at least four \nof every five adult Americans will be registered to vote, compared with \nabout three of every five now.''\n  The figures cited in the Times article are truly amazing. It states \nthat this year Georgia registered 303,000 new voters between January \nand June, compared with only 85,000 for all of last year; Alabama \nregistered about 43,000 in the first quarter and only 23,000 during \nthat same period last year; Kentucky added 77,000 the first quarter \nthis year compared with 23,000 in all of 1994 and Indiana added 64,000 \nnew registrations the first quarter this year and only 5,400 during \nthat period last year.\n  These registration figures for this year show that the law is \nworking, and that it is working very well. I guess that some view the \nincreased voting rolls produced by the States under this act to be a \nthreat. A threat that must be attacked in the States, in the courts and \nin the Senate. What are they afraid of? More people voting? That is \nwhat democracy should be about. I welcome its success. I welcome a \nregistration system that reaches out to all eligible citizens to assure \nthat they are able to cast ballots on election day.\n  With a veto likely on this bill, now is not the right time to propose \nan amendment to strike this provision. But in closing, I want to make \none thing clear to the proponents of this provision, I will continue to \nresist this and any other attempt to undo or weaken a law that has \ndirectly encouraged 5 million more Americans to become involved in our \ndemocratic process.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it has been a long process in putting this \nbill together. It represents a dramatic change in public policy. The \nPresident has said he is going to veto the bill.\n  The American Government is about choices. What we have provided here \nis a bill which dramatically reduces spending below the level proposed \nby the President. We have provided a bill, despite some modest \nadjustments that we have made in the amendment process, some of which I \nhave supported, some of which I have not supported, which dramatically \nchanges the way government does its business.\n  We have sent forward the strongest crime provisions in an \nappropriations act in my Senate career. We have a bill that \nsubstantially reduces funding in the Department of Commerce. It still \nremains to be decided by the Senate whether or not we will eliminate \nthat Department.\n  We have a very tight budget for the State Department, and, under the \ncircumstances, a fair budget. It is clear that there are changes that \nI, as a Member of the Senate, and others would like to make that cannot \nbe made.\n  It is clear that the U.S. Senate supports quotas, supports set-\nasides, and even though the American people in overwhelming numbers \nreject them, it is clear that there is not support in the U.S. Senate \nto have a merit-based program for hiring, for promotions and for \ncontracts.\n  I am confident that some day there will be a majority which will \nsupport merit-based selection. That majority, however, does not exist \ntoday, we have proven this on many occasions and I do not think we \nwould benefit ourselves by proving it again today.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have a unanimous-consent request that I believe will \ncomplete the bill. I would like to read that unanimous-consent request \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following committee \namendments be withdrawn--Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could we have it restated again? I am \nnot sure what we are being asked to consent to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \ncommittee amendments be withdrawn. The amendment beginning on page 143, \nline 13 through page 145, line 18, and the amendment beginning on page \n151, line 16 through page 156, line 6, and that all remaining committee \namendments be agreed to en bloc, that there be one amendment to be \noffered by each manager which will contain amendments cleared on both \nsides of the aisle, that the bill be advanced to third reading and \nfinal passage occur without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, you said without any \nintervening debate? You just got done telling me I was going to have \ntime to debate it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I amend the unanimous consent request to \ndrop the words ``or debate.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Hallelujah.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement just \nadopted, the committee amendment adding the text of the Equal \nOpportunity Act to the underlying bill has been withdrawn.\n  After a lengthy process of consultation and drafting, I introduced \nthe Equal Opportunity Act earlier this year. The act has been referred \nto the Labor Committee. This past June, the Labor Committee held \nhearings on Executive Order 11246, one of the Federal Government's \nmajor affirmative action policies. And I expect the committee to hold \nhearings on my bill sometime later this year.\n  The Small Business Committee, at my request, has also held hearings \non the SBA's section 8(A) set-aside program. And the Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution, under the leadership of Senator Hank Brown, intends \nto convene a general series of hearings on affirmative action as it \noperates in both the public and private sectors. One hearing has \nalready occurred. The next hearing will probably take place sometime in \nOctober.\n  In my view, inserting the Equal Opportunity Act into this \nappropriations bill would have short-circuited the hearing process and, \nin fact, would have harmed the bill's chances for passage in the \nSenate.\n  Of course, I strongly support the Equal Opportunity Act because I \nbelieve the Federal Government should be in the business of uniting all \nAmericans, not dividing us through the use of quotas, set-asides, and \nother preferences. In fact I view the Equal Opportunity Act not only as \na piece of legislation, But as an opportunity to bring Americans \ntogether in a thoughtful, rational discussion about race in America. \nThis discussion is long overdue.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to continued hearings on this \nimportant issue. And I fully expect the Senate to consider the Equal \nOpportunity Act at an appropriate time in the near future.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate will \nplease come to order.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, In the managers' amendment there is a \nwhole new program for a subsidy for the maritime industry. At 5 minutes \nto 9 on a Friday night, when we are not normally in session, before we \nare going to take a week's vacation, it does not seem to me that we \nshould be passing a whole new program without some mention to the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  Since January or February the whole approach to this new program has \nbeen a very careful one-man show behind the scenes to, in a stealthy \nway, get this program out of the authorization committee with as little \nattention as possible, promising as much as you could to keep people \nquiet.\n  So, I rise to first of all tell the people of this country about this \nnew program that has operating subsidies and a shipbuilding loan \nguarantee for the maritime industry. I oppose it because virtually \nevery truly independent analysis of the maritime subsidies and \nprotectionist programs have concluded that they have little or nothing \nto do with our defense needs. Remember, these programs of subsidies \nwere started in the 1930's, the 1940's, the 1950's, to provide ships \nfor our defense needs. When these programs started we had 1,100, 1,200 \nships. Today we have between 250 and 300 ships. So you know the old \nsaying, you subsidize something you get more of it? In this particular \ncase it does not work.\n  This ends up being a waste of the hard-earned money of America's \ntaxpayers and consumers. In all my years in Congress I fought hard to \nuncover and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse within the Federal \nGovernment. I fought waste in a wide range of programs. This week we \nwon a victory for the taxpayers by eliminating AmeriCorps. And I fought \nhard against $1,800 toilet seats and $400 hammers, money squandered by \nthe Pentagon in the name of national defense.\n  Maritime subsidies are, as well, supposedly for the national defense. \nYet, during the last war we were involved in, the Persian Gulf war, 86 \npercent of the materiel that went by ship was not shipped on commercial \nAmerican flagged ships. We do not have the capacity for doing that \nbecause we have had a program that was supposed to work for the \nnational defense and it has not worked.\n  So, maritime subsidies, in the false name of national defense, I \nthink, after 4 decades, we ought to conclude, squander taxpayers' money \nas well.\n  Historically, anyone who has scrutinized maritime programs has come \nunder fierce public attack by the maritime industry's Washington lobby. \nMy motives have been criticized because I come from an agricultural \nState.\n  Let me admit, initially my interest in the maritime programs was \nlimited to its impact on agriculture, because our maritime, through its \nback-door, hidden cargo preference subsidy, not only undercuts our \nability to develop and expand overseas agriculture markets but also, \nand more tragically, cargo preference literally takes food out of the \nmouths of hungry people and starving people around the world. Simply, \nthe money that otherwise could have gone to send more food to the \nstarving is eaten up by the outrageous rates charged by U.S. flag \nmaritime companies, sometimes three to four times the world rate.\n  But it soon became apparent to me that most of the burden of our \nmaritime subsidies and programs is shouldered by the Defense Department \nin terms of cargo preference and by the American consumers, laborers \nand businesses, in terms of the Jones Act.\n  But one of the fascinating things about my long journey in trying to \nexpose and stop this maritime waste is the type of attack directed at \nme. It surprises me that the Defense Department and the defense \nindustry has not used this attack--in short, why has not the defense \ncommunity argued that they are entitled to spend $1,800 on toilet \nseats? After all, farmers get subsidies. Probably, the fact that this \nis such a ridiculous argument is the reason that the Defense Department \nhas not used it. But that certainly has not stopped the maritime \nindustry. \n\n[[Page S 14657]]\n\n  Of course there is a big difference. Farm programs are scrutinized \npublicly and intensely every few years, if not every year during the \nbudget process.\n  When is the last time we have had full-scale hearings, bringing in \nsupporters and opponents to the maritime programs?\n  The Commerce Committee held one hearing in July of this year to \ndiscuss the so-called Merchant Marine Security Act. Only supporters \nwere invited. Not only were maritime program critics not invited, but \ntheir requests to testify were denied as well. Talk about a one-sided \nstory promoted by a committee of the Congress. Then, before the \nCommerce Committee, written questions were even answered by those \ntestifying, the bill was rushed through by a voice vote.\n  Yesterday, there was considerable discussion about recommitting to a \ncommittee a nomination because new information was provided subsequent \nto committee action. Well, today, I am submitting for the Record \ninformation directly related to the Merchant Marine Security Act and \ndirectly related to the pending amendment that is in the managers' \namendment from the other side. I am convinced that my colleagues on the \nCommerce Committee did not have this information. If they had it, there \nis no way they could support S. 1139, the Merchant Marine Security Act.\n  I want my colleagues to know that what I am about to read is not this \nSenator's opinion. Instead, this information is the culmination of \nmonths of work by maritime experts from 16 different Government \nagencies, executive branch agencies--not a congressional study, not a \nGAO study, not a private think-tank study, but a study by 16 Government \nagencies of the executive branch.\n  This memo I think is explosive and sets a lot straight. This memo is \nentitled ``Memorandum for the President''--meaning memorandum for \nPresident Clinton. It is from Robert Rubin. Robert Rubin is now the \nSecretary of the Treasury, as you know. The subject: Decision \nmemorandum on maritime issues.\n  It is dated, the White House, Washington, June 30, 1993. Purpose of \nthe memo: This memorandum asks you to decide--meaning asking the \nPresident to decide, from the Robert Rubin who is now Secretary of the \nTreasury--asks you to decide on the level and form of subsidies to be \ngiven to various U.S. maritime industries.\n\n  So this decision is asked to be played at the highest level of our \nGovernment, the President of the United States.\n  Now, for background, because there are paragraphs here on background.\n       The U.S.-Flag Fleet. The U.S.-flag fleet is engaged in both \n     domestic and international trade. Ships in domestic trades \n     are permanently protected from foreign-flag competition by \n     the Jones Act. This memorandum describes options to subsidize \n     ships that are employed in international trade and therefore \n     subject to competition. The international trade fleet \n     consists of 95 liners (ships designed principally to carry \n     goods in containers) and 60 bulkers (ships that carry loose \n     cargo such as liquids and ore).\n       The principal issue in this memorandum is whether expiring \n     direct subsidies should be replaced with new subsidies for \n     U.S.-flag liners. (No agency supports direct subsidies for \n     bulkers). If no new program is announced, most U.S. liners \n     are likely to reflag their vessels. The reflagged ships would \n     still be owned and controlled by U.S. firms; their U.S. crews \n     (about 10,000 seafarers) would be replaced by foreign \n     mariners. A related issue is whether the plethora of indirect \n     subsidies that now support a wide range of maritime interests \n     should be expanded., maintained or phased-out.\n       Budgetary Context. Option 1 would require DOD to shift \n     defense outlays; it would be deficit neutral. Options 2 and 3 \n     would increase mandatory spending. Under the Budget \n     Resolution, offsets would have to be identified to make the \n     proposals deficit neutral. Options 2 and 3 would also result \n     in savings on the discretionary side of the budget from the \n     phase-out of existing subsidy programs. While these savings \n     could be used for new discretionary outlays, they could not \n     be used as offsets for any new mandatory spending.\n\n  Then it goes on in more detail from the Secretary of the Treasury to \nPresident Clinton.\n\n       Option 1. Require DOD to Support U.S.-Flag Ships Needed for \n     Defense:\n       Rationale. Subsidies for the U.S. flag fleet have always \n     been justified by their role in providing a sealift capacity \n     for use in military emergencies. With the end of the Cold War \n     DOD's sealift requirements have declined. Although DOD's \n     bottom-up review is not complete, the Secretary of Defense, \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Commander \n     of the Transportation Command have already concluded that \n     future requirements will not exceed 20-30 liner vessels. DOD \n     will have no need for bulk vessels. All agencies therefore \n     oppose renewal of direct subsidies for bulkers. This option \n     would meet DOD's maximum military requirements.\n       Description. DOD would be directed to spend $60 million \n     annually on contracts with ship operators to provide DOD with \n     the services of up to 30 U.S.-flag liners in times of \n     military need. New contracts would be phased-in as current \n     subsidies expire or are terminated. If U.S.-flag ships are \n     subsidized through other means, such as Option 2 or Option 3, \n     DOD would be allowed to spend its limited resources meeting \n     more pressing defense requirements.\n       Under this option, the Administration would oppose the \n     expansion of indirect maritime subsidies. [Alternatively, the \n     Administration could, as many agencies recommend, seek the \n     phase-out of any indirect subsidies not required to meet a \n     specific military need.]\n       Budget Cost. This option would subsidize U.S.-flag liner \n     ships by reprogramming money already in the DOD budget (DOD \n     plans to obtain the funds by retiring 29 breakbulk ships from \n     the Ready Reserve Fleet). The option would be deficit \n     neutral.\n       Arguments in favor: These subsidies would provide for \n     genuine defense needs, and therefore would enjoy broad \n     support. By subsidizing 30 of the 52 liners now under \n     contract, this option would sustain 1,500 seafaring jobs and \n     about 750 landside jobs. Indirect subsidies come at the \n     expense of other U.S. industries and hinder the missions of \n     other Executive Branch agencies.\n\n  There is one argument that Secretary Rubin gave to the President to \nbe against this.\n  Provides less support than is sought by the industry and its \nsupporters.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the rest of the Rubin memo be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memo was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Option 2. Increase Direct and Indirect Subsidies to \n     Maritime Interests:\n       Rationale. This option is designed to keep most of the \n     existing U.S.-flag liners in foreign trade sailing under the \n     U.S. flag, regardless of defense needs.\n       Description. The option has four main elements:\n       (1) Increase to 79 from 52 the number of liner ships \n     receiving direct payments. DOT would be authorized to sign \n     10-year contracts at $2.5 million per ship per year in the \n     first four years, and $2.0 million per ship per year in the \n     last six years. In the first two years, new contracts would \n     be limited by savings made available from the existing \n     program.\n       (2) Allow non-subsidized, foreign-built vessels to receive \n     subsidies.\n       (3) Provide $200 million in FY94-96 for Title XI loan \n     guarantees to U.S. shipyards.\n       (4) Do not Oppose Congressional efforts to expand indirect \n     maritime subsidies.\n       Budget cost: Over 10 years, this option would increase \n     mandatory outlays by $1.7 billion, while decreasing domestic \n     discretionary outlays by $567 million.\n       Arguments in favor:\n       This option contains subsidies for liners, bulkers, and \n     shipyards in order to win support for the proposal from the \n     widest range of maritime interests.\n       Subsidizing 79 ships would sustain 4,000 seafaring jobs and \n     about 2,000 landside jobs.\n       Since foreign-built vessels may be less expensive, this \n     option could reduce carriers' costs.\n       Arguments against:\n       Subsidizing 79 vessels is unnecessary. This would be two to \n     three times the maximum number of ships DOD estimates are \n     needed to meet its sealift requirements.\n       The NEC Principals found no evidence that this segment of \n     the maritime industry was of strategic importance to the \n     economy. The U.S. has no competitive advantage in the \n     industry; the industry neither protects nor enhances U.S. \n     exports. Subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would \n     leave the Administration hard pressed to explain why it \n     should not also subsidize every other industry that suffers \n     job losses.\n       Immediate funding for Title XI loan guarantees is \n     premature. All agencies, including DOT, support the efforts \n     of the congressionally-mandated Working Group on the U.S. \n     Shipbuilding Industry. The Working Group will present options \n     to assist shipyards to the relevant Cabinet members later \n     this summer (see TAB B).\n       Greater indirect subsidies would come at the expense of \n     other U.S. industries and hinder the missions of other \n     Executive Branch agencies.\n       Option 3. Provide Direct Subsidies to a Limited Number of \n     U.S.-Flag Liner Ships:\n       Rationale. This compromise option is designed to subsidize \n     a U.S.-flag fleet that will meet defense needs and, if \n     desired, keep additional U.S.-flag vessels employed in the \n     international trades. The option would limit the number of \n     liners receiving subsidies to a range that could be more \n     readily justified to critics--between 30 ships (DOD's current \n     estimate of its maximum need) and 52 ships (the number of \n     liners currently under contract).\n\n[[Page S 14658]]\n\n       Description. Provide direct payments to between 30 and 52 \n     liner ships. DOT would be authorized to sign 10-year \n     contingency contracts providing $2.5 million per ship per \n     year in the first four years, and $2.0 million per ship per \n     year in the last six years. New contracts in the first two \n     years would be limited to savings made available from the \n     existing program.\n       Under this option, the Administration would oppose the \n     expansion of any indirect maritime subsidies. [Alternatively, \n     the Administration could, as many agencies recommend, seek \n     the phase-out of any indirect subsidies not required to meet \n     a specific military need.]\n       The Administration would oppose--as premature--funding for \n     loan guarantees until NEC Principals consider options \n     developed by the Working Group on U.S. Shipbuilding.\n       Budget Cost. Over ten years, direct subsidies for 30 ships \n     would increase mandatory outlays by $500 million, while \n     reducing domestic discretionary outlays by $358 million. \n     Direct subsidies for 52 ships would increase mandatory \n     outlays by $975 million and reduce domestic discretionary \n     outlays by $358 million.\n       Arguments in favor:\n       Would provide the industry with more money and longer \n     contracts than Option 1.\n       This option would sustain 1,500-2,500 seafaring jobs and \n     about 750-1,250 landside jobs.\n       Restricts or eliminates indirect subsidies that come at the \n     expense of other industries or hinder the missions of other \n     Departments.\n       Arguments against:\n       Provides less support than sought by industry and its \n     supporters.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       Fifteen Executive Branch Agencies support Option 1. The \n     Department of Transportation supports Option 2. A compromise \n     proposal is provided by Option 3. In addition to the \n     strengths and weaknesses of each option, these \n     recommendations reflect different views about the economic \n     and strategic importance of liner ships engaged in \n     international trade, as well as the extent of Congressional \n     support for maritime subsidies. These views are noted in TAB \n     C.\n\n\n                                decision\n\n       ________ Approve Option 1.\n       ________ Approve Option 1 as amended.\n       ________ Approve Option 2.\n       ________ Approve Option 2 as amended.\n       ________ Approve Option 3.\n       ________ Approve Option 3 as amended.\n       ________ Take No Action.\n       ________ Discuss Further.\n     Tab A: Background on Current Maritime Subsidies\n       The federal government now subsidizes ship operators \n     through a variety of programs, including:\n       (1) Operating Differential Subsidies. Under the ODS \n     program, the federal government entered 20 year contracts \n     with U.S.-flag operators. These contracts provided that the \n     federal government would pay the difference between wages on \n     U.S.-flag ships and wages on their principal competitor's \n     foreign-flag ships; in some cases, the government also \n     undertook to pay the differential on other costs such as \n     maintenance and repair. ODS contracts now cover 52 liner \n     ships and 28 bulk ships. ODS payments in 1993 are expected to \n     total $244 million, for an average per ship subsidy of about \n     $3.0 million.\n       To qualify for ODS payments, vessels must meet a number of \n     restrictions. ODS liners must: be U.S.-built, U.S.-flag, and \n     at least 51 percent owned by U.S. citizens; provide service \n     on ``essential trade routes''; receive approval from the \n     Maritime Administration before: altering trade routes; \n     affiliating with foreign-flag service; or operating in \n     domestic trades.\n       (2) Ocean Freight Differential (cargo preference) program. \n     Cargo preference laws require certain federal programs to \n     ship between 50 and 100 percent of their cargo on U.S.-flag \n     ships. OMB estimates that in 1993, cargo preference \n     requirements will increase government shipping costs by about \n     $590 million over shipping rates. These costs will be borne \n     by the Department of Defense, Agriculture, Transportation, \n     State, the Agency for International Development, and the \n     Export-Import Bank.\n       (3) Capital Construction Funds (CCFs). Owners of U.S.-flag, \n     U.S.-built ships may shelter income by placing it in a CCF. \n     Taxes on both the income placed in a CCF and the interest \n     earned by the CCF are deferred indefinitely. CCF balances are \n     now approximately $1.2 billion.\n       (4) Title XI. Under this program, the federal government \n     guarantees private loans made to the purchasers of U.S.-built \n     ships. Loans were last guaranteed under this program in 1992. \n     In 1993, $48 million was appropriated for the program, but no \n     loans were guaranteed. No funds were requested for this \n     program in the President's FY 1994 Budget. The government's \n     outstanding contingent liability under this program now \n     stands at about $2 billion.\n       (5) Jones Act. Like most other seafaring nations, the U.S. \n     provides cabotage for its ship operators--all domestic \n     waterborne trade must be carried on U.S.-flag, U.S.-built \n     ships. The Jones Act fleet accounts for about 50 percent of \n     the privately-owned oceangoing U.S.-flag fleet.\n       (6) The Shipping Act of 1984. Since 1916, the U.S. has \n     allowed U.S. and foreign carriers serving U.S. trades to \n     participate in international shipping cartels known as \n     conferences. The Council of Economic Advisors and the \n     Department of Justice estimate that the Act raises shipping \n     prices at least 10 to 15 percent, providing U.S. and foreign \n     carriers with a subsidy valued at $2-3 billion per year \n     (because of their low market share, U.S. carriers receive \n     only 20 percent of this subsidy). The Federal Maritime \n     Commission disputes these results, and asserts that \n     Conferences have little effect on long-term shipping prices.\n       Shippers continue to press for relief from strictures \n     imposed by the Act, and are likely to try and block any new \n     subsidies for carriers without some action to address their \n     concerns. The law regulating conferences was last amended in \n     1984. In 1990, the Advisory Commission on Conferences in \n     Ocean Shipping brought together carriers shippers to seek \n     consensus on further changes to the Act. No agreement was \n     reached.\n     Tab B: U.S. Shipbuilding and Current Administration Efforts \n         to Assist the Industry\n       Large U.S. shipyards are now almost completely dependent on \n     the Navy. Of the 87 ships currently on order or under \n     construction, 86 are for the Navy. With the drawdown in \n     defense spending, naval orders are expected to decline \n     substantially. The problems faced by U.S. shipyards are thus \n     similar to those faced by other defense contractors--namely, \n     how to shift from military to civilian production.\n       The U.S. industry is currently not competitive in the \n     global market. It is less efficient than its foreign \n     competitors and has had little experience in the commercial \n     market since the early 1980s when the U.S. ended construction \n     differential subsidies and increased naval orders. U.S. yards \n     are also disadvantaged by the subsidies granted by foreign \n     governments to their own shipyards. As a result, U.S.--built \n     ships are more expensive than foreign-built ships. According \n     to the ITC, price differentials have reached 100 percent.\n       The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that U.S. \n     shipyards employed 123,900 workers in 1992 (down from 171,600 \n     in 1982). The shipbuilding industry estimates that, absent \n     government assistance, 70,000 more shipbuilding jobs could be \n     lost. Even with government assistance, however, shipbuilders \n     estimate that the transition from military to civilian \n     production will lead to a loss of 20 percent of current \n     employees as some skills will no loner be needed.\n\n\n            Actions Currently Underway by the Administration\n\n       All agencies support the following Administration efforts \n     now underway:\n       1. Seek to Reinvigorate Negotiations to Eliminate Foreign \n     Shipbuilding Subsidies. U.S. negotiators are currently \n     engaged in efforts to restart negotiations on the elimination \n     of foreign subsidies. The elimination of such subsidies has \n     been one of the key objectives of the U.S. shipbuilding \n     industry.\n       2. Explore the Possibility of Working with Congress on \n     Legislation to Support this Effort. In the last Congress, \n     bills were introduced in both the House and the Senate \n     providing the means to retaliate against ship carriers who \n     purchased subsidized foreign-built vessels. These measures \n     are intended to speed multinational agreement on the \n     elimination of foreign shipbuilding subsidies. Agencies are \n     exploring the possibility of working with Congress on \n     legislation this year.\n       3. Prepare Congressionally-Mandated Plan for the U.S. \n     Shipbuilding Industry. The FY 1993 National Defense \n     Authorization Act required the Administration to establish a \n     working group charged with preparing a plan to help U.S. \n     shipbuilding industry become competitive in international \n     commercial markets. The working group is considering a series \n     of measures, including the use of Title XI loan guarantees \n     for ship construction, defense conversion funds, ARPA R \n     projects, and Export-Import financing. The group will present \n     its proposals to the relevant Cabinet members this summer, so \n     that the Administration can submit a plan to the Congress by \n     the statutory deadline of October 1, 1993.\n     Tab C: Differing Views on U.S.-Flag Ships Engaged in Foreign \n         Trade\n\n                           Political Concerns\n\n       (1) Strength of Congressional Support: Secretary Pena \n     believes there to be broad, bipartisan Congressional support \n     for maritime subsidies. The Secretary believes that maritime \n     supporters have enough votes to pass a maximalist package \n     without support from the Administration. If you do not \n     announce such a package now, the Secretary fears that you \n     will lose an opportunity to demonstrate leadership.\n       The Director of OMB disagrees with this assessment. In the \n     current budget environment, he believes that there will be \n     far less support for direct and indirect maritime subsidies. \n     He argues that Congress might even reduce the level of \n     subsidies, including those indirect subsidies that come at \n     the expense of other industries, such as agriculture and \n     manufacturing.\n       (2) The Political Cost of Delay: A number of maritime bills \n     have been introduced in Congress. To date, the Administration \n     has delayed taking a position on these bills pending the \n     completion of its review of maritime policies. Secretary Pena \n     believes that further delay will generate ill feelings on the \n     Hill.\n       (3) Congress will Support Subsidies to Ship Operators Only \n     If Immediate Subsidies Are Provided to Shipyards: Secretary \n     Pena believes that no new direct subsidy program \n\n[[Page S 14659]]\n     can pass in Congress without including immediate new funding for \n     shipyards.\n\n                           Economic Concerns\n\n       (1) DOT: Without a U.S.-flag fleet engaged in foreign \n     trade, U.S. exporters would be held hostage to the fleet of \n     nations with which we might have trade disputes.\n       Other Agencies: The worldwide carrier industry is highly \n     competitive, making the possibility of being held hostage \n     highly remote. Moreover, U.S. exporters will always be able \n     to ship cargo on U.S.-owned, foreign-flagged ships (although \n     these ships have foreign crews, they are owned and controlled \n     by U.S. interests).\n       The Alliance for Competitive Transport, the coalition of \n     major American exporters and importers, has made clear that \n     it does not believe that its interests would be harmed by the \n     reflagging of the Merchant Marine, as long as the ships \n     remained U.S. owned and controlled.\n       (2) DOT: A new ten-year program will lead to increased \n     efficiencies in the Merchant Marine that will make further \n     subsidies unnecessary.\n       Other Agencies: Subsidies are needed principally to offset \n     the higher wages of U.S. mariners. DOT has presented no \n     evidence that this program would eliminate the wage \n     differential between U.S. carriers and their foreign \n     competitors.\n       (3) DOT: The government must subsidize more ships than it \n     needs for defense purposes or risk crippling the commercial \n     shipping industry in times of military emergency.\n       Other Agencies: U.S. ship operators will enter contingency \n     contracts only if they believe that yielding their ships to \n     the government in times of emergency will not cripple their \n     commercial operations. If their ships were used during \n     emergencies, ship operators would continue operations through \n     their U.S. owned, foreign-flag affiliates, and by contracting \n     out to foreign owned companies.\n       (4) Department of Transportation: Some maritime supporters \n     will argue that DOD is not meeting its defense needs in the \n     most cost-effective manner. Critics will claim that DOD plans \n     to spend $6-7 billion over the next few years to purchase \n     ``roll-on, roll-off'' (RORO) ships with a sealift capacity \n     that could be purchased more cheaply through subsidies to \n     maintain a large U.S.-flag Merchant Marine.\n       Department of Defense: DOD will spend $4.5 billion between \n     now and the year 2000 to acquire RORO ships. However, these \n     ROROs are not available in the current commercial fleet, nor \n     would these ships become available under any new liner \n     subsidy program. ROROs are specialized ships that allow rapid \n     loading/unloading of vehicles and can achieve high speed on \n     the open ocean. Reliance on the Merchant Marine to serve the \n     specialized function of ROROs would seriously compromise \n     DOD's ability to deploy U.S. forces in time to meet \n     anticipated threats overseas.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, after reading that memo, I want to tell \nmy colleagues that this option was the overwhelming pick among these \nagencies. Fifteen executive branch agencies supported the option that I \njust read from Secretary Rubin to President Clinton. Only one agency \nobjected, and that lone agency was the Department of Transportation.\n  Now, the Defense Department was willing to pay for this option. Yet, \nthe Transportation Department opposed. Why? Why would the Department of \nTransportation oppose the Defense Department paying for these maritime \nsubsidies, but subsidies limited to meeting our true defense needs, not \none ship more than what the Secretary of Defense said we needed?\n  Now, of course, we all know that the President of the United States \nis a busy man. And so, in preparing a decision memo, you want to make \ncertain that you put your absolute most important arguments front and \ncenter.\n  The 15 agencies had a number of important arguments in favor of this \noption. First and foremost in importance is the fact that the Secretary \nof Defense, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Commander of \nthe Transportation Command said the real defense needs could be met \nwith as few as 20 U.S.-flag ships.\n  Second, it was argued by these 15 agencies that ``Option one'' would \nsustain 1,500 seafaring jobs and 750 landside jobs.\n  And third, they argued against indirect subsidies such as cargo \npreference by pointing out that ``indirect subsidies come at the \nexpense of other U.S. industries and hinder the missions of other \nexecutive branch agencies.''\n  Mr. President, surely the Department of Transportation had a number \nof powerful and persuasive arguments against this cost-effective option \nsupported by 15 agencies. Transportation must have been able to argue \nto the President important meritorious points that our Defense experts \nare wrong, that we need to subsidize more U.S.-flag vessels to meet our \nreal defense needs.\n  But what was Transportation's best arguments? Well, first, it must \nhave been good, because Transportation only offered one argument \nagainst it.\n  And since the lone Transportation Department prevailed over 15 other \nagencies, it must have been a very good argument, you would surmise. \nAfter all, President Clinton was convinced, and he is pushing a \nMerchant Marine Security Act that funds 52 vessels recommended by the \nDepartment of Transportation, not the 20 recommended by the Department \nof Defense. And it must have been good because a House committee and a \nSenate committee have both approved these new subsidies for 47 to 52 \nvessels.\n  So what then was this powerful argument by the Department of \nTransportation? And here I wish to read again for my colleagues.\n\n       Arguments against. Provides less support than is sought by \n     industry and its supporters.\n\n  Mr. President, did my colleagues hear the reason that the President \ndecided to go along with the Department of Transportation as the only \none of 16 Government agencies that thought we ought to subsidize 20 \nships, and instead the President went along with the agency that wanted \nto subsidize 52 ships?\n  The only argument against our top defense officials and 14 other \nagencies is that the maritime industry--get this--that the maritime \nindustry and its supporters want more!\n  I will read again from the memo from the Secretary of the Treasury to \nthe President of the United States what these other 15 departments \nwanted. It says right here, ``Provides less support than is sought by \nthe industry and its supporters.''\n  And for no more than these flimsy reasons, Congress within just a few \nminutes is about to give maritime what it wants. So much then for the \nrevolution that was ushered in in the 1994 elections!\n  This memo to the President is chock full of amazing arguments. Get \nthis. Transportation Secretary Pena strongly argued for the President \nto squander tax dollars by subsidizing 79 vessels, two to three times \nwhat the Defense Department said it needed for sealift requirements.\n  If President Clinton did not advocate subsidizing 79 vessels, \nSecretary Pena ``fears that you will lose an opportunity to demonstrate \nleadership.'' Pena also argued, ``Further delay will generate ill \nfeeling on the Hill.''\n  Now, Secretary Pena is saying to his own President that you better do \nwhat I say and recommend, because if you do not, I fear that you are \ngoing to lose an opportunity to demonstrate leadership.\n  I hope the Secretary is listening and watching because I have a \nmessage. Forget about generating ill feelings on the Hill. Voters took \ncare of many of those last November, and you can bet your bottom dollar \nthat your idea of ``losing an opportunity to demonstrate leadership,'' \nis 180 degrees opposite what the voters and overburdened taxpayers \nexpressed in the last election.\n  So, Mr. President, the military or national defense arguments in \nfavor of this amendment as well as for the so-called Merchant Marine \nSecurity Act are simply bogus. This memo that I have been reading from \nis absolutely clear evidence that the national defense arguments for \nmerchant marine subsidies are a sham.\n  That is not just the opinion of the military experts who participated \nin this 16-agency effort, for during the Bush administration these \nagencies participated in a similar maritime review. The point person \nfor this effort, representing the Defense Department, was former \nDefense Assistant Secretary Colin McMillan.\n  I have a copy of his memo to other task force members. In short, he \nsaid back during the Bush administration, ``The issue of U.S. flag \ncompanies reflagging if we don't give them more subsidies is not''--I \nwish to emphasize is not--``a defense issue.''\n  Assistant Secretary McMillan concluded, ``The issue of two U.S.-flag \ncontainer ship operators disposing of the U.S.-flag fleets is primarily \nan economic one and should be treated accordingly.''\n  Citizens Against Government Waste--we are all familiar with that \norganization--recently contacted Colin McMillan and included his \ncomments in their May 24, 1995 report entitled \n\n[[Page S 14660]]\n ``Disaster at Sea. It's Time to Deep Six the Maritime Subsidy \nPrograms.''\n  That is the name of their publication.\n  For my colleagues, if you are interested in this, this publication is \nan excellent, well-researched report which I am submitting for the \nrecord, but let me share with my colleagues what the former defense \nAssistant Secretary had to say now that he can speak candidly outside \nof the Bush administration.\n  McMillan called the subsidy program in the name of national security \n``a big waste of taxpayers' money. These programs should be clear \ntargets for elimination. Here we are talking about cutting programs for \nchildren and we're funding so-called defense programs that add \nnothing''--I wish to emphasize that add nothing--``to the defense of \nour country.''\n  Keep in mind that these candid remarks come from the former Defense \nDepartment expert on maritime subsidies and sealift needs. He is no \nlonger part of the Defense Department and he is no longer working for \nan administration. He is not being paid by the maritime lobby, nor is \nhe part of any organization that is being funded by the maritime lobby. \nSo no one can question his motives.\n  Again, this maritime defense expert concluded that maritime subsidies \nin the name of national security is a big waste of the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  He is not the only expert opposing maritime subsidies. I would like \nto share the ``Quote to Note'' from the August 3, 1995 Journal of \nCommerce:\n\n       Nearly 50 years of subsidies have not prevented the demise \n     of the U.S. merchant marine . . . Subsidies do nothing more \n     than cause inefficiency, mediocrity, lack of incentive and a \n     dependence upon Uncle Sam.\n\n  Mr. President, that statement was made by Harold E. Shear, who not \nonly served our Nation as a U.S. Navy admiral but also as a Maritime \nAdministrator.\n  As a memo to President Clinton points out, ``Subsidies for the U.S. \nflag fleet have always been justified by their role in providing sea \nlift capacity for us in military emergencies. With the end of the cold \nwar DOD's sealift requirements have declined.''\n  So you see, Mr. President, no matter what the U.S.-flag merchant \nmarine fleet may have meant to our Nation in the past to help with our \ndefense, the subsidies have not only been unjustified, they have not \nworked in providing a strong merchant marine to meet our needs in \nwartime. I argue that subsidies have even been harmful to our maritime \nand if they have been harmful to our maritime, they have been harmful \nto our national security.\n  Well, then, maritime supporters turn the debate away from the issue \nof defense to that of economic security. This, too, is nonsense, \naccording to Secretary Rubin's memo to the President. The memo reads as \nfollows.\n\n       The NEC principals found no evidence that this segment of \n     the maritime industry was of strategic importance to the \n     economy. The U.S. has no competitive advantage in the \n     industry. The industry neither protects nor enhances U.S. \n     exports. Subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would \n     leave the administration hard pressed to explain why it \n     should not also subsidize every other industry that suffers \n     job losses.\n\n  This is amazing. Why have not the House and the Senate committees \nbeen able to pry this truth out of those testifying at their hearings \non the maritime?\n  Not only is it no longer based upon the testimony of military experts \nthat have a military need, but the argument, when that wears out, has \nturned to economic rationale for our own maritime ships. And even the \nadministration principals argue that there is no economic justification \nfor this program.\n  Well, I think we all know the answer to why this argument was not \nable to be made at the committees of the Congress this spring. Those \ntestifying are expected to be team players. They are expected to be \nteam players for the President who decided to throw away taxpayers' \ndollars for unnecessary subsidies for maritime companies and their \nhigh-priced executives and their labor unions.\n  And let us not kid ourselves. The real reason that we need to \nsubsidize U.S.-flag vessels by the tune of $2 to $2.5 million per year \nis to cover the high costs of their labor unions.\n  Again, from the memo to President Clinton. Again, this is Secretary \nRubin writing to President Clinton.\n  He says:\n\n       Subsidies are needed principally to offset the higher wages \n     of U.S. mariners. DOT [the Department of Transportation] has \n     presented no evidence that this program will eliminate the \n     wage differential between U.S. carriers and their foreign \n     competition.\n\n  Mr. President, I have been arguing this truth for years. Most of my \ncolleagues except the new Members have heard it on the floor of this \nCongress almost every year. And now we have proof that the maritime \nexperts in 15 executive branch agencies in a Democratic administration \nagree with my position wholeheartedly.\n  But I surely was not the first who recognized this. A dozen years \nago, Mr. President, the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Commander, V. Adm. \nKent Carroll reported why our merchant marine was sinking.\n  He said 12 years ago:\n\n       Why are we in such a mess? . . . one of the reasons is that \n     U.S. crew costs continue to be the highest in the world. \n     Monthly crew costs of U.S. flag ships are as much as three \n     times higher than those of countries with comparable \n     standards of living, such as Norway.\n\n  He did not say three times higher than poor, Third World seafarers. \nHe said, three times higher than seafarers from countries with \ncomparable standards of living such as Norway.\n  Now, let me be fair to the unions. In a Journal of Commerce article \nabout an MIT study exposing the high cost of America's subsidized \nseafarers, union officials fought back.\n  I want to share what they said.\n\n       Unions representing officers and seafarers on modern \n     containerships have criticized many of the underlying \n     assumptions in the report, saying the authors ignored non-\n     vessel costs such as high management salaries, and corporate \n     overhead.\n\n  That is coming from our unions.\n  Does anyone from the Commerce Committee know how much of this $2.5 \nmillion per ship annual subsidy is needed to cover these high \nmanagement salaries? Because I think that everybody in this body ought \nto know.\n  Did the committee study the MIT report entitled ``Competitive Manning \nof U.S.-Flag Vessels'' before passing out a $2.5 million per vessel \nsubsidy?\n  This report shows how these U.S.-flag vessels can get by with as \nlittle as $1.1 million in Government subsidies. Let us go over that. \nMIT says that our U.S.-flagged vessels can get by with as little as \n$1.1 million subsidies. But our committee votes out a bill that gives \n$2.5 million per vessel subsidies.\n  This means, Mr. President, since the Defense Department needs as few \nas 20 vessels, and since by making some reasonable reforms such as \neliminating abusive featherbedding and overtime practices, Government \nsubsidies can be cut to $1.1 million per vessel, the Merchant Marine \nSecurity Act of 1995 should authorize then only $22 million per year. \nWhat is currently required? Five times that amount every year for 10 \nyears.\n  My colleagues need to understand then that the cat is out of the bag. \nNo longer are maritime subsidies and programs hidden in the dark of \nnight.\n  Perhaps you saw last week's front page article in the Washington \nPost. Other major publications such as the Wall Street Journal have \neditorialized against these wasteful maritime subsidies. And I submit \nboth of these for the Record.\n  Numerous groups have come out this year in opposition to maritime \nsubsidies. The list is long but my colleagues need to know who they \nare.\n  The National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, \nCitizens for a Sound Economy, a group formed by consumer activist Ralph \nNader called Essential Information, the Progressive Policy Institute \nsponsored by the Democratic Leadership Conference, the Cato Institute, \nthe Competitive Enterprise Institute, and the Heritage Foundation. And \nthat is just a partial list.\n  The point, Mr. President, is simple. Too much information exposing \nthe waste and abuse of maritime programs is out in the public. And the \npublic is demanding the elimination of all this waste.\n  In fact, a top Transportation Department official, Inspector General \nMary Schiavo, has testified that the entire Maritime Administration, \ntogether with its programs, including operating \n\n[[Page S 14661]]\nsubsidies can be eliminated. The Inspector General, Department of \nTransportation, working for Secretary Pena, who recommended that the \nPresident come on board for this fat subsidy, recommends that we can do \naway with these program operating subsidies entirely.\n  She is a top transportation official, an expert on all their \nprograms. But she is also an independent voice. And that independent \nvoice does not have to march lockstep with the Clinton administration \nparty line on maritime subsidies.\n  She has no self-serving motives. She does not have to care about \ngenerating ill feelings on the Hill, or about the question of failing \nto demonstrate leadership that Secretary Rubin said in the memo to the \nPresident of the United States if the maritime industry would somehow \nget less support than sought.\n  In other words, Mr. President, I think the Inspector General is a \ncredible person. And so is the memo that I have read, supposedly a \nconfidential memo from Secretary Rubin to the President of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, the public knows that maritime subsidies are a waste. \nThere have also been some public reports that show how desperate the \nmerchant marine unions and lobbyists have become. These articles point \nto the dramatic shift of maritime campaign contributions shifting away \nfrom Democrats in the last couple decades to Republicans this year.\n  And I have seen the reports compiled by some of these public interest \ngroups following closely this shift in campaign spending. I would urge \nmy colleagues to get a copy of an article printed on pages 536 and 537 \nof the 1977 Congressional Quarterly Almanac. History may very well \nrepeat itself.\n\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the amendment offered in this \nmanagers' amendment should be defeated. It should not have been sneaked \nthrough in this way. I regret that this amendment has been included in \nthe managers' amendment. It should have been withdrawn.\n  I do not know what sort of deal makings go on to bring this about, \nbut at least I have had an opportunity to tell the public and to tell \nmy colleagues that when this was a debate in the Clinton \nadministration, there were 16 Departments that were asked their \nopinion. Fifteen of the sixteen said this was a waste of the taxpayers' \nmoney, including the Department of Defense. But the Secretary of \nTransportation, through a memo of Secretary Rubin to the President, \nsaid that you better do this because you have to exercise leadership, \nyou have to exercise leadership, not because of the Department of \nDefense needs, not because of the economic needs, but because the \nmaritime industry and the maritime unions want it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report and articles \nto which I referred earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nDisaster at Sea!--It's Time to Deep Six the Maritime Subsidy Programs--\n                              May 24, 1995\n\n       Congress has set caps on future spending and put the \n     country on a glide path toward a balanced budget in seven \n     years. In doing so, members have set sail into stormy waters. \n     Working out the details will surely be one of the most \n     controversial debates in recent history: a clash over exactly \n     which programs and policies should go, which should stay, and \n     what to do with savings. As congressional observers, \n     political pundits, and arm-chair budgeteers (taxpayers, most \n     of all) observe the debate over the particulars of what \n     should be included, it will be just as important to take note \n     of what they're not arguing about.\n       Even though there have been calls for the elimination of a \n     variety of corporate subsidy programs--everything from the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Market Promotion \n     Program to targeted tax credits for corporations with friends \n     in high places--Congress will be missing the boat if it \n     doesn't move to scuttle wasteful maritime subsidy programs, \n     cargo preference laws and operating differential subsidies \n     (ODS), in particular.\n       Cargo preference laws go way back to the turn of the \n     century and the 1930's. The Jones Act, which governs only \n     domestic waterborne commerce, was enacted in 1920. It \n     mandates that all commercial cargo moving between American \n     ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships.\n       International cargo preference laws (the subject of this \n     report) dictate that all federal agencies--particularly the \n     Department of Defense (DOD), the USDA, the Department of \n     Energy, the Agency for International Development (AID), and \n     the Export-Import Bank--transport 50 to 100 percent of their \n     international cargo aboard U.S.-flag vessels. In practical \n     terms, these laws force taxpayers to underwrite monopoly \n     shipping rates and protect carrier owners from market \n     competition.\n       U.S.-flag vessels are those vessels regulated under the \n     laws of the United States. They must be American-built, \n     American-owned, and American-crewed.\n       According to a November, 1994, General Accounting Office \n     (GAO) report, the DOD alone, which is required by law to ship \n     100 percent of its goods under the U.S. flag, anted up $350 \n     million a year in additional costs between 1989 and 1993 for \n     the privilege of transporting equipment and materials to \n     points abroad on U.S.-flag vessels. The USDA and AID must \n     transport 75 percent of their international food aid under \n     the U.S. flag, at an additional yearly cost of $200 million \n     and $23 million, respectively. About 120 shipping companies \n     shipped goods under the cargo preference laws in 1993, but \n     the bulk of the subsidies went to a handful of companies.\n       The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that \n     international cargo preference laws will cost federal \n     government agencies an additional $600 million in fiscal year \n     (FY) 1996. The November, 1994, GAO report said that cargo \n     preference policies support at most 6,000 of the 21,000 \n     mariners in the U.S. merchant marine industry. That \n     translates into an annual cost of $100,000 per seafarer.\n       As far back as the 1960's the OMB, the GAO, and the Joint \n     Economic Committee of the Congress tried to do away with \n     these subsidies. In 1984, the Grace Commission also \n     recommended elimination of maritime subsidies.\n       Historically, proponents of cargo preference laws and other \n     maritime subsidy programs quickly evoke the national security \n     argument when defending the industry's right to continued \n     taxpayer largesse. They claim that a healthy U.S.-flag \n     merchant marine fleet is an essential logistical component \n     during a war. This argument has powerful resonance with \n     members of Congress, who harbor nostalgic memories of the \n     industry's titanic contributions during World War II, \n     orchestrating massive troop movements and dispatching \n     millions of tons of U.S. military equipment and supplies to \n     distant war zones.\n       The other rationale is that maritime subsidy programs pump \n     desperately needed revenue into an industry which cannot (or \n     hasn't been permitted to, depending upon who you talk to) \n     compete on the global market.\n       Unfortunately, today's merchant marine bears little \n     resemblance to its romantic image. Though the amount of \n     international ocean borne cargo has risen dramatically since \n     World War II, U.S.-flag vessels carry only four percent of \n     America's international cargo. Most of the increased cargo \n     has been picked up by privately owned foreign-flag carriers, \n     which are not subject to our restrictive ``flag'' laws and \n     are therefore far more cost-effective. The U.S.-flag fleet \n     has dwindled from a post-W.W.II peak of 2,000 to 371 ships \n     today. Of those 371, only 165 are currently engaged in \n     international trade and, therefore, eligible for either cargo \n     preference or operating subsidies.\n       Though those 165 vessels benefit from a billion dollars \n     annually in direct and indirect federal government subsidies, \n     the industry continues to sink under the unsustainable weight \n     of government regulation, outdated and protectionist labor \n     and management policies which safeguard the well-being of a \n     small clan of special interest groups, and the fierce \n     onslaught of global competition in the international shipping \n     industry. In characterizing U.S. maritime policies, \n     former U.S. Maritime Commissioner (and outspoken critic of \n     maritime subsidies) Rob Quartel called them ``a scam, a \n     taxpayer fraud.''\n       Cargo preference laws provide one kind of indirect subsidy. \n     A separate group of 20 to 30 privately owned shipping \n     companies also get cash subsidies through the Maritime \n     Administration (MARAD). These subsidies, so-called operating \n     differential subsidies (ODS), are meant to compensate private \n     shipping companies for retaining a certain number of their \n     vessels under a U.S.-flag, a decision which effectively \n     prices them right out of the world market.\n       In fact, keeping a ship under the U.S. flag is an \n     enormously expensive operation. In exchange for ODS, a \n     company must promise to keep certain international shipping \n     lines open, and--like companies with cargo preference \n     contracts--they must make their vessels available to the DoD \n     in times of national emergency. They must also submit to a \n     suffocating array of government regulations. Their ships must \n     be built in U.S. shipyards where construction costs are two \n     to four times those of foreign shipyards. They must comply \n     with a laundry list of safety codes and detailed technical \n     specifications which far exceed the internationally \n     recognized standards required for comparable foreign-flag \n     vessels. Most importantly, from the taxpayers' point of view, \n     they must also be U.S.-manned, with nearly twice the crew \n     size of comparable foreign vessels.\n       Ironically, the industry's most stultifying encumbrance, \n     the one most damaging to its competitive edge is a self-\n     imposed one: artificially inflated crew costs. But crew costs \n     are a matter of concern not just for the companies that must \n     pay seafarers' salaries and benefits. These costs are also of \n     paramount \n\n[[Page S 14662]]\n     importance to taxpayers because the cost of labor is one of the factors \n     which determines the level of the subsidy!\n       In 1994, MARAD quietly released a long-delayed study by \n     researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n     (MIT) on the subject of manning costs abroad U.S.-flag \n     vessels. The report's conclusions were stunning. The \n     industry's labor practices amounted to nothing less than good \n     old-fashioned featherbedding at the taxpayers' expenses.\n       The report contained billet cost breakdowns for a variety \n     of U.S-flag vessels. A captain's billet cost was $34,000 per \n     month, most of which is covered by taxpayers. (In the U.S. \n     maritime industry, mariners are at sea for six months, and \n     then go on a six-month hiatus). Therefore, for six month's \n     work, a captain's billet costs can be about $204,000. U.S. \n     seafarers are also entitled to and often collect unemployment \n     benefits during their six-month hiatus, which leads to higher \n     unemployment taxes for both American carriers and taxpayers.\n       Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), outraged at the \n     exorbitant taxpayer-subsidized crew costs, unsuccessfully \n     offered an amendment to the FY 1994 DoD appropriations bill \n     aimed at reducing those costs. In a letter to his Senate \n     colleagues, Grassley wrote:\n       ``Currently taxpayers are forced to support U.S.-flag \n     merchant marine seamen billets at a far higher level of pay \n     and benefits than those provided by billets for the men and \n     women who serve our nation in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \n     Marine Corps.''\n       Grassley noted that a Navy captain's billet costs $8,422 \n     per month. ``In fact,'' he wrote, ``a U.S.-flag cook's billet \n     costs more than that of a Navy captain!''\n       The November, 1994, GAO report bears out this trend when \n     U.S. crew costs are compared with their European \n     counterparts. In 1993, for example, the daily cost for a 34-\n     person crew were between $12,000 and $13,000 a day. The cost \n     for a 21-person European crew was $2,500 to $4,000 per day.\n       According to the MIT study, subsidies for U.S.-flag \n     vessels, should they be of importance to the DoD, could be \n     reduced from the current $2.5 million per ship to about $1.1 \n     million per ship by reducing crew sizes and salaries and by \n     allowing crew members to perform duties outside their job \n     classifications.\n       Shipping company managers have no incentive to negotiate \n     lower labor costs with the powerful mariners' unions because \n     the taxpayers will end up reimbursing them in the end anyway. \n     This arrangement has resulted in an unusually cozy \n     relationship between maritime industry labor and management, \n     who even share a bevy of lobbyists in Washington, D.C.\n       By brandishing the national security argument, proponents \n     of cargo preference laws and ODS have been very effective at \n     keeping the tide of maritime subsidies flowing in spite of \n     overwhelming evidence that they are a bad deal for taxpayers. \n     Recently, however, that argument has begun to fray.\n       The Gulf War may be remembered as the catalyst which caused \n     the national security argument to unravel in earnest. It \n     exposed the myth that our current national maritime policy \n     has any real national security rationale.\n       The Gulf War was the largest movement of military personnel \n     and equipment since World War II. But of the hundreds of \n     ships that delivered supplies and equipment to the theater, \n     only a handful U.S.-flag vessels actually entered the war \n     zone to deliver their freight to American troops. There were \n     about 50 other U.S.-flag merchant ships moving cargo during \n     the war, but most of them delivered their freight to foreign \n     ports where it was transferred to foreign-flag vessels with \n     foreign crews to make the rest of the journey.\n       In an August, 1991, commentary in Defense News, director of \n     MIT's Defense and Arms Control Studies Institute Harvey \n     Sapolsky characterized the U.S.-Flag merchant marine fleet's \n     Gulf War participation this way:\n       ``Although more three-quarters of the ships chartered \n     during the Gulf War flew foreign flats, only 20 percent of \n     the U.S. military cargo actually rode on these ships. Most of \n     the amount hauled in a crisis is done by government-owned \n     standby and reserve ships. Moreover, there is a ready charter \n     market for commercial cargo vessel when more ships are \n     needed. The price required for their services in a crisis is \n     cheaper than the cost of maintaining a large subsidized \n     commercial fleet for a mobilization that may not happen again \n     for years. Despite any accompanying rhetoric about national \n     security, subsidies for the Merchant Marine fulfill the \n     commonplace desire for obtaining a livelihood without the \n     burden of having to compete to earn a living'' (emphasis \n     added).\n       Use of U.S.-flag ships actually hampered the Pentagon \n     during the critical surge stage of the Gulf War. When the \n     Pentagon had to transport cargo quickly, U.S.-flag ships, \n     which were scattered around the world, had to be called back \n     for service.\n       And, though the Pentagon has the option of commandeering \n     the ships for the war effort, American merchant marine crews \n     are not compelled by law to serve and must be asked to \n     volunteer their services. What's more, taxpayers pay once \n     again because these crews are entitled to hazard pay if they \n     enter a war zone.\n       In 1992, Colin McMillan, then-assistant secretary of \n     defense for production and logistics, was asked to report to \n     an interagency working group on the impact on military \n     readiness of two major U.S. container companies reflagging \n     under foreign flags. McMillian's memorandum, dated December \n     10, 1992, stated that ``the National Security Sealift Policy \n     does not support a fleet sized to meet military requirements \n     while maintaining its essential commercial operations/\n     commercial viability. Therefore, the issue of two major U.S.-\n     flag container ship operators disposing of their U.S.-flag \n     fleets is primarily an economic one and should be treated \n     accordingly (emphasis added).'' Contacted recently about the \n     issue, McMillian called the subsidy programs in the name of \n     national security ``a big waste of taxpayer money. These \n     programs should be clear targets for elimination. Here we are \n     talking about cutting programs for children, and we're \n     funding so-called defense programs that add nothing to the \n     defense of the country.''\n       There have been a number of opportunities to sink these \n     profligate maritime subsidy programs. The most recent was \n     Vice President Gore's National Performance Review (NPR). \n     There were indications that some members of the NPR's \n     transportation task force, charged with rooting out \n     inefficiency in that area, wanted to deep-six these programs. \n     However, intense political pressure was brought to bear, and \n     the promise of a commission to look into maritime issues was \n     the most that emerged from that effort. Yet, even that has \n     not come to fruition.\n       Congressional support for maritime subsidies comes from a \n     variety of different, but apparently complementary, political \n     interests. Republicans like Rep. Herb Bateman (R-VA) and \n     Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott (R-MS), who both hail from \n     coastal states, must contend with powerful maritime and \n     shipbuilding constituencies. On the Democratic side of the \n     aisle, Sen. John Breaux (D-LA) also has a strong maritime \n     constituency. Much of the political support from the \n     Democratic members is a natural outgrowth of the party's \n     traditional relationship with labor unions.\n       The Clinton administration's support for continued maritime \n     subsidies seems to be based upon political concerns rather \n     than sound fiscal policy. In a June 30, 1993, memorandum to \n     the President obtained by Citizens Against Government Waste \n     (CAGW), then-Secretary to the President for Economic Policy \n     Robert Rubin laid out the administration's options on \n     maritime issues. The memo stated that:\n       The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff, and the Commander of the Transportation Command \n     have already concluded that future requirement will not \n     exceed 20-30 liner vessels. DoD will have no need for bulk \n     vessels. All agencies therefore oppose renewal of direct \n     subsidies for bulkers (emphasis added).\n       Further on, Mr. Rubin once again delineated for the \n     President the arguments against maintaining or increasing \n     direct or indirect subsidies to maritime interest:\n       There is no evidence that this segment of the maritime \n     industry was of strategic importance to the economy . . . and \n     subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would leave the \n     administration hard pressed to explain why it should not also \n     subsidize every other industry that suffers job losses.\n       Under the heading ``Political Concerns,'' Mr. Rubin \n     discussed the political climate in Congress and the chances \n     for getting rid of maritime subsidies:\n       ``Secretary Pena believes there to be broad, bipartisan \n     Congressional support for maritime subsidies. The Secretary \n     believes that maritime supporters have enough votes to pass a \n     maximalist package without support from the Administration. \n     If you do not announce such a package now, the Secretary \n     believes that you will lose an opportunity to demonstrate \n     leadership (emphasis added).\n       In other words, if you can't beat them, join them. In the \n     final analysis, and in spite of the well-documented negative \n     impact these policies have on taxpayers and the long-term \n     competitive health of the maritime industry itself, not to \n     mention the federal budget deficit, the Clinton \n     administration chose to renew the operating differential \n     subsidies under a new title, the Maritime Security Act. While \n     practically every federal government program is coming under \n     congressional scrutiny, very little attention is being paid \n     to this ongoing waste of taxpayer money. This new bill, which \n     is similar to its predecessor, appears to be a politically \n     motivated stop-gap measure designed purely to pacify \n     congressional interests.\n       It is undeniable that the American merchant marine \n     industry, owing to a complex range of problems, is \n     floundering. In fact, simply scratching the surface of U.S. \n     maritime policies reveals a diabolically complicated system, \n     apparently designed to promote and enrich a handful of \n     privately owned shipping companies, the seafarers unions, the \n     shipbuilding companies, some powerful members of Congress, \n     and the Washington lobbyists who are paid handsomely to keep \n     all these balls in the air. Everyone, that is, except the \n     American taxpayers.\n       There are some voices of reason on Capitol Hill, and the \n     time may be right to make a serious move to eliminate these \n     costly leviathans. Sen. Grassley, a veteran critic of \n     maritime subsidy programs, collected 23 signatures on a \n     letter to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-\n     N. Mex.) calling for the elimination of ``wasteful maritime \n     programs, particularly cargo preference subsidies.'' \n     Signatories included Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS), \n     Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN), and Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD), \n     chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.\n\n[[Page S 14663]]\n\n       Senator Hank Brown (R-CO) has decried the elitist nature of \n     the program, saying: ``What we accomplish with cargo \n     preference is to line the pockets of some very wealthy \n     people, but we do not accomplish the goal of expanding the \n     number of U.S.-flag vessels. It has dropped. We do not \n     accomplish the goal of making U.S. ships more competitive.'' \n     Sen. Brown's office asked the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) to score the potential savings if maritime subsidies \n     were eliminated. The CBO estimated that the elimination of \n     maritime subsidies would save more than $2.8 billion over \n     five years.\n       Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) has also crafted some preliminary \n     legislative language which would effectively eliminate cargo \n     preference laws in relation to foreign aid food shipments.\n       Several long-term maritime industry observers interviewed \n     for this report have come to a common conclusion. It is no \n     longer a matter of whether the U.S.-flag maritime fleet will \n     implode under its own weight, it's just a matter of when and \n     how much more money the taxpayers will surrender \n     involuntarily in a fruitless endeavor to prop up a failing \n     industry. Members of Congress should move now to stop this \n     maritime madness. It's time to scuttle the maritime subsidy \n     programs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                            Subsidies Ahoy!\n\n       Was there really a revolution in American politics last \n     November? If so, somebody had better notify Congressman Herb \n     Bateman--fast. The Virginia Republican has already persuaded \n     the National Security Committee to approve a new $1 billion \n     subsidy for the U.S. Merchant Marine, and now he's trying to \n     get the rest of the House to go along. If he gets his way, \n     it'll be a strong indication that the Republican tide is \n     breaking up on the special-interest rocks of Washington.\n       There is no clearer case than shipping of the harm that \n     government ``help'' can do. During the past 50 years, the \n     government has sunk tens of billions of dollars into \n     protecting commercial shipping. The result? Just in the past \n     25 years, the U.S. Merchant Marine's share of the U.S. \n     shipping market has declined from 25% to less than 4%.\n       Federal interference starts with Coast Guard-enforced \n     regulations on staffing and work rules. U.S. mariners earn an \n     average of $125,000 for six months duty, but aren't allowed \n     to do as much work as lower-paid foreign counterparts. No \n     wonder it costs several times more to operate a U.S. ship \n     than a foreign vessel.\n       To ``compensate'' for these costly rules, U.S. shipping \n     lines get an annual direct payout of $240 million: this \n     program will expire soon unless it's renewed. Another handout \n     comes from the Defense Department, the Agency for \n     International Development and other government outfits that \n     have to ship goods on costly U.S. vessels. These ``cargo \n     preferences'' cost $592 million last year--enough money for \n     private charities to feed half a million starving children in \n     Africa for a year.\n       Throw in millions more for maritime academies that turn out \n     sailors the U.S. fleet can't employ, and what do you get? \n     Roughly $1 billion annually in direct government subsidies to \n     the U.S. Merchant Marine. But that's only part of the \n     maritime boondoggle. Even bigger costs lurk just beneath the \n     surface.\n       Under the 1920 Jones Act, only U.S.-built, -crewed and -\n     flagged ships can operate between U.S. ports. But since these \n     vessels are so costly, not a single coastal freighter bigger \n     than 1,000 tons runs along the East Coast. One result: Many \n     turkey farmers in North Carolina buy costlier Canadian grain \n     rather than cheaper U.S. varieties. In all, the International \n     Trade Commission estimates, the Jones Act costs consumers up \n     to $10.4 billion a year.\n       Then there's price fixing. The 1984 Shipping Act gave \n     shipowners complete anti-trust immunity and allows the \n     Federal Maritime Commission to enforce international shipping \n     cartels. The excessive charges of these cartels raise prices \n     on most imported and exported goods, costing consumers up to \n     $15 billion annually. Worst of all, 80% of the benefits go to \n     foreign shipping lines.\n       Rob Quartel, a former FMC member, figures that all maritime \n     subsidies together cost at least $375,000 per seagoing \n     worker. It would be a lot cheaper to pay the sailors not to \n     work. Eliminating these subsidies would not only force the \n     maritime industry to become competitive, but also would \n     contribute to the balanced budget effort. Mr. Quartel \n     figures, based on dynamic scoring, that eliminating subsidies \n     would save $7 billion between 1996 and 2002, and generate new \n     economic activity that would raise an extra $28 billion in \n     tax revenue. Even in Washington terms, $35 billion is real \n     money.\n       The House budget charts a course toward this destination; \n     it calls for eliminating direct maritime subsidies. But some \n     Republicans haven't gotten the message yet. Majority Whip \n     Trent Lott, who has also blocked complete telecom \n     deregulation, helped keep the Senate Budget Committee from \n     torpedoing maritime handouts as a favor to his maritime \n     industry constituents. And when the Senate recently allowed \n     the export of Alaskan oil, the legislation stipulated that \n     only costly U.S. ships can carry the crude.\n       In the House, Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster \n     is frustrating deregulation efforts, while Congressman \n     Bateman sails full steam ahead with his subsidies, which he \n     calls ``The Maritime Security Act of 1995.'' (We guess that \n     sounds better than the ``Pork Barrel Act of 1995''.) The \n     congressman dusts off the hoary old argument that the U.S. \n     needs subsidies to preserve a flag fleet that can carry \n     Pentagon supplies in wartime as his excuse.\n       But this claim doesn't hold water. The Defense Department \n     already spends billions on transport vessels that are on \n     permanent standby. It doesn't need, and can't use, most of \n     the merchant ships that Mr. Bateman proposes to subsidize. \n     During the Gulf War, only 8% of supplies delivered directly \n     to the Persian Gulf came on U.S. commercial vessels. That's \n     why the Pentagon has consistently opposed paying for maritime \n     subsidies.\n       Stripped of their military justification, Republican \n     shipping subsidies begin to look a lot like what the \n     Democrats used to hand out: Favors for one set of campaign \n     contributors (shipping companies and sailors' unions) at the \n     expense of the national interest. Mr. Quartel rightly calls \n     this ``a fraud and a scam.'' Unless the GOP quickly deep \n     sixes this outrageous proposal, voters will have cause to \n     wonder whether the Ship of State is being run by the same old \n     crew that was in charge before Nov. 8.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 18, 1995]\n\n              End of Merchant Marine May Be on the Horizon\n\n                          (By Bill McAllister)\n\n       Portsmouth, Va.--It is 9 a.m. on a Sunday, and sweat is \n     trickling down Michael P. Ryan's chest.\n       The temperature has hit 90 degrees in the mint green engine \n     room of the Sea-Land Performance where Ryan, the 37-year-old \n     first assistant engineer, has been running last-minute \n     maintenance checks since before dawn. Later in the day, the \n     giant commercial ocean liner, three football fields in \n     length, will maneuver out of port on its way to deliver 1,700 \n     containers of chemicals, auto parts, chocolates and other \n     merchandise across the Atlantic.\n       For the six months at sea he will spend tending the ship's \n     clattering diesel engine, Ryan will earn about $90,000, more \n     than his counterparts on any commercial ocean liner without a \n     U.S. flag on its stern. American ship captains and chief \n     engineers on ships like Ryan's earn even more--as much as \n     $132,000 to $151,000 for a half-year's work. In the months \n     off, crew members of the Performance do everything from \n     collect unemployment to work at a ski resort.\n       ``I'm not going to say that the money's not good, but I \n     earn it,'' said Ryan, waving a dirty hand in the sultry air. \n     ``It's not the life of Riley.''\n       Whether it's a life that taxpayers should subsidize is \n     another question--one the Senate may address as early as \n     today.\n       Since a fledgling Congress first penalized imports on \n     foreign ships in 1789, the federal government has protected \n     shipping interests on the theory that the military needs \n     American-built, American-manned ships on hand in case of war. \n     It has proven a costly premise that critics claim no longer \n     is valid.\n       In the name of a strong merchant marine, the government \n     today pays some $214.4 million a year to underwrite the pay \n     of about 9,000 jobs on 75 private ships and cover the cost of \n     abiding by U.S. regulations. Those payments have totaled $10 \n     billion since the first checks went out in 1936.\n       It pays an additional $578 million a year more than it \n     needs to, by one estimate, to ship millions of tons of \n     military goods and other government cargo solely on U.S.-\n     flagged ships like the Performance, even though foreign \n     vessels are considerably cheaper. Farm state legislators \n     argue that the government loses millions more each year in \n     sales of farm commodities to foreign governments because of \n     higher transportation costs.\n       And consumers pay a good deal more money--$10 billion a \n     year, critics charge--for goods that federal law requires be \n     transported on more expensive American-flagged ships. That \n     law, called the Jones Act, bars foreign ships from carrying \n     any cargo shipped between domestic ports.\n\n\n                          a shrinking flotilla\n\n       Whether all this is necessary--indeed, whether it is even \n     good for the industry--has been argued for decades. The raft \n     of subsidies has not saved the U.S. shipping industry from a \n     titanic plunge from the top ranks of world shippers. The \n     number of merchant ships flying the U.S. flag has dropped \n     from 3,644 in 1948 to 351 this year. Their share of the \n     world's ocean-shipping trade has plummeted from 42.6 percent \n     in 1950 to approximately 4 percent today.\n       Even the industry's military value has vastly diminished. \n     In recent years, the Pentagon acquired its own fleet of fast \n     cargo ships, built specially to transport military equipment \n     and moored more or less permanently in strategic harbors \n     around the globe.\n       What's left of the American-flagged ships, according to \n     critics, is a tiny and costly flotilla of ``welfare queens'' \n     that epitomizes the waste that laces the federal budget.\n       The very obscurity of the subsidies to shipowners is part \n     of the secret of their survival. Many legislators see little \n     percentage in fighting to strike $1 billion or so from a $1.5 \n     trillion federal budget, especially when it might mean \n     forgoing the political contributions of maritime unions and \n     shipowners that comprise one of the most politically active \n     industries in the country.\n       ``This is a big mess, basically $1 billion a year . . . \n     going to less than 10,000 people,'' \n\n[[Page S 14664]]\n     said Rob Quartel, who served as a member of the Federal Maritime \n     Commission under President George Bush and has emerged as one \n     of the chief critics of the subsidies. ``The problem with \n     this industry is that it has been subsidized and regulated to \n     death.''\n       To the industry, however, the question is not whether \n     Congress wants to give the shipping industry a break, but \n     whether it wants a merchant marine at all. Executives of the \n     few remaining U.S. shipping lines blame their industry's \n     decline on foreign competitors who copied American technology \n     and then undercut American firms with cheaper labor and fewer \n     regulations.\n       Unless ``Uncle Sugar'' makes up the difference in costs, as \n     one shipper puts it, shipping companies will demand that the \n     government let them re-register their vessels in foreign \n     countries to take advantage of lower foreign operating costs. \n     ``We're fighting for our life,'' said Mike Sacco, president \n     of the Seafarers International Union.\n       ``America's future as a maritime nation is at stake,'' \n     Albert J. Herberger, President Clinton's maritime \n     commissioner, recently told Congress. ``This year will make \n     or break what remains of our U.S.-flag presence on the high \n     seas.''\n       The issue before Congress is a simple one, said Christopher \n     L. Koch, a senior vice president of Sea-Land: ``Give us the \n     dough or let us go.''\n       More and more, letting them go seems a viable option. \n     Groups as diverse as the conservative National Taxpayers \n     Union and Ralph Nader's Essential Information Group are \n     pressing the Republican Congress to untie the shipping \n     industry and see how it floats on its own.\n       Their champion is a farm-state senator, Charles E. Grassley \n     (R-Iowa), who foresees savings for the Agriculture Department \n     in sales and shipments of surplus food overseas if maritime \n     programs are eliminated. ``We're seeing more light at the end \n     of the tunnel, but I don't see victory,'' he said in a recent \n     interview.\n       Some of the maritime industry's supporters, sensing trouble \n     at hand, are proposing cutting some of the expense. A \n     coalition of senators from maritime states may ask for a \n     floor vote as early as today on a measure that would extract \n     about $100 million from Radio Free Europe to continue \n     subsidizing the operating costs of a smaller number of U.S. \n     ships and provide some other benefits to the dwindling number \n     of private U.S. shipyards.\n       ``Yes, it is going to cost a little more to ship on an \n     American ship,'' said Sen. John Breaux (D-La.), one of the \n     measure's supporters, at a recent Senate hearing. But, he \n     said, ``it is all a part of being an American.''\n\n\n                         a call for elimination\n\n       Early on, it appeared that the Clinton administration might \n     try to toss out maritime subsidies in its drive to streamline \n     government. A task force advising Vice President Gore \n     described the subsidies as ``a cancer eating away--\n     unnecessarily--at the general revenues of the U.S. \n     Treasury.''\n       A draft of Gore's report on ``reinventing government'' \n     called for eliminating the benefits, according to the task \n     force members, but that recommendation was deleted after \n     leaders of the politically powerful maritime unions protested \n     to Clinton. In a 1993 memo to the president, Robert E. Rubin, \n     then the director of Clinton's National Economic Council, \n     noted that maritime benefits already had ``broad bipartisan \n     support'' on the Hill.\n       But the support from the Pentagon, which long has provided \n     the rationale for the expenditures, has faded. In the 1980s \n     the military decided it was no longer content with the \n     shipowners' pledges to haul supplies in their vessels in \n     wartime in exchange for ongoing subsidies. Military planners \n     concluded it would take too long to commandeer the civilian \n     ships in a crisis. Besides, most commercial U.S. ships \n     sailing with U.S. flags were designed to carry standardized-\n     sized boxes of food and goods, not helicopters.\n       So the Pentagon invested in so-called roll-on, roll-off \n     ships--essentially floating garages that can be filled with \n     tanks and military trucks. Since the Persian Gulf War, the \n     military has continued to expand its fleet of ``row-rows,'' \n     as the ships are called, with a $6 billion program. Today it \n     has a reserve fleet of 89 Navy-gray ships, many of them fully \n     loaded and docked around the world.\n       Should it need more in a time of crisis, the Pentagon would \n     ``prefer American ships with American crews,'' said Margaret \n     B. Holt, a spokeswoman for the Military Sealift Command, the \n     Washington-based Navy command that charters ships for the \n     Pentagon. But that's only if another agency pays the \n     shipowners, said Gen. Robert L. Rutherford, head of the U.S. \n     Transportation Command, in recent testimony before a Senate \n     subcommittee.\n       During the Gulf War, the military found it could rely on \n     foreign ships to supplement its own fleet. The U.S. Maritime \n     Administration, part of the Transportation Department, \n     estimates that about 20 percent of goods arriving in the war \n     zone came on foreign ships; a Navy estimate places the level \n     closer to 50 percent, noting many military goods were \n     transferred from U.S.-flagged ships to smaller feeder ships \n     at European and Asian ports.\n       According to Holt, the Sealift command spokeswoman, the \n     lesson is: ``If there is money to be made, there are ships to \n     be had.''\n       The maritime programs are a patchwork of direct and \n     indirect subsidies and protections that date back largely to \n     the period between 1904 and 1936.\n       There are three ways the government subsidizes U.S.-flag \n     vessels: It pays direct subsidies to vessels engaged in \n     international trade to help them compete with foreign-flag \n     vessels. It pays higher rates on shipment of government \n     goods. It also requires goods shipped between U.S. ports to \n     be carried by U.S. vessels.\n       The requirement that government goods be transported in \n     U.S.-flagged vessels adds $578 million a year to the \n     government's transportation bills, most of it paid by the \n     Pentagon, the government's largest shipper, according to the \n     General Accounting Office. The rule that surplus food be \n     shipped under U.S. flag has cut the amount of farm \n     commodities that foreign governments could buy by $131 \n     million in the past three years, according to a March report \n     by the Agriculture Department's inspector general.\n       Consumers also pay to protect the industry, according to \n     critics like Quartel, the former Bush administration \n     official. Quartel heads a group backed by farm and minerals \n     interests that hopes to repeal the 1920 Jones Act, the law \n     that restricts domestic cargo to American-flagged ships. He \n     cites a U.S. International Trade Commission study that \n     estimates the law may add as much as $10.4 billion a year to \n     transportation costs, which are then passed along to \n     wholesalers and consumers.\n       The most obvious cost--and perhaps the most vulnerable to \n     cuts--is the $214.4 million a year the government pays out to \n     the owners of the 75 U.S.-flagged vessels to cover the cost \n     of sailing with a U.S. crew, under U.S. regulations.\n       Unless Congress acts, these so-called ``operating \n     differential'' payments will cease when the government's 20-\n     year contracts with the shipowners expire in 1997. Rep. \n     Herbert H. Bateman (R-Va), a strong maritime advocate who \n     chairs a subcommittee of the House National Security \n     Committee, has teamed up with Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) to \n     propose somewhat reduced benefits: an average of about $2.3 \n     million a year each to about 50 ships, rather than the \n     roughly $3 million now paid to 75 vessels. The Clinton \n     administration supports their proposal.\n       Maritime industry officials say critics exaggerate the \n     indirect costs and underrate the benefits to the country in \n     jobs and national security. Although fewer than 10,000 jobs \n     depend on the direct subsidies, the Jones Act helps protect \n     as many as 200,000 workers, industry supporters say.\n       They deride foreign ships as unreliable in wartime, citing \n     a half-dozen or more vessels that refused to sail or delayed \n     voyages into the Persian Gulf during the conflict there.\n       If U.S.-flagged ships are not militarily important, then \n     their crews certainly are, supporters say. ``You can always \n     commandeer ships. You can't commandeer people,'' said Thomas \n     L. Mills, a Washington maritime lawyer and lobbyist.\n       Sea-Land has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the \n     maritime programs and, in the company's view, a victim as \n     well. The company benefits handsomely by flying the U.S. \n     flag; in fact, its Pentagon contracts make it the country's \n     largest ocean shipper of military goods.\n       But the American flag raises its operating costs because it \n     must pay its crews the higher U.S. union salaries. The firm \n     is not reimbursed directly for those added costs because it \n     is barred from drawing operating subsidies at the same time \n     it holds government shipping contracts.\n\n\n                           flying a new flag\n\n       As military shipping declines, Sea-Land wants the option to \n     switch to operating subsidies. Unless Congress continues the \n     subsidies, Sea-Land president John P. Clancey has warned, his \n     company will ask permission to register its remaining 37 \n     U.S.-flagged ships under foreign flags.\n       It already dropped the Stars and Stripes off five ships in \n     the past year and registered them with the Republic of \n     Marshall Islands. The firm has offered American captains jobs \n     on those ships at a salary of $72,760 for eight months a \n     year. That's roughly 41 percent of what some of them would \n     earn as skippers of U.S.-flag ships.\n       Offers like that are quite disheartening to seamen like \n     Lawrence R. Swink, of Lake Tahoe, Nev., captain of the \n     Performance. ``For those kind of wages they're talking about, \n     I can run a little tour boat and be home with my family every \n     night and watch my children grow up,'' he said.\n       From Swink down to the ship's tattooed cook, the 21 crew \n     members of the Performance know their jobs are on the line. \n     ``I can't argue that the Filipinos won't do it cheaper than \n     me, but I'll tell you one thing,'' Ryan said. ``They won't do \n     it better than me.''\n       ``I can't imagine the U.S. not having a merchant marine,'' \n     said Baden L. Fitzsimmons, the junior engineer, shaking his \n     head.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have to respond to some of this, because \nI think if someone listens to this debate, they get a total \nmisimpression of what we have done in this bill. Let me begin by saying \nI take a back seat to no one on this planet and nobody in the U.S. \nSenate in opposing cargo preference. I have fought it from the first \nday I \n\n[[Page S 14665]]\ncame here. I am going to fight it from here or elsewhere until it is \nultimately eliminated.\n  Let me review the facts. The facts are as follows:\n  President Clinton, despite all this wonderful advice, proposed $175 \nmillion for operating subsidies for the maritime industry. Our \nsubcommittee and our full committee provided not one red cent. We had \nan amendment about which we talked to Members on both sides of the \naisle. Some 14 Republicans were ready to vote for the amendment. It was \nobvious to a blind man that we were going to lose on the amendment and, \nat a late hour, instead of holding the Senate here, we agreed to \nproviding $46 million.\n  Here is the point: As far as I am aware, that is the lowest level of \nsubsidies for the maritime industry since the Second World War. We have \nnever had an appropriations bill in the U.S. Senate since 1946 that cut \nmaritime subsidies as much as this bill cut maritime subsidies.\n  I wanted it to be zero. I oppose these subsidies. But, basically, the \npoint I want people to understand is, the President asked for $175 \nmillion. While the accounts are not comparable, there was $214 million \nprovided last year. Even with the adoption of this amendment, which I \ndo not support, we are only providing $46 million in new subsidies. So \nwe have cut maritime subsidies more than any appropriations bill since \nWorld War II. We have dramatically reduced those subsidies.\n  I share my colleague's righteous indignation. The problem is I have \nsat here all day and fought amendments. I wanted to fight this \namendment, but not only did I have no votes on my side giving me any \nchance of a majority, but many of our colleagues were elsewhere in \ncommittee. I was here on the floor basically making a decision that we \nwere going to lose, and so this amendment was included.\n  To conclude, being repetitive one final time, if somebody wants good \nnews about maritime subsidies, the President proposed $175 million of \noperating subsidies. This final bill provides $46 million, which is a \ndramatic cut and which, as far as I am aware, is the largest cut in \noperating subsidies for the maritime industry since the Second World \nWar.\n  In terms of loan guarantees, the President asked for $52 million, our \ncommittee provided $2 million. This amendment that has been adopted \nadds $25 million to that, providing $27 million. So in an overall \nrequest of nearly a quarter of a billion dollars by President Clinton \nand his administration, after all is said and done, we are providing \n$73 million. If we do this well next year, there will be no maritime \nsubsidy program. That is my point.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas for providing \nthis clarification. It should be pointed out that the Commerce \nCommittee of the U.S. Senate and the National Security Committee of the \nHouse of Representatives, in response to taxpayers' concerns about the \nhigh cost of the operation differential subsidy, came forth with the \nMaritime Security Act. In the Senate, it is S. 1139; in the House, H.R. \n1350.\n  This year, by a unanimous vote in the Senate committee and a \nunanimous vote in the House committee, this act was passed--unanimous \nvote. It is a bipartisan measure. In the U.S. Senate, the chairman of \nthe subcommittee is the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott. I have the \ngreat privilege of serving as the senior Democrat on that committee.\n  As the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice and State just noted, the amounts we are requesting are much, \nmuch less than what has been requested by the President of the United \nStates or what it has cost the taxpayers in the past. It has been \nsuggested that all we would need is 20 vessels, and in so doing, cite \nDesert Storm as an example.\n  We, together with our allies, were exceedingly fortunate because the \nman in charge of Iraq did not have the good sense to do what any \nmilitary commander would have done. He gave us over 6 months to prepare \nourselves, and that is why we were able to ship goods in a rather \nleisurely manner to the Persian Gulf. We were lucky.\n  I think at this juncture I should just briefly point out the history \nof our merchant marine industry.\n  At the end of World War II, we controlled the seven seas. The Russian \nfleet was in the bottom of the ocean. The British fleet did not exist. \nThe German fleet was gone. The Japanese had none. The Chinese had none. \nNo one had ships. We controlled the ocean. If the Japanese wanted to \nship anything, it had to be on an American ship. If the British wanted \nto ship anything, it had to be on an American ship. We controlled the \nseas. But because of our belief in free trade, because of the massive \nprogram we instituted, the Marshall Plan and other programs, we helped \nto build the economies of other lands, including our former enemies. As \na result, at this moment, the U.S. fleet carries less than 4 percent of \nour foreign cargo. We carried over 90 percent and now we carry less \nthan 4 percent. And if you think that 20 would be enough, may I remind \nmy colleagues about the Yom Kippur war. During the Yom Kippur war, the \nEgyptians nearly overran the Israeli forces. They were pushed back to \ntheir borders across the Sinai. And in 30 days, they used up the \nammunition that they had stored for 6 months. We had an agreement with \nthe State of Israel to provide ammunition and supplies. And so we \nlooked around for our ships. Our ships were busy. So we looked to \nAmerican citizens. There were hundreds of American citizens who owned \nships registered in foreign lands, like Liberia and Panama. Most of the \nships registered in Liberia and Panama belong to Americans, hundreds of \nthem. So we called upon them to say that we have an emergency and we \nmust supply the Israeli forces, please provide your ships, make them \navailable to our Defense Department.\n\n  Mr. President, do you know how many ships responded? Do you know how \nmany loyal American citizens responded? Zero. Zero. As a result, we had \nto use our C-5 tankers, the new C-5, and flew cargo into Israel. This \nis not classified now, but two of those C-5s were nearly shot down. \nImagine what would have happened if they were shot down.\n  What I am trying to suggest is that Desert Storm was a good war for \nus, if you want to put it in ``good and bad.'' It was easily discerned \nas to who was bad and who was good. All the allies were with us. Even \nthe Arabs were with us. They made their ships available very happily. \nEven the Japanese came down to the Persian Gulf to help us. But we may \nget involved in something that is not popular, that may not be \nconsidered a good war. And then what would happen?\n  Finally, may I say that every country with a fleet would insist that \ntheir mail--postage--be carried by their ships. The British carry their \nmail to the United States. The Germans carry their mail to the United \nStates. The Russians carry their mail to the United States on their \nfleet. The Japanese insist on that. Even the Arabs insist on carrying \ntheir mail on their ships.\n  We believe in free trade. We put our mail carriage on auction, on \nbid. Who do you think carries our mail across the Atlantic ocean? The \nAmerican fleet? The Polish Steamship Company. I hope we are proud of \nthat. One would think that we would be proud enough to insist that our \nmail with our postage stamps be carried by our fleet. But because we \ninsist upon slowly but surely tearing down our merchant fleet, the day \nwill come when this great and powerful Nation will be blackmailed by \nall these other countries. The day will come and they will say, sorry, \nfolks, we do not want to get involved in this conflict. See, what \nhappened during the Yom Kippur war, Saudi Arabia sent word to Liberia \nand Panama and told the Liberian and Panamanian government, ``If ships \nin your register are used to carry cargo to Israel, we will consider \nthis an unfriendly act.'' That is why zero.\n  That could happen to us again, Mr. President. This is a small \ninvestment.\n  One part of this is the title I one loan guarantee program. A $25 \nmillion investment will generate $500 million in ship building. It is \nabout time we revived our ship building industry.\n  Mr. President, this is a bargain. This has bipartisan support. That \nis why the chairman of this committee, Mr. \n\n[[Page S 14666]]\nGramm, wisely counted the votes, because it is a popular program. It is \nan American program, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the managers of the bill \nagreeing to accept this amendment.\n  The Competitiveness Policy Council [CPC], for which I am recommending \njust $100,000 of support in fiscal year 1996, has just published \nseveral reports which provide thoughtful commentary on our Nation's \neconomy. These reports include three just recently released and titled \n``Lifting All Boats: Increasing the Payoff From Private Investment in \nthe American Economy'' by Harvard Business School professor, Michael \nPorter, and Salomon Inc. chairman, Robert E. Denham; ``U.S. Technology \nPolicy: The Federal Government's Role'' by former Bush administration \nUnder Secretary of Commerce for Technology, Robert White; and ``Saving \nMore and Investing Better,'' which concentrates on raising national \nsavings and improving the way saving is allocated, or invested, in the \nprivate sector.\n  During a time when we are struggling with important decisions about \nthe role of Government in the economy--about what programs should be \ncut back, which should be nurtured--it seems to me that a bipartisan \nCouncil such as CPC, which produces the sorts of high-intellectual \noctane material that directly responds to choices we are making in our \nnational economic framework, should receive our support.\n  The Competitiveness Policy Council, which started operating in 1991, \nwas established as a bipartisan Federal advisory commission. Of the 12 \nmembers, of which 6 are Republicans and 6 are Democrats, 4 are \nappointed by the joint leadership of the House, 4 by the joint leaders \nof the Senate, and 4 by the President. Business, labor, and Government \nas well as public interest groups are equally represented, each group \nhaving three members representing their interests. And when this \ncommission was initiated, the founders had the wisdom to make it a \ncreature of both the legislative and executive branches.\n  The CPC's mission is to develop recommendations to Congress and the \nPresident to improve the productivity and international competitiveness \nof the American economy. And importantly, the Commission provides \ndispassionate analysis of the state of the U.S. international economic \ncompetitiveness, providing a report to the President and Congress on an \nannual basis.\n  At this time, when CPC is issuing important policy reports and has \nothers in the pipeline, it would not be judicious of this body to force \na premature end to the good work and initiatives of this valuable \ncommission. Its capital allocation report, ``Lifting all Boats,'' is \nripe with important recommendations for which the American business \ncommunity will cheer; these recommendations, CPC argues will help \nbusinesses truly organize for the long term, which is also very much in \nthe national economic interest. The CPC may also reconstitute its Trade \nPolicy Subcouncil to focus on regional trade agreements within the \nWestern Hemisphere and the Asia Pacific region and the impact of these \non both the multilateral trading system and American \n\n[[Page S 14667]]\n\n\nliving standards. The need for trade negotiating authority would make \nthis effort timely.\n  Furthermore, the Council has begun work in two other areas: \nregulation and the relationship between Federal and state governments \nand U.S. competitiveness and living standards. I do not need to tell \nany of my colleagues here that $100,000 is modest; but this amount will \nallow the CPC to conclude the important work it has only recently begun \nto release and distribute. I think that many of my colleagues across \nthe aisle can also attest to the quality and lucidity of CPC policy \nanalysis and recommendations.\n  As part of this amendment, I suggest that we pare back, just a bit, \nthe increase that the committee bill proposes for the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration [DEA]. The bill provides the DEA with a 12.4 percent \nincrease, $93 million, above the current year; an amount that surpasses \nthe President's request by $40 million. Specifically, the committee \nbill provides an increase of $10.5 million for Permanent Change of \nStation moves. Last week, $4 million of fiscal year 1995 funds was \nreprogrammed for this very same purpose.\n  Thus, I propose that the $100,000 appropriation for the \nCompetitiveness Policy Council be drawn from the account for Permanent \nChange of Station Moves in the DEA fiscal year 1996 appropriation.\n  Support of the Competitiveness Policy Council at this level of \nfunding should be an easy decision to make. I think that the positive \ncontribution of CPC's work will be returned in many multiples as the \noverall health of our economy benefits from CPC's wise counsel.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                           energy efficiency\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss an amendment I am offering on this appropriations bill. My \namendment encourages agencies funded under the bill to become more \nenergy efficient and directs them to reduce facility energy costs by 5 \npercent. The agencies will report to the Congress at the end of the \nyear on their efforts to conserve energy and will make recommendations \nfor further conservation efforts. I have offered this amendment to \nevery appropriations bill that has come before the Senate this year, \nand it has been accepted to each one.\n  I believe this is a commonsense amendment: The Federal Government \nspends nearly $4 billion annually to heat, cool, and power its 500,000 \nbuildings. The Office of Technology Assistance and the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, a nonprofit group which I chair with Senator Jeffords, estimate \nthat Federal agencies could save $1 billion annually if they would make \nan effort to become more energy efficient and conserve energy.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment will encourage agencies to use \nnew energy savings technologies when making building improvements in \ninsulation, building controls, lighting, heating, and air conditioning. \nThe Department of Energy has made available for government-wide agency \nuse streamlined ``energy saving performance contracts'' procedures, \nmodeled after private sector initiatives. Unfortunately, most agencies \nhave made little progress in this area. This amendment is an attempt to \nget Federal agencies to devote more attention to energy efficiency, \nwith the goal of lowering overall costs and conserving energy.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, this amendment has been accepted to \nevery appropriations bill the Senate has passed this year. I ask that \nmy colleagues support it.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2850\n\n    (Purpose: To require State Department to report on cost savings \ngenerated by extending foreign service officer tours of duty in nations \n    for which the State Department requires two-year language study \n                program, including China, Korea, Japan)\n\n       On page 93, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       And also provided, That by May 31, 1996, the State \n     Department will report to the President and to Congress on \n     potential cost savings generated by extending foreign service \n     officer tours of duty in nations for which the State \n     Department requires two year language study programs, but \n     specifically including China, Korea, and Japan. This study \n     should consider extending terms on the following basis: \n     junior officers from the current two year maximum term to a \n     three-year tour, and mid to senior foreign service officers \n     from the current three year minimum term to four year minimum \n     with a possible employee-initiated one year extension.\n\n\n  Potential costs savings from revised foreign tour of duty guidelines\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have spoken here in the past \nexpressing strong support for the initiative of this Congress to cut \nour Government's Federal budget deficit. But I feel just as strongly \nthat this effort be undertaken in a sensible way that promotes economic \ngrowth where it can, and at all costs, does not actually cause the \neconomic welfare of our citizens to worsen.\n  One of the steps that our Government can take to both cut spending \nand promote economic growth would be to better leverage the investment \nwe make in our Foreign Service officers stationed in Embassies and \nconsulates abroad. Presently, all levels of Foreign Service officers \nreceive language training for non-English language speaking posts to \nwhich they are sent. Our personnel assigned to nations that use \nChinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic languages receive, at Government \nexpense, 2 years of language training. All other language programs \noffered are 1-year programs.\n  I strongly support the training of our foreign service personnel so \nthat we have a culturally literate team of American representatives \npursuing our interests abroad.\n  But it does seem to me that we could be doing more both to enhance \nour ability to pursue American political and economic interests abroad \nand give the taxpayer more return on his investment if we revised our \nguidelines for the length of assignment for our foreign service \nofficers.\n  Presently, the State Department does not make a distinction between \nthe terms of duty in those nations for which we provide 2 years of \nlanguage training as opposed to 1 year. We also don't have a framework \nthat allows us to provide longer-term assignments in those nations, \nparticularly in Asia, that are relationship-based and are of \nsignificant consequence to America's trade and economic agenda.\n  Junior foreign service officers--regardless of whether they had 1 or \n2 years of language training--remain in their foreign assignment just 2 \nyears. Mid- to senior-level foreign service officers are assigned for 3 \nyears, and can, at their own initiative, extend their assignment for 1 \nadditional year. I think that we can get more return on our investment \nby extending the assignments for junior foreign service officers, who \nare assigned to a country for which we require a 2-year program. These \ncountries would include China, Korea, and Japan which, of course, have \nvery high priority on our Nation's economic radar.\n  I also believe that mid- to senior-level foreign officers should have \ntheir assignments lengthened from 3 to 4 years in these high-priority \nnations, and continue to have the personal option of extending an extra \nyear.\n  I think that this framework makes good common sense and should not be \na controversial matter. I would like to request that the State \nDepartment study this proposal that I have briefly outlined and report \nback to the Congress and to the President by May 31, 1996 on the cost \nsavings that such a plan would generate. I also think that America \nwould further its own interests by allowing those who develop good \nnetworks and cultural literacy in key nations to remain in place for \nlonger periods of time.\n  If there was a message that I heard from those staffing our overseas \nposts it was that we pull our people out just when they were figuring \nout the lay of the land. I think that the State Department may find \nthat revising their foreign assignment guidelines, particularly in \nassignments in which our taxpayers have made considerable investments \nin language training, would make good sense.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2851\n\n (Purpose: To require a report to the Congress on the Doppler weather \n   surveillance radar located on Sulphur Mountain in Ventura County, \n                              California)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section.\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, my amendment prohibits the authorization \nof funds to privatize the Federal prison facilities located at Yazoo \nCity, MS, and Forrest City, AR.\n  Mr. President, recent administration proposals regarding the \nprivatization of Federal prison facilities has created a unique problem \nfor Federal prison facilities located in Yazoo City, MS, and Forrest \nCity, AR. I offer this amendment today as a fair and equitable solution \nto allow the Federal Government to meet its obligations to two \ncommunities while not impeding the policy objectives of the \nadministration.\n  Quite a few years ago, a small community in my home State, Yazoo \nCity, and a similar community in Arkansas, called Forrest City, \ncompeted with many other communities in our region of the country to \nsite Federal prison facilities in their communities. Yazoo City and \nForrest City were successful in their efforts. Each community now has a \nlow and minimum security Federal prison facility ready to begin \noperation in early 1996.\n  The two facilities are similar in other ways, also. Each site has \nland and infrastructure in place to accommodate additional medium and \nhigh security facilities which the Bureau of Prisons had indicated were \na very real possibility for the future. Both communities made \nsubstantial financial investments to enhance their respective sites \nwith the understanding that doing so would increase their chances of \ngaining additional facilities.\n  The Clinton administration's budget contained a directive that the \nBureau of Prisons privatize ``the majority of future pretrial \ndetention, minimum and low security Federal prisons.'' Low and minimum \nsecurity facilities built on the same site as medium and high security \nfacilities are exempt from this proposal.\n  Mr. President all of us understand and many of us support the policy \nobjectives of the privatization effort. However, I submit that the \nfacilities located at Yazoo City, MS and Forrest City, AR do not \nqualify as future facilities and are thus not appropriate candidates \nfor privatization.\n  First, the administration directed the privatization of future \nminimum and low security prisons. The facilities in Yazoo City and \nForrest City are by no means future facilities. The Federal Government \nshook hands with the officials in these two communities many years ago. \nEach of these communities made substantial financial investments and \nentered contractual obligations based on the Government's agreement to \nsite a federally run facility on their sites. To privatize these \nfacilities at this point would be breaking a commitment to two \ncommunities who welcomed and supported the Government's decision to \nlocate facilities among them. The terms of the agreement between the \nFederal Government and the citizens of these two communities must not \nbe broken at this 11th hour.\n\n  Second, privatization of these facilities will preclude these \ncommunities from being able to compete on an equal footing with other \ncommunities for higher security Federal prison facilities. The policy \nof the Bureau of Prisons and the administration prohibits the locating \nof federally run and privately run facilities on the same site. It is \nalso the administration's policy not to allow the privatization of \nmedium and high security Federal prisons because of the concern of \nmaintaining security and safety of the facilities and surrounding \ncommunities. The administration's own policy dictates that the \nprivatization of the Yazoo City and Forrest City minimum security \nfacilities will forever preclude the location of higher security \nfacilities on those sites. The environmental studies and improvements \nnecessary to accommodate higher facilities at these sites are already \ncomplete. To deny these communities the opportunity to eventually \ncompete for higher facilities would be a disastrous waste of time and \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, these two communities entered a contract with the \nFederal Government in good faith and have made expenditures to uphold \ntheir obligations under that contract. We only ask that the Federal \nGovernment do the same. Privatization of these two facilities is a \nbreach of the faith of these communities and violation of a contractual \nobligation.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment as a fair solution to a \nunique situation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2854\n\n       On page 74, 18, after ``Fund'', strike the period and \n     insert the following: ``, and of which $1,200,000 shall be \n     available for continuation of the program to integrate energy \n     efficient building technology with the use of structural \n     materials made from underutilized or waste products.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2855\n\n (Purpose: To clarify language for providing funding for the National \n                         Maritime Heritage Act)\n\n       Page 117, line 5 is amended by inserting after \n     ``academies'' and before the colon, the following: ``and may \n     be transferred to the Secretary of Interior for use as \n     provided in the National Maritime Heritage Act (P.L. 103-\n     451).''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2856\n\n (Purpose: To make available funds for the Tenth Paralympiad games for \n                     individuals with disabilities)\n\n       On page 110, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 405.

Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nmanagers for their assistance in the adoption of this very important \namendment. Next summer, the city of Atlanta will host the Tenth \nParalympiad. This event will draw 119 countries and 3,500 world-class \nathletes with physical disabilities to the United States to complete in \nthe largest global summit on disability. Leaders from the international \ndisability community will observe the progress made in the country on \ndisability policy first hand.\n  This amendment will allow the Director of the United States \nInformation Agency (USIA) to direct $5 million of the funds \nappropriated to USIA for the Tenth Paralympiad. Since 1994 USIA has \nbeen encouraged to promote events and activities involving individuals \nwith disabilities. The passage of this bi-partisan amendment is in \nkeeping with the purpose of USIA.\n  With the adoption of this amendment, international awareness will be \nincreased, but more importantly it will be a chance to showcase \nAmerican leadership in opportunities for people with disabilities.\n  I strongly encourage the Senates conferees to retain this amendment \nduring the House Senate conference next month, and I thank the managers \nonce again.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment is important in many ways, \nand I am proud to join my colleague from Georgia in bringing this \nmatter to the attention of the U.S. \n\n[[Page S 14669]]\nSenate. As many Americans know, the Centennial Olympic games will begin \nin Atlanta on July 19, 1996, and conclude on August 4. Many people do \nnot know, however, that just 12 days after the conclusion of the 1996 \nSummer Olympics, another sporting event of great magnitude will begin. \nThe Paralympic opening ceremony will be held August 16 and over the \nnext 12 days more than 3,500 athletes from 119 nations will compete in \n19 different sports. This will be the largest gathering of people with \ndisabilities ever assembled anywhere in the world.\n  The origins of the Paralympic movement goes back to 1946 when Sir \nLudwig Guttman organized the International Wheelchair Games to coincide \nwith the 1948 London Olympics. Since that time, the official Paralympic \norganization has been established, and the Paralympic Games have been \nheld nine times in nine countries across the globe. The 1996 Atlanta \nparalympics will mark the tenth and largest gathering with an expected \n1.5 million spectators. Over the years, the Paralympics have expanded \nfrom wheelchair athletes to include amputees, the blind, those with \ncerebral palsy, dwarfs and those with a variety of other physical \nlimitations.\n  In 1994, Congress expanded the U.S. Information Agency's mission to \ninclude direction to promote exchange and training activities on \ndisability matters. This American leadership has helped to create \ninternational visibility and awareness of disability concerns and has \nencouraged and reinforced the provision of opportunity for people with \ndisabilities around the world. The Paralympics gives people with \ndisabilities not only the right, but the opportunity to show what they \nare able to do.\n  Consider, for example, Ajibola Adoye, a Nigerian runner who, despite \nthe amputation of one arm, ran faster than the fastest, able-bodied \nrunner in his country in the 1992 Olympic Games. The Paralympics lets \nathletes like Ajibola Adoye represent their countries in international \ncompetition at the Olympic level. While many events have been modified \nin certain ways to accomodate the disabilities of the participants, \namazingly, many Paralympic athletes still remain competitive in \nstandard Olympic events.\n  In addition to celebrating the outstanding talents and achievements \nof disabled athletes, next summer's Paralympiad also serves another \nimportant function. It will serve as an international forum, bringing \nleaders in the international disability community to Atlanta to address \nissues vital to the disabled worldwide. Developments in disability-\nrelated technology and public policy in the United States and \nother nations will be highlighted. The Paralympiad is an unprecedented \nchance to showcase American leadership in creating opportunities for \npeople With disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act is just \none example of such leadership.\n\n  The United State is a leader in the development of prosthetic \nequipment and disability health care. U.S. Paralympic athletes will \nmake use of the most state-of-the-art prosthetic equipment when they \ncompete in the games. Regrettably, much of this equipment is \nunavailable to the developing nations. The experience of many countries \ntorn by war and conflict, where many people, including children, have \nlost limbs from land mines and other weapons of war, demonstrates the \npressing need for advanced prosthetic devices. The Paralympiad brings \nrepresentatives of those countries to the United States to see our \nlatest developments and fosters their export to the world.\n  A fundamental goal of U.S. disability-related public policy has been \nto foster increased economic independence among the disabled. Sport is \nan established pathway for the disabled to reach self-sufficiency, \nhelping to break the expectation of life-long dependence among the \ndisabled. It is also a powerful tool to change attitudes among the \ngeneral public. We know that changing attitudes is more effective than \nmandating behavior. The impact of watching a sprinter run less than \ntwo-seconds off Carl Lewis' pace on two prosthetic legs can change the \nway the world perceives the abilities of people with disabilities.\n  By bringing many of the disabled from around the world to the United \nStates, this one event will do more to communicate our achievements and \ncommitment to ensuring opportunity than holding a number of smaller-\nscale individual exchanges, which would be considerably more expensive. \nI believe the types of exchange activities envisioned by the Paralympic \nOrganizing Committee are perfectly consistent with the USIA mandate.\n  Last year, the Congress saw fit to appropriate $1.5 million in USIA \nfunding for the Paralympics games. This amendment, if adopted, would \nreserve $5 million from the USIA's general accounts for the Paralympic \nGames. It is consistent with the report language adopted by both the \nHouse and Senate Appropriations Committees which urged ``that support \nbe increased for this program to the maximum extent possible within the \nresources provided, since this is the year the program will take \nplace.''\n  This funding would help support the international exchange events \ncentered around the competition, including the international forum on \ndisability, adaptive technology displays, as well as follow-through \ndissemination of materials and information. In addition, every Federal \ndollar is expected to attract at least $8 of private support. Let me \nalso add that funding is contingent upon satisfactory compliance with \nfinancial oversight and reporting procedures just like any Federal \ncontract. If the Paralympic Organizing Committee does not comply, USIA \nmay exercise its discretion not to release any of this funding.\n  The 1996 Paralympiad presents an unparalleled opportunity for \ncultural exchange and education. The Paralympics has never before been \nhosted by a country with a comprehensive disability rights law, and \ninternational expectations could not be higher. Leaders from around the \nworld will be drawn to witness the progress the United States has made \nin the inclusion of those with physical disabilities. I am pleased to \nsupport this measure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge other Members to vote for this \namendment to provide $5 million for cultural and educational exchange \nactivities at the 1996 Paralympics in Georgia.\n  The Paralympics have grown significantly in size and popularity, yet \nstill do not have the liability to get corporate support that the \nOlympics have--1996 will be one of the largest gatherings of disabled \nathletes in history, and the money provided in this amendment will \nallow for the full and open exchange of ideas and information by \ndisabled persons from around the world.\n  I believe that our country has been a leader in ensuring access and \nequality for disabled individuals, and we should capitalize on this \nimportant opportunity at the 1996 games to share what we have done and \nto learn from others.\n  This appropriation has been authorized by legislation crafted by \nSenator Dole, section 242 of the Foreign Relations Authorizations Act \n(P.L. 103-236), which was passed last year\n  I strongly support the goals and spirit of the Paralympics and urge \nmy colleagues to do the same by voting for this amendment which I have \ncosponsored with Senators Coverdell and Nunn.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2857\n\n (Purpose: To provide that voter registration cards may not be used as \nproof of citizenship.

Mr. President, this amendment makes a technical \ncorrection to the bill's current language appropriating funds for the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program, known in short as SCAAP.\n  I was very pleased last year to be part of a bipartisan group of \nSenators who introduced legislation to establish SCAAP, which was \nultimately made part of the crime bill. SCAAP was established in \nrecognition of the burden placed on State and local governments by the \nFederal Government's failure to control illegal immigration, when State \nand local governments then find themselves faced with the high cost of \nincarcerating persons who enter this country illegally and are later \nconvicted of felonies.\n  Unfortunately, a glitch in the appropriations language prevented \nSCAAP from completely fulfilling its purpose--contrary to SCAAP, local \ngovernments were excluded from reimbursement. Even more unfortunately, \nthis mistake has been replicated in the appropriations bill which we \nnow have before us.\n  Specifically, this appropriations bill, like last year's \nappropriations bill, provides that the funds appropriated for SCAAP \nshall be available as authorized by section 501 of the Immigration \nReform and Control Act of 1986 [IRCA], rather than as authorized by \nSCAAP itself, which was enacted as section 242(j) of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, as part of the 1994 Crime Act.\n  Section 501 of IRCA only provides for reimbursement to States, not to \nlocalities. The reference to IRCA, in effect, means that only States \nand not localities would be reimbursed for their costs from not only \nthe $130 million in fiscal year 1995 SCAAP funds, but also the $300 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996 funds that would be appropriated under this \nbill.\n  It is important to note that not only is the reference to IRCA \ninconsistent with SCAAP itself, it is also inconsistent with the \ncommittee's own report, which references the Crime Bill, not IRCA.\n  My amendment would correct this apparent error and eliminate this \ninconsistency.\n  It also would ensure that all States and localities would be \nequitably reimbursed for their combined fiscal years 1995 and 1996 \ncosts at the same percentage rate.\n  Therefore, it corrects for any inequities in the allocation of fiscal \nyear 1995 SCAAP funds to States as well as to localities. It is \nnoteworthy that, because fiscal year 1995 was the first year of the \nSCAAP program, there necessarily would be start-up delays in setting up \nprocedures to identify criminal alien inmates whose costs are \nreimbursable. My amendment would ensure that States which could not \nidentify all, or most, of their allowable costs before fiscal year 1995 \nallotments were made, would not be penalized.\n  It is also important to note, Mr. President, that this amendment \nneither increases nor reduces the amount of money appropriated for \nSCAAP, but only affects who can access that money.\n  In expanding access to that money to local governments, we are: \nFirst, furthering the goal of Senators who wish to send authority away \nfrom the Federal Government, by allowing for direct grants to the level \nof government closest to the people, local government: and second, \nremoving a level of bureaucracy by not making localities go through \nState governments.\n  This amendment has important, real-world consequences. Many \nlocalities, especially in California, have been hurt more by illegal \nimmigration than have many States.\n  In Los Angeles County, for example, based on the preliminary results \nof a joint County-INS effort to identify deportable criminal aliens in \nthe county's jail system, the percentage of all county jail inmates who \nare deportable criminal aliens has increased to 17 percent from 11 \npercent in May 1990.\n  The growing impact of criminal aliens on the county's criminal \njustice system not only imposes a major financial burden on the county, \nwhich must finance the costs, but also endangers the public's safety.\n  Because of the county's major budget problems, which have been \nworsened by the impact of criminal aliens, the county had to close \nthree of its jail facilities earlier this year. As a result, many \ncriminals, who, otherwise, would be incarcerated, now are on the \nstreets of Los Angeles.\n  I am pleased to report that this amendment is supported by the \nNational Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, cities throughout the country, including New \nYork City and Chicago, and by local governments throughout the State of \nCalifornia.\n  I therefore urge my fellow Senators to support their cities, \ncounties, and towns, and vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2860\n\n       On page 85, line 14 add the following new section:\n       Sec. 207. None of the funds appropriated under this Act or \n     any other law shall be used to implement subsections (a), \n     (b), (c), (e), (g), or (i) of section 4 of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973, (16 U.S.C. 1533) until such time as \n     legislation reauthorizing the Act is enacted or until the end \n     of fiscal year 1996, whichever is earlier, except that monies \n     appropriated under this Act may be used to delist or \n     reclassify species pursuant to subsections 4(a)(2)(B), \n     4(c)(2)(B)(i), and 4(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is identical \nto a provision included in the Senate's fiscal year 1996 Interior \nappropriations bill. The Senate bill included language that prohibits \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from listing species, and \ndesignating critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. Like the \nInterior provision, the amendment I offer today allows the Secretary to \ncontinue to implement recovery plans for listed species, implement 4(d) \nrules, de-list, downlist, and remove species from the list altogether. \nIn other words, this amendment would place a time out on further \nlistings under the act until a reauthorization is enacted into law, or \nuntil the end of fiscal year 1996.\n  The majority of the Senate voted earlier this year to support a \nsimilar amendment to the Department of Defense Supplemental \nAppropriations bill. The Senate voted 60-38 to adopt the Hutchison \namendment that effectively placed a moratorium on the listing of \nspecies under the act by rescinding funds from the Fish and Wildlife \nService listing account.\n  The House Commerce, State, Justice bill zeroed out the ESA listing \naccount, but did not include bill language backing up its decision not \nto fund the listing account. I believe that the amendment I offer \ntoday, while some Senators may not support it, will give the \nadministration support to fend off potential lawsuits down the road, \npossibly demanding that it list one species or another.\n  Unlike the House bill, my amendment does not reduce funds for any of \nthe ESA accounts funded within the Department of Commerce.\n  This amendment is not an attempt to put off forever the debate on \nreauthorization of the ESA. To the contrary, this Senator desperately \nwants to see the ESA reauthorized. Senator Johnston and I have \nintroduced legislation to amend and reauthorize the act, and we hope \nthat the Senate will take up legislation to reauthorize the act \nsometime this Fall. As many of you know, \n\n[[Page S 14671]]\nCongressmen Young and Pombo recently introduced legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives to reauthorize the act.\n  What this amendment does is to ensure that both the Secretary of \nInterior and the Secretary of Commerce--both of whom have jurisdiction \nover implementation of the ESA--are implementing the law consistently. \nIf the full committee adopts my amendment, both Secretaries will be \nheld to the same standard--to implement a time out on further listings \nunder the act.\n  The amendment places a prohibition on the use of funds for the \nimplementation of subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), (g), or (i) of \nsection 4 of the Endangered Species Act, until legislation \nreauthorizing the act is enacted or until the end of fiscal year 1996, \nwhichever comes first. Essentially this provision prohibits the listing \nof species and the designation of its critical habitat.\n  This amendment allows funds to be used to determine whether or not a \nspecies should be removed from the list, delisted, or downlisted from \nits current status. (Pursuant to subsections 4(a)(2)(B), 4(c)(B)(i), \nand 4(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the act.)\n  These subsections specifically allow for the following actions:\n  Funds may be used to implement subsection 4(a)(2)(B) that allows the \nSecretary to remove a species from the list pursuant to subsection (c) \n(the provisions cited below), or to be changed in status from \nendangered to threatened.\n  Funds may be used to implement subsection 4(c)(2)(B)(i) that would \nallow the Secretary to remove a species from the list. In other words, \nwhether or not a species should be delisted.\n  Funds may also be used to implement subsection 4(c)(2)(B)(ii) that \nwould allow the Secretary to determine whether a species should be \nchanged in status from an endangered species to a threatened species. \nIn other words, whether or not the species should be down listed.\n  Funds may be used by the Secretary to implement subsection 4(d) that \nwould allow the Secretary to issue protective regulations for \nthreatened species. This is what is commonly known as a 4(d) rule, \nwhich, as many of you may know, has been used by this administration in \nan attempt to provide protection for threatened species, and a degree \nof flexibility for landowners.\n  Funds may be used by the Secretary to implement subsection 4(f) that \nwould allow the Secretary to continue to implement recovery plans for \nalready listed threatened and endangered species.\n  Funds may be used by the Secretary to implement subsection 4(h) that \nallows the Secretary to issue agency guidelines, and adhere to notice \nand public comment requirements.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2861\n\n    (Purpose: To provide funds for the Community Relations Service)\n\n       On page 12, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n                      Community Relations Service\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Community Relations Service, \n     established by title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n     $10,638,000: Provided, That such additional funds as may be \n     necessary for the resettlement of Cuban and Haitian entrants \n     shall be available to the Community Relations Service, \n     without fiscal year limitation, to be reimbursed from the \n     Immigration Examinations Fee Account: Provided further, That, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the funds \n     made available pursuant to this Act under the heading \n     ``Federal Bureau of Investigation, Salaries and Expenses,'' \n     shall be reduced by $11,170,000.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2862\n\n       Page 19, strike line 7 through line 17 and insert the \n     following: Provided further, That the Office of Public \n     Affairs at the Immigration Naturalization Service shall \n     conduct its business in areas only relating to its central \n     mission, including: research, analysis, and dissemination of \n     information, through the media and other communications \n     outlets, relating to the activities of the Immigration \n     Naturalization Service: Provided further, That the Office of \n     Congressional Relations at the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service shall conduct business in areas only relating to its \n     central mission, including: providing services to Members of \n     Congress relating to constituent inquiries and requests for \n     information; and working with the relevant Congressional \n     committees on proposed legislation affecting immigration \n     matters.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2863\n\n     (Purpose: To make available funds for the International Labor \n                             Organization)\n\n       Before the period at the end of the paragraph under the \n     heading contributions to international organizations'', \n     insert the following: ``: Provided further, That funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available under this heading \n     may be available for the International Labor Organization''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould allow for continued participation by the United States in the \nInternational Labor Organization, or the ILO.\n  The report language for this bill recommends prohibiting the use of \nappropriated funds to pay for U.S. membership in the ILO. This was the \nposition stated in the State Department authorization bill introduced \nearlier this year.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support U.S. withdrawal from what I believe \nto be one of the more effective specialized agencies of the United \nNations, the ILO.\n  Our amendment is budget neutral--it simply allows that funds \nappropriated under the international organizations account may be made \navailable for the ILO.\n  I am honored to be joined in this effort by the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, Senator Moynihan. Senator Moynihan probably knows more \nof the history of the ILO than any individual in this body. My esteemed \ncolleague wrote his dissertation on the ILO 35 years ago. He was the \nchairman of the hearings held on the five conventions passed since \n1988, and was the floor manager for the ratification debates. I have \nalways been grateful that we could work together to strengthen our \nnation's role in the ILO.\n  I am also pleased to have as cosponsors of this amendment Senators \nStevens, Jeffords, Pell, Harkin, Sarbanes.\n  Because the ILO represents one of the most solid collaborations to \naddress international human rights that has ever been \ninstitutionalized, support for it has always been bipartisan.\n  But today some are reconsidering the utility of the ILO. Perhaps part \nof the reason is because it is associated with the U.N., which has done \nmuch to earn criticism in recent years.\n  I remind my colleagues, however, that the ILO--and U.S. participation \nin it--precedes the creation of the United Nations. When the United \nNations was formed, the ILO had been around for a quarter of a century. \nThe ILO became the United Nations first specialized agency.\n  The ILO was founded as an organization that would represent \ngovernments, labor, and employers in a mission to improve the working \nconditions of people worldwide.\n  This exceptional international organization works to accomplish these \ngoals by, first, setting international standards in the form of \nconventions and recommendations that it supervises; second, supporting \neconomic development, including employment creation, through technical \nassistance programs; third, analyzing workplace problems and issues \nthrough research; and fourth, highlighting workplace abuses through \npublic criticism.\n  The ILO is based on a system of compliance: with its conventions, \nwhich are similar to treaties, and with its recommendations, which are \npolicy guidelines.\n  It uses persuasion, not confrontation, to effect the improvement of \nlabor standards worldwide. Where it challenges abuses of men, women, or \nchildren in the workplace, it operates with what has been referred to \nas ``the mobilization of shame.''\n  As such, the ILO is as much a human rights organization as it is an \norganization to promote labor standards.\n  And this is an important point, Mr. President. It is worthwhile \nnoting that, because it combines technical assistance programs for \ndeveloping employment and maintaining labor standards with its annual \ncriticisms of abuses of workers, the ILO has been called the most \neffective human rights organization in the world.\n  Some have questioned the relevance of the ILO in today's world, \nquestioning its structure and role.\n  But five former secretaries of labor--3 from Republican \nadministrations, 2 from Democratic administrations--\n\n[[Page S 14672]]\nhave spoken out recently in favor of continuing support for the ILO. \nEvery secretary of labor has credited the ILO with defending and \nimproving labor conditions worldwide.\n  I believe that the on-going mission of the ILO is more important \ntoday than ever before, and that its tripartite approach--involving \nprivate sector business and labor representatives alongside \ngovernments--is the strength that makes the ILO extremely relevant \naround the world.\n  Throughout central Europe, for example, we are seeing a remarkable \ntransition from centrally planned economies to democratic marketplaces. \nIf the economic transition falters, we know that political stability \nwill be threatened.\n  But the shift has created an incredible challenge to those societies \nin terms of accepting new norms of behavior and exchange. We cannot \nignore the suspicions that many in the region still hold about \ncapitalism--suspicions driven by old, socialist mentalities or new \ninsecurities as a result of economic dislocation.\n  The ILO's tripartite structure--demonstrating the compatibility and \nprogress that come when governments, labor, and employers work \ntogether--provides the best credibility to societies who have \npreviously held antagonistic views toward such voluntary cooperation.\n  This credibility allows the ILO to participate in helping to \nestablish the labor standards in countries where governments may be \nreluctant, businesses may be suspicious and labor may be exploited. \nThis credibility drawn from its tripartite approach helps secure the \neconomic institutions necessary for these countries to succeed as free-\nmarket democracies.\n  In central Europe, the ILO was there during the dark days, and its \ndedicated support of Solidarity under communism is perhaps its best \nknown case. The historic role the ILO played in supporting Solidarity \nduring its years underground is still credited by international \ndemocrats as critical in the triumph of democracy in that country.\n  But its role continues now that these countries have come into the \nlight of freedom and the ILO works to institutionalize the values we \nbelieve make the marketplace fair and benign. President Lech Walesa has \nappealed to the leaders of the Senate to continue their support for the \nILO, which President Walesa says ``operates on behalf of all those who \nhave been fighting tyranny around the world.'' I completely agree with \nPresident Walesa when he says that ``The future of the ILO without the \nengagement of your country is difficult to imagine.''\n  The ILO addresses the most driving dynamic within and among nations \ntoday: the relentless need for economic development.\n  Among developing countries in particular, the need for economic \ndevelopment is the single factor that determines whether these \ncountries can maintain social stability and political evolution. And \nthe most important component in economic development is job creation. \nWhen nations can't create jobs for their people, poverty and \ninstability result.\n  Over the past decades, nations around the world have recognized that \ntrade promotes growth and employment.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong believer in free trade. For developed \nnations, trade with the less developed world is increasingly a factor \nthat drives our economies. But we know that amidst our debates on free \nand open trade remains the concern of competing with low-wage \neconomies, where--and we must concur with the critics of free trade \nhere--the lack of labor standards can contribute to unfair advantages.\n  In this country, we have wrestled and debated over this issue \nrecently during the NAFTA and GATT debates. I am very sympathetic to \nthis criticism, Mr. President. I have always thought that we can take \ntwo approaches to this question: We can either restrict our trade with \ndeveloping nations, which I believe would be extremely \ncounterproductive--both for us and for them. Or we can address the \nissues of labor practices in a productive way.\n  In addressing the issue of unfair labor practices, we have two \napproaches. We can seek to force labor standards on trading partners \nthrough unilateral confrontation and linkages, which I believe can be \ncounterproductive and could lead to increases in protectionism.\n  Or we can work with these nations to raise their standards.\n  The ILO provides the multilateral forum where we can work with \nnations to improve labor conditions. It is the only international \norganization that can serve this critical challenge.\n  Since its inception in 1919, the ILO has set international standards \nfor labor conditions. These standards have been incorporated into \nnational legislation throughout the world, including, for example, our \nTrade Act of 1974, which uses standards defined by the ILO.\n  I believe that by continuing to support the ILO we have the best \nmechanism to promote labor standards in the developing world, thereby \nsupporting fair trade. The ILO works for us so that we do not suffer \nthe disadvantages of competing with nations who believe they can \ncontinue to abuse their labor populations for profit.\n  Mr. President, I must stress that the ILO has strong labor and \nbusiness support in this country.\n  The U.S Council for International Business, which is an affiliate of \nthe International Chamber of Commerce and represents U.S. business in \nthe ILO, has been very outspoken about the need for our continued \nsupport for the ILO: In a letter it has sent to Members of this body, \nit has argued, and I quote:\n\n       ``For American businesses, there are three critical reasons \n     why the United States should continue its participation in \n     the ILO:\n       To support its technical assistance and employment policy \n     activities, which promote job creation, enterprise \n     development, and flexible labor markets, thus reducing \n     protectionism encountered by American companies in developing \n     countries and newly emerging economies.\n       To ensure that American companies continue to have a voice \n     in setting international labor standards that have an impact \n     on their operations and profitability.\n       To promote the rights of workers and oversee adherence to \n     good labor practices, which we believe is an acceptable \n     alternative to using trade sanctions to promote these rights.\n\n  As the Business Roundtable said in a recent statement to Congress: . \n. . the United States should upgrade its participation in the ILO . . . \nrather than seek to address international labor standards in the World \nTrade Organization.\n  The ILO plays a role in employment creation, institution building, \nand the promotion of trade. With its research programs, the ILO \nprovides highly technical information on labor and employment trends \nand issues. With its many programs of technical assistance, the ILO \nprovides on-the-ground programs to help advance labor law, design \nsocial security schemes, establish employer associations, and provide \nindustrial retraining. And by promoting its labor standards, the ILO \nworks to ensure that the labor content of the goods and services \nflowing within and among nations meets minimum standards.\n  Some have argued that such programs are just a taxpayer supported \nmeans for imposing labor and social policies on other nations that do \nnot even serve low-skilled workers in the United States.\n  But the ILO does not impose. It offers flexibility in working with \nother nations under the aim of promoting fully minimally international \nlabor standards. Its goal is to ensure that U.S. industry--and U.S. \nworkers--will not be displaced because other countries gain unfair \ntrade advantages through labor exploitation.\n  Mr. President, the ILO is the voice for freedom of association, \nfreedom from forced labor, equality of treatment in employment, and the \nelimination of child labor.\n  We should speak with this voice, Mr. President, because the ILO \nrepresents our values.\n  We believe in human rights, Mr. President, and we believe that we \nmust work to improve human rights around the world. In promoting human \nrights, it has always been difficult to achieve the balance between \nidealistic pronouncements and practical policies. The ILO achieves this \nbalance in practice. \n\n[[Page S 14673]]\n\n  Every year, during its annual conference, the ILO levels its \ncriticism against nations that violate workers' rights. In this year's \nconference, the governments of Nigeria and Burma were singled out. In \nthe past, Bangladesh, China, Cuba have been criticized for violations. \nMr. President, the abuses in these nations are our concerns.\n  The ILO estimates that as many as 200 million children worldwide are \nworking in jobs that are dangerous, unhealthy and inhumane. The ILO has \nresponded with its International Program on the Elimination of Child \nLabor, for which Congress appropriated $2.1 million grant in 1994. This \nprogram has initiated global research to develop a comprehensive \nstatistical rendering of the extent of this problem. But the ILO has \ngone beyond research to work on implementing solutions: It set \nstandards on minimum age for employment in its Convention No. 138. And \nit works with other international organizations to address these \ncritical problems.\n  For example:\n  In Pakistan, ILO involvement has contributed to that country \nabolishing its bonded labor system and discharging all bonded labor \nfrom any obligation. The ILO continues to monitor the situation of \nchild labor in that country.\n  In Bangladesh, the ILO recently played a key role in getting \ngovernment and producers to monitor new regulations limiting the use of \nchildren in the carpet industries and providing alternate education \nprograms. This recent development resulted in the U.S. Child Labor \nCoalition calling off a planned boycott.\n  Mr. President, the abuse of children in the workplace around the \nworld is a concern to most Americans. The ILO is working on solutions.\n  Through most of this country's association with the ILO, it has had \nbipartisan support. It has had the support of all U.S. Secretaries of \nLabor since our entry in 1934. It has the support of AFL-CIO. It has \nthe support of the U.S. Council for International Business. How much \nmore bipartisan can you get?\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is important, in this day, to mention \nbudgets. The administration requested $64 million to pay this year's \ncontribution to the ILO.\n  Every Member in this Congress has had to face unpleasant choices \nabout cutting budgets. I do not believe that our international \nactivities should be immune from such considerations. Our international \ncontributions are going to have to be subject to the same fiscal \nrestraints we will be applying to our domestic programs. Following on \nlast week's Foreign Operations bill, where we successfully scaled back \nsome of our international obligations, the figures in this bill clearly \nrepresent this hard-headed approach.\n  I am very pleased to note that the ILO has recognized the realities \nwe must face and that, in their June conference, they began to discuss \nfurther cost-saving measures to compensate for expected shortfalls.\n  One last assurance for those who are still reticent to support the \nILO. The United States is not bound by any of its conventions unless we \nchoose to ratify them. The U.S. cedes none of its sovereignty to the \nILO. We bow to no decision, pronouncement, or convention with which we \ndisagree or which are not in our country's interests.\n  But, in fact, the ILO can play a key role in facilitating American \nvalues abroad; it is an organization for promoting our values.\n  Mr. President, infusing all our debates these days is how to \nparticipate in a post-Cold War world. One of the questions we must face \nis: how should we work with international organizations? This is an \nespecially critical question, considering the overreliance some hold \nfor multilateral approaches to everything from war-making to \npeacekeeping.\n  Mr. President, when I think of which international organizations we \nshould support, the answer is simple: Those that promote our values and \nour goals. The International Labor Organization is such an \norganization.\n  It promotes our values of fairness and human rights in the work \nplace. It promotes our goals to improve the economic conditions of \nnations around the world, because it promotes our belief that economic \ngrowth is a positive-sum game, and when workers benefit in one part of \nthe world, we all benefit.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Senator Hatch, in offering \nthis hugely important amendment. Senator Hatch and I have worked \ntogether on matters related to the International Labor Organization for \na decade now, and we believe it would be a serious error for the United \nStates to withdraw from participation in the ILO at this time.\n  The Senator from Utah does not raise this issue lightly, nor does the \nSenator from New York. Senator Hatch's concern grows in part from his \nexperience with the ILO during his tenure as chairman of the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources in the mid-1980's. In 1985, he held a \nhearing to consider whether there was a link between the failure of the \nUnited States to ratify ILO conventions and our influence within the \nILO.\n  The Senator from New York has also had an abiding interest in the ILO \nfor many years. In 1975, while serving as our Ambassador to the United \nNations under President Ford, it fell to me to draft the letter \nannouncing our intention to withdraw from the ILO after a mandatory 2-\nyear notice period. Later, on July 19, 1977, I rose on this floor to \nannounce our intention to do just that. And again on September 25, \n1980, after the ILO had met the conditions we laid down, I informed the \nSenate of our return to the organization.\n  I would also note that I wrote my doctoral dissertation on the \nhistory of U.S. involvement in the ILO from 1889 to 1934.\n  The Senator from Utah and I have taken the floor to suggest, before \nthe Senate acts to abruptly terminate U.S. participation in the \nInternational Labor Organization, that we carefully consider how and \nwhy we came to participate in the first place. The history of the ILO \ngoes a long way back in our national life, before it finally came to \nfruition at the end of the Great War. The premise of the ILO as stated \nin the Preamble to the ILO Constitution is that:\n\n       [T]he failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of \n     labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which \n     desire to improve the conditions in their own countries.\n\nIf States fail to act together to improve labor practices, an imbalance \noccurs and an unfair advantage is created. We ought to be taking steps \nto strengthen our leadership in the ILO. Instead, by prohibiting \nfunding for the ILO, the current bill requires our withdrawal.\n  One of the primary concerns arising from the situation of workers \nduring World War I was that some attention be paid to the fact that \nlabor standards often fell victim to international trade. At war's end, \nthe opportunity arose to address this problem.\n  The Western nations, shaken by the revolution that swept Russia in \n1917, were inclined to act. Samuel Gompers of the American Federation \nof Labor was enthusiastically received as he traveled through Europe in \nthe fall of 1918 to speak out against the growing Bolshevik influence \nin the European labor movement. Creation of an international labor \norganization became imperative to prevent uprisings like the one in \nRussia from spreading across Europe. So much so that as the terms of a \nnew international order were being drawn up at the peace conference, a \ncommission headed by Gompers created the ILO. It was much more a part \nof the campaign for the League of Nations than we might remember.\n  In 1991, then-Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin testified before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee about the significance of the ILO.\n\n       It was Abraham Lincoln of Illinois who summed up democracy \n     when he said that ``working men and women are the basis of \n     all government.''\n       . . . As such, the political structure of the ILO itself \n     illustrates the truth of Lincoln's remarks and, hence, \n     reinforces the linkage between democracy and a free economy, \n     between democratic values, independent trade unions, and free \n     enterprise.\n\n  The League of Nations, which was the subject of such fierce debate on \nthe Senate floor in the fall and winter of 1919-20, came to life \nsomewhat furtively in the clock room of the Quai d'Orsay in Paris in \nJanuary 1920. In point of fact the League system had already begun to \nwork here in Washington in October and November of 1919 \n\n[[Page S 14674]]\nwhen the first international labor conference was held pursuant to \narticle 424 of the ILO Constitution, which was signed as part of the \nTreaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919.\n  The Washington Conference, held at the Pan American Union Building, \nturned out to be an almost complete success, despite all the prospects \nof failure. Six major labor conventions, the first human rights \ntreaties in the history of the world, were adopted, including the 8-\nhour day convention, and the minimum age convention.\n  Woodrow Wilson, on his great trip across the Nation campaigning for \nthe United States to join the League, spoke continuously of the \nInternational Labor Organization. Indeed, almost the last words he \nspoke before his stroke, before he collapsed in Pueblo, CO, were about \nthe ILO. He told the people in Colorado about the League covenant and \nthe ILO. But he collapsed, and was prostrate when the International \nLabor Conference was organizing here in Washington.\n  His Secretary of Labor, William B. Wilson, did not know what to do. \nThe Senate was caught up in a protracted debate about whether to have \nanything at all to do with the League. A very distinguished British \ncivil servant, Harold Butler--later Sir Harold Butler--arrived in New \nYork by ship and then came down here, assigned to put in place the new \ninternational organization. He found the President prostrate and \nsilent, and the Secretary of Labor unable to take any action without \nthe President.\n  By sheer chance, Butler dined one evening with the then Assistant \nSecretary of the Navy, a young, rising New York political figure, \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, and his wife Eleanor. Butler recounted his \ndifficulties. ``Well, we have to do something about this,'' said \nRoosevelt. ``I think I can find you some offices at any rate. Look in \nat the Navy Building tomorrow morning and I will see about it in the \nmeanwhile.'' Roosevelt was devoted to Wilson. By the next day Roosevelt \nhad 40 rooms cleared of its admirals and captains to make room for the \nconference.\n  Harold Butler later became the second director-general of the ILO, \nserving from 1932 to 1938. Subsequently, he returned to Washington \nduring the second World War and his continued friendship with President \nRoosevelt made him a hugely influential figure in the wartime alliance.\n  Just as Roosevelt helped get the ILO off the ground, when he came to \nthe Oval Office, his administration soon laid the groundwork for the \nUnited States to join. In June of 1934, the House and Senate both \npassed a resolution clearing the way for our participation. The ILO is \nthe part of the League system the United States was least likely to \njoin. The League system consisted of the League itself, the Permanent \nCourt of International Justice, and the ILO. In fact, the ILO was the \nonly one we did join and it was the only one to survive the next war. A \ntribute to its enduring importance.\n  Last year, Congress approved U.S. participation in the World Trade \nOrganization. This was the culmination of a half century of \nnegotiations to break down trade restrictions. Yet continued progress \ntoward free trade brings with it a danger that labor standards will be \nthreatened. This was the primary motivation for forming the ILO three \nquarters of a century ago. As trade barriers continue to be broken, \nlabor standards in our country will increasingly be linked to standards \nin other countries. Maintaining humane, minimum labor standards was the \nprimary motivation for forming the ILO three quarters of a century ago. \nThe first priority of the ILO--which is closely related to encouraging \nthe democratic process--remains the defense of worker rights and the \napplication of international labor standards.\n  In a recent letter to all Senators, Abraham Katz, President of the \nU.S. Council for International Business--which includes among its \nmembers the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--lists as one of the three \ncritical reasons the United States should continue to participate in \nthe ILO:\n\n       To ensure that American companies continue to have a voice \n     in setting international labor standards that have an impact \n     on their operations and profitability.\n\nHe adds that participation is vital\n\n     to promote the rights of workers and oversee adherence to \n     good labor practices, which we believe is an acceptable \n     alternative to using trade sanctions to promote these rights. \n     As the Business Roundtable said in a recent statement to \n     Congress: ''. . . the United States should upgrade its \n     participation in the ILO . . .,'' rather than seek to address \n     international labor issues in the World Trade Organization.\n\n  The ILO is the place to address human rights as they relate to \nemployment. The ILO was the forum for the first human rights \nconventions the world has known. Perhaps none is more important than \nthe right of workers to organize and bargain collectively. I recall \nthen Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole's testimony before the Committee \non Foreign Relations on November 1, 1989:\n\n     [T]he International Labor Organization is the United Nations' \n     most effective advocate of human rights.\n       We are all aware, for example, of the ILO's courageous \n     support of Solidarity during the darkest days, and the \n     critical role it has played in Poland's historic journey to \n     democracy.\n\n  The efforts of the ILO on behalf of Solidarity were extraordinary. \nPoland had ratified ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association and \nProtection of the Right to Organize, and Convention 98 on the Right to \nOrganize and Bargain Collectively. Ratification of these Conventions \nwas a fact Poland could not deny. In 1978, the International Federation \nof Free Trade Unions charged Poland with violating Convention 87. After \nrepeated requests from the ILO to Poland to comply with Convention 87, \nPoland's Minister of Labor wrote to the ILO Director General in 1980, \nstating that Poland officially recognized Solidarity, the first \nindependent trade union to gain national recognition in a Communist \ncountry--the first ever. Lech Walesa was allowed to attend the 67th \nsession of the International Labor Conference. A year later, Poland \ntried to suspend trade unions, but the ILO would not relent. Poland \ncould not deny the basic fact that they were obliged by treaty to \nrecognize Solidarity, and domestic law, even martial law, could not \nundo those treaty obligations. Repeated criticism from the ILO kept \npressure on the Polish government to allow the return of Solidarity. \nFinally, in April 1989, the legal status of Solidarity was restored by \nthe Polish government and followed quickly by democratic elections. Now \nPresident Walesa has written Senator Dole stating:\n\n       The ILO, thanks to the activism of its officials, played a \n     significant role in reminding the world of our existence and \n     our goals. It supported us in the most difficult times of our \n     underground existence. The Committee on Inquiry created by \n     the ILO after the imposition of martial law in my country \n     made significant contributions to the changes which brought \n     democracy to Poland.\n\n  Our relations with the ILO have at times been stormy. In the 1970s \nthe ILO came to apply a double standard to the conduct of nations in \nthe West as opposed to the totalitarian block and was being abused as a \nforum to carry out political agendas unrelated to its legitimate \npurposes, and thus we withdrew from the ILO in 1977. Our withdrawal had \nthe desired effect: the ILO responded to our concerns and in 1980 we \nrejoined.\n  Since then we have increased our engagement with the ILO. For \ninstance, up until 1988, the United States had only ratified 7--6 \nmaritime and 1 technical--of the 176 ILO conventions. However, in 1988 \na new era commenced. The United States ratified its first convention in \n35 years. At this point I must acknowledge the role in this turnabout \nplayed by the sponsor of this amendment, the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Senator Obrin G. Hatch. In 1985, during his tenure as chairman of \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Senator Hatch recognized \nthat the ILO had put into place a comprehensive set of conventions \nwhich protected the human rights of workers around the world. He \nclearly saw the failure of the United States to ratify these very same \nconventions weakened our influence within the ILO and limited our \nability to use those conventions in pursuing reforms in other nations. \nSenator Hatch proposed that we again begin ratifying ILO treaties, and \nwe have done.\n  In all, the Senate has now ratified five conventions since 1988. Most \nnotably in 1991 when the United States for the first time ratified an \nILO human rights convention: Convention 105 on the Abolition of Forced \nLabor, an area \n\n[[Page S 14675]]\nwhere the ILO has made vital contributions.\n  ILO Convention 105, ratified by the Senate on May 14, 1991 by a vote \nof 97 to 0 abolishes the use of forced labor in five specific \ncircumstances: First, as a means of political coercion, second, as a \nmethod of mobilizing and using labor for purposes of economic \ndevelopment, third, as a means of labor discipline, fourth, as a \npunishment for having participated in strikes, and fifth, as a means of \nracial, social, national or religious discrimination. This convention \naddresses one of the great crimes against humanity that the 20th \ncentury has known, the forced labor camps of the totalitarian states. \nIt builds on an earlier ILO Convention, 29 which calls on ratifying \nnations to suppress forced labor in all its forms. Convention 29 \ndefines forced labor as ``all work or service which is exacted from any \nperson under the menace of any penalty and for which that person has \nnot offered himself voluntarily.'' It goes to the very essence of what \ncivilized conduct is in our age.\n  The committee hearing on Convention 105 was hugely informative. In \nparticular, I believe that we helped expose some of the atrocious \nconditions in the prisons of China and the goods for export that \nprisoners are forced to produce. To this day I have a pair of socks, \nthe product of the Chinese gulag, which Representative Wolf brought \nback for our hearing. I am proud that we were able to ratify Convention \n105. It would not have been possible without the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Helms.\n  I would also point out that a current provision of this bill relies \non the standards set by the ILO. I speak of Section 611 which requires \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to certify that goods originating in \nChina were not made with forced labor. The definition of forced labor \nis not random. Section 611(e)(1) defines forced labor as ``all work or \nservice which is exacted from any person under the menace of any \npenalty and for which that person has not offered himself \nvoluntarily.'' The definition of forced labor in this bill is word-for-\nword that of ILO Convention 29. As it should be. A primary function of \nthe ILO is to set such labor standards for the world.\n  That is the record. The ILO has accomplished much in its three-\nquarters of a century. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider these \nfacts and to not prevent us from participating in this hugely important \ninstitution.\n  A final point I would like to raise is the simple fact that when the \nUnited States joined the ILO in 1934 we made a commitment to give an \nadvance notice of two years before we withdrew from the organization. \nIf we are to prohibit funding for the ILO as the current version of \nthis bill does, we are essentially withdrawing from the ILO \nunannounced, and thus in violation of international law. Such rampant \ndisregard for our legal commitments does not become this body, nor does \nit serve the interests of this country.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2864\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. FUNDS TO TRANSPORTATION OF ADMINSITRATOR OF THE \n                   DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 1344(b)(6) of title 31, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(6) the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the \n     Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the \n     Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration;''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2865\n\n     (Purpose: To Amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act)\n\n       Section 36(a)(1) of the State Department Authorities Act of \n     1956, as amended, (22 U.S.C. 2708), is amended to delete \n     ``may pay a reward'' and insert in lieu thereof ``shall \n     establish and publicize a program under which rewards may be \n     paid''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2866\n\n   (Purpose: To make certain changes within the National Oceanic and \n                  Atmospheric Administration accounts)\n\n       On page 76, line 20 strike ``$55,500,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$62,000,000''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this amendment acknowledges that the \ntransfer that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will \nreceive from the Department of Agriculture for fiscal year 1996 for the \nSaltonstall-Kennedy Program will be $8,128,000 higher than originally \nestimated. The amendment would adjust the amount used as an offset by \nthe Operations, Research, and Facilities Account within NOAA upward by \n$6,500,000 to equal $62,000,000. This increase would be reflected \nwithin the Operations accounts as follows: $2,202,000 for Marine \nServices, to ensure that repair and maintenance can be conducted to \nallow the existing fleet to operate, $558,000 to the Great Lakes \nEnvironmental Research Laboratory [GLERL] to freeze that account at \ncurrent year levels, $911,000 to freeze GLERL zebra mussel research at \ncurrent year levels, $550,000 to International Fisheries Commissions to \nbe used for the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission to address sea lamprey \nproblems in the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, and $2,279,000 to \nCentral Administrative Support leaving that account with a significant \ncut from current year levels. This amendment would leave $1,628,000 of \nthe increased transfer in the Saltonstall-Kennedy Program for a total \nprogram level of $10,893,000 for fiscal year 1996. Because this \namendment involves changing only the amount used to offset \nappropriations, it has no budgetary impact on the bill.\n\n\n                  RESTORING GREAT LAKES PROGRAM FUNDS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nHollings amendment that restores certain Great Lakes program funding to \nfiscal year 1995 levels. The Hollings amendment incorporates the major \ncomponents of an amendment that I and several of my Great Lakes \ncolleagues were prepared to offer. Though the amendment does not \naddress all of the items in my original proposal, the remaining matters \nare addressed in a colloquy between me and Senator Hollings.\n  The amendment adds money for two very important Great Lakes programs, \n$1.469 million for NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory \n[GLERL] restoring it to fiscal year 1995 levels, and $450,000 for the \nGreat Lakes Fishery Commission [GLFC] also restoring it to fiscal year \n1995 levels. The distinguished Democratic manager of the bill and I \nhave also discussed the very likely probability that the conferees will \nbe able to recede to the House marks on the National Sea Grant program \nfor zebra mussel and non-indigenous species research--$2.8 million--and \nfor the International Joint Commission [IJC]--$3.160 million. And, the \nranking member has indicated that he will not support conference report \nlanguage that would transfer funding responsibility for the Great Lakes \nFishery Commission from the State Department to the Fish and Wildlife \nService.\n  This amendment does not provide special treatment for Michigan or the \nGreat Lakes region. The amendment merely seeks to address the \ntremendous problems that face the Great Lakes and allow the \nimplementation of international agreements and treaties. The majority \nof the restored funding is to be spent on aquatic nuisance species \nresearch and control. And, not all of that will be necessarily spent in \nthe Great Lakes.\n  Non-indigenous species are entering the Great Lakes at a record rate. \nThe sea lamprey entered in force when the Welland Canal was completed. \nThe zebra mussel most likely arrived in the ballast water of a Russian \ntanker in about 1986. The list goes on to include the gobi, the river \nruffe, the spiny water flea, et cetera. Other parts of the country have \nexperienced similar alien species invasions, but the Great Lakes Basin \nis a particularly vulnerable ecosystem that does not adapt as well as \nsaltwater to such intrusions.\n  Non-indigenous species have caused and continue to cause major \neconomic havoc in the Great Lakes. Municipal water intake systems, \nindustrial water users, tourism, anglers, recreational boaters, and \nother sectors of society have suffered tremendously. We need all the \navailable scientific and techncial expertise components in the region \nworking together to understand what needs to be done to manage our \nprecious water and wildlife resources most effectively. Adding this \nmoney back to GLERL, and with the understanding that non-indigenous \nspecies research supported by Sea Grant will likely continue, restores \nthose main \n\n[[Page S 14676]]\n\ncomponents. It also recognizes the valuable part they play in \nprotecting and preserving the Great Lakes fisheries and the ecosystem.\n  Under the amendment, the Great Lakes Environmental Research \nLaboratory [GLERL] will receive $.558 million above the amount proposed \nin the House and the Senate committee's bill. This brings GLERL back to \nfiscal year 1995 levels simply for operations and basic research \nactivities. Also, GLERL will have an additional $.911 million to \ncontinue more applied research on zebra mussels and other aquatic \nnuisance species research.\n  Among other tasks, the add-back will allow GLERL to continue its \nexcellent work in trying to understand and address the aquatic weed \nproblems in Lake St. Clair. GLERL will be able to continue working to \nimplement its storm surge model, which is used by emergency planning \npersonnel to predict and warn riparians of storm-related high water \nlevels, across the Basin. And, retain highly-skilled and experienced \npersonnel to accomplish this goal. Similarly GLERL's research on \necosystem impacts of the zebra mussel will continue, just when it has \nbecome apparent that massive blue-green algal blooms sprouting around \nthe basine, particularly in Saginaw Bay and western Lake Erie, are \nprobably a result of the changes to the ecosystem caused by the zebra \nmussel. These algal blooms are reminiscent of the mid-1960's when many \ndeclared Lake Erie dead due to eutrophication. They deplete oxygen in \nthe bottom water, potentially leading to fish kills.\n  GLERL is a unique combination of scientific expertise in \nbiogeochemical, ecological, hydrological, and physical limnological and \noceanographic sciences that is not reproduced at any other Great Lakes \ninstitution. It is the only research laboratory with the staff and the \nequipment necessary to examine physical phenomena, such as currents, \nice cover, and water levels, in concert with biogeochemical/ecosystem \nand water quality studies, in both freshwater and marine ecosystems.\n  As part of NOAA, GLERL helps the Federal Government meet its \nscientific, ecosystem-understanding, and management responsibilities \nunder the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement with Canada, especially \nunder the Research Annex (17). GLERL works with and advises the \nInternational Joint Commission [IJC].\n  GLERL measures and models the role of contaminants in sediments. \nGLERL develops and improves hydrologic and water resources prediction \nmodels that assist the IJC and the Army Corps of Engineers in their \nlake-level regulation responsibilities.\n  GLERL has a 21 year history of important scientific contributions to \nthe understanding and management of the Great Lakes Water Quality \nAgreement [GLWQA] between the United States and Canada. The Lab's work \nin the Great Lakes has been impeccable and highly useful. Here are some \nexamples of sound scientific information provided by GLERL that has \nincreased safety, protected property, and reduced or eliminated \ninefficient and costly regulations:\n  GLERL developed wind-wave models so the National Weather Service \ncould make more accurate forecasts and warnings of weather conditions \non the Lakes. This advance helps protect the lives of recreational \nboaters.\n  GLERL's scientific know-how transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard \nhelped save the U.S. shipping fleet millions of dollars in lost cargo \nsweeping time and prevented the finalization of highly restrictive \nproposed regulations.\n  GLERL produced a predictive model of the storm surges and wave \nmotion, or seiches, in the Great Lakes, so local emergency preparedness \nofficials could have advanced warning of shoreline flooding. Now, in \nseiche conditions, shoreline property owners have time to protect their \nproperty and their lives.\n  GLERL's research on nutrients, especially phosphorous, helped \nconvince USEPA that proposed requirements to further decrease \nphosphorous levels in treated municipal sewage discharges would be \nineffective in lowering phosphorous amounts in the Lakes. This act \nsaved taxpayers in excess of $10 billion.\n  GLERL developed the PATHFINDER model for oil/chemical spill \ntrajectories, which is used by NOAA and the States for spill response \nand by the Coast Guard to help guide search and rescue operations.\n  Also, GLERL has been very active in other parts of the country:\n  Vermont and New York--Scientists from GLERL worked with academic \nscientists from the Lake Champlain basin to quantify the causes and \neffects of high speed bottom currents in the lake. The currents cause \nsediment resuspension, making toxic contaminants attached to sediment \nparticles repeatedly available in lake water. This is important \ninformation for water quality restoration work. GLERL will complete \nthis work in fiscal year 1995.\n  Carolinas--Last year, a GLERL oceanographer was part of a NOAA and \nacademic scientific team studying the influence of circulation patterns \non fishery recruitment off the coasts of the Carolinas.\n  South Florida--GLERL scientists are part of a multi-agency team \nconducting research and assessments of both the Everglades and Florida \nBay, both of which are experiencing declining ecosystem health. GLERL's \nexpertise on nutrients is being applied to the Bay, while GLERL's \nsediment core experience is being used to document historical factors \naffecting freshwater flows in the Everglades.\n  Louisiana and Texas--GLERL scientists have played a lead role in the \nnearly-completed 5-year NOAA study of the effects of the Mississippi-\nAtchafalya River system on the continental shelf waters off Louisiana \nand Texas. The near-bottom waters there become hypoxic or anoxic--\nlittle or no oxygen in the water--each year.\n  Wyoming--GLERL scientists are collaborating with academic scientists \nand the National Park Service on an ecological and geochemical study of \nYellowstone Lake, the largest alpine lake in North America. The lake is \nunder stress from increasing visitors and the introduction of non-\nindigenous species.\n  South Dakota--Lake Oahe is a large reservoir on the upper Missouri \nRiver in south central South Dakota. GLERL carried out a joint research \nproject with the USGS to determine reservoir parameters using \ngeochemical tracers.\n  Iowa, Kansas, and Georgia--GLERL is helping USGS to evaluate where \nand how much sediments contaminated with toxics, such as herbicides and \npesticides, were moved and redeposited during the extensive flooding of \nthe Midwest in 1993.\n  The amendment provides an additional $.450 million for the Great \nLakes Fishery Commission [GLFC], which brings that line item up to the \nfiscal year 1995 level. The GLFC is a binational organization \nestablished by the Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries between Canada \nand the United States of 1955. The Commission has two major \nresponsibilities; first, develop coordinated programs of research in \nthe Great Lakes and, on the basis of findings, recommend measures which \nwill permit the maximum sustained productivity of stocks of fish of \ncommon concern; second, formulate and implement a program to eradicate \nor minimize sea lamprey populations in the Great Lakes.\n  The amount proposed in the Senate committee's bill for the GLFC is \ninsufficient because it does not recognize the need to match the \nincreased Canadian contribution to the binational Commission. Last \nyear, the Canadians offered to increase the amount they provide, \nassuming the United States would maintain its share of payments in the \ntraditional 69:31 ratio. Canada has kept its promise and its payments \nare on time.\n  Last year, several Great Lakes colleague joined me in increasing \nGLFC's appropriations bill to bring the United States contribution up \nto $8.773 million, reflecting the Canadian increase. I understand that \nthe State Department sought to include this amount in the budget \nrequest but was denied by the Office of Management and Budget. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to remind my friends in the \nadministration that the price of the TFM, the only effective \nlampricide, has continued to increase in price almost annually, while \nGLFC appropriations have remained level or fallen. Price increases by \nthe world's sole TFM manufacturer, a foreign company, and inflation \nhave steadily eaten into the real money available for stopping the \nlamprey. And the dollar's decline against \n\n[[Page S 14677]]\nthe German mark further has further eaten away at the Commission's \nreserves.\n  Despite GLFC's ever-increasing efficiency and effort, the sea lamprey \npopulation in the Great Lakes continues to grow, particularly in the \nSt. Mary's River and Lake Huron, threatening the world's largest \nfreshwater ecosystem and a multi-billion dollar commercial and \nrecreational fishing industry. This parisitic fish's predation is \nchecked only by the Commission's efforts.\n  The bulk of the Commission's funds go directly to pay for the \nlampricide, TFM, which is the only truly effective way to control sea \nlamprey populations at this time. There is ongoing research into non-\nchemical means, but the Commission has rarely received adequate funding \nfor such research and inadequate funding in the past has depleted \nlampricide inventories.\n  The level of funding proposed in the committee's bill would have \nforced the Commission to scale-back its lamprey control and assessment \nefforts in the St. Marys River, where the populations are approaching \nthose of the 1940's. Those levels caused the populations of lake trout \nand whitefish to collapse then. It would have slowed advances in \ndeveloping and implementing the sterile-male release program. The \nCommission traps male sea lampreys, sterilizes them, and releases them \nback into Great Lakes tributaries. The proposed cut would have reduced \nthe scope of the sea lamprey barrier program and slow research into \ninnovative barrier designs. These barriers are the main non-chemical \nmethod to prevent lamprey spawning.\n  The Great Lakes' $2 to $4 billion sport and commercial fishery \ncreates jobs and fulfils treaty obligations. The Commission's sea \nlamprey control program has led to the rehabilitation of lake trout in \nLake Superior and has helped facilitate a strong revitalization of lake \ntrout in Lake Ontario. Cutting the U.S. contribution below last year's \nlevel would jeopardize this success.\n  Mr. President, once again, I would like to thank the manager of the \nbill, the distinquished ranking member and the junior Senator from \nMichigan for their assistance in gaining approval of this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanager of the bill in a brief colloquy regarding several matters that \nare important to the Great Lakes region and elsewhere.\n  As my colleagues from the Great Lakes know, there are several \ntreaties and agreements between the U.S. and Canada, and between the \nU.S. and the Tribal nations, that require maintenance and adequate \nsupport from the Congress for implementation. Not the least of these \nare the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, the Convention on Great Lakes \nFisheries of 1955, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and numerous \ncompacts with the Tribes. These agreements are designed to protect the \nquality and quantity of our nation's largest supply of fresh water and \nthe abundant aquatic wildlife.\n  The committee's bill, as reported, would provide less than adequate \nsupport for the functions of the American section of the International \nJoint Commission [IJC], the binational body that implements the \nBoundary Waters Treaty and oversees the Great Lakes Water Quality \nAgreement. In fact, both the House mark and the Senate Committee's bill \nwould provide less than the IJC received in fiscal year 1987. Adjusting \nfor inflation, that is a dramatic and painful cut.\n  Would the ranking member be able to tell me whether or not he could \nhelp increase the IJC's fiscal year 1996 appropriation, at least to the \nHouse level, during conference?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Though I cannot guarantee the outcome of the \nconference, I will strongly urge the Senate conferees to recede to the \nHouse position on this point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On a related matter of great importance to the Great \nLakes, the Senate committee's bill appears to reduce the National Sea \nGrant appropriations for research into zebra mussels and non-indigenous \nspecies. The House bill provides $53.3 million for this program and \ndirects that $2.8 million be spent on this research. The Senate \ncommittee's bill proposes $50.4 million and makes no mention of this \nresearch.\n  My colleagues from other regions may not yet be able to appreciate \nthe necessity and benefits of this research into the life-cycle, \necology and control methods of non-indigenous species. Those who live \nin or have visited the Great Lakes region appreciate it. Zebra mussels, \nsea lamprey, river ruffe, gobi, spiny water flea, are just a few of the \ninvading species that have caused ecological and economic havoc in the \nGreat Lakes. They are changing the way we live and use our waters. They \ninfest lake water system intakes and hurt the $4 billion Great Lakes \nfishery. We need to understand how they work and how to stop them from \nspreading. My friends from other regions should be particularly \nsupportive of our efforts to keep these species out of their areas.\n  I would ask the distinguished Senator from South Carolina if he would \nbe able to work in conference to get closer to the House mark for the \nNational Sea Grant program and to specify some level of funds be used \nfor zebra mussel and non-indigenous species research performed by \nNational Sea Grant affiliated colleges and universities and NOAA \nlaboratories?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As the Senator has indicated, the House mark for Sea \nGrant is somewhat higher than has been recommended in the committee's \nbill. The committee's report silence on non-indigenous species research \nshould not be construed as a lack of support for this important \nresearch. I will certainly work in conference to provide adequate funds \nfor the Sea Grant program.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The distinguished ranking member's assistance in both of \nthese areas will be greatly appreciated. I would like to request his \nattention to and consideration of one last item.\n  The committee's report language recommends that responsibility for \nthe fiscal year 1997 budget request for the Great Lakes Fishery \nCommission be transferred from the State Department to the Fish and \nWildlife Service at the Interior Department. I strongly disagree with \nthis suggestion and have opposed efforts to make this transfer in the \npast.\n  The Great Lakes Fishery Commission is an effective, neutral, \nbinational forum for coordination of fish management and sea lamprey \neradication in the Great Lakes. Transferring the latter responsibility \nto the Fish and Wildlife Service has been and will continue to be \nopposed by the Great Lakes States and Tribal governments. Such a \ntransfer would interfere with the institutional structure and direct \nState and Tribal participation in the Commission's activities, and \njeopardize existing delicate relationships among Great Lakes fishery \nagencies.\n  I strongly encourage the conferees not to pursue the transfer any \nfurther, because it will be met with strong resistance from the region, \nand I hope, from the administration.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The committee's report language is advisory only to the \nadministration and does not have the force of law. Nonetheless, I will \nseek a clarification in the conference report that reflects the \nSenator's concerns.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Democratic manager of the bill for his \nconsideration and cooperation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2867\n\n       On page 74, 18, after ``Fund'', strike the period and \n     insert the following: ``, and of which $1,200,000 shall be \n     available for continuation of the program to integrate energy \n     efficient building technology with the use of structural \n     materials made from underutilized or waste products.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2868\n\n(Purpose: To amend the bill with regard to the transfer of title to the \n                    Rutland City Industrial Complex)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, this amendment, which is cosponsored by \nSenator Dorgan, would prohibit the Administrative Office of the United \nStates Courts to spend additional money to develop the National Fine \nCenter Project prior to March 1, 1996.\n  The amendment includes three exceptions. The Administrative Office \nwould be permitted to maintain National Fine Center services at their \ncurrent level, to complete its work on cases for courts currently \nparticipating in the project and to proceed with the pilot projects in \nseveral judicial districts.\n  A freeze in funding will give Congress time to address serious \nquestions and problems relating to the status and direction of the \nproject which were highlighted in a July 19, 1995 Governmental Affairs \noversight hearing.\n  Congress tasked the Administrative Office 8 years ago to develop an \nintegrated database to better track and collect Federal criminal debt. \nAs of 2 months ago, the office had spent nearly $10 million on the \neffort, including over $5 million on an aborted pilot project in \nRaleigh, NC. today, the prospects of achieving a workable, cost-\nefficient Fine Center that meets the needs of the Department of Justice \nand the goals articulated by Congress remain very much in question.\n  The Department of Justice, the primary customer of the Fine Center, \nis very concerned about the project, and does not believe that the \ncurrent system provides the integration needed by the Department to \nimprove debt collection--one of the system's primary goals. In fact, \nDepartment of Justice officials believe that if the AO stays its \ncurrent course, the Department will be required to develop an \nadditional system to access information stored in the Fine Center's \ndatabase. This is, of course, absurd.\n  I am particularly troubled that according to the GAO, the \nAdministrative Office has very little documentation to justify its \ndevelopment decisions to date and no detailed plan for completing the \nproject. Moreover, the AO cannot say with any certainty what the final \nprice tag for the project will be.\n  While I am sure the intentions of the Administrative Office are \nhonorable, the project has a troubled history and confidence that we \nare on a cost-effective track is not what it should be.\n  It is important to note that the money being used by Administrative \nOffice for the project comes from the crime victim fund. This account \nis normally used to finance vital victim assistance programs. We cannot \ncontinue to dedicate valuable resources from this account without \nabsolute assurance that the public, and crime victims are receiving \nvalue for their investment.\n  Freezing the funds will allow Congress the time to take appropriate \nsteps to ensure that this project is on track. In fact, I hope to \nintroduce, with Senator Dorgan, very soon legislation which will help \nus to achieve that end.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2871\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding compliance of \nthe Russian Federation with the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in \n                                Europe)\n\n       On page 121, after line 24, add the following:\n       Sec.   . It is the Sense of the Senate that the President \n     of the United States should insist on the full compliance of \n     the Russian Federation with the terms of the Treaty on \n     Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and seek the advice and \n     consent of the Senate for any treaty modifications.\n\n                             the cfe treaty\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. President Clinton and our NATO allies have agreed to a \nmajor compromise on the CFE treaty in an effort to lay the ground work \nfor the planned October Summit between President Clinton and President \nYeltsin. The amendment I am offering today is attempt to put the \nAdministration on notice that the Senate will take a careful look at \nthe agreement recently reached before it is finalized in October.\n  In November of 1990, Russia agreed to significant limitations on \nnumbers and deployment of its heavy weaponry--battle tanks, artillery, \narmored combat vehicles, attack helicopters and combat aircraft. There \nis unanimous agreement that Russia is not currently in compliance with \nthe treaty and, at its current pace, it is not likely to meet the \ndeadline for full compliance.\n  The treaty changes proposed by NATO--under pressure from the \nAdministration--involve the number of weapons allowable in what is \nknown the flank zone. A compromise has been reached that expands the \nflank zones to allow an amount of equipment halfway between the treaty \nrequirements and the amount currently in the zone. The treaty sets \nlimits of 1,300 tanks, 1,380 armored combat vehicles, and 1,680 heavy \nartillery pieces. There are currently 3,000 tanks, 5,500 armored combat \nvehicles and 3,000 heavy artillery pieces in the flank zone.\n  The limits in the flank zone are important because it involves \nRussia's Southwest and Northwest border. It has implications for the \nsituation in Chechnya, Russia's involvement in what it terms its ``near \nabroad'' in the Caucuses and the Baltics, and our allies in Turkey.\n  As with many issues, what causes me the most concern isn't that a \ncompromise on treaty compliance has been reached. If the compromise is \nconsistent with the treaty, I am pleased we were able to avoid a rift \nwith Russia. What concerns me the most is the twist and turns that the \nAdministration has taken to get to this point. The changes in the \npolicy makes one skeptical that treaty compliance is really the \nadministration's aim. Too often in the Administration's Russia policy \nthe aim has been to avoid and paper over disputes. This was the case \nearly on with NATO expansion. It was the case with Chechnya. It is the \ncase with the Russia-Iran nuclear deal.\n  President Clinton indicated at the Moscow summit in May that \n``modifications are in order'' to the CFE treaty and that he would \nsupport modifications at the CFE review conference next year. The \nPresident later attempted to clarify the issue by stressing that he \nwould press for Russian compliance with the agreement by the November \n1995 deadline. Now that the President has reconsidered his earlier \nstatements and determined that changes are in order to assist the \nRussians in meeting this year's November 17th deadline, I think it is \nimportant that the Senate be heard on the issue prior to the \nPresident's meeting next month with President Yeltsin.\n  The CFE treaty will hopefully become a central element of stability \nin Europe. It is important that its integrity be preserved and that no \nparty be able to subvert its purposes. I encourage the administration \nto keep the Senate fully apprised of its attempts to negotiate changes.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2872\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for a land transfer in Tuscaloosa, Alabama)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment which is \ncritical to our efforts to reform U.S. maritime policy, maintain a \nU.S.-flag fleet and merchant marine and serve our national security \ninterests.\n  Maritime reform is vital to our national and economic security. From \nour beginning history, America has been a maritime nation reliant on \nsecure ocean passage and transport for commerce and military strength.\n  From the sea battles of the American Revolution through the Persian \nGulf, our seafarers and merchant marine courageously supplied and \nsustained our troops in combat and conflict.\n  The U.S.-flag fleet and merchant marine carried our troops and cargo \nthrough World War I, II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf.\n  In World War II, more than 6,000 merchant mariners were killed and \nthousands more were wounded. After World War II, the Supreme Allied \nCommander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, declared:\n\n       The officers and men of the merchant marine by their \n     devotion to duty in the face of enemy action, as well as the \n     material dangers of the sea, have brought to us the tools to \n     finish the job. Their contribution to final victory will long \n     be remembered.\n\n  Following the Persian Gulf, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nColin Powell, stated:\n\n       Since I became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I \n     have come to appreciate first-hand why our merchant marine \n     has long been called the Nation's fourth arm of defense. The \n     American seafarer provides an essential service to the well-\n     being of the Nation, as was demonstrated so clearly during \n     Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.\n\n  In relation to our Nation's economic security, Rear Adm. (ret.) Tom \nPatterson recently wrote in the Journal of Commerce:\n\n       Throughout history, the Nation that ruled the seas \n     controlled the world's economy. In their time, Egypt, Greece, \n     Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome, then Spain, Portugal, and \n     Great Britain, came and went as the leading naval and \n     commercial powers. When they lost their maritime dominance, \n     they quickly became second-rate in terms of economic success \n     and political influence.\n       The United States is in grave danger of going down that \n     same road if it has not done so already. Our perceived \n     economic decline in recent years has been accompanied by an \n     almost suicidal approach to our maritime policy--and \n     specifically to the future of merchant shipping under the \n     American flag . . .\n\n  Over the last 20 years, Congress has failed to pass an effective \nmaritime policy. As a result, we have seen a dangerous decline of the \nU.S.-flag fleet, merchant marine, and shipbuilding.\n  Now, we face a situation where if we fail to act in this Congress, \nour national security and international competitiveness will be \nseriously and irreversibly harmed.\n       We could easily lose our U.S. flag fleet and with it our \n     merchant marine.\n       If that occurs, only military readiness and our sealift \n     capacity will be dealt a blow.\n       Numerous jobs would be lost related to the maritime \n     industry and our balance of payments and international \n     competitiveness will suffer.\n       In times of international crisis or war, our historical and \n     successful reliance on the U.S. flag fleet and merchant \n     marine would come to an end.\n       Personally, I do not want to be a part of that. This \n     Congress has a sobering opportunity to do something about it.\n       Secretary Pena, on behalf of the administration, along with \n     General Rutherford and Admiral Herberger strongly support the \n     funding for the Maritime Security Program.\n       The House National Security Committee and the Senate \n     Commerce Committee have reported out the reform legislation \n     that serves as the basis for the proposed funding contained \n     in this amendment.\n       I would like to state as simply as possible the objective \n     of this amendment.\n       It is to maintain and promote a U.S. flag fleet, built in \n     U.S. shipyards and manned by U.S. crews in the most cost \n     effective and flexible manner possible.\n       When I go home to Pascagoula, I want to see the greatest \n     amount possible of Mississippi agricultural products--rice, \n     cotton, soybeans, catfish, chicken and forest products and \n     other exports moving on U.S. flagged ships build in America.\n       In times of national emergency or war, I want to know that \n     we will continue the finest tradition of the U.S. flag fleet \n     and merchant marine--secure in the knowledge that our sealift \n     capability is assured and confident that our troops will be \n     supplied.\n       The maritime reform legislation and proposed funding will \n     help achieve these objectives by establishing a new maritime \n     security program. The bill terminates the previous program, \n     reducing costs by 50%. In its place, a more efficient and \n     flexible program will continue the successful private \n     commercial partnership with the Departments of Transportation \n     and Defense.\n       A partnership which will help promote and preserve a modern \n     U.S. flag fleet and merchant marine and one that will serve \n     our national security in time of war or emergency.\n       To promote our Nation's underlying shipbuilding \n     infrastructure and capacity, this amendment funds and reforms \n     the Title XI Loan Guarantee Program. A program which \n     effectively stimulates U.S. shipbuilding, competitiveness and \n     jobs.\n       Again, this amendment is vital to our national and economic \n     security. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this \n     amendment and our effort to reform our maritime policy.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment to \nfund two strategically and economically important maritime programs; \nthe title XI loan guarantee program and the new maritime security \nfleet.\n  The title XI program provides loan guarantees for vessels built in \nAmerican shipyards and for the modernization of those same yards. The \nmaritime security program provides payments to participating vessel \noperators in exchange for their promising the availability of \nmilitarily useful U.S.-flag vessels and trained, loyal American crews.\n  I believe a viable, active, private-sector U.S. maritime industry is \nin our national interest. We need a U.S. merchant fleet and U.S. \nshipyards for military purposes in times of national emergency.\n  We need a U.S. merchant fleet to preserve our historic presence as a \nglobal economic power moving goods on the high seas. We need American \nmen and women to build and run those ships. This amendment is the most \ncost-effective way to make sure that our merchant marine is there when \nwe need it.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, it has always made strategic sense \nto have a strong maritime industry. Policymakers who have come before \nus have had the sense to realize that we need U.S.-flag ships with \nAmerican crews to supply our armed forces overseas.\n  Let me make the significance of this vote perfectly clear: in the \nabsence of a U.S. merchant marine, the Defense Department will have no \nother option but to subcontract foreign ships and seamen for \npractically all its sealift needs.\n  A number of times during the Gulf war foreign-flag ships refused to \nsail into the war zone. That never happened with a U.S.-flag ship. Our \ncivilian merchant mariners have always been there for us in times of \nnational crisis. They have been true patriots--reliable, consistent, \nand faithful. Without Americans manning those supply ships, we can't \nguarantee that the U.S. military will be able to do its job.\n  I believe in public/private cooperation to encourage government \nsavings. This maritime package does just that. It provides a rainy-day \nmaritime infrastructure for U.S. defense needs while, at the same time, \nstimulating private sector enterprise. The sealift capability that a \nU.S. merchant marine provides the Defense Department costs a fraction \nof what it would cost if they did it ``in house''.\n\n[[Page S 14680]]\n\n  It also guarantees that loyal American merchant mariners will be \navailable to serve when needed. They won't be there if we betray the \nU.S. maritime industry.\n  This amendment is smart, it's strategic, and it makes sense. Our \nmerchant mariners and shipyard laborers when called to serve, never \ngave up the ship. I hope the U.S. Senate doesn't give up the ship \ntoday. Let's stand by these heroes in dungarees and adopt the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment, \nand to join Senators Lott, Inouye, Breaux, and others as a cosponsor, \nto fund the maritime security program [MSP].\n  The MSP will replace the existing operating differential subsidy \n[ODS] program over the next 3 years, and will ensure the continuation \nof a viable U.S.-flag fleet in our trade with foreign countries.\n  Statistics show an alarming decline in the size of our domestic \ncommercial fleet, and this amendment will ensure that U.S. defense and \neconomic security needs continue to be met.\n  The amendment provides $46 million for operating subsidies under the \nMSP in fiscal year 1996.\n  When the MSP fully replaces the ODS in 1998, it will cost $100 \nmillion per year through the year 2005, providing subsidies to roughly \n50 ships at around $2 million per ship.\n  This annual cost is 50 percent lower than the cost of the existing \nODS subsidy program, on which we spent $214 million in fiscal year 1995 \nalone.\n  We feel this leaner program is sufficient to sustain a viable U.S.-\nflag fleet as it competes against carriers from countries with lower \nlabor standards and heavy subsidies.\n  The amendment also provides $25 million for title XI loan guarantees \nto build new U.S. vessels.\n  U.S. shipyards, even more than U.S. carriers, compete against \nshipyards in other countries that receive subsidies as large as any \nindustry in the world receives.\n  The $25 million provided in this amendment will allow the Maritime \nAdministration to guarantee loans totaling $250 million in fiscal year \n1996.\n  The Secretary of Transportation has informed the Appropriations \nCommittee that loan guarantee applications totaling $2.8 billion are \ncurrently pending before the Maritime Administration.\n  There is no question that the demand for loan guarantees will meet \nthe supply we provide.\n  The Secretary additionally tells us that world shipbuilding demand \nwill exceed $350 billion in the next 10 years.\n  This loan guarantee money will ensure that U.S. shipyards can meet \nsome of that demand for new ships.\n  The amendment provides $71 million total by reducing the amount \nprovided for Radio Free Europe by $71 million.\n  While the decision to make this reduction has been difficult, I \nbelieve this amendment provides funding that is critical to the United \nStates and U.S.-flag commercial fleet.\n  In addition to the carrier and shipbuilding provisions, the amendment \nwould also add important bill language to allow proceeds from the sales \nof National Reserve Defense Fleet vessels to be transferred to the \nSecretary of the Interior to use for the National maritime Heritage \nGrants program.\n  This program was created as part of the National Maritime Heritage \nAct, passed into law last November. That act authorizes the change we \nare making now to the appropriations bill.\n  This grants program will allow entities such as the Fairbanks \nHistorical Preservation Foundation in Fairbanks, AK restore vessels \nthat are important relics of our maritime heritage.\n  The Fairbanks Historical Preservation Foundation has just begun to \nrestore the NENANA, an important riverboat in Alaska's history, and \nwould be eligible to apply for grants under this program.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2874\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress urging the President to \n   provide for unified command and control of Department of Defense \n                        counterdrug activities)\n\n       On page 110, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. It is the sense of Congress that, in order to \n     facilitate enhanced command and control of Department of \n     Defense counter-drug activities in the Western Hemisphere, \n     the President should designate the commander of one unified \n     combatant command established under chapter 6 of title 10, \n     United States Code, to perform the mission of carrying out \n     all counter-drug operations of the Department of Defense in \n     the areas of the Western Hemisphere that are south of the \n     southern border of the United States, including Mexico, and \n     the areas off the coasts of Central America and South America \n     that are within 300 miles of such coasts. But not to include \n     the Carribean Sea.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, more Americans die each year from the \nuse of cocaine, heroin, and other illicit drugs than from international \nterrorism.\n  One hundred percent of the world's cocaine comes from South America. \nRealizing this, one can conceptualize possible centers of gravity where \nwe can reach out and disrupt the drug cartel's operations. It is \nimperative that we take the fight to the drug cartels.\n  We can target the illicit drug industry itself; drug transshipment \nareas, airfields, navigational equipment, drug labs, and drug cache \nsites.\n  As the Honorable William Perry, Secretary of Defense has been quoted \nas saying, ``Narco-traffickers don't think in terms of borders. Indeed, \nthey take advantage of this mind set. They violate sovereignty. So the \nonly way to deal with the narco-trafficking problem is to treat it as a \nregional problem . . .''\n  With this concept in mind, I am concerned that there is a great deal \nof stratification and duplication of effort within U.S. governmental \nagencies. On Capitol Hill alone, there are over 74 congressional drug \noversight and review committees. To stem the tide of illicit drug \ntrafficking, sale, and use, we must maximize our potential and our \nlimited resources.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, I feel \nthat a logical place to begin consolidating command and control, to \nbetter curb the flow of illicit drugs from the southern portion of the \nWestern Hemisphere, is within the department of Defense.\n  The Department of Defense provides support to law enforcement \nagencies and host nations in creating and strengthening their \ninstitutions to defeat the narcotics threat. Currently, each command \nprovides: intelligence support, detection and monitoring (D), \ninterdiction, training support, planning assistance, logistics support, \nand communications support within their respective theaters. It is my \nintent to consolidate these efforts under one unified command that will \nhandle counternarcotics operations.\n  This sense of the Congress is designed to put the executive branch on \nnotice that it is time to streamline counternarcotic activities and \nbecome more effective interdicting drugs at their point of origin in \nSouth America. It is time for tighter command and control regarding \ncounternarcotics operations in the region of the world that is the sole \nproducer of cocaine.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2875\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for Agricultural Weather Service Centers)\n\n       On page 76, line 25, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That the National Weather \n     Service shall expend not more than $700,000 to operate and \n     maintain Agricultural Weather Service Centers''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, This amendment provides funding for the \nAgricultural Weather Service Centers at Stoneville, MI and Auburn, AL \nand requires the National Weather Service to continue the operation of \nthese important weather centers.\n  This bill calls for the privatization of elements of the National \nWeather Service [NWS], including services for agriculture and forestry. \nThese weather service centers provide several important services to \nAmerica's farmers. Millions of dollars and hundreds of family farms are \nat risk without proper weather information.\n  Many important products and services would be terminated if these \ncenters are closed. Special freeze forecasts, special advisories for \nextreme weather events, and agricultural weather guidance would all be \neliminated. All agricultural climatology services to State and Federal \nagencies would cease as would all liaison activities with the land \ngrant universities and other agencies. Cooperative research with \nscientists at all universities would end.\n  Some argue that farmers can obtain the weather services they require \nfrom \n\n[[Page S 14681]]\nthe private sector from the many commercial weather services that \noperate around the Nation.\n  However, none of the commercial weather services provide the kind of \nagricultural weather information available from these agricultural \nweather service centers. Additionally, there are only a very small \nnumber of companies that could potentially provide some agricultural \nservices.\n  Commercial operators are generally unwilling to make an investment in \ndeveloping the kinds of unique products used by agriculture because the \nmarket is too small. In areas of concentrated agriculture, such as in \nCalifornia or Florida, the market might be sufficient for the private \nsector. Markets like Mississippi are too small to support private \nmeteorological services.\n  Some argue that these services should be done by private sector \nmeteorologists and that the National Weather Service constitutes \ncorporate welfare. Let me bring to the attention of my colleagues that \nthe bulk of agriculture and forestry consists of small family \noperations, not giant corporations. Large farms already hire private \nmeteorologists and will not be affected by office closings. This is \ngoing to affect the small- and medium-sized farmers who do not have the \nmoney to get expert help and could not afford to contract for weather \ninformation.\n  Some may argue that this is an unnecessary service that should no \nlonger be funded by taxpayers, that in a time of smaller budgets, we \ncan no longer afford the $2.1 million to operate the National Weather \nService agricultural weather program.\n  However, according to a 1992 study by the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, the modernization of the National Weather \nService will reduce agricultural losses by $15 billion and increase \nagricultural output by $117.9 million annually.\n  This is clearly one of the best bargains in government.\n  The Stoneville Center is a world renown research center with major \nactivities in cotton, soybeans, rice, catfish, and hardwood forestry. \nAt the Stoneville, MI center, more than 200 farmers have been working \nwith the Stoneville Agricultural Weather Service Center to develop a \ncredible agricultural weather forecast system. This center has the \npotential of producing data that could save millions of dollars in \nreduced input costs such as pesticide applications, fertilizer, and \nharvest potential.\n  There is clearly a role for the Federal Government in providing these \nspecialized agricultural services. The production of food and fiber is \nthe most critical component of our economy. With so few Americans now \ndirectly producing our food and fiber, it is imperative that we \nmaintain the most efficient production possible. The NWS agricultural \nand forestry weather program contributes to this efficiency at the \nlowest possible cost.\n  The roles of the NWS and the private sector are clear. The role of \noperating and maintaining the agricultural weather data networks is \nbest done by NWS. The same goes for the operations of agricultural \nweather forecast models. Research and development activities which \nutilize the observational and forecast data is another primary NWS \nfunction. The end result is a great wealth of information. It is the \npackaging and delivery of this information which can be best done by \nthe private sector. The NWS does not have the resources to produce \ncustomized information for each user. This is clearly an important job \nfor the private sector. The NWS and the private sector can work \ntogether and share in the provision of weather information to \nagriculture.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to privatize these services. \nThis bill represents the wrong way. These services should not be \nabruptly ended without careful planning and judicious management of the \nprivatization process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Cochran \namendment which would restore funding for the Agricultural Weather \nService Centers at Stoneville, MS, and Auburn, AL. The amendment would \nrequire the National Weather Service to continue the operation of these \nimportant weather centers.\n  Mr. President, the business of American farmers, ranchers, and \nforesters is to produce and market the world's safest supply of food \nand fiber. To do so, they must cope with all of the vagaries of nature. \nUnlike the vast majority of people in this Nation who cope with \neveryday weather in the context of a golf game or a picnic, weather is \nthe single most important external element in the production equation. \nTo our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and foresters specific weather \ninformation is crucial to the protection of crops, the application of \nmanagement practices, the timely selection and use of pesticides, the \ndecision to apply expensive freeze protection measures, et cetera.\n  In my opinion, there is no other organization, business, or \ninstitution which is capable of gathering and analyzing data either on \nthe scale or to the degree of reliability which farmers, ranchers, and \nforesters routinely receive from the National Weather Service. The \nrefinement of the data for their specific needs requires specific \nanalysis and employs special knowledge provided by land grant colleges, \nthe Cooperative Extension Service, and other State and Federal \nspecialists.\n  I am aware that there are a number of private weather services \noffered and that some highly specialized and concentrated segments of \nagriculture employ them. However, I am informed that these rely totally \non the data provided by the National Weather Service as the basis for \ntheir specialized services. Regardless, farmers are incapable at the \npresent time to assume the functions of government privately even if \nthey could afford the services.\n  Therefore, I strongly support Senator Cochran's attempt to restore \nfunding for the Agricultural Weather Service Centers at Stoneville, MS, \nand at Auburn, AL. I urge my colleagues to support the Cochran \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2876\n\n (Purpose: To restore funding for trade adjustment assistance centers)\n\n       On page 68, line 19, insert ``, $7,500,000 of which shall \n     be for trade adjustment assistance'' after ``$89,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Levin, from Michigan; D'Amato, New York; Mrs. Hutchison, \nTexas; Moynihan, Leahy, Glenn, Pell, Murray, and Rockefeller to offer \nan amendment to restore funding for Trade Adjustment Assistance \nCenters, or TAACs as they are called. Our amendment provides that of \nthe $100 million included in the existing bill for the Economic \nDevelopment Administration, $10 million will be used to fund the 12 \nregional TAACs at their fiscal year 1995 level.\n  Trade adjustment assistance is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974 to \nhelp manufacturers who have lost sales and jobs to imports. Once \ncertified as having been hurt by imports, firms receive cost-shared \ntechnical assistance to improve their competitive position.\n  Mr. President, TAACs work. Looking at TAAC clients a clear pattern \nemerges. In the two years prior to going to a TAAC, a manufacturing \nfirm has seen declining sales and reduced jobs. After receiving TAAC \nassistance sales go up and employment increases.\n  In a study of TAAC clients from fiscal year 1990-1994, prior to \nseeking assistance, TAAC clients lost over 10,000 jobs and $630 million \nin sales. After receiving TAAC assistance, not only had the drop in \nemployment and sales been stemmed, it had been reversed. Fifty-five \nhundred jobs were added in addition to the 55,000 jobs that were saved, \nand client sales increased by $1.1 billion. Most importantly, \nproductivity, as measured by sales per employee, was increased \nsignificantly from $82,000 to $94,000.\n  Productive firms stay open for business; they continue to employ and \nhire new people. Mr. President, trade adjustment assistance is a good \nprogram. For every dollar spent by the federal government there is an \n800 percent return in terms of Government revenue.\n  As I mentioned, there are twelve regional TAACs--Boston, Trenton, \nSeattle, Boulder, Chicago, Atlanta, Ann Arbor, Binghamton, San Antonio, \nLos Angeles, Columbia (MO), and Blue Bell, PA. Each of these centers \nhave helped manufacturing firms in every State who have been hurt by \nimports get back on their feet and remain viable.\n  TAACs save private sector jobs, and, as we all know, the best social \nprogram \n\n[[Page S 14682]]\nis a good paying job, and manufacturing jobs are good paying jobs.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the TAAC which serves my region, the New \nEngland Trade Adjustment Assistance Center (NETAAC) is currently \nproviding or reviewing certification petitions from seven manufacturing \nfirms who combined employ close to 500 people. In a small State like \nVermont that is a lot of jobs.\n  The assistance is cost shared by the client and TAAC contribution can \nbe as little as $25,000. The average NETAAC investment is $684 per job. \nThat is an excellent return on federal investment.\n  Mr. President, our amendment simply directs that of the $100 million \nalready in the bill for the Economic Development Administration, $10 \nmillion be used for TAACs. We have funded this program in the past and \nthe other body has included funding in its fiscal year 1996 Commerce \nappropriations bill. I should also note that the Ways and Means \nCommittee recently voted to extend authorization for trade adjustment \nassistance for 2 more years.\n  TAACs help manufacturing firms that have been hurt by imports. TAAC \nassistance saves jobs and increases sales. For every dollar we spend on \nthis program, we get eight dollars back. Funding TAACs is a sound \ninvestment, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join the Senator from Vermont \nin his effort to restore funding for the program providing Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for companies affected by imports.\n  This has been an enormously effective program for more than 30 years. \nUnder the firm TAA program, we have established a national network of \ncenters that provide technical assistance to trade-impacted companies. \nThese centers, several located in universities, have a remarkable \nrecord in improving companies' manufacturing, marketing, and other \ncapabilities in the face of stiffened competition from foreign imports.\n  This program is a complement to the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram for workers, which provides direct benefits to individuals who \nlose their jobs because of imports. Both are part of an effort to \nfulfill a commitment we have made to American workers as we pursue our \nnational trade policy. The notion of Trade Adjustment Assistance was \nfirst articulated in 1954 by David MacDonald, President of the United \nSteel Workers, and the program was later enacted in the Trade \nExpiration Act of 1962. In 1993, when I last spoke on this floor in \nsupport of this program, I cited Luther Hodges' statement to the Senate \nFinance Committee in 1962 during consideration of that landmark \nlegislation. I find it fitting to bring that statement here again:\n\n       Both workers and firms may encounter special difficulties \n     when they feel the adverse effects of import competition. \n     This is import competition caused directly by the Federal \n     Government when it lowers tariffs as part of a trade \n     agreement undertaken for the long-term economic good of the \n     country as a whole. The Federal Government has a special \n     responsibility in this case. When the Government has \n     contributed to economic injuries, it should also contribute \n     to economic adjustments required to repair them.\n\n  Our trade policy, which began with Cordell Hull's Reciprocal Trade \nAgreements Program in 1934 and culminated with the passage last \nDecember of the Uruguay Round Trade Agreements Act, results in some \nwinners and some losers. Losers, simply because some American \nindustries have difficulty competing against companies with the \nadvantages afforded to them in other countries. However our winners are \nplentiful, and expectations are that implementation of the Uruguay \nRound agreements alone will pump an additional $100 million to $200 \nmillion into the American economy. We dare not abandon the policy. We \nsimply must assume responsibility for those whom it may harm.\n  The Trade Agreement Assistance for Firms program has been enormously \neffective in assuming that responsibility. In just the past five years, \nthe twelve regional TAA centers have collectively helped 488 companies. \nMost of those firms were in danger of going out of business prior to \nthe TAA center's assistance, and all were experiencing serious \ndifficulty meeting payroll obligations. In the two years prior to \nreceiving assistance, these 488 manufacturing companies had laid off \n10,447 employees. In the two years after TAA help arrived, however, \nthose same companies had hired an additional 5,475 workers. Their sales \nrose 24.5%, productivity increased 13%, and, as a result, tax revenues \nare up. Program organizers estimate that more than $7 in federal and \nstate income tax revenue is generated for every $1 spent on the \nprogram.\n  The TAA center at the State University of New York in Binghamton has \nplayed no small role in that success, assisting 49 manufacturing \ncompanies in my State over those same five years. While those firms \nexperienced a combined drop in sales of $27 million in the two years \npreceding TAA assistance, they now can boast increases of over $51 \nmillion in sales in the subsequent years. These accomplishments \npreserved employment for many New Yorkers plus generating jobs for 167 \nmore.\n\n  I have received numerous letters from these companies, each detailing \nfor me how timely and critical was the TAA center's assistance, and I \nwould like to share with my colleagues some of their compelling \nstories:\n  Beldoch Industries Corporation, located in Manhattan, has \nmanufactured ladies' knitwear for over 50 years under three generations \nof family management. When the company had trouble competing with \ninexpensive textile imports, Gene Hochfelder, Beldoch's Chairman, \nsought the help of New York's TAA center. The center's consultants \nidentified strategies under which Beldoch could consolidate operations, \nprovide more prompt service to customers, and successfully compete with \nforeign imports. Beldoch, with its 260 employees, has kept its \nmanufacturing in the U.S. and is experiencing great success.\n  The Beach-Russ Company, located in Brooklyn, New York, manufactures \nvacuum pumps, air compressors, and gas boosters. Charles Beach, \nPresident of Beach-Russ, writes ``The New York Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Center facilitated the obtaining of assistance in the \ndevelopment of a New Vacuum Pump to make our company more competitive \nwith low-cost foreign manufacturers.''\n  Michael Hrycelak, Vice President of AJL Manufacturing Inc. in \nRochester, writes of how the New York TAA center helped them devise a \nnew marketing plan. He adds, ``We strongly support this program, a true \nexample of a government agency adding long term value, with minimal \nshort term cost.''\n  And there are many works in progress as well. Helmel Engineering \nProducts, Inc. is a small machine tool manufacturing company in Niagara \nFalls with only 26 employees. In the face of stiff competition from \noverseas, the company has recently completed a two-year diagnostic \nsurvey and adjustment project directed by the New York TAA Center. The \nCenter's assistance allowed them to update and improve the marketing of \ntheir software, a task which otherwise would have taken closer to five \nyears and may have been altogether unmanageable for the small company. \nBut now, believing that they manufacture the best software their \nindustry can offer, Helmel is optimistic about their new future. \nJudging by the success of their fellow graduates of the New York TAA \nprogram, I think their optimism is well-founded indeed.\n  Mr. President, this is clearly government money well spent. These are \nquality companies with capable managers and dedicated workers. The TAA \nprogram's modest investment has been sufficient for them to recover \nfrom damage done by imports and remain active contributors to our \nnational economy.\n  Seventy-six of my colleagues in this body, many of whom are still \nhere today, supported our effort to liberalize trade last December. It \nwas good policy. The country is better for it, and we should not regret \nour decision. But we must also assume responsibility for its \nconsequences. I urge the Senate restore funding for this important and \nvery worthy program.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2877\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress regarding funding for \n                the Economic Development Administration)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT \n                   ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S 14683]]\n\n       (1) assistance from the Economic Development Administration \n     (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``EDA'') within \n     the Department of Commerce is an investment in the economic \n     vitality of the United States;\n       (2) funding for the EDA within the Department of Commerce \n     is reduced by almost 80 percent in this Act;\n       (3) the EDA serves a unique governmental function by \n     providing grants, which are matched by local funds, to \n     distressed urban and rural areas that would not otherwise \n     receive funding;\n       (4) every EDA $1 invested generates $3 in outside \n     investments, and during the past 30 years preceding the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the EDA has invested more than \n     $15,600,000,000 in depressed communities, creating 2,800,000 \n     jobs in the United States;\n       (5) the EDA is one of a very few governmental agencies that \n     assists communities impacted by military base closings and \n     defense downsizing;\n       (6) the EDA has--\n       (A) become a more efficient and effective agency by \n     reducing regulations by 60 percent;\n       (B) trimmed the period for application processing down to a \n     60-day period; and\n       (C) reduced its operating expenses; and\n       (7) the House of Representatives, on July 26, 1995, voiced \n     strong bipartisan support for the EDA by a vote of 315 to \n     110.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the appropriation for the EDA for fiscal year 1996 \n     should be at the House of Representatives-passed level of \n     $348,500,000.\n\n\n                  eda sense-of-the-congress amendment\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I have offered a sense-of-the-\nCongress resolution on behalf of myself and Senator Snowe and a \nbipartisan group of 18 cosponsors. I am happy that the managers of the \nbill have accepted the amendment. Our amendment puts the Senate on \nrecord in support of fiscal year 1996, House-passed appropriation level \nfor the Economic Development Administration [EDA].\n  The House level of $348.5 million dollars is a 25-percent cut from \nthe requested level, but a significant increase from the $100 million \npassed by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The $100 million is a 79 \npercent reduction that would devastate the EDA.\n   Mr. President, I do want to applaud Chairman Hatfield for providing \nthe $100 million in his committee, which was an improvement on the zero \nfunding proposed initially.\n  Before I describe the critical role of EDA and the streamlining that \nhas occurred at EDA, I want to explain the spending dynamic in our \namendment. Simply put, the House allocated more funds to the Commerce, \nState, Justice bill. This permits a higher EDA funding level without \ncutting other programs within the bill.\n   Mr. President, the Economic Development Administration has been \ncrucial to rebuilding distressed rural and urban communities in each of \nour States. Not by providing Government handouts, but by helping \ncommunities become economically self-sufficient. EDA's goal is to \ninvest limited Federal dollars so that communities can attract new \nindustry, spur private investment, and encourage business expansion.\n  EDA gets more bang for the buck by creating partnerships with local, \ncounty, and State governments and economic development entities. These \npartnerships help to provide planning, financial, technical, and \nspecialized assistance to help develop infrastructure and create jobs \nin these distressed areas.\n  In fact, for every EDA dollar invested, more than $3 in outside \ninvestment has been generated. In the last 30 years, EDA has invested \nover $15 billion in local communities in need of financial assistance. \nThis investment has resulted in the creation or the retention of more \nthan 2.8 million American jobs.\n  One of EDA's key functions is to help communities recover from \nnatural disasters. EDA played a pivotal role in the State of Florida \nafter Hurricane Andrew, in South Carolina and North Carolina after \nHurricane Hugo, and in Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, \nMinnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin after the Midwest \nflooding of 1992. After the emergency management people leave, EDA is \nthe only governmental agency that remains to help devastated \ncommunities rebuild.\n  Perhaps the largest and best-known mission of EDA is in the field of \ndefense conversion. EDA is life support for base closure towns \nsearching for new direction and new life after the cold war.\n  In 1988, 1991, and 1993 we closed 250 military bases across America. \nJust months ago, the 1995 Base Closure Commission recommended the \nclosing or the realignment of another 130 bases. Communities \nsurrounding these bases and defense factories being down-sized face \nmassive revenue and job losses. EDA is often the only place cities and \ntowns can turn for help in getting back on their feet.\n  Since 1992, EDA has provided 173 grants, matched by local funds, \ntotalling almost $288 million to these communities. But the value of \nEDA's contribution goes well beyond the dollars spent.\n\n  A good example of how EDA helps military towns adjust is in my \nhometown of Camden, AR. In 1957, the Navy shut down Shumaker Naval \nAmmunition Depot, which was an old research and development facility. \nAfter Shumaker closed, Camden was challenged with finding a new \ndirection and source of jobs for our people. Before long, the newly-\ncreated Economic Development Administration provided Camden with a \n$365,000 grant that helped create a new technical college on the old \nNavy property. Today, I am proud to say that the Southern Arkansas \nUniversity's Technical Branch in Camden is alive and well, thriving as \na national leader in the area of robotics research. It has been a \nmagnet for defense contractor factories that now employ thousands of \nworkers.\n  Without EDA those thousands of jobs might not be available today.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to step in and provide a \nhelping hand to communities that face the loss of a military base or a \ndefense production facility. Eliminating EDA's funding in the wake of \nthe 1995 base closure round would spell disaster for the people and the \nbusinesses that helped us win the cold war but not suffer due to \ndefense downsizing.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have heard past criticisms about EDA's \nmanagement and I am sure that some of my colleagues will mention them \nagain today. However, I am here to say that EDA has reinvented itself. \nIt is more effective and more efficient. The EDA has:\n  First, trimmed application processing down to 60 days.\n  Second, reduced regulations by 62 percent.\n  Third, has cut the processing time for grant applications by 50 \npercent and delegated more decisionmaking responsibility to regional \noffices.\n  Fourth, developed a single application form that can be used for all \nEDA programs.\n  Fifth, reduced administrative expenses in half from 13.6 percent in \nfiscal year 1989 to 6.6 percent in fiscal year 1995.\n  Sixth, in fiscal year 1996, the EDA will further reduce its staff \nfrom 350 to 309.\n  On July 26, 1995, Congressman Hefley of Colorado introduced an \namendment in the House of Representatives which would have eliminated \nthe funding for EDA. This amendment failed by a vote of 315 to 110. By \nthis vote, both Republicans and Democrats voiced their support for the \nmany successes that the EDA has accomplished in communities across the \nUnited States and for EDA's management.\n  Mr. President, I have letters of support for the Pryor/Snowe \namendment from the National Association of Development Organizations \nand the National Association of Installation Developers that I would \nlike included in the Record following my remarks.\n  Again, I would like to thank the managers for accepting the \namendment. It was clear to all that a much higher funding level for EDA \nis supported by a clear majority of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of cosponsors, and relevant \nletters be printed following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Current List of Cosponsors\n\n       Senator Baucus.\n       Senator Warner.\n       Senator Boxer.\n       Senator Robb.\n       Senator Breaux.\n       Senator Dodd.\n       Senator Daschle.\n       Senator Moynihan.\n       Senator D'Amato.\n       Senator Bingaman.\n       Senator Harkin.\n\n[[Page S 14684]]\n\n       Senator Cohen.\n       Senator Rockefeller.\n       Senator Bumpers.\n       Senator Lieberman.\n       Senator Levin.\n       Senator Ford.\n       Senator Lugar.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n            National Association of Development Organizations,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: On behalf of the members of the \n     National Association of Development Organizations (NADO), I \n     am writing in support of your Sense of the Congress Amendment \n     urging the Senate to accept the House-passed funding level \n     for the Economic Development Administration (EDA).\n       As organizations representing local governments that served \n     distressed communities, NADO members understand the \n     importance of EDA assistance--and of an adequately funded \n     EDA. Distressed communities, through help from EDA, have \n     access to the professional capacity and planning \n     capabilities, infrastructure grants, business development \n     programs, and disaster and defense adjustment assistance that \n     they need to battle economic disruption--whether it be \n     chronic or sudden and unexpected. Distressed communities \n     depend on EDA assistance. They need adequate funding for EDA \n     if they are to have any chance to develop economically.\n       EDA is not a hand-out: EDA is a federal program that \n     attracts local funds--every EDA dollar invested leverages \n     three local dollars; and EDA creates long-term private sector \n     jobs that puts people to work--2.8 million people have been \n     put to work through EDA assistance.\n       NADO members realize that difficult choices must be made to \n     help balance the budget. As a result, we understand the need \n     for cuts to EDA funding made by the House. H.R. 2076, as \n     approved by the House of Representatives, cuts EDA funding by \n     21 percent from current funding levels--a considerable \n     reduction. However, further cuts would significantly inhibit \n     EDA's ability to assist distressed communities. The \n     communities that EDA serves are those that can least afford \n     reductions.\n       The House of Representatives agrees: by a 315-110 vote, \n     representatives overwhelmingly rejected an attempt to \n     eliminate EDA funding. Voting in support of EDA was a \n     majority of the Republican caucus (including a majority of \n     the freshman Republican class) as well as a majority of the \n     Democratic caucus. We urge senators to join with you, Senator \n     Olympia Snowe and others in showing support of adequate \n     funding for this essential program by cosponsoring your \n     amendment and voting for it on the floor.\n       NADO members endorse the Pryor/Snowe amendment and urge all \n     senators to vote for it. We appreciate your leadership on \n     this crucial issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    James C. Tonn,\n            NADO President and Executive Director, Middle Georgia \n     Regional Development Center, Macon.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                      Installation Developers,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 20, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: The National Association of \n     Installation Developers (NAID) supports your efforts to \n     maintain funding for the Economic Development Administration \n     (EDA). As you know, NAID is an organization dedicated to \n     helping communities that have had their local military bases \n     closed or designated for realignment. NAID is comprised of \n     nearly 400 members including representatives from communities \n     and states affected by base closures.\n       In August NAID had its annual conference in Chicago which \n     was attended by more than 450 delegates. One of the sessions \n     on the program was about EDA's role in base reuse. The \n     membership of our organization understands fully the critical \n     contribution of the EDA's Defense Economic Conversion Program \n     to successful base reuse. The EDA is one of a very few \n     governmental agencies that assists communities impacted by \n     military base closings and defense downsizing.\n       Senator Pryor, you understand the devastating impact the \n     loss of the EDA's Defense Economic Conversion Program would \n     have on communities seeking to recover from military \n     cutbacks. NAID and its members appreciate your effort to \n     preserve funding for this essential need.\n           Cordially,\n                                                       Brad Arvin,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would first like to thank my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Pryor, for his continued efforts on issues \npertaining to the Economic Development Administration [EDA] and for \nsponsoring this amendment. And I am pleased to join in this effort. I \nwould also like to thank the bipartisan group of Senators who have \njoined us in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of continued funding \nfor the EDA. The EDA is a small but important agency that contributes \nsignificantly to economic growth and job expansion. Through its \nprograms, the EDA fulfills a key function in providing State and local \ngovernments, non-profit organizations, and public institutions with \nvital economic grants and technical assistance.\n  The House of Representatives clearly recognized the vital role that \nthe EDA plays in communities affected by economic dislocation and \nincluded a significant and meaningful level of funding for the agency \nin fiscal year 1996. And although the House overwhelming voted on July \n26 to maintain the $348.5 million funding level contained in the \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee opted to cut funding for the EDA to $100 million.\n  I recognize the challenge that we face in balancing the budget over 7 \nyears and believe that all programs should be asked to contribute. \nHowever, as we choose those programs that should be either scaled back \nor eliminated, it is important that we establish priorities. I believe \nthe EDA can and should remain a priority even as it contributes to \ndeficit reduction. The House-passed funding level for EDA is $60 \nmillion less than the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1995--which \nwould amount to a 21-percent cut. The amendment we are offering would \nsend a strong message to the soon-to-be-chosen conference committee \nthat, while such a reduction is acceptable, to go further would imperil \nan agency that has proven to be a valuable source of economic \nassistance to regions all across the United States.\n\n  The debate over EDA funding is hardly a new one in Congress--previous \nadministrations have even proposed the termination of the agency. \nHowever, I have consistently fought--and will continue to fight--for \nmeaningful funding because of the critical assistance I have seen the \nEDA deliver not only in the State of Maine, but across the United \nStates.\n  Many in Congress know the real value of EDA in distressed communities \nand support the EDA. We all know that economic distress is not limited \nto simply a single city or county. Pockets of need exist nationwide in \nboth rural and urban areas. And while some may be concerned that EDA \nmoneys are spent in regions lacking requisite need, 98.8 percent of the \n603 EDA projects undertaken between fiscal year 1992 and today were in \nareas of high economic distress.\n  For 30 years the EDA has provided grants for infrastructure \ndevelopment, local capacity building, and business incentives that \naddress the debilitating conditions caused by substantial and \npersistent unemployment in economically distressed areas. Since 1965, \nthe EDA has provided more than $15.6 billion nationally through its \nprograms for initiatives ranging from natural disasters to defense \nconversion. The partnerships it has forged with local, county, and \nState economic development organizations have provided invaluable \nassistance and technical support for regions of high economic distress \nnot only in Maine, but across the United States.\n  Over this same period of time, the EDA has invested more than $182 \nmillion in 570 projects targeted to assist needy communities in Maine. \nDuring 1994, more than $14 million in EDA assistance was received by \nthe State. Included in this amount was $6 million in assistance for \nfishermen coping with the severe economic impacts of the ongoing New \nEngland groundfish crisis.\n  EDA is a true partnership between the Federal Government and local \ncommunities that fosters economic growth and stability by promoting \nsound economic development practices and carefully investing limited \nFederal dollars. The underlying philosophy of the EDA program is that \nlong-term job opportunities can best be created by providing the \ninfrastructure and other forms of support necessary for private \nbusinesses to establish new plants or to expand existing facilities in \neconomically distressed areas. And the programs administered by the EDA \nput this philosophy into practice.\n\n  EDA's Public Works Program is an excellent example of the federal-\nlocal partnership that brings this vital assistance to distressed \nregions. We all recognize that an adequate local infrastructure is \ncritical to the development and expansion of rural and urban economies. \nBy pairing federal grants \n\n[[Page S 14685]]\nwith matching monies from local communities, the Public Works Program \nhas led to the development of water and sewer systems, industrial \naccess roads, and high-skilled training facilities. All of these \nservices are essential to not only retaining existing businesses, but \nto attracting new industries to communities. In our increasingly \ncompetitive global economy, the importance of developing this \ninfrastructure and attracting new businesses cannot be overstated.\n  The Title IX Economic Adjustment Assistant Program provides \ncommunities with the most flexible tools necessary to develop and \nimplement locally-identified economic development priorities that \naddress changes that are causing--or are threatening to cause--serious \nstructural damage to the underlying economic base. Examples of such \neconomic changes include sudden and severe economic dislocations caused \nby base closures, reductions in defense contract spending, new Federal \nlaws or requirements, industrial or corporate restructuring, or natural \ndisaster. Structural economic changes may also result from long-term \neconomic deterioration as evidenced by gradual population shifts, \ndepletion of natural resources, or increased foreign market competition \nthat drains a significant local industry.\n  Under the Title IX program, communities are provided with the \nflexibility and tools necessary to organize a local strategy for \nachieving economic stability and change. Such planning may lead to \ngrants for projects including the construction of public facilities, \nroads, or industrial parks. In Lewiston, Maine, Title IX monies proved \ninvaluable in renovating the Bates Mill--a textile mill that required \nmassive renovations following its closure.\n  Finally, the EDA Planning, Technical and Trade Adjustment Assistance \nPrograms are visible examples of local-federal partnerships with \nacademic institutions, communities, and economic development \nprofessionals committed to the promotion of our nation's economic well-\nbeing.\n  As cited in a recent issue of Fortune magazine, many firms with \nstrong growth potential have very little in the way of physical assets, \nbut many intangible assets. When these firms seek capital for \nexpansion, their lack of collateral is a significant hindrance. Through \nthe utilization of a small EDA grant, the article demonstrated how a \nrecipient was able to create a formula to help firms calculate the \nvalue of these intangible assets--which could thereby be helpful in \nexpanding access to capital. EDA Planning Assistance also supports \nlocal economic development planning efforts necessary to respond to \nlocal problems and, therefore, help communities take advantage of \nopportunities at the state, multi-county, and local level.\n  Through these and other programs, the EDA has proven itself to be an \ninvaluable guide and resource for economically depressed communities. \nBased on available data, the EDA has created more than 2.8 million jobs \nof which 1.5 million were the result of public works projects. In \naddition, through the EDA revolving loan fund program, the agency has \ncreated $1.9 billion in private sector capital--which amounts to more \nthan three dollars in outside capital being generated for every federal \ndollar invested in the program. And don't be mistaken: EDA is not an \nentitlement program--rather, it is a push in the right direction for \nour nation's communities.\n  As Congress begins to make the tough decisions necessary to balance \nthe budget, let us be sure we continue to maintain a program that has \nproven itself to be both necessary and effective in its broad \nassistance to distressed communities across America. I urge my \ncolleagues to continue funding the EDA at a responsible level--and \nsupport the Pryor-Snowe amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2878\n\n  (Purpose: To establish conditions for the termination of sanctions \n                     against Serbia and Montenegro)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RESTRICTIONS ON THE TERMINATION OF SANCTIONS AGAINST \n                   SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO.\n\n       (a) Restrictions.--Section 1511 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160) \n     is amended by striking subsection (e) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(e) Certification.--A certification described in this \n     subsection is a certification by the President to Congress of \n     this determination that:\n       ``(1) the elected Government of Kosova is exercising its \n     legitimate right to democratic self-government, and the \n     political autonomy of Kosova, as exercised prior to 1984 \n     under the 1974 Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia, has been restored;\n       ``(2) systematic violations of the civil and human rights \n     of the people of Kosova, including institutionalized \n     discrimination and structural repression, have ended;\n       ``(3) monitors from the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, other human rights monitors, and \n     United States and international relief officials are free to \n     operate in Kosova and Serbia, including the Sandjak and \n     Vojvodina, and enjoy the full cooperation and support of \n     Serbia and local authorities;\n       ``(4) full civil and human rights have been restored to \n     ethnic non-Serbs in Serbia, including the Sandjak and \n     Vojvodina;\n       ``(5) the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has halted \n     aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       ``(6) the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has terminated all \n     forms of support, including manpower, arms, fuel, financial \n     subsidies, and war material, by land or air, for Serbian \n     separatists and their leaders in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia;\n       ``(7) the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has extended full \n     respect for the territorial integrity and independence of the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, \n     and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; and\n       ``(8) the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has cooperated \n     fully with the United Nation war crimes tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia, including by surrendering all available \n     and requested evidence and those indicted individuals who are \n     residing in the territory of Serbia and Montenegro.''.\n       (b) Foreign Assistance Act Amendment.--Section 307(a) of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2227(a)) is \n     amended by inserting ``Serbia and Montenegro,'' after \n     ``Cuba,''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--Section 1511(a) of such Act is \n     amended by striking ``subsections (d) and (e)) remain in \n     effect until changed by law'' and inserting ``subsection (d)) \n     remain in effect until the certification requirements of \n     subsection (e) have been met''.\n       (d) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the conditions specified in section 1511(e) of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, as \n     amended by this section, should also be applied by the United \n     Nations for the termination of sanctions against Serbia and \n     Montenegro.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment, together with \nthe distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, which \nwould require the President to certify that certain conditions have \nbeen met before United States sanctions on Serbia can be lifted. These \nconditions include an end to systematic violations of the civil and \nhuman rights of the people of Kosova; the restoration of Kosova's \npolitical autonomy as exercised prior to 1984; and an end to the \nBelgrade regime's support for Serb separatists in Bosnia and Croatia.\n  In my view this amendment is very important. For all of the \nadministration talk of peace being around the corner, the situation in \nthe former Yugoslavia is hardly peaceful--or stable. We cannot and must \nnot forget that in Kosova, 2 million Albanians are in their 6th year of \nmartial law. Not only are they disenfranchised, unemployed, and living \nwhat is at best a subsistence existence, they are victims of brutal and \nsystematic repression. The Serbian Government has deployed thousands of \ninterior police to ensure its regime of terror in Kosova.\n  Furthermore, despite his image as peacemaker, Serbian President \nMilosevic continues to support aggression against Bosnia, and the \noccupation of Croatia. The Yugoslav Army is assisting Bosnian Serb \nforces--who are still attacking Bosnian towns.\n  The sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro are essentially the \nonly leverage the United States--and the international community--has \nchosen to use to influence the behavior of the Milosevic regime. These \nsanctions should not be lifted until the situation in Kosova is \nresolved--even if a peace plan is agreed to for Bosnia.\n  One of America's key objectives should be stability in the region, \nand this goal cannot be achieved without a military balance in Bosnia \nand Croatia, and without resolving the question of Kosova. Although \noriginally Kosova was on the agenda of EU and U.N. sponsored talks on \nthe former Yugoslavia, negotiating efforts since 1992 have ignored \nKosova. This is short-sighted and a serious error. Both the Bush and \n\n[[Page S 14686]]\nClinton Administrations have publicly recognized that a conflict in \nKosova could draw in Albania and our NATO allies.\n  Therefore, I believe that sanctions should not be lifted on Serbia \nuntil a comprehensive settlement which includes Kosova, is not only \nagreed to, but implemented. We must take a long term view, not a short \nterm view, and pursue policies which can enhance stability.\n\n\n                                 kosova\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the majority \nleader to offer this amendment, which would condition the lifting of \nsanctions against the former Yugoslavia on specific improvements in \nKosova. I am concerned deeply with events taking place in the former \nYugoslavia. It is my hope that a workable peace agreement can be \nreached in the troubled Balkan region. However, I remain concerned with \nthe fragile condition in Kosova. The United States should be resolute \nin averting an accelerated campaign of ethnic cleansing and Serbian \naggression against Kosovar Albanians. I believe the legislation \nintroduced today will ensure United States policy interests in Kosova \nstand a far better chance to be achieved.\n  Briefly, our amendment would require specific conditions be met in \nKosova before lifting sanctions against the former Yugoslavia. These \nconditions include: full restoration of all civil and human rights; the \nreturn of international observers to monitor the human rights situation \nin Kosova; permitting the elected Government of Kosova to assemble; and \nbringing an end to the brutal Serbian-imposed martial law. Last year, \nPresident Clinton announced a set of conditions concerning the lifting \nof sanctions against Serbia. However, these requirements did not \ninclude improvements in Kosova. I believe the situation in the former \nYugoslavia demands that the plight of Kosovar Albanians be addressed.\n  Unquestionably, Albanians in Kosova have suffered great hardship. \nSince the Belgrade government expelled international observers, basic \ncivil and human rights have deteriorated significantly. Currently, \nSerbian-imposed martial law, institutionalized discrimination, and \norganized repression characterize daily life for the more than 2 \nmillion Albanians living in Kosova. Kosovar Albanians are denied \neducation, employment, and due process of law solely on the basis of \ntheir ethnicity. Given these dire circumstances, I believe the \ntermination of sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia should be \ncoupled with a successful resolution to the crisis in Kosova.\n  Mr. President, I have long been an outspoken advocate for Kosovar \nAlbanians. This amendment would help to resolve their current plight. I \nurge my colleagues to adopt this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendments, en bloc\n  The amendments (No. 2847 through 2878) were agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to thank several staff members. I \nthank Scott Gudes, who did an exceptional job in helping us put this \ntogether. I thank, from my own staff, David Taylor, who, in my period \nas chairman of this committee, has done an absolutely great job. I am \nvery proud of him and the work he has done. I thank Scott Corwin, Lula \nEdwards, Steve McMillin, from my own staff, to the degree to which we \nhave made a small impression on the deficit, to the degree to which we \nhave started to change the way American Government works in this one \nlittle appropriations bill. I think nobody deserves more credit than \nSteve McMillin does. I appreciate his help.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I did not think I would be thanking the \nSenator from Texas, but I do. We have really cleaned this bill up \nmaterially, substantially, and meaningfully. I do thank the \ndistinguished chairman of our subcommittee for his cooperation and \nassistance in working out a bill that, no doubt, would still be vetoed \nas inadequate, but certainly by way of balance and maintaining \nfundamental programs, such as the cops on the beat and Legal Services \nCorporation, the minority business enterprise, and so forth--you can go \ndown the list--and for saving from very, very severe cuts the Small \nBusiness Administration, Federal Trade Commission, SEC, and many, many \nothers.\n  You can tell by the participation, Mr. President, and the numerous \namendments that we have adopted, en bloc, after consideration here for \nthree full days, that it could never have been done without the \nwonderful work of David Taylor, Scott Corwin, Lula Edwards, Steve \nMcMillin, Scott Gudes, and Keith Kennedy and Jim English of our full \nAppropriations Committee. They guide us regularly in all of our \ndeliberations here.\n  So I want to make sure that Mark Van de Water and the rest are \nacknowledged, because they have been doing it until 2 o'clock this \nmorning and around the clock here this evening.\n  We are very grateful to the Members for their cooperation and then, \nof course, most particularly, my good friend, the Senator from Hawaii, \nwho kept us going, the Senator from Kentucky, our leader, along with \nthe distinguished minority leader, the Senator from South Dakota, and \nmost of all, the Senator from Oregon, the principal chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee. With his guidance within the committee \nand in the last few days, we have a bill that I intend to vote for.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Hatfield, chairman \nof the full committee. I think it is clear that without his help and \nguidance and leadership, we would not have passed this bill at this \ntime.\n  Finally, I want to thank the ranking member of the committee, Senator \nHollings. Not only has he done his usual great job, but no one has \nmissed the fact that his eye was operated on. There are very few \nMembers of the Senate who, under the circumstances, would have been \nhere doing their job. I know it has been painful for all of us looking \nat it, so it has got to be painful to Senator Hollings looking through \nit. I just want to commend him for the great work he has done.\n  Finally, before suggesting that we move to third reading, the bill \nbefore the Senate has been amended in such a way that funding levels \nfor a number of accounts are set by language contained in two or more \nplaces in the text.\n  Under the standard procedure for conferring with the House on \namendments in disagreement, the funding levels for these activities \nwould be determined by the interaction of several amendments in \ndisagreement. This would greatly complicate the resolution of \nconference on terms favorable to the Senate.\n  In order to assist the resolution of a conference with the House, I \npropose that the Senate action on this bill be presented to the House \nin the form of a substitute.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments of the Senate \nbill be deemed as one amendment in the nature of a substitute for the \nHouse of Representatives-passed bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  economic development administration\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Phil Gramm, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  My distinguished colleague from Texas can well understand the \nferocity of natural disasters. I know he remembers well the historic \n``Great Midwest Flood of 1993'' that devastated thousands of people's \nhomes, businesses, and lives throughout the Midwest, including my home \nState of Missouri. Missourians are fighters and survivors and don't \naccept defeat. After the floods subsided, Missourians picked up the \npieces and began rebuilding their lives, only to be hit again this year \nwith near-record flooding.\n  It is devastating that my fellow Missourians have had to fight and \nsurvive natural disasters. But what is even worse and more devastating \nis that my fellow Missourians are having to fight man-made disasters \ncreated by White House policy.\n  The White House policy that I am referring to was the choosing, by \nthe Administration, of the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to \nhandle \n\n[[Page S 14687]]\npart of the levee reconstruction program.\n  I believe a lot of mistakes were made by bureaucrats during our flood \nrecovery, but one of the biggest blunders was choosing the Economic \nDevelopment Administration to handle part of the levee reconstruction \nprogram. As proof of how ill-equipped the agency was to administer this \nlevee program--only one of the twelve levee projects awarded nationally \nwas complete two years after the ``Great Flood.'' Out of the eleven \nincomplete levee projects, most not even begun, six are in my own state \nof Missouri.\n  Thanks to the delay of repairing the levees, when the latest flooding \noccurred, people were evacuated, thousands of acres of farmland \nflooded, and highways were inundated. Hundreds of thousands of dollars \nwere spent trying to preserve water supplies, and countless hours of \nbackbreaking work literally washed downstream.\n  The State of Missouri, local residents and cooperative federal \nagencies have pushed and prodded the EDA into awarding contracts and \nhave even gotten the EDA to start work on our flood control projects. \nBut the EDA is still being difficult. EDA is trying to claim it cannot \nmodify the scope of projects to include damage from this past spring's \nflooding, even though this Congress has been careful to preserve \nunobligated funding for contingencies just such as my State is \nexperiencing.\n  When we did the rescission bill earlier this year we left $2,000,000 \nin unobligated balances related to emergency supplementals available \nfor projects currently in the funding pipeline such as the flood \ncontrol projects you have mentioned. I do not understand why the EDA \nclaims it cannot modify the scope of a project, if the project was in \nthe funding pipeline and the reason that it needs to be modified is \nbecause of delay of action by the EDA.\n  I ask the assistance of my good friend in assuring that the EDA will \nhonor its obligations to Missouri by making available quickly the \nfunding necessary to complete projects awarded from the Flood of 1993. \nI want to emphasize that this assistance would not be necessary if the \nagency had accomplished this mission before the flooding hit earlier \nthis year. If the matter is not revolved quickly, we risk still more \navoidable flooding and the passing of a third construction season. \nThese consequences would be unconscionable.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is my view that this situation should be solved and I \nwill work with the Senator to that end.\n\n\n             immigration and naturalization service account\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I had intended to offer an amendment to provide such \nfunds as may be available, but no less than $10 million, for a Central \nStates Support Fund. These funds are needed to provide additional INS \noffices in the central states. Additional offices are needed to support \ncommunities in their efforts to reduce the flow of illegal workers and \nto assure expeditious deportation. Senator Grassley is a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, it has been said that the border states are \nincreasingly a pass-through to reach jobs in the interior. My state and \nothers in the central corridor need help in meeting this challenge. But \nnot much help has been forthcoming. There is no INS office in the whole \nwestern half of Kansas, where the need is great. In other parts of my \nstate, the INS presence is thin. Local law enforcement, having arrested \nvans of illegal aliens being smuggled into the country, have been told \nto send them on their way because INS personnel was not available.\n  Senator Grassley, if he were not tied up in the Finance Committee, \nwould point out that in the whole state of Iowa there is no INS office, \nthough, again, the need is great.\n  The efforts of these interior states are critical to the success of \nnational initiatives to control the flow of illegal workers. Areas in \nthe central corridor that are most challenged by the flow of illegal \nworkers must have a day-to-day INS presence--for example, to assist \nlocal law enforcement in expeditious deportation of illegal workers who \nare repeat criminal offenders.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment. This amendment \nwould open a separate account, to be called the Central States Support \nFund, to assure that these needs are promptly addressed and that the \nfunds are used exclusively for that purpose.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I understand the concerns of my colleague. The needs of \nthe interior states are great, and it is my belief that these needs \nwill be alleviated by the strong Border Patrol initiative in this bill. \nHowever, I would like to be able to assist my colleague from Kansas and \nSenator Grassley in ensuring a strong INS presence in their states, as \nwell as others in the central corridor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Since funding under this bill is very tight, I agree \nnot to offer the amendment, with the understanding that $10 million in \nadditional funding will be sought in conference with the House for the \npurpose of establishing this fund. I also understands that the INS will \nbe required in the next two months to provide a plan for deployment of \nadditional personnel and offices in the central states.\n\n\n                     law enforcement support center\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am concerned that the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service's (INS) continue to develop and implement the \nLaw Enforcement Support Center (LESC). This Center is the only on-line \nnational database available to identify criminal illegal aliens.\n  The LESC is a valuable asset and essential to our national \nimmigration policy. The Center provides local, state and federal law \nenforcement agencies with 24-hour access to data on criminal aliens. By \nidentifying these aliens, LESC allows law enforcement agencies to \nexpedite deportation proceedings against them.\n  The Center was authorized in the 1994 Crime Bill. The first year of \noperations has been impressive as the 24-hour team identified over \n10,000 criminal aliens. After starting up with a link to law \nenforcement agencies in one county in Arizona, the LESC expanded its \ncoverage to the entire state. In 1996, the LESC is expected to be on-\nline with California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New \nJersey, Texas, and Washington.\n  The House and Senate Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bills do \nnot expressly provide funding for the LESC. The LESC is available now \nand is proving to be an effective resource for law enforcement \nagencies.\n  We owe it to states with illegal alien problems to support the only \nsystem available to identify criminal aliens. INS Commissioner Doris \nMeissner supports it. Commissioner Meissner recently wrote to me \nreaffirming INS' commitment to the LESC. I urge setting aside $3.8 \nmillion within the INS budget to allow the LESC to continue its \nvaluable work. Accordingly, I ask the Chairman whether the bill will \nallow INS to continue to fund the LESC at $3.8 million for fiscal year \n1996?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, it does.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                         benefits review board\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it has been brought to my attention that \nthere is an excessive backlog of longshore claims at the Department of \nLabor's Benefits Review Board and that it takes an inordinate amount of \ntime for the Board to process appeals under the Longshore and Harbor \nWorkers' Compensation Act. I would ask the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman, Mr. Specter, if he agrees that the Board should take all \nsteps necessary, including reorganization, to ensure that all appeals, \nincluding those now pending before the Board, are acted upon within one \nyear from the date of filing the appeal. If by next year the Board \nfalls short of this one-year standard, I believe we should consider \nsuspension of pay for Board employees who have not acted within one \nyear of an appeal being assigned to them.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I certainly agree that the Benefits Review Board should \ntake all steps necessary to ensure that all appeals are acted upon \nwithin one year from the date of filing the appeal.\n\n\n               Anti-Government Criminal Activity Funding\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, along with my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Burns, I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a serious law \nenforcement problem facing too many Montana communities.\n  We both received a letter from Ron Efta from Wibaux, MT. Mr. Efta is \npresident of the Montana County Attorneys Association. The association \npoints to a serious problem with a lack of prosecution resources \nnecessary to \n\n[[Page S 14688]]\ndeal with cases caused by anti-government criminal activity in our \nState. The increased demands that these prosecutions create for local \nprosecutors and law enforcement is well documented in court and law \nenforcement records and by a letter I received from Montana Attorney \nGeneral Joe Mazurek.\n  Fortunately, part of the legislation before us today can help our \nlocal law enforcement and Attorney General Mazurek keep pace with these \ndemands. As page 40 of the Committee Report states, the Edward Byrne \nMemorial State Law Enforcement Assistance Program includes $50 million \nin funding for discretionary grants to ``public and private agencies \nand nonprofit organizations for educational and training programs, \ntechnical assistance, improvement of state criminal justice systems, \nand demonstration projects of a multijurisdictional nature.'' I believe \na modest investment of these funds, approximately $100,000, should be \nallocated to the Office of County Prosecution Services of the Attorney \nGeneral of Montana. And I respectfully ask the support of the \ndistinguished managers of this bill in making this request of the \nJustice Department.\n  Mr. BURNS. I share the concern of my colleague from Montana. This is \na serious problem for our Montana law enforcement. I believe it is \nessential that a portion of the Byrne funds be allocated for this \npurpose. And I join Senator Baucus in making this request of the \ndistinguished managers of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senators from Montana for bringing this \nconcern to the committee's attention. And I will encourage the Attorney \nGeneral to award this grant if the need exists.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senators. I recognize the seriousness of \nthis situation. And I will encourage the Attorney General to award this \ngrant.\n\n\n                   funding earmarks for dare america\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I share the concerns of other Senators, including Senators \nD'Amato and Biden, regarding the DARE program. DARE is a well-managed \nlaw enforcement program that is run by DARE America. DARE is very \npopular with citizens and police officers across the country. Salt Lake \nCity police chief Ruben Ortega says DARE officers ``may be the most \nvisible symbol of drug prevention in our community.''\n  The DARE program uses police officers to teach students how to resist \npressure to experiment with drugs and alcohol. DARE is taught in 60 \npercent of America's schools, and involves over 20,000 police officers \nin all 50 States. Unlike some prevention programs, DARE is truly a \ngrassroots program. Most of its assistance comes in the form of in-kind \ncontributions of personnel and supplies. Less than 1 percent of DARE's \nbudget is direct federal money [$1.85 out of $257 million in fiscal \nyear 1995]. DARE needs that direct support, however, to run its five \nregional training centers.\n  DARE has been around for years, but recent headlines make the need \nfor it especially clear. Tuesday we learned that drug use among young \npeople has almost doubled in the past 2 years. According to former HEW \nSecretary Joseph Califano, more young people know that cigarettes are \nharmful than think marijuana is harmful. That kind of alarming \nstatistic argues for renewed diligence in this area.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I also support the DARE program. One reason why prevention \nprograms are so important is that young people are under so much \npressure to use drugs. The July 18 New York Times reported that drugs \nare the greatest problem facing adolescents, ``far outranking crime, \nsocial pressure, grades or sex,'' according to a survey released by the \nCenter on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.\n  In fiscal year 1995, the DARE America program received an earmark of \n$1.75 million out of funds administered by the Bureau of Justice \nassistance for State and local law enforcement assistance. It is my \nintention that in fiscal year 1996, the same amount of money, $1.75 \nmillion, be available for the DARE program.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is an appropriate amount, in my judgment. The DARE \nprogram will also be eligible, I believe, to receive block grant \nfunding under provisions of the Neighborhood Safety Act. I want to take \nthis opportunity to acknowledge and thank my colleague from Texas for \nhis efforts and leadership on this issue, and for his support for law \nenforcement as well.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would also like to encourage funding for the DARE \nprogram for fiscal year 1996. Drug use is rising among our Nation's \nyouth, not declining as it should be. We have a responsibility to our \nchildren to prepare them for the devastation that results from drug \nhabits. If DARE provides our children with such basic skills, it should \nbe continued. It seems to me that having uniformed police officers \nspeak directly to school children could only have beneficial effects.\n\n\n                        national weather service\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, during the conference with the House, it \nis my desire that the senior Senator from Texas will defer to the House \nlevel on funding for the National Weather Service.\n  As my colleague is aware, the National Weather Service has been \nundergoing a complete modernization and restructuring to prepare it to \ngive even better service as the Nation enters the next century. With \ntwo thirds of this modernization complete, it is not time to begin the \nrestructuring--realigning people and consolidating offices to gain the \nefficiencies and cost savings that modernization promises.\n  An especially important step in the restructuring will come in fiscal \nyear 1996--the activation of the National Centers for Environmental \nPrediction. Using the latest in communications and the best weather \nscience, these centers will streamline the way the National Weather \nService produces and disseminates forecasts. A good example is the new \nStorm Prediction Center now being organized in Norman, OK. This will \nprovide detailed guidance and coordination to the Weather Service's new \noffices around the country on all severe weather except hurricanes.\n  I believe the proper course is to fund the National Weather Service \nand its supporting laboratories at the level authorized by the House of \nRepresentatives which will allow modernization to continue and \nrestructuring to proceed as planned. Is it the Senator's intention to \nwork toward the end during conference?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I certainly understand the concern of the Senator from \nOklahoma. I strongly support the efforts to modernize and streamline \nthe National Weather Service.\n  During the conference with the House, it is my intention to support a \nlevel of funding that will facilitate this ongoing modernization and \nstreamlining effort at the NWS, including the Storm Prediction Center \nin Oklahoma.\n\n\n                  on noaa coastal zone management fund\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Texas regarding use of the coastal zone \nmanagement fund in H.R. 2076. The Committee report on page 67 describes \nusing $4,300,000 from this fund to administer the National Estuarine \nResearch Reserve Programs, similar to a House proposal. Because of the \nneed to leave at least $4,000,000 to administer the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act [CZMA], I understood that the committee intended to \ndesignate $3,300,000 for national research reserve administration, and \n$4,000,000 for CZMA administration.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator is correct. It is the intention of the \ncommittee that $4,000,000 be designated in order to fund administration \nof the CZMA Program, $3,300,000 be used to administer the National \nEstuarine Research Reserve Program, and $500,000 is left for State \nprogram development grants out of the total amount of $7,800,000 in the \ncoastal zone management fund.\n\n\n            RELOCATION OF NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee for \nentering into this colloquy with me regarding the relocation of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National \nMarine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Laboratory from Tiburon, California to \nSanta Cruz, California. The purpose of this colloquy is to ensure that \nthis important project be supported in conference.\n  I cannot overstate the importance of this project to California and \nto the marine science community in the Monterey Bay area. The Tiburon \nresearch group consists of a core of world class fishery scientists. \nRelocating the group \n\n[[Page S 14689]]\nto the Santa Cruz campus offers the opportunity to establish the \nUniversity of California system's first PhD level fisheries curriculum. \nBringing Tiburon scientists to the Monterey Bay area offers the almost \nunlimited potential of Federal, State, and private sector collaborative \nresearch, a potential that is not even conceivable in most other places \nin the U.S. or in the world.\n  Within the NMFS, the relocation of the Tiburon research group remains \na top priority. NMFS views the project not as a replacement but as a \nconsolidation initiative consistent with the recent Congressional \nguidance calling for a NOAA consolidation study. NMFS desperately needs \na state-of-the-art research facility in the central California area to \nmaintain and enhance its research activities along the central coast \nand in the San Francisco Bay area. If Tiburon were to be closed and \nstaff assigned to other NOAA facilities, NMFS would have no research \nfacility between La Jolla, California and Newport, Oregon, a distance \nof over 1000 miles and an area of critical marine resource problems.\n  NOAA and the Department of Commerce (DOC) also consider the \nrelocation of the Tiburon research group to Santa Cruz a top priority. \nLast fall the DOC Deputy Secretary David Barram publicly announced the \nplan to relocate Tiburon to Santa Cruz. NOAA followed up by setting \naside virtually all discretionary funding in the FY 1995 NOAA \nConstruction Account (approximately $10.1 million) for the Tiburon \nrelocation project. When rescission of these funds was proposed, I did \nnot object because it is my understanding that the rescission would not \nimpact, or delay, the project in FY 1995 since sufficient funds would \nremain to carry out all planned FY 1995 activities, and there was an \nagreement that the rescinded construction funds would be restored in \nthe FY 1996 appropriations process.\n  It is critically important to get additional funds for land \nacquisition and construction in FY 1996. The best current estimates \nindicate that $10 million is required in FY 1996 for land acquisition \nand to enable construction to go forward. Even in this budget cutting \nclimate, I believe an investment of $10 million in FY 1996 for a \nmodern, consolidated research facility that ensures wise and \nsustainable use of California's valuable fishery resources is well \njustified.\n  Given that it has not been possible to provide for the full $10 \nmillion in FY 1996, I would like to thank the Senator for agreeing to \nassist me in securing a placeholder amount of dollars in Conference, to \nthe NMFS Construction account in FY 1996, and for agreeing to the \nextent possible that these dollars will not impact NOAA's budget. I \nwould also like to thank the Senator for agreeing to make every effort \nto add report language in Conference giving the go-ahead on expenditure \nof the appropriated Architecture and Engineering funds.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. We will make every effort to see that this is done in \nconference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chairman very much for his help on this \nimportant issue.\n\n\n                  American Institute of Indian Studies\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise to stress the importance of continued active \nparticipation in the American Institute of Indian Studies (AIIS). AIIS \nis the preeminent organization funding U.S. scholarship in India. This \nprogram operates in conjunction with the Council of American Overseas \nResearch Centers, and is affiliated with Universities across the \ncountry.\n  Is the distinguished Senator from South Carolina aware of the \nparticipation of researchers from the University of South Carolina in \nAIIS?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for \nnoting the participation of the University of South Carolina in the \nprogram.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I say to my two colleagues that in 1974 President Nixon \nasked me to go to New Delhi as Ambassador in his second. At that time \nrelations between our two nations were somewhat strained. The two \nlargest democracies in the world should not have strained relations, \nbut we have experienced such periods in the half-century since \nindependence. One thing that I have noticed as a longtime follower of \nU.S.-India relations has been that when official contacts between our \ncountries cool, citizen to citizen contacts have successfully carried \nthe weight of the relationship. I would say to my two friends that AIIS \nis an organization which has played such a role in our relations with \nIndia.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do not disagree that well run exchange programs can \nhelp improve relations between our countries.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am concerned that the level of funding in the bill \nfor international educational exchanges will seriously impinge on the \nability of AIIS to adequately fill the research demands of U.S. \nscholars in India. I would therefore seek assurance from the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Subcommittee that the statement of managers \nfor the Conference Report of this Bill contain mention of the merits of \nAIIS and the importance of continued funding for the organization.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I understand the concerns of the Senator from New York and \nI will seek to address them in the Conference Report.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator raises an important point and I will be \nsure that his views are raised at the conference.\n  Mr. Moynihan. I thank my colleagues for their assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14645-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14689-S14697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION AND BUREAU OF EXPORT ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the \nimportance of the amendment offered yesterday by the Senator from \nOregon, Senator Hatfield, and myself in terms of its impact on the \ntrade related functions of the Department of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, over the past few years, Members of the Congress have \nbeen deeply divided on certain trade issues such as NAFTA, GATT, and \nFast Track. However, almost all the members of Congress agree that \nthere are certain fundamental jobs that the Federal Government must \nperform to facilitate international trade and to ensure that U.S. \ncompanies are competitive in the global marketplace.\n  We must enforce our trade laws so that U.S. jobs are not lost to \nforeign competitors who are subsidized by their governments, or who \nengage in predatory practices.\n  We must monitor and enforce our trade agreements with other \ncountries.\n  We must produce detailed industrial sector analysis so that both \nbusinesses and the government can make sound policy decisions.\n  The International Trade Administration within the Department of \nCommerce is the nerve center of all these activities.\n  The Committee reported bill gutted our International Trade \nAdministration. It cut the agency $46.5 million below the fiscal year \n1995 level and below the level set by the Contract for America House. \nThe Committee report provided no details on how such a large reduction \nwould actually be apportioned within ITA. What Senator Hatfield and I \nand others did yesterday was to bring the ITA back to a freeze. This \nwas a bipartisan amendment. And, I should note, support for ITA has \nalways been bipartisan.\n  Mr. President, the ITA is made up of four separate agencies:\n  First; the United States Foreign and Commercial Service.\n  The Foreign Commercial Service officers are our advocates overseas. \nThey operate offices in 69 countries and they have a network of 73 \noffices across America. Overseas, they serve directly under our \nAmbassadors. Our Foreign Commercial Officers are the folks who hustle \nto ensure that U.S. firms get fair treatment while competing for \nforeign contracts, and who help small- to medium-sized U.S. companies \nwork through the maze of foreign regulations and other barriers. They \nenable U.S. businesses to gain access to their worldwide network \noverseas, and they provide information to business owners concerning \nvarious foreign markets. During the past few years, these centers have \nbeen collocated with personnel from the Small Business Administration \nand the Export Import Bank.\n  Second; trade development.\n  The Trade Development section of ITA provides analysis and \ninformation \n\n[[Page S 14690]]\non industry sectors. It monitors, analyzes, and provides information on \nhundreds of industries, from the most basic to the emerging high-\ntechnology industries. This expertise, which is found nowhere else, \ninside or outside the Federal Government--is essential to getting U.S. \ngoods and services into foreign markets. The expertise at Trade \nDevelopment is also critical to the negotiation and enforcement of \ninternational trade agreements.\n  Third; the International Economic Policy Office.\n  The International Economic Policy office is responsible for trade \npolicy development and trade negotiations. IEP operates regional and \ncountry desks. It monitors foreign compliance with bilateral and \nmultilateral trade agreements and intellectual property rights.\n  Fourth; the Import Administration.\n  The Import Administration is responsible for carrying out U.S. anti-\ndumping and countervailing duty laws to provide remedies for U.S. \nbusinesses injured by unfair competition. The Import Administration \nalso participates in negotiations to promote fair trade in specific \nsectors such as steel, aircraft, and shipbuilding.\n  Mr. President, in 1995, the United States will post a record trade \ndeficit. And since March, the U.S. has lost 188,000 manufacturing jobs. \nThe proposed a $46.5 million cut to the ITA would only add to the \ndeterioration in our balance of trade and the loss of good jobs.\n  Virtually every industrial nation of the world provides support for \nexports. To compete, America must do the same. Recognizing this, we \nhave been trying to beef up export promotion, first with the support of \nPresident Bush and now with the support of President Clinton. Why? \nBecause at the levels we are now spending, we are way behind the \nJapanese, Germans, French, and British. We spend less and have less \npeople advancing and advocating U.S. exports than do any of these other \ncompetitors.\n  ITA's export promotion programs return $10.40 to the Treasury for \nevery dollar invested in export promotion. And over the past 2 years, \nITA, through its new Advocacy Center, has been cranked up as never \nbefore and has helped American companies sell over $24 billion in \nAmerican goods and services. Through its Big Emerging Markets \ninitiative, ITA has worked hand in hand with the private sector in \naccessing new markets. And through its toll-free number (1-800-USA-\nTRADE), ITA has responded to about 60,000 calls per year for export \nassistance--90 percent from small businesses.\n  The Committee reported bill would have seriously hindered our efforts \nto promote U.S. exports. The Foreign Commercial Service would have been \nforced to close offices in States with lower volume of exports, such as \nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, \nKentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New \nMexico, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, South Carolina, Utah, \nVermont, and West Virginia.\n  If we had allowed the cut to stand, we would have rolled back the \nprogress that we have made overseas in the last few years. Namely, we \nwould have had to close our new offices in Eastern Europe and in the \nNewly Independent States that formerly made up the Soviet Union. The \nBig Emerging Markets initiative would have been terminated, \nsurrendering growing markets to the French and Japanese in such markets \nas China, Vietnam, Argentina, and India. I say to my colleagues, go to \nthese countries and look at what our competitors are doing.\n  In the area of trade negotiations, the proposed reduction would have \ndebilitated our trade negotiators. ITA, and principally its Trade \nDevelopment Office, serves as staff to the U.S. Trade Representative, \nand often the ITA itself takes the lead in trade talks. We cannot cut \noff this critical support at the very time that multilateral and \nbilateral trade issues with Japan, Europe, Asia, and the Western \nHemisphere require increased attention. Absent the Hatfield-Hollings \namendment, analytical support and marketing assistance from industry \nspecialists would have been reduced by at least 25 percent under the \nCommittee reported mark, and desk coverage of some thirty countries \nwould have ceased.\n  Cutting ITA would also cripple our ability to monitor and enforce \nexisting trade agreements. For example, the ITA is the lead agency in \nmonitoring the recently completed U.S.-Japan auto parts agreement and \nthe Medical Technology Agreement with Japan.\n  Finally, and of greatest concern to me, is the Import \nAdministration's ability to fulfill statutory obligations. We must not \nundermines the effectiveness of U.S. antidumping and countervailing \nduty laws. We must provide ITA with adequate resources to verify \nforeign producer data, which is so essential to determining whether \ndumping or foreign subsidies exist. Scaling back the Import \nAdministration only means that foreign producers will find it easier to \nevade import orders, leading directly to a loss of U.S. jobs.\n  Mr. President, the amendment passed last night also provides $8.1 \nmillion to the Bureau of Export Administration, or BXA, to restore that \nagency back to a freeze and to the House-passed level. BXA performs the \nessential task of processing export license applications and enforcing \nour Nation's export control laws. BXA, in essence, is the cop on the \ninternational beat who keeps critical technologies out of the hands of \nbad actors. As one BXA official noted, ``If you wake up and the bomb \nhasn't been detonated, we've done our job.''\n  The 21 percent cut to BXA in the Committee-reported bill would have \nthrown the brakes on BXA's timely and efficient operation of its \nmission. Such a large cut would endanger our national security by \ngutting enforcement and hurt U.S. exporters by slowing down the \nlicensing process.\n  Specifically, BXA's capacity to investigate national security and \nnonproliferation cases would have been cut in half, down from 1600 \ncases per year to 800 cases. The cut would also have forced BXA to \nclose five of its regional enforcement offices, including those in \nnorthern California, the Northwest, the upper Midwest, and the middle \nAtlantic regions. In addition, BXA would not have had the resources \nnecessary to fully monitor antiboycott regulations such as the \nregulations to prevent U.S. companies from cooperating with the Arab \nLeague boycott of Israel.\n  Unnecessary delays in export licensing means that U.S. businesses \nlose out on sales to foreign competitors. Members of Congress should \nremember that BXA already took a hefty budget cut in the 1990's, \nshrinking from over 500 employees down to its current level of 321. BXA \nhas to walk the fine line between promoting U.S. exports and keeping \ncritical technologies out of the hands of mad men. Any further cuts \nwould jeopardize our national security and would lead to unnecessary \nloss of U.S. jobs.\n  Mr. President, during debate on the future of the Commerce \nDepartment, U.S. businesses have unanimously supported the trade \nfunctions performed by the Department. While some business groups favor \nthe establishment of a new international trade agency, they have made \nclear that the new agency should continue the jobs done now by ITA and \nBXA.\n  While their views differ on where the trade functions should be \nhoused, the following business organizations are among those who have \nexpressed strong support for the trade-related activities of the \nCommerce Department: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the American Electronics Association, the \nElectronics Industries Association, the Aerospace Industries \nAssociation, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the \nRecording Industry Association of America, the Semiconductor Industry \nAssociation, and the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association.\n  In this era of economic competition, the Commerce Department is the \n``arsenal'' of business. As long as Americans engage in world commerce, \nwe need a Department of Commerce to help level the playing field for \nthese American industries and workers, to give them a fair chance to \ncompete in a world dominated by large foreign companies backed by the \nfull resources of their governments. The Senate made a wise decision \nlast night in restoring the funds to the International Trade \nAdministration and the Bureau of Export Administration.\n\n\n                    international trade association\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I would like to ask the distinguished sponsor of this \n\n[[Page S 14691]]\n  amendment, Senator Hollings from South Carolina, if he would yield for \na question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The amendment offered last night by the Senator from \nOregon and the Senator from South Carolina restores funding for a very \nimportant part of the Department of Commerce, the International Trade \nAdministration. The International Trade Administration houses many \ncritical programs that are vital to U.S. companies in the field of \nglobal trade and competitiveness. Some of the programs that are of \ngreatest concern to me at the International Trade Administration are \nthose administered by the Office of Textiles & Apparel, including the \nTextile Clothing Technology Corporation program, known as (TC)2 and the \nNational Textile Center. Am I correct in stating that one of the \nintentions of this amendment is to ensure that all the existing \nfunctions at the Office of Textiles & Apparel, including the operation \nof the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, as well \nas (TC)2 and the National Textile Center, will continue to be funded in \nFY 1996 at current year levels?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the inquiry regarding the textile programs \nfrom my colleague from South Carolina. I concur that those programs are \ncritical to the stability and competitiveness of the nearly 2 million \nU.S. textile and apparel workers nationwide, and I agree that one of \nthe purposes of this amendment is to continue funding the Office of \nTextiles and Apparel and its specific research programs at the current \nlevels. From their inception, I have supported these programs, which \nare excellent examples of public-private partnerships which have \nresulted in tangible improvements in technology for the U.S. textile \nand apparel industries.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank my distinguished colleague from South Carolina.\n\n\n                CLARIFICATION OF SENATE REPORT LANGUAGE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to clarify an issue in this \nlegislation regarding an apparent inconsistency contained in the Report \naccompanying this bill. The bill contains significant reductions in the \nAccount for International Organizations within the Department of State. \nThe Administration requested over $923 million for the next fiscal year \nfor the ICE account; this bill reduces that account to $550 million. \nWhen the Report was filed, language was included that identified eight \ninternational organizations to be zeroed out in the next fiscal year. \nThe Report specifically references that this action is consistent with \nS. 908, the Foreign Affairs Revitalization Act of 1995, as reported out \nof the Foreign Relations Committee. However, one of the eight \norganizations listed--the International Copper Study Group--was \nactually not part of S. 908. The other seven organizations were.\n  The International Copper Study Group has brought representatives of \nthe copper-producing countries together to develop statistical \ninformation to better understand the international copper market. In \nthe process, the former eastern block countries are being brought into \nthe mainstream, providing the international community with a much \ngreater understanding of a region that is a major participant in the \nworld copper market. I sponsored the legislation that created the \nCopper Study Group and know that this information is vital. Last year, \nthe funding of the Group was a mere $65,000. That seems like a small \ninvestment for the development, in a cooperative fashion, of such vital \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the conferees on the bill will review and \ncorrect the matter of the listing of the International Copper Study \nGroup in the report because it is not addressed in S. 908 as the \nCommittee report would indicate.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2814\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a matter \nregarding the Hatfield amendment number 2814 that passed by voice vote. \nThe amendment contained a total of $30,000,000 in additional funds for \nthe Small Business Administration. Am I correct in my understanding \nthat this amount includes approximately $15 million for the \nadministration of business loan programs, $1 million for direct loans \nin the Microloan Program, and nearly $14 million for salaries and \nexpenses.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator is correct, that was the effect and the \nintention of my amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator, and I further note that, with the \nincreased funding in the bill for salaries and expenses, a more \nadequate amount should be available for Microloan Technical Assistance \ngrants that was envisioned when the Committee wrote its report, and \nthat the amount should be increased commensurate with the new funding \nin the bill for salaries and expenses to ensure that the crucial \ntechnical assistance portion of the Microloan program is adequately \nfunded. I note that every hearing we have conducted in the Small \nBusiness Committee concerning the Microloan program has emphasized the \nimportance of technical assistance.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. As Ranking Minority Member of the Small Business \nCommittee, I join with the Senator from Minnesota in support of the \ncrucial importance of the Microloan Program and the technical \nassistance portion of that program. I think the Chairman for his \nclarification.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Small \nBusiness, I would like to confirm our understanding that the additional \nfunding made available to SBA is intended to reduce the impact of SBA's \ncost of funding staff reductions and terminations contemplated under \nthe Committee amendment. A sufficient amount of the additional funding \nunder the Hatfield amendment should be used by SBA to pay these \ntermination costs so the agency can get to a level of FTE's likely to \nbe sustainable next year and thereafter with the further appropriations \nreductions expected as we move towards a balanced budget. I do not \nobject to the SBA having reasonable managerial discretion on certain \nitems and programs, including those mentioned by my colleagues. But it \nis our clear intention, is it not, Senator Hatfield, that funding of \nthese first year termination costs should be taken care of as a \npriority item for SBA, along with assuring adequate loan administration \nfunding for the volume of the loan programs?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator is correct, that was the effect and the \nintention of my amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator, and I appreciate the work of the \nChairman in recognizing the importance of small business and \nentrepreneurship in our country, while responding to the wishes of many \nAmericans, including small business owners, that we make the tough \ndecisions required to balance the budget.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2815\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Texas \nfor taking such strong leadership and making tough choices to help \nbalance the budget and streamline government. But I would like to \nclarify an important point regarding the authority of the judiciary to \nexpend funds to conduct so-called gender and racial bias studies under \nHR 2076. Although the Judiciary requested a specific line item in the \nappropriations legislation for the coming fiscal year to support such \nstudies, no such line item has been included in HR 2076. Furthermore, \nin the chairman's mark, approximately $700,000 was removed from the \nCrime Trust Fund from which the race-gender bias studies could be \nconducted. Am I correct that these actions indicate an intent on the \npart of the Appropriations Committee not to fund race-gender bias \nstudies?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I appreciate those kind words. I would only say that the \nSenator's interpretation of these removals is correct. It was the \nintent of the Committee to clearly indicate that no funds have been \nappropriated for race-gender bias studies.\n  Mr. HATCH. I concur in Senator Grassley's analysis of the actions \ntaken by the Appropriations Committee regarding race and gender bias \nstudies. I rise to add that these studies have been ill-conceived, \ndeeply flawed and divisive. In my view, they threaten the independence \nof the Federal judiciary. In the D.C. Circuit, for instance, the gender \nbias study was so controversial, and so poorly carried out, that a \nmajority of judges on the D.C. Circuit have formally disavowed the \nstudy. \n\n[[Page S 14692]]\nProfessor Stephen Thernstrom of Harvard University has investigated \nthese studies and found them to be methodologically biased and flawed. \nThere are to be no funds expended on these studies in the future.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for clarifying this matter. As \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts, I believe that the choices you have made clearly indicate that \nno bias studies can be supported by Federal funds. I would also like to \nthank the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his \ncogent observations on the nature of the race-gender bias studies.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2816\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I want to congratulate Senator McCain for pursuing the \nlaudable goal of maximizing revenues for the Treasury. I asked for this \nmodification to ensure that Senator McCain's objective is achieved \nwithout undue interference with or micro-management of pending Federal \nCommunications Commission proceedings.\n  The FCC is currently considering an appeal from a decision of its \ninternational bureau which denies the request for an extension of the \nDBS permit held by Advanced Communications Corp. Before the full \ncommission is a proposal which would grant an extension of the permit, \nsubject to the condition that it be assigned to TEMPO DBS, Inc., for \nuse by PRIMESTAR Partners, L.P., which would provide the first \ncompetitive high power DBS service.\n  In addition, the proposed FCC decision would require TEMPO to \nrelinquish its permits for 11 channels at 119 deg.W, 11 channels at \n168 deg.W, and 24 channels at 148 deg.W. The decision would also \nrequire TEMPO to pay an amount to the Treasury for the 27 channels \nequal to their fair auction value. Since the FCC compromise could \nresult in payment for 73 channels, in contrast to the 27 channels \naffected by the McCain Amendment, the FCC approach has the potential to \nyield greater revenues for the Treasury.\n  The term ``adjudication,'' which is inherently broad in the \nregulatory context, is used to encompass the current proceedings at the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2842\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, but I had \nreservations about doing so. I have long been troubled by the frequent \nencroachment of the Congress on the President's authority as Commander \nin Chief. Had this amendment the force of law I would have opposed it \nwithout hesitation.\n  I also share the concerns of some Senators that the amendment might \nhave an adverse affect on the current negotiations to conclude a peace \nagreement in Bosnia. I am not as certain as others that this peace \nagreement, as the probable outlines of that agreement have been \nexplained to me, will achieve a stable resolution of the conflict. \nHowever, I think Congress should be reluctant to intrude itself in \nthese difficult negotiations. Let us reserve our judgment until we see \nwhat the final product looks like.\n  Nevertheless, it is clear that this sense of the Senate amendment \ndoes not bind the administration to take any action, and should not, \ntherefore, influence the deliberations of any party involved in the \npeace negotiations.\n  I should add that my reservations about the amendment are not nearly \nas serious or as troubling as my reservations about deploying American \ntroops to Bosnia. While I am not prepared to say that the President is \nobliged to seek congressional authorization for deploying American \ntroops to Bosnia, it would be a profoundly unwise course for him to \ntake without such authorization.\n  The American people are about to be asked to send as many as 25,000 \nof their sons and daughters to a very dangerous place. Some of them \nwill not return. That is a sad, but certain fact, Mr. President. The \nPresident should want the advice and the support of Congress before he \nundertakes an initiative as fraught with danger for American troops, \nfor the Atlantic alliance and for is presidency as is his anticipated \ndeployment of American troops in Bosnia.\n  I cannot tell the President he must seek our support, but I can tell \nhim--in the strongest possible terms--that he should. And when and if \nhe does seek our support he will have some very grave questions to \nanswer. And unless those questions--which will be elaborated in detail \nin the coming weeks--can be answered fully, and to the satisfaction of \na majority of the U.S. Congress and the American people, he should not \nsend a single soldier to Bosnia.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nCommerce, Justice, and State Department appropriations bill before the \nSenate today. This measure eliminates or cuts many programs which help \nto preserve our natural resource base, promote economic and business \ndevelopment, invest in research and development and protect American \nconsumers. In my view, it fails to provide the resources necessary to \nmeet our National priorities and to enable federal agencies to fulfill \ntheir important missions. I want to point out just a few examples where \nthe measure is particularly inadequate, unfair and unbalanced.\n  First, the bill cuts the Economic Development Administration by $310 \nmillion--or 75 percent--below the current funding level and 71 percent \nbelow the level recommended by the House. The proposed appropriation \nwould cripple EDA's ability to continue helping communities in Maryland \nand other States throughout the Nation adjust to severe jobs losses and \neconomic dislocations such as the recent round of base closures, build \npublic facilities essential to commercial and industrial growth, and \nplan and implement comprehensive economic development programs. In \nMaryland alone, the agency has pumped $151 million into the economy \nover the past 30 years, creating thousands of jobs, stimulating local \ngrowth and generating revenues from the eastern shore to Western \nMaryland. Moreover, it is estimated that each EDA dollar invested has \ngenerated more than $3 in outside investment. The cuts contained in \nthis bill will deprive our communities and business of this investment \npotential, and in the long run will exact a painful cost in lost growth \nand opportunity.\n  Second, the bill cuts the budget of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology [NIST] by $377 million--or more than 50 \npercent--below current funding levels, and $80.8 million below the \nlevel recommended by the House. It drastically reduces--by over 80 \npercent--NIST's industrial technology services which help develop and \ncommercialize high risk technologies. It also rescinds $153 million in \nfunding appropriated in previous years for the comprehensive, multi-\nyear effort to modernize NIST's laboratory facilities in Gaithersburg \nand Boulder, CO. These cuts would essentially eliminate all currently \nplanned and future upgrades and construction for NIST laboratory \nfacilities and severely impact upon the agency's ability to perform its \nimportant mission. Reports issued by the General Accounting Office, the \nNational Research Council and others over the past five years have \nidentified an urgent need for repairs and upgrades of NIST's 35 year \nold lab facilities to meet the measurements and standards requirements \nof the 21st century. John W. Lyons, the former Director of NIST, \nperhaps said it best in an April 28, 1992, letter to the Washington \nPost, laboratory facilities are the infrastructure--the roads and \nbridges--of science and technology. Funding for science without funding \nfor facilities is a losing game.\n  Third, while the measure is a vast improvement over the House-\nrecommended funding levels for NOAA, it still cuts the agency's funding \nby $230 million below the administration's budget request and some $45 \nmillion below current levels. It does not provide the resources \nnecessary to meet all the statutory requirements of the Marine Mammal \nAct or for living marine resources research and protection programs. It \ncuts NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Program by $390,000 and provides no funding \nfor oyster disease research in Chesapeake Bay--programs which are \nessential to the efforts to restore the vitality of the Bay.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to vote against this bill and I \nhope my colleagues will join in rejecting this measure and sending it \nback to committee for substantial rewriting and reordering of \npriorities.\n\n[[Page S 14693]]\n\n\n\n                 post-conviction defender organizations\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about and oppose \nelimination of the Post-Conviction Defender Organizations.\n  This debate is not, as some would have you believe, about the death \npenalty. It is about common sense and fiscal responsibility.\n  The benefits of eliminating these centers are allegedly two-fold; \none, it will save taxpayers $20 million and two, it will sped up \nexecutions by eliminating lawyers who, under the guise of providing \neffective counsel to men sentenced to death, allegedly work only to \ndelay executions.\n  While these arguments may, on the surface, be appealing to some, they \nare both inherently flawed. Elimination of these centers will do \nnothing to expedite the rate of executions in this Nation, nor will the \nAmerican taxpayers save any money whatsoever.\n  In fact, the costs of providing these services will increase if these \ncenters are eliminated.\n  Chief Judge Richard Arnold, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit and chair of the budget committee of the U.S. Judicial \nConference has testified before Congress that these centers are the \nmost economical method of providing these essential services.\n  The attorneys who presently work in the 20 post-conviction defender \ncenters across this Nation do so at substantially less pay per hour \nthan their counterparts in private practice will require to take their \nplace.\n  Resource center attorneys receive $55 an hour while court-appointed \nlawyers receive an average hourly rate of $138 an hour. Therefore, \nprivate attorneys will increase the costs of these services even if \nthey work exactly the same amount of hours as the current resource \ncenter attorneys. However, this is highly unlikely.\n  The complexity of these cases requires highly specialized skills \nwhich, frankly, you will not find in an attorney who does not devote \ntheir full-time practice to this area of the law.\n  Therefore, not only will we be paying private lawyers more per hour, \nthey will have to work additional hours just to get up to the speed of \nthe attorneys who will be displaced when the centers are eliminated.\n  GAO has reported that the cost of representing men on death row was \nnearly $20,000 more when a private attorney was used as opposed to a \nlawyer from the resource centers.\n  We will be paying private attorneys at a higher rate to work longer \nhours. This is hardly the formula for saving taxpayer dollars.\n  Furthermore, under the present system, private attorneys are often \nassisted by resource center lawyers in preparation for handling these \ncomplex cases.\n  The ability to attract private attorneys to handle these cases cannot \nconceivably be enhanced by removing the support these resource center \nlawyers offer.\n  In short Mr. President, the alleged savings of roughly $20 million \nwill quickly be consumed by the increased cost of attaining private \nrepresentation.\n  Furthermore, the argument that eliminating these centers will \nexpedite the imposition of the death penalty is equally without merit.\n  Our system of justice calls for representation of those sentenced to \ndeath. In the absence of this representation, the system is delayed--it \ndoes not move ahead.\n  As was reported recently in the National Law Journal, these centers:\n\n       Came about precisely because delays in finding lawyers for \n     post-conviction appeals delayed executions. Cases could not \n     proceed unless the condemned had representation.\n\n  The simple fact of the matter is that it will not be possible to find \nenough attorneys to handle the post-conviction caseload particularly \nwhen one considers the fact that the caseload will increase in coming \nyears rather than decrease. In fact, since these centers were created \nin 1988, 900 men have been placed on death row.\n  To suggest that the private sector can fill the void resource center \nattorneys will leave overlooks the practical realities of what this \nlitigation involves.\n  Eliminating these centers will not expedite the appeals process nor \nwill it expedite imposition of the death penalty.\n  Although critics may argue that these resource centers slow the \nprocess, the simple fact is that the delays will be worse if these \ncenters are eliminated.\n  Furthermore, there is also a larger issue. The credibility of our \nsystem of criminal justice is imperilled when we apply the sanction of \ndeath but at the same time fail to provide adequate representation to \nthose condemned.\n  Regardless of our respective views on the appropriateness or \neffectiveness of the death penalty, we should all be offended by even \nthe possibility that death would be administered in anything less than \na fair and equitable manner.\n  Many of the so-called habeas corpus reforms which were pushed through \nthis body earlier this year are predicated upon the presence of \ncompetent counsel.\n  The attorneys who work at the post conviction resource centers embody \nthe competence that our system of justice requires.\n  The post conviction resource centers provide a vital service and they \ndo so at the most efficient level.\n  If my colleagues look closely at the practical effects the committee \nlanguage will have, not only on the efficient administration of \njustice, but also on the costs that taxpayers will incur, they will see \nthat this effort will not achieve either of its stated goals.\n  The committee language is ill-conceived and misguided. It will attain \nneither of its stated goals. We should not eliminate these centers \nbased on a specious premise.\n  Acting attorney general of Pennsylvania, Walter Cohen recently stated \nthat if these centers are eliminated it will:\n\n       * * * Take away the capability of the system to provide \n     adequate counsel to death row defendants * * * You're not \n     going to have the death penalty carried out. This is one of \n     those cases where Members of Congress can talk tough but end \n     up with a very weak result.\n\n  Mr. President, we should avoid such a result, and retain the post-\nconviction defender organizations.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, if anyone wonders why people do not trust \nCongress, an answer lies in what we have done with the crime issue. \nWhat Congress is doing, Mr. President, is worse than nothing. Congress \nis, in fact, breaking a public promise to the American people.\n  One year ago last week, the President signed into law a tough, \nbalanced, bipartisan crime bill after years of political infighting. \nThat bill devoted 80 percent of its resources to punishment and 20 \npercent to prevention, and it reflected a mainstream consensus.\n  Democrats and Republicans agreed that we need to put more police \nofficers on America's streets.\n  Democrats and Republicans agreed that we need to build more prisons \nto house violent criminals.\n  Democrats and Republicans agreed on the importance of prevention \nefforts targeted toward at-risk youth.\n  And Democrats and Republicans agreed that all of this would be \nfinanced from a trust fund that dedicated money saved through \nreductions in Federal personnel.\n  In just 1 year after that public agreement, the COPS Program has \nfunded more than 25,000 police officers who go after crime where it \nhappens--on our streets. More than 200 communities in Wisconsin alone \nhave received funding and the COPS Program has enjoyed overwhelming \nbipartisan support among law enforcement in my home State.\n  But do not take my word for it, Mr. President, ask the police chiefs \nand sheriff's--mostly Republican--who apply for these grants. My office \nsurveyed these front-line people, and found that 85 percent of \nWisconsin law enforcement officers support last year's crime bill. \nMoreover, almost 80 percent specifically support maintaining the \ncurrent COPS Program, and oppose turning it into a block grant. This \nsupport comes through loud and clear throughout the State. In the words \nof one Wisconsin police chief:\n\n       This is the first time in my 17 year career that I have \n     seen the Federal Government put together a program that \n     helped small police agencies that did not bury the department \n     in paper work, and had a reasonable turn around period. We \n     have already hired an officer under this program and the \n     results are very noticeable. Our community is glad to have \n     the increased police services and at a cost they can afford.\n\n\n[[Page S 14694]]\n\n  And this kind of effectiveness has been amazingly inexpensive--less \nthan 1 percent of all COPS funds are spent on administration. How many \nother organizations--whether public or private--can say that?\n  And what will happen to this effective and efficient program under \nthe downsized block grant of this appropriations bill? The numbers tell \nthe sad truth:\n  When State and local matching funds are not spent on cops--but on \nanything any Governor could arguably label a basic law enforcement \nfunction--fewer cops will patrol our streets.\n  When $200 million is slashed from Federal funding for police \nofficers, fewer cops will patrol our streets.\n  And when the 14,000 communities that have applied for grants must \nstart over--competing with every imaginable basic law enforcement \nfunction--fewer cops will patrol our streets.\n  Fewer cops on the street--that is not what we promised last year, and \nit is not what most Americans want. That is why more than three-\nquarters of the mostly Republican law enforcement officials in my State \noppose block granting and want us to preserve the COPS Program.\n  Mr. President, Americans have every right to feel cheated if this \nCongress becomes absorbed in Presidential politics and ignores its \ncommitment to safety for the sake of a soundbite. Giving our citizens \nfewer cops to fight a growing crime problem is not only bad policy--it \nis also bad politics. Because ultimately our Government depends on the \nfaith of its citizens for support. Reversing ourselves on our \ncommitment to fulfill one of our most basic obligations--to protect the \npublic from crime--only undermines our credibility with the American \npeople. To preserve that credibility, we should all vote in favor of \nrestoring the COPS Program.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nto restore funding to the Community Policing Program which serves as \nthe cornerstone of the crime law passed last Congress.\n  Under this program, the Clinton administration has already approved \nfunding to hire and place over 25,000 police officers on American \nstreets. In just over 1 year, they are over a quarter of the way to \nfulfilling the President's promise of putting 100,000 additional police \ninto cities and towns across this Nation.\n  It is ironic, and in my estimation, unfortunate, that barely 1 year \nafter President Clinton signed this program into law we are forced to \nrevisit and attempt to preserve a program which the American public, as \nwell as law enforcement across this Nation, strongly support. However, \nthe fact that we must do so, particularly under the guise of an \nappropriations bill, speaks more clearly about the partisan nature of \nthis debate than it does the merits of community policing.\n  As has been stated many times previously on this floor, the premise \nbehind community policing is very simple and very sound. When local \npolice agencies increase their physical presence on the streets and in \nthe communities they protect, they not only deter crime, they forge \ncommunity wide bonds between the police and the citizenry--bonds which \nwill help combat criminal activity.\n  The Community Policing Program has to date provided funding necessary \nto place an additional 297 police officers on the streets of cities and \ntowns all across the State of Wisconsin.\n  The response of Wisconsin law enforcement to this program has not \nsimply come from the large urban centers like Milwaukee, but has also \ncome from rural communities from across the State. In fact, of the 297 \nadditional officers provided to Wisconsin law enforcement a great many, \n188 officers, have gone to cities and towns with populations under \n50,000.\n  While the popular misconception may be that crime affects only large \ninner city neighborhoods, a visit to small towns all across this Nation \npaints a very different picture. Mr. President, crime does not \ndiscriminate based upon population density. It is a problem for \neveryone in this Nation, regardless of where they live.\n  The COPS Program recognized the needs of smaller communities and \ntailored the grant application for communities with populations under \n50,000 to one page, so that the limited time and resources of these \ntowns would not be squandered writing grant applications. Doing so is \nbut one example of how the emphasis under this program has, from the \nvery outset, been to get police into communities across this Nation. We \nshould not be too quick to dismiss the value of having a visible law \nenforcement presence on our streets.\n  The men and women of law enforcement can and should serve as positive \ninfluences, particularly in regard to our young people. The need for \nthis positive voice is even more important than last year at this time, \nbecause the legislation we are considering today fails to fund most \nprevention programs created under the crime bill.\n  This conscious failure to do so will have, in my opinion, two \ndetrimental effects--one, it will make the job of law enforcement even \nmore difficult than it currently is, and two, it will eliminate many of \nthe positive influences that these prevention programs have on the \nyoung people of this Nation.\n  The failure to fund prevention magnifies the importance of putting \nthe police in the community working to offset the negative influences \nof drug-dealers and criminals--influences which we all must admit are a \nday to day part of the lives of many of our young people. To leave \nthese corrupting voices unanswered is a formula for disaster.\n  As I meet with members of law enforcement from across Wisconsin they \nrepeatedly extol the value and importance of prevention programs--not \njust in keeping young people out of trouble, but also in making the job \nof law enforcement easier. The police of this Nation intuitively \nunderstand what this legislation chooses to ignore--you cannot fight \ncrime without prevention.\n  While it is an abdication of our responsibility to defund prevention \nprograms, the failure to do so only serves to heighten the importance \nof integrating law enforcement into our communities.\n  However, the bill before us today chooses a different, and in my view \nill-conceived, response--a so-called block grant. Unlike the targeted \ncommunity policing program, the proposal before us does not promise \neven one additional police officer will be placed on the streets.\n  The money provided under the block grant may be utilized for any \npurpose ranging from prosecutors to secretaries to radios. Not one \nadditional police officer is assured under the block grant. There is no \nguarantee that any of this money will even filter down to the local \npolice department. While prosecutors clearly play an important role in \nour criminal justice system, and have my support, they cannot help you \nuntil you, or your family, have been victimized. The basis of the COPS \nProgram is to attack crime at the source--on the streets. This program \ndoes not fund police to answer phones or work at a desk--it funds cops \nto work the streets.\n  The Republican proposal we are asked to accept in its place has no \nfocus, no objectives, and apparently no parameters. It simply allocates \nbillions of dollars to be used for any function which is arguably \nrelated to fighting crime.\n  Past history tells us that programs such as are proposed here today \nwill not work. One need look no further than the LEAA, the Law \nEnforcement Assistance Administration, for evidence of the potential \nfor abuse.\n  LEAA poured massive amounts of Federal aid into cities and towns to \nfight crime. These unchecked funds garnered the citizens of this Nation \nsuch prudent crime fighting weapons as encyclopedias on law \nenforcement, tanks, consultants, and land.\n  I want to be very clear, Mr. President, as I cross the State of \nWisconsin and hear from the fine people of my State, I hear about the \nneed for flexibility in fighting crime. I hear about the need for \ncommunities to target community specific problems.\n  I think we should heed the concerns of the people who live with and \nfight crime everyday across this Nation. But this need for flexibility \nshould not be a pretext for an open-ended, ill-defined block grant \noffered solely to undermine a successful program administered by a \nDemocratic administration.\n  If we are truly concerned about flexibility--if we are truly \nconcerned that the needs in places like Woodruff, WI are different than \nthe needs in Milwaukee, we should fund the rural crime \n\n[[Page S 14695]]\ncomponent of the crime bill. But this legislation fails to do that. If \nwe are truly concerned, we should fund drug courts and prevention \nprograms. But this legislation also fails to fund those proposals.\n  The crime law contained many facets which could be used to respond to \ndiffering needs. And yet, this legislation fails to fund many of them. \nFurthermore, it eliminates one of the most successful and popular \nprograms, the COPS program, despite the fact that response has been \noverwhelming.\n  In addition to the 168 Wisconsin jurisdictions which have already \nreceived grants, there are over 100 pending applications from Wisconsin \ncommunities requesting funding under the COPS Program. These \ncommunities have made the conscious decision that they want more police \non their streets. If we abandon this program, these communities will be \nforced to hope that their proportional block grant allocation is \nsufficient to cover all their law enforcement needs.\n  Mr. President, the COPS Program is working. Cities and towns have \nresponded and are working with the Federal Government to put more \npolice officers on American streets. They are doing so because they \nknow that it is a far more effective response to try and stop crimes \nbefore they occur. And they know that putting police on the streets, \nworking with the community, is the best way to prevent crime and take \nback our neighborhoods.\n  The American public cannot be pleased to see that once again this \nbody is debating a policy which took 6 years of partisan wrangling to \ndevelop in the first place. The American public wants us to quit \ntalking and start responding to their needs.\n  The community policing program does just that. Although it might \ncause some of my colleagues discomfort, the Clinton administration has \ndeveloped and is implementing a sound anti-crime strategy which \naddresses this Nation's needs from many different perspectives. \nAlthough I clearly do not agree with each and every portion of the \nplan, I do support putting 100,000 additional police on our streets.\n  The ink is barely dry on the crime law, and today we are asked to \nrepeal most of it. This despite the fact that in only 1 year the COPS \nProgram has provided funding for over 25,000 additional police \nofficers.\n  Mr. President, the American people support this program. The men and \nwomen of law enforcement support this program and so should this body. \nWe should not abandon it for the failed promise of an ill-defined block \ngrant. I urge my colleagues to support putting 100,000 police on the \nstreets of this Nation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to point out that the most important \nchange in the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill just happened \nin the most quiet of ways. The Senate has just restored the funding for \nnext year's installment of the 100,000 COPS Program. This important \nprogram has already funded 25,891 State and local police officers \ndevoted to community policing. This bill now continues the 100,000 COPS \nProgram.\n  The program is continued due to the addition of an amendment I \noffered that eliminated the law enforcement block grant and restored \nthe 100,000 COPS Program. I am gratified that the amendment offered by \nSenator Hollings and myself has been adopted by the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I rise today in support of the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. The bill is within the \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation and is clean of budgetary gimmicks.\n  The bill provides $26.5 billion in budget authority and $18.7 billion \nin new outlays for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the \nJudiciary, and related agencies.\n  The Senate-reported bill is $1 million below the subcommittee's \nsection 602(b) allocation in budget authority and by $11 million in \noutlays. It is $4.5 billion in budget authority and $2.8 billion in \noutlays below the President's request, and is $1.1 billion in budget \nauthority and $739 million in outlays below the House-passed bill.\n  Under very difficult funding constraints, this is a bill that \nhonestly and straightforwardly sets forth funding priorities, most of \nwhich I support, some I may redirect in the form of amendments to this \nbill.\n  This bill provides dramatic increases in our front line law \nenforcement by providing $2.3 billion for State and local law \nenforcement and $4.6 billion for Federal law enforcement agencies and \nthe border patrol.\n  Increased flexibility for States in developing their crime fighting \nstrategy is provided through the new State and Local Law Enforcement \nAssistance Block Grant. A total of $1.7 billion will be provided to \nStates and local governments for the hiring and equipping of law \nenforcement personnel, updated technology, and crime prevention \nprograms.\n  As part of the Federal role in ensuring equal justice under law, I \nhave offered an amendment, along with Senator Kassebaum and others to \nretain the Legal Services Corporation as a provider of traditional \nlegal services with a funding level of $340 million for fiscal year \n1996, higher than both the Senate-reported and House-passed CJS \nappropriations bills, and adopting tough new restrictions on its more \ncontroversial activities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and adopt this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table showing Budget Committee scoring \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  COMMERCE-JUSTICE SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL  \n

Mr. President, as a member of the Small Business \nCommittee, I thank the managers and Chairman Hatfield for improving the \nSmall Business Administration portion of this bill. I would like to \ntalk briefly about the SBA Microloan Program.\n  The Microloan Program has been a remarkable success in its short \nexistence. It was the first small-business bill I cosponsored when I \ngot to the Senate, and I am very proud to have worked on it with \nSenator Bumpers, who authored the legislation, from the beginning. As a \nmember of the Senate Small Business Committee, and in the course of a \nnumber of visits with program participants in Minnesota, I have been \nextremely impressed by the first-hand accounts I have heard. The \nprogram is working, and the owners of the very small businesses which \nare its beneficiaries in many cases have absolutely inspiring stories \nto tell.\n  SBA's Microloan Program assists women, low-income, and minority small \nbusiness owners with very small loans--loans averaging just over \n$10,000. These are generally very small businesses, and they are very \nsmall loans. In many cases, these loans actually have helped \nindividuals to leave welfare, to start their own small businesses, and \nto make a full economic \n\n[[Page S 14696]]\ncontribution to their communities. I am sure that many of my colleagues \nhave heard from or visited with participants in this program from their \nStates.\n  In my State of Minnesota, for example, we have four intermediary \nlending organizations making small loans to small businesses and \nproviding technical assistance.\n  The Northeast Entrepreneur Fund of Virginia, MN, has made \napproximately $218,000 in loans to 56 very small entrepreneurs. That's \nan average loan size of less than $4,000. In many cases, that's all \npeople need to get on their feet, to start or expand their very small \nbusiness and allow it to succeed.\n  The Northwest Minnesota Initiative Fund in Bemidji, MN, assists \nmainly rural small businesses. Average loan size is just over $5,000, \nand the default rate is about 10 percent. Staff from the initiative \nfund point out that their default rate would be even lower, but in many \ncases they provide technical assistance to the point where the small \nbusiness clients can get bank financing. The fund then ends up \nfinancing some of the riskier operations. Still, the program has helped \nstart 56 new businesses, with a success rate of about 90 percent.\n  Women Venture of St. Paul, MN, was one of the models for this \nlegislation. They have made loans to 55 small businesses in the amount \nof $581,000. Eighty-seven percent of the businesses served by Women \nVenture are owned by women. Twenty-five percent are owned by people of \ncolor.\n  Finally, the Minneapolis Consortium of Community Developers has \nhelped 32 very small businesses with loans in amounts ranging from \n$4,000 to $25,000. I have visited with some of these business owners in \ntheir places of business. It is a remarkable program. Staff from the \nconsortium have pointed out to me that they provide an average of about \n26 hours of technical assistance to each small business client.\n  I would like at this time to enter into a colloquy with a number of \nmy colleagues concerning the Microloan Program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wellstone for his \nleadership in this area. The SBA Microloan Program really works. It's \nthe most effective welfare to work program we've got. It turns welfare \ndependents into taxpaying small business people.\n  The Institute for Social and Economic Development in my State of Iowa \nhas been a pioneer in promoting microloans. This organization headed by \nJohn Else works with individuals, helping them establish their own \nbusinesses. The institute works with them to determine if a concept to \nestablish a business is sound. If so, they help the client establish a \nsound business plan, teaching them the many skills that are necessary \nto be successful in a small business. And, they work with the person to \nsecure a loan through a bank or other financial institution. This is \ntime intensive work. But, without this technical assistance, there is \nno way microloans will produce significant success. Most microloan \nintermediaries use SBA financing to provide direct loans. In either \ncase, the program really works.\n  I have personally met with a number of people who have used the \nprogram. In many cases, they were on AFDC, food stamps, and other \nFederal assistance when they started. Now, they are operating \nsuccessful businesses, making a decent living and paying taxes rather \nthan receiving welfare benefits. Through this program, they have been \nable to turn their lives around. When we talk about helping people get \noff welfare, this is a mechanism that really works.\n  I believe that technical assistance for this program deserves to be \nfully funded.\n\n\n          EDA AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR: PUTTING AMERICA TO WORK\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment that has \nbeen offered by Senator Pryor. Like Arkansas, south Dakota is a rural \nState that has faced the challenge of rebuilding distressed communities \nand stemming the tide of outward migration. I support the Pryor \namendment for a number of reasons.\n  Senator Pryor's amendment is reasonable and prudent. We recognize the \nneed for spending cuts to meet deficit reduction targets. Senator \nPryor's amendment simply asks the Senate to support the House's funding \nlevel of $348.5 million, a 22 percent cut from fiscal year 1995.\n  Second, EDA has proven to be a solid investment over the years. EDA \ngrants have resulted in the creation or retention of 2.8 million jobs \nin the Nation's most distressed areas, areas where, quite frankly, the \nprivate sector was not creating jobs.\n  In fact, EDA resources are used as a catalyst to leverage private \nsector investments, which turn into long-term growth. EDA has \ndemonstrated a remarkable ability to attract private sector capital. In \nthe last 30 years, for every Federal dollar invested, more than $3 in \noutside investment has been leveraged.\n  The third reason to support this amendment is because many of the \nNation's smaller counties and communities rely on EDA help for local \nplanning efforts. In South Dakota, a number of the smaller communities \ncannot afford a full-time economic development director. In many \ninstances, these are the communities that need the most help. EDA \nfunding has allowed local planning districts to travel to small towns \nacross rural America, identify local leaders, and help them execute \nplans for infrastructure development or industrial recruitment.\n  Finally, EDA has taken steps to reduce bureaucratic overhead without \nsacrificing customer service. In 1994, overhead at EDA was just 4.6 \npercent. Regulations in the Federal Register have been cut by 60 \npercent. EDA has delegated more responsibility to its regional offices. \nAnd, EDA will be reducing its staff from 350 people to 309 in fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution and 13 appropriations bills we \nhave been considering in recent weeks have forced the Senate to make \nhard choices about what our country's priorities should be. If our \ncurrent budget can include $245 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy, \nwhy can it not include another $249 million for EDA? Let us be clear--\nSenator Pryor's amendment requests that the Senate support a Federal \ninvestment that is less than 2 percent of what is being set aside for \nthis country's top income earners.\n  Is providing tax relief for this group 100 times more important than \nhelping distressed communities battling base closures, defense \ndownsizings, and depressed prices for commodities? Are tax cuts for the \nwealthy 100 times more important than creating 2.8 million jobs, \nkeeping people off unemployment lines and out of welfare offices?\n  While our colleagues on the other side of the aisle point to a \ndecline in values, they are missing the point. Strong values are built \non the self-respect and economic stability that come with a good job. A \nstrong sense of community is fostered by shared economic hope for the \nfuture. There is no greater sense of values and community than in the \nrural areas of South Dakota. These towns are hungry to innovate and \nadapt to the changing economy. They are deeply committed to making \neconomic development projects work so they can preserve their way of \nlife.\n  EDA gives us the efficient investment tools to help communities make \nthis happen. And it does so while paying its own way. Taxes received by \nthe Federal Government from EDA investments exceed Federal funds \nprovided to the agency.\n  Our vote today on the Pryor amendment will reflect this body's \npriorities. Do we cut EDA funding to pay for tax cuts? Or do we invest \nin our future wisely and give distressed communities the tools they \nneed to put more Americans to work.\n  Mr. President, EDA is the right priority, and it works. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Pryor amendment.\n\n\n                              zebra mussel\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Gramm, Hollings \nand Levin for working with me to find an appropriate solution to the \nzebra mussel problem that has overtaken the Great Lakes and Lake \nChamplain. I hope Senators Hollings and Levin can join me in a brief \ncolloquy on the Hollings-Levin-Leahy amendment.\n  For Senators who may not be familiar with the zebra mussel, I want to \nbriefly describe the challenge facing the State of Vermont. Zebra \nmussels, which are tiny, fresh-water mollusks the size of my thumbnail, \nthreaten to choke off 25 percent of Vermont's \n\n[[Page S 14697]]\ndrinking water, clog our hatcheries and unravel the Lake Champlain \necosystem.\n  We did not ask for the mussels, but we got them. I was scuba diving \nin Lake Champlain this summer and was shocked to find mussels taking \nover the lake bottom, historic ship wrecks included. Three years ago we \nhad no zebra mussels--this summer I found mussels by the handful.\n  The zebra mussel problem in Lake Champlain deserves immediate and \nswift action. This pest poses a serious risk to the water resources \nthroughout Vermont, economic opportunities along the lake, and the \nhealth and safety of Vermonters. In the not-so-distant future, some \nVermonters may turn on their taps to find nothing flowing, as these \nmussels have blocked water intakes and delivery systems up and down the \nshoreline.\n  The biggest hurdle our States face is the fact that there is no \nproven control technology. It is like the State of Vermont looking for \na solution to cancer--by itself. The Hollings-Levin-Leahy amendment \nprovides a modest contribution of Federal assistance that will help \naddress the zebra mussel problem.\n  My understanding is that this amendment includes $100,000 \nspecifically for Vermont to tackle the problem. Our State Legislature \nhas appropriated millions of dollars to address the problem, and this \ntoken of Federal support will make a big difference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Vermont has been very supportive of our \nefforts to clean up the Great Lakes and is correct about this \namendment. We know first hand the challenge Vermont faces. The Great \nLakes research and control efforts have benefited Lake Champlain, and \nwe expect the Lake Champlain efforts funded in this amendment to \nbenefit the Great Lakes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with both the Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from Michigan. They have worked hard on this amendment to \naddress a problem of true national concern and scope.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to thank the Senator from South Carolina for his \nleadership on this bill, and the Senator from Michigan for his long \nstanding commitment to the Great Lakes and to freshwater issues like \nthe Zebra mussel.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I believe now we are ready for third \nreading.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third time and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis, Shall the bill pass?\n  So the bill (H.R. 2076), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move that the Senate insist on its amendments and \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the city of Smyrna, GA, \nand its outstanding Mayor Max Bacon, I rise to commend the Senate--and \nespecially Senator Gramm--for helping Smyrna and the entire Atlanta \narea in its efforts to deal with the transportation of illegal \nimmigrants once they have been detained.\n  By increasing by $12.3 million the portion of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service budget for fiscal year 1996 which deals with the \ntransportation of detained illegals, the Commerce, Justice, and State \nappropriations bill will go a long way toward more effectively \nenforcing our immigration laws.\n  In the city of Smyrna--as in many across the country--illegal \nimmigrants are placing an enormous burden on legal residents, who are \nfacing rising taxes due to the increased costs of providing health \nservices and educational programs, in addition to the loss of jobs.\n  In the Atlanta area, we have been concerned with the lack of vehicles \navailable for the transportation of detained illegals. The city of \nSmyrna is optimistic that an influx of new buses and vehicles will help \nthe INS be even more effective in removing illegal immigrants and \ntransporting them to the proper authorities. Again, I commend my Senate \ncolleagues for their wisdom, and extend my gratitude on behalf of \nSmyrna's Mayor Bacon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14689-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I rise today to once again express my \nconcerns about the so-called ``train wreck'' that might occur if there \nis a lapse in appropriations authority beyond the Continuing Resolution \nwe will be approving today or tomorrow.\n  While some have proclaimed it would be ``no big deal'' if government \nshut down, there are many, including me, who think this kind of \nreasoning is wrong.\n  By approving a continuing resolution (CR), we are acting responsibly \nand avoiding unnecessary and costly furloughs. The CR gives us time to \npass all of our appropriations bills and helps provide for real deficit \nreduction.\n  But, if we continue to play politics with government employees and \nthe American people on this issue, we are only hurting ourselves and \nthe image of Congress. Those who encourage a shutdown proclaim \nthemselves to be deficit and spending hawks.\n  Mr. President, in 1990, we had our last furlough. It happened over \nthe Columbus Day Weekend. As a result, several members of Congress \nasked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to examine the taxpayer costs \nof that shutdown. The GAO found that of the 22 executive branch \nagencies surveyed, seven reported significant shutdown costs totaling \nabout $3.4 million.\n  Moreover, the GAO examined a hypothetical three-day shutdown during a \nnormal workweek. The costs of this scenario would range from $244.6 \nmillion to $607.3 million.\n  It is foolhardy to think a shutdown is good for America. The 1994 \nelections, which gave Republicans majorities in both Houses of \nCongress, sent a clear message to Washington, DC. The message was: ``We \nare sick and tired of Congress doing business as usual. Stop the \nbickering and get the job done.''\n  I applaud the Republican leadership in the House and here in the \nSenate. We are changing the way government does business. We are, \nhowever, doing ``business as usual'' when we play politics and appear \ncavalier in attitude towards our Federal employees--both civilian and \nmilitary.\n  Mr. President, I am the sponsor of S. 1246, a bill that would insure \nthat Federal employees who work or are furloughed during a shutdown \nwill automatically be paid as soon as the appropriations bill funding \ntheir salary is enacted.\n  I have also vowed not to accept a paycheck if a shutdown occurs. Like \nthe men and women of the armed services and the civil service, all of \nus are employees of the American people. If the government shuts down \nin November after the CR expires, or because we fail to agree on a \nmeasure to raise the nation's debt ceiling, I believe that the Congress \nshould be denied compensation as well.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me say that I believe the American \npeople are looking to us Republicans to lead this country and to make \ntheir Federal government more responsive and less burdensome. We have \nweathered some tough storms in the Senate, but we are making progress \nas evidenced by passage of the unprecedented reform of the country's \nbroken down welfare system.\n  The American public, including the people in my State, are proud of \nour achievements. Republicans are moving in the right direction, and we \nare changing the way government governs. We are not posturing, we are \nworking.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the American \npeople are fed up with blustering and posturing. The American people \nare sick and tired of hearing about a ``train wreck.'' They have heard \nthese same arguments year after year. I say to my colleagues, get our \nappropriations bill passed before the continuing resolution expires. \n\n[[Page S 14698]]\n\n  Resolve to negotiate firmly with the White House over the debt \nceiling, but be realistic about what we want and what can be achieved. \nWe Republicans are leading the way against government as usual. Do not \nget snared in a political trap by recycling old arguments that make us \nlook like we are returning to the old way of doing business.\n  I say again. We are changing the way government governs. This is the \ntrack of the Republican train. There will only be a wreck if we turn \nour back on the progress we are making.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14697-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ST. MARY'S CATHOLIC PARISH\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise paying tribute to Saint Mary's \nCatholic Parish in historic Old Town Alexandria. Tomorrow, September \n30, 1995 marks a true milestone, its 200th anniversary. Saint Mary's \nstands as the oldest Catholic church in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  Saint Mary's has called Alexandria home for two centuries and is an \ninstitution whose presence has extended over many generations. The \nactual parish was founded in 1795 at a time when the seeds of \nCatholicism were just planted: Virginia was home for only 200 Catholics \nat the turn of the eighteenth-century.\n  Led by Colonel John Fitzgerald, then the Mayor of Alexandria and \nmilitary assistant to General George Washington, Saint Mary's was \nerected. In 1869, the Sisters of Holy Cross School pioneered Saint \nMary's School, which is still in existence and filled to capacity.\n  The Reverend Stanley Krempa currently serves pastor to Saint Mary's, \nwhich boasts a membership of over 3,200 families. Its ``church family'' \nis fervently committed to taking on the twenty-first century with great \nenergy and zeal. Saint Mary's family not only intends to expand, they \nare preparing for tomorrow, today: the church just successfully \nconcluded an amazing fundraising drive that will build not only \nclassrooms for the school, but assists with other renovation efforts \nassociated with the church.\n  I join the many friends and families in wishing well to Saint Mary's \nCatholic Parish. As we stand in the threshold of the twenty-first \ncentury, Saint Mary's stands as a body with tremendous outreach, Saint \nMary's stands as a credit to its church body and its locality. Saint \nMary's can stand tall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14698-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATOR MARK HATFIELD: RECIPIENT OF 1995 ALBERT LASKER PUBLIC SERVICE \n                                 AWARD\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my \ncongratulations to the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, \nupon his receipt of the 1995 Albert Lasker Public Service Award for his \n``energetic leadership and enduring advocacy in support of biomedical \nresearch.''\n  I can think of no Member of the Senate more deserving of this \nrecognition. Senator Hatfield has been unflagging in his dedication to \nthe cause of biomedical research--recognizing the importance it holds \nfor Americans today and the promise it holds for Americans in the \nfuture.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Senator \nHatfield is keenly aware of the competing demands upon dwindling \nfederal resources. Establishing priorities among a series of worthy \ncauses is a difficult task. I believe it is a tribute to his judgment \nand his vision that he has always assigned the highest priority to \nbiomedical research efforts.\n  In addition to protecting the current federal investment in this \narea, Senator Hatfield has also sought creative ways to expand the pool \nof funds which can be made available to it. I was pleased to have been \ncounted among the supporters of the biomedical research trust fund \nproposal he put forward during the last Congress and of his efforts to \nrestore National Institutes of Health [NIH] funding in the budget \nresolution this year.\n  The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, which I chair, has \nauthorizing and oversight responsibility for the NIH. Senator Hatfield \nhas consistently offered his support and suggestions for NIH \nactivities, and I look forward to continuing to work with him.\n  The Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation has made a wise choice in \nselecting Senator Hatfield  for this prestigious award.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the award citation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                1995 Albert Lasker Public Service Award\n\n\n                              the citation\n\n       As an energetic advocate in support of biomedical research, \n     Senator Mark Hatfield has made outstanding contributions. \n     Dedicated to the proposition that the health of Americans is \n     a national priority, Mark Hatfield has continually fought to \n     increase research appropriations for the National Institutes \n     of Health, and he has succeeded.\n       During the six years of his Chairmanship of the Senate \n     Committee on Appropriations, funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health increased by over $2.5 billion, an \n     average of almost 10% per year. These funds enabled 107,000 \n     research projects to receive NIH grants, supported an \n     expansion of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders \n     and Stroke, and substantially increased the allocation for \n     research on Alzheimer's Disease.\n       Senator Hatfield's vigorous leadership has been crucial in \n     the battle against proposed cuts in the NIH budget. Affirming \n     the central role of the National Institutes of Health in the \n     mission of biomedical research, he declared that, ``The NIH \n     is the cornerstone of improved quality of life in this \n     nation.''\n       Throughout his career, Mark Hatfield has sought to reorder \n     our nation's research priorities to focus on activities that \n     enhance life. Taking the time to become informed about \n     particular diseases has led him to introduce legislation to \n     create a National Advisory Council on Rare Disease Research, \n     which would formulate a strategic plan and establish a \n     national research database. He has also emphasized the need \n     to support research on Parkinson's Disease, Epidermolysis \n     Bullosa, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\n       During the 103rd Congress, Senator Hatfield achieved \n     enactment of a National Center for Sleep Disorders Research \n     within the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, and \n     introduced a bill to create a permanent bioethics advisory \n     board as a forum for discussion of ethical issues in \n     biomedicine. In a period of dwindling resources, his most \n     farsighted piece of health legislation is the Hatfield-Harkin \n     bill that would establish a Fund for Health Research, a \n     stable, non-appropriations-based source of additional \n     research dollars, from tax checkoffs and insurance premiums.\n       Mark Hatfield believes that funding for medical research \n     not only improves quality of life, but offers our nation the \n     highest rate of economic return of any other federal program. \n     If health is wealth, then biomedical research is the best \n     investment our nation can make in its future.\n       To Mark O. Hatfield, for energetic leadership and enduring \n     advocacy in support of biomedical research, this 1995 Albert \n     Lasker Public Service Award is given.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14698-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14698-S14699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE FULBRIGHT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the importance of \ninternational exchange programs at this particular point in history. I \nwould particularly like to highlight the Fulbright program and its \nenormous contribution to the enrichment of our society. The Fulbright \nprogram was created in 1946 largely with the efforts of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas from whom the program derived its name. Since that time \nthe program has sent 75,026 United States students to study in foreign \ncountries and has brought 127,093 foreigners to study in our country.\n  Forty-five years ago they sent me off to the London School of \nEconomics where, for the first time, I learned a dictum of Seymour \nMartin Lipsit, who has put it so nicely. He said, ``He who knows only \none country knows no country.'' If you use the simple analogy of \neyesight, it is two eyes that provide perspective.\n  My experience in London was certainly eye-opening. As a New Deal \nDemocrat I was surprised to find how extraordinarily suspicious of the \nUnited States they were in London. I wrote back to a friend, in a \nletter that Douglas Schoen had preserved in his book:\n\n       I get the impression Americans are not generally aware of \n     just how fundamentally we are being opposed by a small but \n     enormously vital element in British society, or just how much \n     we are being disagreed with by British society in general. I \n     respectfully submit that we had damned sure better get off \n     our intellectual asses but quick.\n\n  A point that was perhaps never fully appreciated. I only wish that \nthere were more Fulbright opportunities so that more students might \nhave the enlightening experience that I enjoyed.\n\n[[Page S 14699]]\n\n  Perhaps at no time in our history have we needed an increase in \ninternational exchange programs. We find ourselves in a world that in \nmany ways is more complex than when it was dominated by two ideologies. \nInternational exchange programs are necessary to give our students an \nappreciation of our country and its place in the world.\n  The Fulbright program has been administered by an even older \ninstitution, the Institute for International Education [IIE]. Last year \nI had the honor to address the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Forum of the \nIIE. I ask unanimous consent that my remarks from this event be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Opening Remarks\n\n                  (By Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan)\n\n       Andrew Heiskell Segan by noting the setting we're in, the \n     New York Public Library. I was brought up in this library in \n     a very important way. I was brought up into a understanding \n     of what the United States could provide for people.\n       In the 1930s, in the midst of the Depression. I shined \n     shoes, pretty much for a living. But it was a living that was \n     fair enough. I would work between Sixth and Seventh Avenues \n     at the Wurlitzer Building, in a little territorial space of \n     my own. When I had earned $1.10, which was five cents up in \n     the subway, five cents back, and a dollar for the day, I'd \n     come over here as a shoe shine boy, with a black box. I'd \n     take it in the Fifth Avenue entrance and bring it to the \n     check-in desk. It would be accepted, without comment, as if \n     it were an umbrella being presented in the lobby of a Pall \n     Mall club. I'd be given a ticket by a man in a brown cotton \n     jacket. I'd go up in that great room. I was a citizen of the \n     world and of literature. And indeed, for those purposes. I \n     was, I can never repay that debt.\n       I'm here to talk about the Fullbright experience and the \n     Institute of International Education. IIE sent me off 44 \n     years ago, in 1950, to the London School of Economics. There, \n     for the first time. I learned a dictum of Seymour Martin \n     Lipset, who said, ``He who knows only one country knows no \n     country.''\n       If you use the simple analogy of eyesight, it is two eyes \n     that provide perspective. And it was a perspective enormously \n     striking to me at that time--1950, the United States in good \n     condition, untouched by war, and, indeed, enlivened by it. \n     The recovery was extraordinary, and Europe was just climbing \n     out of the ruins. We were victorious allies. I found, though, \n     on arriving at the London School of Economics as a person of \n     liberal disposition, a New Deal democrat, if you like, how \n     extraordinarily suspicious of the United States were most \n     folks there, the academics in particular, and the Left, to be \n     specific.\n       And then came the Korean War. I was called back. We \n     mustered in Grosvenor Square, got on a train at Waterloo, and \n     in the late afternoon we were crossing the Netherlands on our \n     way, as it would turn out, to Bremerhaven, which was a \n     submarine base the Nazis had built.\n       I had brought along a library habit that had been imbued \n     here, made possible largely through the GI bill and its book \n     allowance. I brought an enormous volume of Hannah Arendt's, \n     The Origins of Totalitarianism. just then published in Great \n     Britain. This was her masterwork. I brought it along, not \n     to read, really, but to be seen reading. So, I got in this \n     compartment, as they then had in European railways--there \n     were six of us--and I opened it up. Here was the first \n     paragraph. ``Two world wars in one generation, separated \n     by an uninterrupted chain of local wars and revolutions, \n     followed by no peace treaty for the vanquished and no \n     respite for the victor, have ended in the anticipation of \n     a third World War between the two remaining world powers. \n     This moment of anticipation is like the calm that settles \n     after all hopes have died.''\n       I read that. Then I read it out loud to the compartment. No \n     one demurred. Finally, a commander, who had a Navy Cross and \n     was the senior officer present afloat said, ``There must be a \n     bar car on this train somewhere.'' And that was that.\n       I began to sense then the power of Marxism as an idea, the \n     inevitability of the clash of civilizations--the \n     totalitarian, the liberal--you could read it either way, and \n     some did. And some looked both ways simultaneously. The first \n     thing I ever published was a letter from London in The \n     Nation, in response to an article by G.D.H. Cole, who \n     suggested that the Korean War was an act of American \n     aggression, intended to invade China and the Soviet Union. I \n     said, ``No, no, no, surely that's not so.'' I got a \n     surprising amount of mail from the British, Londoners, who \n     said that's obviously right, but that's what they all think.\n       But having had this experience of the power of Marxism, it \n     became possible for me years later, in different \n     circumstances, to see its decline. Having seen it at the \n     flood tide of its strength, you saw it recede. You couldn't \n     have done that absent the international experience. And it \n     was startling to be in Washington, and see how little this \n     was understood.\n       In 1979, Newsweek had an issue on ``what will happen in the \n     1980s,'' and I wrote a small piece that said, ``Well, in the \n     1980s, the Soviet Union will break up. That's obvious.'' And \n     will the world blow up as its constituent parts start using \n     their nuclear weapons one on the other? This issue is not yet \n     resolved. I'm not aware if anyone read the article, but I was \n     then on the Intelligence Committee, and I would make this \n     argument, an argument impenetrable to the intelligence \n     community. They didn't know what you were talking about.\n       I was once, for a long period, an observer to the Strategic \n     Arms Reduction Talks, the START talks. I remember asking the \n     negotiators, when we were finished with the mind-numbing \n     details of this treaty between the United States of America \n     and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, what makes you \n     think there will be a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics?\n       Well, to them this question was not a question. They had \n     never heard it before and went right by it. When the treaty \n     did arrive at the Committee on Foreign Relations, of which I \n     am a member, it was between the United States of America and \n     four countries, of which I think I'd only heard of two. They \n     were Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.\n       I had the doubtful pleasure of asking the ambassadors who \n     were presenting this to us. ``It says here it's a treaty \n     between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., and then yet it says, no, \n     no, it's these four other countries. How do you know it's \n     with these other four countries?''\n       They said, ``We have letters.'' I said, ``Well where did \n     you get them?'' They said, ``We got them in Lisbon.'' It \n     sounded like a World War II Humphrey Bogart movie. Oh. Got \n     them in Lisbon. I see.\n       In fact, had we had a better feel for what you could have \n     learned in those years, we might not be in such straitened \n     circumstances as we are today. That failure of understanding \n     of international politics came about because of an insularity \n     about the essential fact, the opposition of ideas, and then a \n     pre-occupation with the minute, mechanical fallout of those \n     ideas.\n       This clash of ideas is not over. It now assumes yet another \n     phase. At the beginning of this century, there were two \n     commanding, universal ideas. You could call them liberal, if \n     you like, and Marxist, if you choose. The liberal idea, in \n     the general usage in nineteenth-century England, was that the \n     group identity that was called nationalist, or ethnic, was \n     preindustrial and would simply disappear as it became more \n     and more outdated and irrelevant. The other side, the Marxist \n     view, was that economic processes determine all identity, \n     that the class structure determines all social struggle, and \n     that it would be universal in its nature. The red flag is red \n     because the blood of all men and women is red. And that is \n     the universality of the class struggle.\n       Well, both ideas were wrong. Deeply wrong. And we enter \n     into an age subsequent to that, in which not the only, but \n     the most painful, the most immediate source of conflicts is \n     ethnic. It is ethnic conflict as a post-industrial \n     phenomenon--ethnic conflict as a mode of aggregating \n     interests that is far more effective than any other mode seen \n     on earth just now.\n       If you look around the world, that is what you mostly \n     encounter. We are two or three generations behind any \n     understanding of it. Just as the American political \n     establishment had no real understanding of Marxism in 1950, \n     it has no real understanding of ethnicity today. We're as \n     unprepared for Bosnia as we were for Leningrad.\n       And there's one answer to it, if there's any answer. That \n     is to go abroad and study it, and see it, taste it, touch it, \n     feel it. And there's one institution singularly devoted to \n     just that purpose. And that is the Institute of International \n     Education.\n       You were welcoming to me, a gawky and half-formed youth, \n     nearly half a century ago. There will be others like me \n     coming, possibly to your embarrassment. But with any luck, it \n     all works out, and I'm here to thank you and wish you another \n     three-quarters of a century as successful as the last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14698-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14699-S14700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF FARM AID\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this Sunday will mark the 10th \nanniversary of Farm Aid. This remarkable organization, born of the farm \ncrisis of the 1980's, has stood on the front lines with America's \nfamily farmers as farming, ranching and the rural way of life have been \nunder attack. Through the vision and effort of founders Willie Nelson, \nNeil Young, and John Mellencamp, millions of dollars have been raised \nto assist farm families beset by disaster, fund legal assistance \nprograms for rural citizens and increase national and international \nawareness of the plight of America's family farmer.\n  At the same time we are celebrating the achievements of Farm Aid, the \nRepublican-controlled Congress is making the deepest cuts to farm \nprograms in history--at the same time they are funding tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest citizens in the country. Make no mistake, a workable \nfarm program cannot be crafted under a mandate to cut $13.4 \n\n[[Page S 14700]]\nbillion from farm programs. This legislation could result in a farm \ncrisis far worse than the one that gave birth to Farm Aid.\n  The 1995 farm bill is far too important to be sacrificed this way. \nThat's why several of my colleagues have joined me in introducing the \nFarm Security Act, an alternative way to reform farm programs and \nsecure a safety net for our farmers. We have developed a commodity \nsupport proposal that would allow market-based income support, target \nbenefits to our smaller producers, and simplify programs. Unlike the \nRepublican plan, our plan offers real reform. We didn't just cut \nfunding levels by providing less of the same old programs that are \nalready too complicated, too rigid and too inadequate.\n  The goal of farm programs should be to give America's farmers and \nrural communities a fair shake. Farmers do not want a handout. They do \nnot want welfare. They want a program that reflects the principles that \nlaunched Farm Aid 10 years ago: a helping hand that lets them grow the \nbest food and fiber in the world with minimal bureaucracy and with a \ngood return on their financial and labor investments. Today, however, \nfarm programs have become, in the minds of some people who have never \nmilked a cow or plowed a field, a sacrificial lamb that can be offered \nup to fund new defense programs and unreasonable tax breaks.\n  For many farm families across the country, the organizations \nsupported by Farm Aid have been all that stood between them and \ndisaster. The counseling, educational and legal services these groups \nprovide have helped farm families navigate some very difficult times. \nIn my State of South Dakota, Dakota Rural Action, a Farm Aid-supported \ngroup, has been an effective voice for family farmers and rural \ncommunities. Through grassroots organization, educational programming \non issues from land stewardship to meatpacker concentration, and \neffective policy advocacy, they have brought the voices of farmers to \nthe halls of Congress.\n  I am deeply concerned about how rural communities across the Nation \ncontinue to whither as more and more farmers are driven off their land \nand young people find it increasingly difficult to begin farming. Now \nthat the majority in Congress has threatened to pull the rug out from \nunder our farmers again, Farm Aid and the groups it supports will be \nneeded more than ever to provide support and leadership for our rural \ncommunities.\n  The strengths of rural America have always been hard work, fair play \nand commitment to community. I applaud the efforts of Farm Aid to \nfacilitate these goals and secure a bright future for America's farmers \nand ranchers. There is a reason why the Midwest is called America's \nHeartland. It is because our farmers, ranchers and rural citizens truly \nrepresent the heart and soul of America. If we continue to take for \ngranted the men and women who live on the land and produce our food, we \nwill lose an important piece of our national soul.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14699-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, 30 years ago today on September 29, 1995, I \nwas proud to witness President Lyndon Johnson sign into law the \nNational Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act which established \nthe National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities. That historic occasion marked the beginning of a process to \npreserve America's cultural heritage and to broaden access to millions \nof our citizens in every corner of the country, Americans who would \notherwise not be able to hear a symphony orchestra concert, see a dance \nor theater production, or experience a great museum exhibition.\n  By any measure, the endowments have been a magnificent success. \nPeople are participating in our culture in record numbers. The \nendowments have made a difference in the lives of millions of children \nand their families. A cultural infrastructure has solidified and grown. \nIn 1965, where there were 46 nonprofit theaters, there are over 425 \ntoday. The numbers of large orchestras has doubled, opera companies \nhave increased 6-fold, and there are 10 times as many dance companies \nnow as there were 30 years ago. In 1965, there were five State arts \nagencies; today every State has a vibrant public arts agency, and there \nare now community arts agencies in over 3,800 cities, counties and \ntowns. Individuals who have received endowment support early in their \ncareers have gone on to spectacular achievement, earning numerous \nimportant prizes and awards, and creating works that will prove to be \nan enduring legacy from the second half of the 20th century.\n  In my own State of Rhode Island, the endowments have supported a \nMusic in our Schools program in Providence, a folk and traditional arts \napprenticeship program and the nationally-acclaimed Trinity Repertory \nTheater; aided the Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of Design \nin renovating its painting and sculpture facilities; and provided funds \nto a team of scholars at the Rhode Island Historical Society to edit \nthe papers of Revolutionary War Gen. Nathaniel Greene for publication. \nAlso funded was a partnership between the Rhode Island State Council on \nthe Arts and the U.S. Department of Education to integrate theater, \nmusic and design into the curriculum of the Davies Career and Technical \nHigh School which has shown to improve overall discipline and \nattendance at the school.\n  As further testimony to their success, the small investments in \nAmerican culture made by the endowments has stimulated an extraordinary \namount of private dollars. Since 1985, NEH matching funds have \nleveraged almost $1.4 billion in third-party support for the \nhumanities. Each Federal dollar invested by NEA leverages $12 non-\nFederal dollars.\n  As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the endowments, we are \ncelebrating our belief in a vigorous, democratic, far-reaching culture. \nThe Federal Government has a strong role to play in transmitting our \nNation's greatest artistic and scholarly achievements to the \ngenerations of the future. As the present custodians of American \nculture, we must continue to do so. It would be a tragedy for the 30th \nanniversary celebration to be marred by a reluctance to reauthorize the \nNational Foundation on the Arts and Humanities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14700-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14700-S14701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS IN LIBERIA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues the recent cease-fire agreement in Liberia. After nearly 6 \nyears of civil war, 13 failed peace agreements and protracted \nnegotiations, the leaders of Liberia's warring factions have finally \ncoalesced to form a government aimed at bringing peace and democracy to \nthis war-torn African nation. This recent peace agreement, agreed to on \nAugust 19, 1995, in Abuja Nigeria, provides the United States with a \nunique opportunity to demonstrate leadership in restoring peace and \ndemocracy to a longtime ally, as well as to prove its concern for the \nstability of the entire West African region.\n  Mr. President, I would like to begin my statement by identifying \nseveral key actors who deserve recognition for procuring this peace \nagreement: Members of ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African \nStates, ECOMOG, the West African peacekeeping force, UNOMIL, the U.N. \nobserver mission, and the President's Special Envoy to Liberia, \nAmbassador Dane Smith, I would particularly commend the extraordinary \ndiplomatic leadership shown by President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana and \nhis Deputy Foreign Minister Muhamed Ibn Chambas. I know and greatly \nadmire both men; their commitment to peace in Liberia is exemplary and \nis one of the key reasons why this cease-fire and agreement have been \narchived.\n  On a local level, I would like to pay special tribute to my esteemed \ncolleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas. As Chair of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, she is a \nstrong leader, an able manager, a model for bipartisanship, and a \ntremendous resource on issues regarding African affairs. Last week, \nSenator Kassebaum introduced amendment 2710, stating that it is in the \ninterest of the United States to ``strongly support the peace process \n\n[[Page S 14701]]\nin Liberia, including diplomatic engagement, support for the West \nAfrica peacekeeping force, humanitarian assistance, and assistance for \ndemobilizing troops and for the resettlement of refugees.''\n  I too, believe that it is in the interest of the United States to \nsupport this peace agreement, both diplomatically and financially. The \nUnited States has a special responsibility towards Liberia. Founded in \nthe early 19th century by freed American slaves, the United States and \nLiberia have had almost 150 years of continued friendship. As pointed \nout in a position paper sent to me by Friends of Liberia, in World War \nII, American soldiers used Liberian airfields and ports as a primary \nbase to supply the battlefields in North Africa and Europe. During the \ncold war, Liberia was often our only reliable ally in Africa, serving \nas a listening post and headquarters to the United States intelligence \nservices. At the United Nations, Liberia has been a dependable American \nally, consistently voting in support of United States positions, even \nwhen such actions were unpopular among other developing nations.\n  If we neglect our historic relationship with Liberia, we will \njeopardize, if not lose, our reliable foothold in Africa. A limited \ndiplomatic reaction to this peace agreement would reflect poorly on our \ncommitment to peace and democracy on the African Continent, and would \nhinder future United States diplomatic and commercial interests, among \nothers, in the region.\n  Given the current climate in Congress to paralyze humanitarian \nassistance, I believe that this situation offers an important \nopportunity to prove to critics of U.S. foreign aid that a small \ninvestment in seeking peace through diplomacy will yield significant \nreturns. By heightening our diplomatic involvement and providing modest \nfinancial support to the peace process, we can help break the cycle of \nhumanitarian need that will only continue if this disastrous war is not \nresolved.\n  American support can make the difference in securing a sustainable \npeace in Liberia and beyond. The international community looks to the \nUnited States as having the closest ties to Liberia, thus having the \nresponsibility of taking the first step in assisting this peace \nprocess. Once the United States takes the lead, the European Community, \nJapan and other governments with historical relationships with Liberia, \nas well as members from the private and public sectors, are likely to \nfollow.\n  Given our special relationship towards Liberia, our commitment to \npromoting peace, democracy, trade and human rights in West Africa, and \nour position in the international community as the only remaining \nsuperpower, I conclude that it is in the interest of the United States \nto take the initiative to develop and implement a coalition to sustain \nthe peace in Liberia. We must move quickly to provide the significant \nsupport, in terms of diplomatic engagement and where possible, the \nallocation of resources, to assist the Liberians as they move through \nthis delicate period of transition to peace and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14700-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14701-S14702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     GIVEAWAY TO SPECIAL INTERESTS IN REPUBLICAN STUDENT LOAN BILL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this week the Republican majority \nin the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee voted to cut $10.8 \nbillion from student loans over the next 7 years. This bill is bitter \nnews for students and their families, who will see their student loan \ncosts rise by as much as $7,800 per family. But the champagne corks are \npopping for banks and other special interests in the student loan \nindustry, because the same Republican majority also voted a $1.8 \nbillion sweetheart deal for them.\n  Tucked in the legislation is a series of provisions that sign over \n$1.8 billion in Federal funds to the guaranty agencies in the student \nloan program. That $1.8 billion should be used to ease the burden of \nthe budget cuts on students and their families. It should not be used \nto bestow an unjustified windfall on the special interest student loan \nindustry.\n  This new windfall comes with no strings attached. Guaranty agencies \ncan use it to build new palaces for their headquarters, or to pad the \nsalaries of their executives, which for one official already exceeds \n$600,000 a year. They can even literally take the money and run. Under \ncurrent law, if a guaranty agency goes out of business, the reserve \nfunds that it has accumulated under the Federal student loan program \nare returned to the American taxpayer. Under this new giveaway, the \nofficers and directors of a guaranty agency could close down the agency \nand keep the funds for themselves.\n  Forty-one guaranty agencies participate in the Federal student loan \nprogram. They function as middlemen between the banks, who loan funds \nto students, and the Federal Government, which bears the risk on the \nloans. The guaranty agencies maintain records on student borrowing, \ncollect on defaulted loans, and advance funds to lenders for defaulted \nloans. The guaranty agencies are reimbursed by the Federal Government \nfor those advances. The agencies are then permitted to pursue the \ndefaulted debts, and keep 27 cents of every dollar over and above the \nreimbursed amount.\n  In the course of the past three decades, the guaranty agencies have \naccumulated $1.8 billion in what are called reserves. These reserves \nbegan with seed money advanced to the guaranty agencies by the Federal \nGovernment in the early years of the loan program, of which $40 million \nnow remains. Since then, the agencies have accumulated $1.8 billion in \nadditional reserves from other sources. Ninety-eight percent of those \nreserves come from insurance premiums paid by students under the \nFederal student loan program, payments received from the Federal \nGovernment for default claims and administrative expenses, and \ninvestment earnings on the reserve funds.\n  The reserves were originally intended as a financial cushion to \nenable the guaranty agencies to have enough funds to cover defaults in \nthe student loan program. Now, however, the Federal Government bears \nvirtually all the risk on the loans, and the cushion is no longer \nneeded. There is no doubt that the reserves are federal funds. They \ncertainly do not belong to the guaranty agencies. If the Federal \nGovernment were to take back the reserves, the Congressional Budget \nOffice would score the reclaimed reserves as a savings to the taxpayer \nof $1.8 billion.\n  The Republican student loan bill, however, does exactly the opposite. \nRather than reclaiming the reserves in order to reduce cuts in student \naid or to reduce the deficit, the bill turns over to the guaranty \nagencies--no strings attached--all but the $40 million of taxpayer \nfunds originally given to the agency reserve accounts. Secretary of \nEducation Riley has called this giveaway ``an alarming development that \nwould further exacerbate the current problems in the student loan \nindustry.''\n  I urge the Senate to block this $1.8 billion Republican raid on the \nstudent reserve funds. It is unconscionable for the Republican majority \nto slash $7.6 billion from student loans, while sneaking $1.8 billion \nout the back door and into the pockets of the very people who have \nprofited for more than 30 years on the backs of students. This is \ncorporate welfare of the worst kind, and the Senate should reject it.\n   I ask unanimous consent that a letter on this issue from Secretary \nRiley and a memorandum from General Counsel Judith Winston of the \nDepartment of Education be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of Education,\n\n\n                                                The Secretary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express my serious \n     concern about a particular provision of the Student Loan \n     amendments recently passed by the Senate Committee on Labor \n     and Human Resources as part of its budget reconciliation \n     package. In particular, under the guise of strengthening \n     guaranty agency reserves, Section 1004(e)(2) of the bill \n     would have the effect of giving away approximately $1.8 \n     billion in Federal assets to non-profit and State guaranty \n     agencies.\n       An analysis of the effect of the proposed change on the \n     Federal interest in the guaranty agency reserve funds by the \n     department's General Counsel is attached for your \n     consideration. In my view, enactment of this \n\n[[Page S 14702]]\n     change would be an alarming development that would further exacerbate \n     the current problems in the student loan program. I urge the \n     Committee to reconsider this decision.\n       I am sending an identical letter to Senator Kassebaum.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Richard W.

Winston, General Counsel\n     Subject: Guaranty Agency Reserves\n\n       Earlier this week, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources approved certain changes to the statutory \n     provisions relating to the Federal Family Education Loan \n     (FFEL) Program in connection with the budget reconciliation \n     bill. One of the approved provisions would make significant \n     changes in the status and ownership of guaranty agency \n     reserve funds. If enacted, these changes would cede Federal \n     ownership of more than $1.7 billion in funds and assets to \n     state or private non profit agencies.\n       In particular, the bill passed by the Committee would make \n     significant changes to Sec. 422(g) of the Higher Education \n     Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). Currently Sec. 422(g) reflects \n     numerous Federal court decisions that the reserve funds of \n     the guaranty agencies are Federal property which is held by \n     the guaranty agency as a trustee of the funds for the general \n     public. See Puerto Rico Higher Education Assistance Corp. v. \n     Riley, 10 F.3d 847, 851 (D.C. Cir. 1993); State of Colorado \n     v.

Del. \n     1989), aff'd without opinion, 919 F.2d 137 (3d Cir. 1990). \n     Earlier this month, the United States District Court for the \n     District of Idaho reaffirmed the holding of these earlier \n     decisions that guaranty agencies do not have (and have never \n     had) a property right in their reserve funds. Instead, that \n     court held that the guaranty agencies' reserve funds are \n     Federal property and are subject to the control of the \n     Secretary of Education. Student Loan Fund of Idaho v. Riley, \n     Case No. CV 94-0413-S-LMB (D. Ida., Sept. 14, 1995).\n       The bill would essentially give away the overwhelming \n     amount of Federal property included in the guaranty agency \n     reserve funds. Most importantly, the bill would redefine \n     the term ``reserve fund'' to mean ``the Federal portion of \n     a reserve fund''. See Sec. 1004(e)(2) of the Committee \n     bill, p. 38, lines 14-16. The bill would then limit the \n     Federal property to an amount calculated under the formula \n     in Sec. 422(a)(2) of the HEA. The formula in \n     Sec. 422(a)(2) of the HEA would, in most cases, limit the \n     ``Federal portion'' of the reserve fund to the amount of \n     Federal advances maintained by the guaranty agency plus \n     interest. As of September 30, 1994, the amount of \n     outstanding Federal advances was $40 million out of total \n     guaranty agency reserves (all of which came from federal \n     sources or under Federal authority) of more than $1.8 \n     billion. See FY 1993 Loan Programs Data Book, at 65, 67. \n     Thus, the Federal government would be relinquishing \n     ownership and control of more than $1.7 billion in federal \n     funds and property.\n       Enactment of these proposed changes to the definition of \n     ``reserve fund'' would also effectively end Federal control \n     over the uses of the reserve funds by the agencies. If the \n     reserve funds are the property of the guaranty agency and the \n     agency uses those funds for purposes unrelated to the FFEL \n     program, the Department would have no authority to take \n     action against the agency. Thus, the Department would be \n     unable to take action against an agency that used funds \n     intended to be used to pay lender claims on elaborate offices \n     or high executive salaries. If this provision were enacted, \n     the strong possibility exists that an agency could choose to \n     use reserve funds for non-program purposes and be unable to \n     pay lenders' claims. At that point, the lender would then be \n     able to demand payment from the Department under Sec. 432(o) \n     of the HEA. The Department would have to use taxpayer funds \n     to pay the lenders.\n       This proposal would also provide an incentive for some \n     guaranty agencies to leave the program. An agency which left \n     the program would be able to take its reserve fund (minus \n     Federal advances and interest) with it and use it for \n     purposes unrelated to higher education or student loans.\\1\\ \n     Moreover, those agencies which have already established loan \n     servicing and secondary market operations could use the \n     reserve funds to compete with private parties which provide \n     services in this area.\n     \\1\\ Those agencies which are tax exempt non profits under \n     Sec. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code would have to use \n     the funds in accordance with the requirements of that \n     section. However, some agencies have already transferred \n     significant portions of reserve funds to associated non-\n     profit companies which may not be tax exempt and thus not \n     bound by those restrictions. Moreover, some state laws appear \n     to allow non-profit corporations which dissolve to distribute \n     remaining assets to members (generally the company's \n     directors) in certain circumstances. See 805 ILCS 105/112.16 \n     (Illinois); A.R.S. Sec. 10-2422 (Arizona).

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to \nconvey my thoughts on the closing of the fabled Boston Garden in \nBoston, Massachusetts.\n  To almost all of my constituents in Massachusetts, the Boston Garden \nrepresents the best in the world of sports. Many championship battles \nhave been waged within the hallowed walls of this magnificent \nstructure. Some were lost, most were won, but all are captured forever \nin the hearts and minds of the legions of Boston sports fans.\n  Just ask any hockey player from Northeastern University, Boston \nCollege, Harvard University or Boston University what the Boston Garden \nmeans to them and you will hear war stories about two Mondays every \nFebruary where seasons are made or broken during the Beanpot \nChampionship.\n  Just ask any of the high school athletes, whose teams were good \nenough to persevere through endless qualifying playoff rounds in order \nto play for a league championship on the Boston Bruins' ice or the \nCeltics' parquet floor, what the Boston Garden means to them and you \nwill hear innumerable accounts of a dream come true.\n  Just ask the scores of everyday people, who file into the Garden to \nsit together knee-to-knee and elbow-to-elbow, what the Boston Garden \nmeans to them, and you will hear recollections of rumors, myths, \nlegends, and lore.\n  Gallery gods, leprechauns, ghosts, and other beings are rumored to \ninhabit the Garden and wreak havoc with the fate of visiting, \nunfriendly teams. Some say they are responsible for turning up the heat \non the L.A. Lakers and trying to fog-out and eventually powering down \nthe Edmonton Oilers. Others claim they are to be credited with the \ninfamous dead spots in the parquet and the impossible bounces of the \npuck off the boards.\n  Other teams feared coming to the Garden. They declared it archaic and \ndecrepid with abysmal accommodations and playing conditions. But Boston \nfans know the truth, they feared coming to the Garden because they \nhated to lose.\n  Legends abound in the Boston Garden, and historical significance \nseemingly is a basic element of every event that has taken place there.\n  On election night in 1960, then-Senator John Kennedy delivered his \nfirst campaign address in the city of Boston at the Garden. An \nestimated 1 million people flocked to the area surrounding the Garden \nand a precious few 25,000 were fortunate enough to be inside to hear \nhis words. Many other great politicians of this century have addressed \n\n[[Page S 14703]]\nthe people of Boston from a platform in Boston Garden. President \nEisenhower, Horace Taft, Mayor James Curley, Gov. Thomas Dewey, and \nWinston Churchill are just a few who have contributed to the Garden's \npolitical lore.\n  I could stand here and talk for days on the meaning of the Boston \nGarden and the tumultuous history it has enjoyed. I could recall the \nmany games I have attended and rallies I have witnessed. There are many \nthings worth mentioning, but I am certain I would be unable to recall \nthem all.\n  Tonight, in Boston, the people will re-live all of these and other \nmemories in a ceremony full of history and celebration designed to mark \nthe closing of one of the greatest venues in America.\n  ``Havlicek stole the ball * * *, ``Sanderson to Orr * * *, ``Bird for \nthree * * *, ``Penalty--O'Reilly, ``Russell with a block, ``Esposito \nshoots, scores! ``DJ steals, over to Bird, Good!, ``Cheevers stones \nhim, ``Cousy tricky dribbles, lays it in.'' The voices of the past \ncatalogue the great moments in a history soon to be turned over to a \nnew building and a new era of sports in Boston.\n  As the lights dim for the final time, echoes will resound through the \ncity and people will think of their fondest memories of the Garden and \ncelebrate the great times enjoyed by those who were there, or watching, \nor listening, when great things happened.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14702-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14703-S14706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS REVIEW CONFERENCE: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. \n                               LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week representatives of over 50 \ngovernments began meeting in Vienna, Austria to discuss proposals to \namend the Conventional Weapons Convention, which contains the first \nlaws of war limitations on the use of landmines.\n  Fifteen years ago, the United States played a leading role in \nnegotiations on the Convention. However, despite lofty rhetoric at the \ntime, the Convention is so riddled with loopholes and exceptions, as \nwell as lacking any verification procedures, that the numbers of \ncivilian casualties from landmines has soared. This is because the \nfocus of the negotiations then was on reducing the dangers to military \npersonnel, rather than on the problems landmines cause for civilians.\n  Today, there are 80 to 110 million landmines in over 60 countries, \neach one waiting to explode from the pressure of a footstep.\n  These hidden killers have turned vast areas of land, in countries \nstruggling to rebuild after years of war, into death traps. According \nto the State Department every 22 minutes someone is maimed or killed by \na landmine. That is 26,000 people each year, most of whom are innocent \ncivilians.\n  It would cost tens of billions of dollars to locate and remove the \nmines. It is an incredibly arduous, dangerous, and prohibitively \nexpensive task. There is no way they will be cleared. The world's \narsenals are overflowing with new mines that are only compounding the \nproblem in every armed conflict today.\n  Mr. President, the meetings in Vienna began yesterday with dramatic \nannouncements by two of our NATO allies, France and Austria. The French \nGovernment announced that it would halt all production of antipersonnel \nlandmines, and begin destroying their stockpiles of these weapons. The \nAustrian Government declared that its military would renounce their \nuse, and destroy their stockpiles.\n  Earlier this year, Belgium outlawed all production, use and exports \nof antipersonnel mines.\n  I mention this because just a month ago, my amendment to impose a 1-\nyear moratorium on the use of these weapons passed the Senate 67 to 27.\n  Yesterday's announcements by our NATO allies go even further, and the \nUnited States should seize this opportunity to support them. These NATO \ncountries defy the Pentagon's assertion that modern militaries like \nours require antipersonnel landmines. Landmines are a coward's weapon, \nthat are overwhelmingly used against civilians. If the United States \nwere to join France, Belgium and Austria it would give an enormous push \ntoward the goal of ridding the world of these weapons.\n  Mr. President, I am going to put my full statement in the Record, but \nI do want to say this. This conference in Vienna presents the United \nStates with a tremendous opportunity, an opportunity that must not be \nmissed.\n\n  Fifteen years ago the Conventional Weapons Convention was signed with \nmuch fanfare, but it has turned out to be worth little more than the \npaper it was printed on. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of \npeople dead or maimed by landmines, the very weapon that Convention was \nintended to control.\n  We have seen the immense devastation landmines cause, and continue to \ncause, around the world. Each day, another 70 people are killed or \nhorribly mutilated. The undeniable truth is that antipersonnel \nlandmines cannot be controlled. They are too cheap to make, too easy to \ntransport and conceal. They are the ``Saturday night specials'' of \ncivil wars, and they have become one of the world's greatest scourges.\n  Last September at the United Nations, President Clinton took a \ncourageous step, when he called for the eventual elimination of \nantipersonnel mines. My amendment was a small step toward that goal.\n  Its purpose was not unilateral disarmament, as some in the Pentagon \nwould have one believe, but leadership. Leadership by the world's only \nsuperpower with a military arsenal that dwarfs that of any other \nnation, to stop the senseless slaughter of tens of thousands of \ninnocent people. By setting an example, we can lead others to take \nsimilar action, just as our European allies announced steps yesterday \nthat we should imitate.\n  The amendment that won the bipartisan support of two thirds of the \nSenate should be a model for our negotiators in Vienna. I only wish \nthese negotiations were being held in Cambodia, or Angola, where the \none-legged victims of landmines can be seen on every street corner.\n  I wish the negotiators could experience the constant fear of losing a \nleg, or an arm, or a child, simply from stepping in the wrong place. \nInstead of weeks of lofty speeches in air conditioned room quibbling \nover an elaborate set of unenforceable rules, I think we would see \ndramatic progress toward a ban on these weapons.\n  Let us not repeat the mistake of a decade and a half ago. Let us \nfinally recognize that there are some weapons that are so \nindiscriminate, so inhumane, and so impossible to control, that they \nshould be banned altogether. Let us finally do what we say, and stop \nthis when we have the chance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na New York Times article about the French Government's announcement.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                [From the New York Times Sept. 27, 1995\n\n      Paris to Scrap Some Land Mines In Face of Growing Sentiment\n\n       Vienna, Sept. 26.--France announced today that it would \n     stop production and export of all antipersonnel mines and \n     begin to destroy its stocks.\n       Xavier Emmanuelli, the French secretary of state for \n     emergency humanitarian actions, said at a conference in \n     Vienna that France was determined to carry on its struggle \n     against mines, which caused a ``humanitarian catastrophe.''\n       ``To further this end, France has decided to adopt a \n     moratorium on the production of all types of antipersonnel \n     mines,'' Mr. Emmanuelli told delegates. ``We shall also halt \n     the production of these weapons.''\n       Furthermore, he added, ``France will as of now begin to \n     reduce its stocks of antipersonnel mines by destroying \n     them.''\n       The Vienna conference is reviewing a 1980 convention on \n     weapons that are deemed to be indiscriminate or excessively \n     injurious. It will also be discussing laser weapons that \n     blind people exposed to them.\n       The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-\n     Ghali, called for a total ban on land mines, which he said \n     killed or maimed thousands of civilians each year.\n       He acknowledged that the conference was unlikely to outlaw \n     land mines completely but urged participating countries to at \n     least establish an export moratorium.\n       In a videotaped message, the United Nations chief said \n     1,600 people would be killed or wounded in mine blasts around \n     the world during the time the conference was being held. It \n     ends Oct. 13.\n       Mr. Boutros-Ghali said several countries had already heeded \n     a call by the General Assembly to establish an export \n     moratorium and he urged the conference to back an export ban \n     to states that had not yet ratified the 1980 convention.\n       France's move, which does not cover antitank mines, is \n     likely to increase pressure on countries that are still \n     exporting mines.\n\n[[Page S 14704]]\n\n       The United States banned mine exports three years ago.\n       Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Sweden backed Mr. Boutros-\n     Ghali's call for a total ban.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, landmines have been around since at least \nthe American Civil War, when live artillery shells were concealed \nbeneath the surface of roads, in houses, even in water wells. They \nwould explode when a person inadvertently came into contact with them, \nwhether a soldier or an innocent child. The result was an arm or leg \nblown off, or worse. At the time, General Sherman, who is not \nremembered as a great humanitarian, called them a ``violation of \ncivilized warfare.'' Yet despite Sherman's condemnation, landmines have \nbeen used ever since, in steadily increasing numbers.\n  My own knowledge about landmines dates to 1988, when I met a young \nboy in a field hospital on the Honduras-Nicaragua border. He had lost a \nleg from a mine that had been left on a jungle path near his home. It \nwas because of that boy that I started a fund to get artificial limbs \nto landmine victims around the world. The war victims fund has been \nused in over a dozen countries, including Vietnam.\n  That boy is one of countless people whose lives have been irreparably \nharmed by landmines. We have all seen the photographs of children with \ntheir legs blown off at the knee; their mothers with an arm or a leg \nmissing; hospital wards filled with rows of amputees. They tell the \ngruesome story, yet those people, who face a lifetime of hardship, are \nthe lucky ones because they survived. There are many thousands of \npeople like them, and as many others who died from loss of blood before \nreaching a hospital.\n  Civilians are not the only victims of landmines. Landmines have \nbecome a cheap, popular weapon in developing countries where American \ntroops are likely to be sent in the future, either in combat or on \npeacekeeping missions. A $2 plastic antipersonnel mine, hidden under a \nlayer of sand or dust and practically impossible to detect with a metal \ndetector, can blow the leg off the best trained, best equipped American \nsoldier as easily as a defenseless child. If American and NATO troops \nare sent to former Yugoslavia to rescue U.N. peacekeepers, they will \nface as many as 2 million mines in Bosnia alone.\n  The social and economic costs of landmines are staggering. The United \nNation estimates that it will cost several tens of billions of dollars \njust to remove the existing mines. In each of the past 2 years, about \n100,000 mines were cleared at an average cost of several hundred \ndollars per mine, while an estimated 2 to 2.5 million new mines are \nlaid. The United States has spent millions of dollars to develop better \ntechnology for locating and removing landmines, but the most effective \nmethod is still a hand-held probe and metal detector. Kuwait, one of \nthe few mine-infested countries rich enough to get rid of the mines \nleft over from the Gulf war, spent over $800 million to clear the \nmillions of Iraqi and American mines and 84 deminers died in the \nprocess. We are clearly losing the battle.\n  The cost of caring for the victims is also immense. The medical care, \nartificial limbs and lost income for a quarter million amputees over a \nlifetime is figured at about $750 million, and another 70 people are \nmaimed or killed by mines each day.\n  Three years ago almost no one was paying attention to this global \ncrisis. The Conventional Weapons Convention had become a distant \nmemory, in part because it had been such a failure. Then, in 1992, the \nU.S. Senate passed my amendment for a moratorium on the export of \nantipersonnel landmines. That amendment had one goal--to challenge \nother countries to join with us to stop the spread of these hidden \nkillers.\n  Since then, and spurred on by a global campaign of 350 \nnongovernmental organizations in at least 30 countries, public pressure \nagainst the proliferation and use of antipersonnel mines has grown \nsteadily. To date, 28 countries have halted all or most of their \nexports of these weapons.\n  Then last September, in an historic speech to the U.N. General \nAssembly, President Clinton announced the goal of the eventual \nelimination of antipersonnel mines. On December 15, the U.N. General \nAssembly passed a resolution calling for further steps toward this \ngoal.\n  This is the first time since the banning of chemical weapons that the \nnations of the world have singled out a type of weapon for total \nelimination. It reflects a growing consensus that antipersonnel \nlandmines are so cheap, so easy to mass produce, so easy to conceal and \ntransport and sow by the thousands, that they cannot be controlled. \nThey have become slow motion weapons of mass destruction, and it is \ncivilians who suffer.\n  In March of this year, Belgium, a member of NATO, became the first \ncountry to unilaterally implement the U.N. goal, by prohibiting the \nproduction, export, and use of antipersonnel mines. In June, the \nNorwegian Parliament did the same thing, and half a dozen other \ncountries have declared support for a global ban on these weapons. The \nEuropean Parliament and the Organization of African Unity have also \nadopted resolutions supporting a complete ban.\n  U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali, U.N. High Commissioner for \nRefugees Sadako Ogata, Pope John Paul II, former President Jimmy \nCarter, former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, and American Red Cross \nPresident Elizabeth Dole are among the world leaders who have called \nfor an end to the use of antipersonnel mines.\n  Yet, despite this progress, the use of landmines continues unabated. \nIn the past year alone, an estimated 5 to 10 million new mines were \nproduced and millions have been used in Chechnya, Bosnia, Cambodia, \nalong the Peruvian-Ecuador border, and in virtually every other armed \nconflict in the world today.\n  President Clinton's announcement of the goal to seek the eventual \nelimination of antipersonnel mines was a crucial milestone, because it \ndefined the ultimate solution to the problem. The administration has \nalso participated actively in the meetings to prepare for the Vienna \nreview conference, where it has shown leadership on several important \nissues such as the convention's scope and verification. It has also \nbeen the leading contributor to landmine clearance programs in \ncountries contaminated with mines.\n  On the other hand, the administration has emphasized eventual rather \nthan elimination. It has proposed a strategy, developed by the \nPentagon, which aims to promote the export and use of self-destruct \nmines which are designed to blow themselves up after a finite period of \ntime. The theory is that by increasing the availability of these safe \nmines, the reliance on long-life mines, which often remain active years \nafter a conflict ends, will decrease. However, there is no requirement \nthat governments actually reduce their stockpiles of long-life mines, \nand no limit on the number of self-destruct mines than can be used.\n  In an ideal world this approach might make sense, but the reality is \notherwise. It ignores the intrinsic problem with landmines--no matter \nhow modern the technology, as long as they are active they cannot \ndistinguish between civilians and soldiers. It also ignores the fact \nthat these mines can be scattered over wide areas by the thousands, or \ntens of thousands, and even if the failure rate is 2 or 3 percent they \npose a perpetual life-threatening danger to whole societies. Moreover, \nthere are tens of millions of long-life mines in inventories around the \nworld. There is little incentive for governments to destroy these \nstockpiles simply to pay to replace them with more expensive short-life \nmines. Finally, if we treat some mines as acceptable it will be \ndifficult if not impossible to build international support for the goal \nof banning them altogether. The inevitable result will be many more \nneedless civilian deaths.\n  My amendment, which passed the Senate on August 4, offers an \nalternative approach. But whether the opportunity of the Vienna \nconference will be seized is the question, and I am not optimistic. \nDespite notable progress on some issues, the four meetings to prepare \nfor the conference were disappointing since there was little support \nfor a complete ban on antipersonnel mines. Instead, it seems clear \nthat, at best, we can expect an increasingly elaborate set of rules and \nprocedures which are exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to \nmonitor and enforce.\n\n[[Page S 14705]]\n\n  Although probable, such an outcome is not inevitable. To begin with, \nthere is a proposal for consideration at the review conference to \nprohibit the use, development, manufacture, stockpiling, or transfer of \nantipersonnel landmines. The administration should support this \nproposal, especially considering this week's announcements by the \nFrench and Austrian Governments, coming on the heels of the Belgian \nGovernment's. It is fully consistent with the President's goal, and \nwith my amendment. Even a halt to production, as our NATO allies have \ndone, would be a major step beyond where we are.\n  Unfortunately, the Pentagon continues to insist that it needs \nantipersonnel landmines until viable and humane alternatives are \ndeveloped, and is therefore certain to reject such an approach despite \nthe administration's own rhetoric. Although the Pentagon is spending \nmillions of dollars to develop more advanced mines, there is little \nevidence that it is seriously engaged in developing alternatives. \nInstead, the administration will probably support proposed hortatory \nlanguage that the restrictions and prohibitions in this protocol shall \nfacilitate the ultimate goal of a complete ban on the production, \nstockpiling, use, and trade of antipersonnel landmines. Although \nconstructive, this language would have no operative effect and could \neasily be construed to be consistent with the administration's safe \nmine approach.\n  Even if governments fail to adopt the complete ban on antipersonnel \nmines which I and many others would prefer, the conference can produce \nimportant progress toward that goal and the United States should seek \nthe strongest possible limits on antipersonnel landmines.\n  The convention, like other laws of war agreements, contains limits on \nuse, as opposed to production, stockpiles, and transfers. My amendment, \nwhich also limits use, offers a useful model, and the administration \nshould incorporate elements of it into the U.S. negotiating position. \nRather than encourage the widespread use of self-destruct mines, my \namendment seeks to severely limit the use of all antipersonnel mines, \nand thus move unambiguously toward a complete ban. But it falls \nsignificantly short of a ban, since it permits their use along \ninternational borders and in demilitarized zones which is a paramount \nconcern of countries with hostile neighbors. It exempts antitank mines. \nIt exempts command detonated munitions which are effective for \nprotecting a perimeter and are not indiscriminate. And, it does not \ntake effect for 3 years.\n  Although my amendment differs substantially from the administration's \ncurrent policy, it has the distinct benefit of being simpler to \nimplement and far easier to verify. And while overcoming the \nconsiderable resistance to such a significant change in international \npractice would depend on the amount of public pressure that could be \namassed to convince governments to agree, it has the added advantage \nthat it might actually work.\n  While I believe the above recommendations are reasonable and \nnecessary under the circumstances, I fully recognize that, at best, \nthey are likely to receive only passing consideration. However, short \nof that, there are several other areas of discussion where strong U.S. \nleadership could determine whether the review conference achieves \nmeaningful results.\n  I am encouraged that there is near agreement on expanding the scope \nof the convention beyond international conflicts. This is crucial, \nsince the widespread use of landmines in recent years has been in civil \nwars. The administration has strongly supported this modification, and \nit should advocate for final agreement on application of the convention \nin all circumstances, so there is no ambiguity about its universal \napplication.\n  There is a proposal that any antipersonnel mine that is not placed in \na marked and guarded minefield must contain a self-destructing device. \nHowever, self-destruct mines are often disbursed by aircraft and \nartillery in huge numbers over wide areas making it extremely difficult \nto accurately map their location. Instead, all mines, including self-\ndestruct mines which as noted above are as indiscriminate as other \nmines, should be required to be located in marked and monitored \nminefields to ensure the exclusion of civilians. In addition, given the \nlarge number of self-destruct mines that failed to self-destruct in the \nPersian Gulf war, it is essential that the United States advocate \nstrongly that such mines also contain a self-deactivating device, such \nas a battery which loses power after a finite time.\n  A proposal tabled by Russia would establish an exception to the self-\ndestruct and marked and monitored minefield requirements in situations \nwhere direct enemy military action makes it impossible to comply. Such \nan exception would virtually negate the effect of these requirements, \nand the administration should strongly oppose it.\n  The time period within which a self-destruct mine must self-destruct \nor self-deactivate remains a subject of discussion. There are proposals \nranging from 2 to 365 days. Indeed, at least one government has \nreportedly proposed that there be no time limit. Most U.S. mines are \ndesigned to self-destruct within 24 to 48 hours, and to self-deactivate \nwithin 60 days. The administration should advocate strongly for this \nshort time period.\n  One of the most frequent criticisms of the Conventional Weapons \nConvention is its lack of verification and compliance procedures. The \nadministration has proposed factfinding and compliance procedures \nwhich, while not nearly as intrusive as the verification and compliance \nprocedures in the Chemical Weapons Convention, could significantly \nenhance the effectiveness of the Conventional Weapons Convention. In \ncontrast, a proposal advocated by several nonaligned governments would \nprovide for only transparency requirements, whereby governments would \nhave to disclose certain information about their use of mines. This \nwould be woefully inadequate. If the review conference is to have any \nhope of producing meaningful results the convention must include \neffective verification procedures and at least the possibility of \nsanctions for nonratification and noncompliance.\n  It is encouraging that there appears to be agreement that \nantipersonnel mines must be detectable with common electronic metal \ndetecting equipment. To avoid confusion and foreseeable problems, there \nneeds to be a requirement of a specific amount of metal to ensure easy \ndetection. This requirement should be extended to cover antitank mines \nas well. This is very important for the safety of deminers.\n  The administration has proposed to prohibit antihandling devices on \nanti-tank landmines, as well as on antipersonnel mines. Unfortunately, \nthis has not received support from other countries. The administration \nshould continue to advocate for such a prohibition, since an antitank \nmine with an anti-handling device is an antipersonnel mine. This could \nalso could help reduce the danger to deminers.\n  Finally, given the U.N. General Assembly's adoption of the goal of \neventually eliminating antipersonnel mines, the utter failure of the \nconvention, and the fact that the results of the Vienna conference are \nlikely to be quite modest, the administration should seek frequent \nreviews of the convention. Rather than every 10 years, there should be \nsome form of annual technical review, and a formal review at least \nevery 5 years. In addition to identifying problems, frequent reviews \ncould help bring additional States on board.\n  Like any weapon, landmines have a military use. But it needs to be \nweighed against the immense, long-term human and economic damage they \ncause. Solving the landmine crisis will take years, possibly \ngenerations. The Vienna conference is a beginning. Our aim should be to \nbuild an international consensus that like chemical and biological \nweapons, antipersonnel mines are so indiscriminate and inhumane that \nthey do not belong on this Earth. They are not weapons we depend on for \nour national security. They are most often used against the \ndefenseless.\n  Ultimately, it is a moral issue, as has been so eloquently stated by \nSouth African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. He has spoken about the 20 \nmillion landmines in Africa that have already destroyed so many \ninnocent lives:\n\n       Antipersonnel landmines are not just a crime perpetrated \n     against people, they are a sin. Why has the world been so \n     silent about \n\n[[Page S 14706]]\n     these obscenities? It is because most of the victims of landmines are \n     neither heard nor seen.\n\n  Mr President, I want to also speak briefly about another issue that \nwill be debated in Vienna, blinding laser weapons.\n  In recent years, military forces have come to rely on lasers for \nrange finding, target designation and other modern technology. These \ntechnologies have helped to increase the accuracy and effectiveness of \nU.S. weapons, and are widely accepted as legitimate uses in warfare. \nHowever, as the technology has advanced, various governments have begun \nto move from these non-weapon laser systems to the development of \ntactical laser weapons that are either intended or have the potential \nto destroy eyesight. Such laser weapons now exist in prototype form, \nand some are small enough to be mounted on a rifle.\n  A recent report identified 10 different U.S. laser weapon systems, 5 \nof which have apparently been fielded in prototype form. The Pentagon \nhas acknowledged that two of the systems were deployed, but not used, \nin the Gulf war, and that one system was deployed, but not used, in \nSomalia. Other governments that have been mentioned in the press as \ndeveloping blinding laser weapons include China, Russia, other former \nSoviet republics, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Israel. China \nattempted to market its ZM-87, a portable laser weapon system, at an \narms exhibition this spring. Its promotional literature openly states \nthat one of the weapon's main purposes is to injure eyesight.\n  Alarmed by the obvious potential for widespread abuse by terrorists, \nrogue states, insurgent groups and common criminals if antipersonnel \nlaser weapons are developed and allowed to proliferate, several years \nago the international committee of the Red Cross initiated a campaign \nagainst battlefield laser weapons. This led to a Swedish proposal to \nadd a protocol to the convention to prohibit the use of laser weapons \nfor the purpose of causing permanent blindness as a method of warfare. \nOver 20 governments including many of our closest allies, as well as \nthe European Parliament and the Organization of African Unity, have \nexpressed support for such a protocol.\n  The possibility of hundreds or thousands of American servicemen and \nwomen returning from combat to face the rest of their lives without \neyesight is sufficiently horrifying that I sought the Pentagon's \nopinion on the Swedish proposal. Although the Pentagon concedes that \nthere is no military requirement for weapons that are used to destroy \neyesight, I found the Pentagon strongly opposed to the Swedish proposal \nfor several somewhat contradictory reasons:\n  I was told that a prohibition is unnecessary since there is no plan \nto develop blinding weapons. At the same time, I was told that they are \neasy to develop and indeed already exist.\n  I was told that there is no point in investing in such weapons since \nthey are ineffective in inclement weather and thus unlikely to receive \nwidespread use.\n  I was told that a prohibition would not prevent their development or \nuse by civilians; that blinding is preferable to death; that a \nprohibition would be difficult to enforce because of the legitimate \nuses of lasers in warfare and, even worse, that it would deter \nlegitimate uses; and that negotiation of such a protocol would divert \nattention from the more immediate and pressing issue of landmines.\n  These arguments are unpersuasive. The Pentagon maintains that its \nlaser weapons systems are intended not to blind, but to disrupt enemy \noptical and electro-optical battlefield surveillance systems. The \nPentagon has also conceded, however, that in some circumstances the \nlaser weapon performs its antisensor function by damaging the eyesight \nof the enemy user. A laser weapon beam directed at a simple optic such \nas a binocular or gunner's sight does not destroy the optical lens, but \ninstead magnifies and shoots back into the human eye, causing damage \nand probable permanent blindness. The most advanced U.S. laser weapon \nsystem, the Laser Countermeasure System [LCMS], which is mounted on an \nM-16 rifle, reportedly fires a beam powerful enough to destroy a human \nretina from a distance of 3,000 feet.\n  The fact that a prohibition would not directly apply to civilians is \nhardly a reason not to limit their use as a method of warfare, \nparticularly since a prohibition would certainly inhibit their \ndevelopment and use by terrorists and common criminals. Blindness may \nbe preferable to death, but blindness is permanent and weapons used to \nblind would be used in combination with, not instead of, other deadly \nweapons.\n  As for the Pentagon's argument that a prohibition on blinding could \ndeter legitimate uses of lasers, it should not be difficult to \ndistinguish between the use of nonweapon lasers for target designation \nand range-finding versus tactical laser weapons that can blind. During \nthe Gulf War, there were many thousands of uses of nonweapon lasers by \nthe United States and other nations, and only one or two known \ninstances of eye damage.\n  In any event, this problem is certainly solvable, and is by no means \nunique to the laws of war. A prohibition should prohibit blinding as a \nmethod of warfare, as well as the development, production, transfer, \nand use of laser weapons the primary purpose or effect of which is to \ncause blindness.\n  Some violations would be difficult or impossible to prove, but that \nis true with other laws of war violations such as the deliberate \ntargeting of civilians. The burden of proof is on the person alleging \nthe violation.\n  As a strong proponent of limits on the use of landmines, I certainly \ndo not want negotiations on laser weapons to divert attention from the \nlandmine issue. However, given the brevity of the Swedish proposal, its \nsupport among other governments and the unique opportunity presented by \nthe Vienna conference, this is too important an opportunity to miss. I \nhave urged the administration to delay the development or production of \nany antipersonnel laser system until the issue has been fully \nconsidered in Vienna.\n  Unfortunately, in June the Pentagon made an ill-advised decision to \ngo forward with a limited production of 75 LCMS systems, while \ndeferring a decision on full production of 2,500 units until early \n1996. While I am relieved that a decision on full production was \ndelayed, even limited production will complicate the negotiations on a \nprohibition. The administration should reverse this decision and \npostpone any further research, development, or procurement of tactical \nlaser weapon systems until after the Vienna conference.\n  To its credit, the Pentagon recently announced that it has revised \nits policy on lasers, to prohibit the use of lasers specifically \ndesigned to cause permanent blindness. This is an important step, but \nit is not enough to prohibit only lasers designed to be used against \npersonnel, since virtually any laser can be used to destroy eyesight if \nused for that purpose.\n  It is not too late to act to prevent the widespread proliferation of \nthese weapons. Like exploding bullets and other weapons that have been \nbanned as excessively cruel, the administration should actively support \nan international prohibition on blinding as a method of warfare. U.S. \nleadership, even at this late date, would virtually assure agreement.\n  Mr. President, again, the Vienna conference is a unique opportunity. \nOn both landmines and laser weapons, U.S. leadership is urgently needed \nand vital to save lives and prevent the proliferation of these inhumane \nweapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14703-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14706-S14707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS AMENDMENTS VOTES\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to explain \nseveral of my votes concerning H.R. 1868, the Foreign Operations \nappropriation bill. I voted in favor of final passage of the bill \nbecause it would meet U.S. foreign relations and national security \ngoals, while cutting spending in those areas that do not directly \nsupport the U.S. national security strategy.\n  Many of the amendments offered to the bill concerned the question of \nresponsibility the United States has in economically or militarily \nsupporting other countries. I ran for this body on a platform fiscal \nconservatism and directing our foreign assistance programs towards \nthose areas in which the United States has a direct political, \neconomic, or national security interest. Although many arguments were \nraised as to what effect U.S. aid would \n\n[[Page S 14707]]\nor would not have in the recipient country, my votes on the amendments \nturned more on the question of whether the national security of the \nUnited States was directly improved by the provision or withholding of \nthis assistance.\n  These principles led me to oppose the D'Amato amendment to cut \nEconomic Support Fund assistance to Turkey, but support the Dole \namendment on the transhipment of United States humanitarian aid. I \nbelieve the United States national security interests are best served \nby a strong and stable Turkish government, which has fully committed \nitself to the principles of open markets, democratic government, and \nthe preservation of individual liberties.\n  Turkey, in my opinion, is making progress on all these fronts, and \nrelations with its neighbors are similarly changing, both with United \nStates assistance and through other venues. Because of the potential \nfor our relations with Turkey to quickly shift, I believe it is \ncritical any conditions the Congress places upon assistance to Turkey \nprovide the Executive with the tools necessary to adjust to those new \ncircumstances. The D'Amato amendment cut almost half of the Economic \nSupport Fund aid to Turkey without any method for the Executive to \nresume that aid if such leverage proves necessary or fruitful. For that \nreason I was unable to support the D'Amato amendment.\n  The Dole amendment, however, provided such tools to the Executive, \nand I was therefore able to support this measure. Although the language \nof the amendment was universal in its application, the Majority Leader \nmade clear his motivation for this measure was Turkey's refusal to \nallow the transhipment of United States humanitarian aid to Armenia. \nBecause of the potential for a rapid shift in our national security \nobjectives and relations with Turkey, this amendment provides the \nExecutive the authority to waive its provisions if it is in the United \nStates national security interests to do so. Given the strategic, \npolitical and economic importance of Turkey to the United States, I \nbelieve this is a vital provision. This language is even more expansive \nthan the original Humanitarian Relief Corridor Act waiver language and \nI applaud its inclusion. Although the amendment was adopted by voice \nvote, if it had come to the floor for a roll call vote, I would have \nvoted in favor of its adoption. I also wish to make it clear that if \nthe progress I referred to earlier in the democratization and \nliberalization of Turkey does not continue and solidify, I may \ndetermine that requested levels of United States assistance are no \nlonger serving our national interests.\n  I also wish to explain my opposition to the Brown amendment allowing \nthe transfer of previously purchased military equipment to Pakistan. \nThis amendment was presented as an attempt to divest the United States \nof military equipment purchased by Pakistan, but withheld due to the \nimplementation of the Pressler Amendment. I do not wish to argue the \nrelative merits of the Pressler amendment itself, for that was not the \nissue. The issue was whether the United States should go back on its \nlegislatively defined position that aid to Pakistan could only be \nprovided if Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device. The \nPressler Amendment had been on the books for almost 5 years before it \nwas finally implemented in 1990, and Pakistan knew full well what would \nhappen if the President found it impossible to certify that Pakistan \ndid not possess a nuclear explosive device. Pakistan continued those \npolicies that led to this Presidential determination, and they must be \nwilling to accept the consequences.\n  This is not to imply our interests in South Asia are static. All \nparties must abandon the notion that United States relations with \nPakistan and India are part of some regional zero-sum game. Measures \nthe United States undertakes to improve relations with one country \nshould not be interpreted as happening at the expense of the other \ncountry. But I believe allowing the introduction of significant \nmilitary hardware at this critical juncture in South Asian relations \nwould be contrary to our national interests and regional stability. \nObviously, however, the affirmative vote on the Brown amendment \nindicates the Senate is moving in another direction. I therefore \nbelieve it is now time for the United States to move past this issue in \nour relations with India and Pakistan, and extend our relations with \nboth countries, not at the expense of one or the other, but in tandem.\n  As for my support for the Helms amendment regarding funding for the \nUN Population Fund [UNFPA], it is not because I am opposed to foreign \nassistance. Indeed, I believe it is vitally important we remain engaged \nin the international arena, and foreign assistance can be a powerful \ntool for the United States to further its political, economic, and \nnational security goals. However, the history of our foreign assistance \nprograms shows a repeated record of funding for controversial projects \nthat do little to advance those goals. Given the demands to balance the \nbudget and cut federal spending, I believe this program is extraneous \nto our foreign policy objectives.\n  The UNFPA fully supports Chinese population control programs that \ninclude forced abortions and involuntary sterilization. These practices \nare contrary to the values of a large segment of my State's citizens, \nand I believe the citizens of the United States as well. That \nconsideration, in fact, is why the Congress has previously mandated \nsuch United assistance to the UNFPA be separated from the Chinese \nprograms. But I believe such separations are irrelevant given the \ninherent fungibility of money. The UNFPA simply shifts other donor \ncountries contributions to China and use the United States \ncontributions as a replacement in non-Chinese projects. The Helms \namendment stops this elaborate shell game unless China ceases such \npractices or the UNFPA withdraws from this program, and brings such \nexpenditures in line with the clear wishes of the American people. I \ntherefore voted to adopt the Helms amendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wish to explain my vote regarding the Smith \namendment prohibiting Most Favored Nation trading status with Vietnam, \nor the provision of trade financing incentives unless the President \ncertifies they have been fully cooperative on the issues of United \nStates POW/MIA's and human rights. The normalization of relations with \nVietnam is a major development in United States foreign policy, and I \nhave long been disappointed the Congress was not more fully brought \ninto this process by the Administration. There are still substantial \nquestions regarding the fate of United servicemen lost in South East \nAsia during the Vietnam War. I therefore voted for this amendment in \nthe hope it would provide the leverage needed to obtain this crucial \ncooperation and information.\n  However, given the amendment's rejection by a vote of 39 to 59, it is \nclear the Senate has decided to move forward in relations with Vietnam, \nand I am fully prepared to become involved in that process. The \nAdministration has promised these initiatives towards Vietnam will more \nassuredly provide the United States the answers it needs regarding POWs \nand MIA's in South East Asia. I will monitor that progress closely over \nthe next year, and make an independent evaluation as to whether these \nmeasures have indeed helped resolve these questions.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to analyze this myriad of issues in \nthe pure vacuum of policy analysis. Different groups can have vastly \ndifferent positions on issues, and each can defend those positions with \na plethora of hard evidence and supporting statistics. However, by \napplying a standard of United national security interests to such \ndecisions, I believe we can ensure that our international initiatives \nbest meet our national strategies and goals, and further the \nestablishment of democratic societies, free market economies and \nindividual liberty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14706-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14707-S14708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COSPONSORING S. 830\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 830, a bill \nintroduced by Senator Specter to amend the Federal Criminal Code to \nprohibit the making of false statements, misrepresentations or false \nwritings to Congress or to any congressional committee or subcommittee. \nUntil the Supreme Court decided Hubbard versus United States in May of \nthis year, that \n\n[[Page S 14708]]\nhad been the law of the land for 40 years.\n  In the Hubbard case, the Supreme Court decided that section 1001 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, prohibits the making of false statements \nonly to executive branch agencies, and not to the courts or Congress. \nThis decision overturned a 1955 Supreme Court case, which squarely held \nthat ``one who lied to an officer of Congress was punishable under \nSec. 1001 . . .'' Hubbard, 131 L.Ed. 2d 779, 798.\n  S. 830 would make clear that the courts, Congress and ``any duly \nconstituted committee or subcommittee of Congress'' are covered by the \nprohibition in section 1001 against false statements. It would restore \nthe clear message to all who may appear before a committee or \nsubcommittee of the Senate or House: Do not lie to us.\n  Although various other laws criminalize false statements to Congress, \nnone of those statutes reaches the breadth of misrepresentations and \nfalse statements prohibited by section 1001. For example, a perjury \nprosecution under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1621 requires that the false statement \nbe made under oath, while section 1001 does not. Likewise, a \nprosecution under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 287 requires that the false statement \nbe made in connection with a claim for payment, while section 1001 does \nnot. Finally, an obstruction prosecution under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1505 \nrequires that the obstruction be effected ``corruptly or by threats or \nforce,'' which section 1001 does not. Indeed, section 1505 has \nspecifically been held not to prohibit lying to Congress. U.S. v. \nPoindexter, 951 F.2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991).\n  I recognize that extension of section 1001 to the courts must be done \ndelicately so as not to impinge upon responsible advocacy. I look \nforward to working with my friend from Pennsylvania on refining this \nbill, and urge its passage in this Congress.\n  We should all be aware that until S. 830 is passed, witnesses may lie \nwith impunity at congressional hearings, unless they are placed under \noath.\n  Senator Specter has meticulously administered oaths to every witness \nwho has appeared at the extensive and ongoing Ruby Ridge hearings \nbefore the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and \nGovernment Information, which he chairs. We have heard from current and \nformer law enforcement personnel from four Federal agencies, including \nthe Marshals Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the \nFBI, and the Justice Department. We have also heard from Randy Weaver \nand his daughter, Sara, Kevin Harris, their neighbors and their \nfriends.\n  Sorting out what happened 3 years ago at Ruby Ridge, and then its \naftermath, has proven to be no simple task. This was a tragedy, \nresulting in the deaths of Deputy Marshal William Degan, a 14-year-old \nboy, Sammy Weaver, and his mother, Vicki Weaver. Figuring out what went \nwrong at Ruby Ridge and what can be done to make sure those events are \nnever repeated, is the challenge the subcommittee is facing on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Fulfilling our important oversight responsibility at these hearings, \nand in future hearings on other matters, requires that we seek the \ntruth and base our findings on facts. Witnesses, who are interviewed, \ncalled to testify, and asked to provide documentary material relating \nto matters under consideration by Congress, should be given the message \nloudly and clearly that if they lie or purposely mislead us, they will \nbe sanctioned with criminal penalties. This bill would put that message \nin the law, and I am glad to cosponsor it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14707-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14708-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14708-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14708-S14709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT OF PROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION WITH SOUTH AFRICA \n     CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 84\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n2153(b), (d)), the text of a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between \nthe United States of America and the Republic of South Africa \nConcerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, with accompanying annex and \nagreed minute. I am also pleased to transmit my written approval, \nauthorization, and determination concerning the agreement, and the \nmemorandum of the Director of the United States Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency with the Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement \nconcerning the agreement. The joint memorandum submitted to me by the \nActing Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy, which includes a \nsummary of the provisions of the agreement and various other \nattachments, including agency views, is also enclosed.\n  The proposed agreement with the Republic of South Africa has been \nnegotiated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended \nby the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA) and as otherwise \namended. In my judgment, the proposed agreement meets all statutory \nrequirements and will advance the non-proliferation and other foreign \npolicy interests of the United States. It provides a comprehensive \nframework for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States \nand South Africa under appropriate conditions and controls reflecting a \nstrong common commitment to nuclear non-proliferation goals.\n  The proposed new agreement will replace an existing U.S.-South Africa \nagreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation that entered into force on \nAugust 22, 1957, and by its terms would expire on August 22, 2007. The \nUnited States suspended cooperation with South Africa under the 1957 \nagreement in the 1970's because of evidence that South Africa was \nembarked on a nuclear weapons program. Moreover, following passage of \nthe NNPA in 1978, South Africa did not satisfy a provision of section \n128 of the Atomic Energy Act (added by the NNPA) that requires full-\nscope IAEA safeguards in non-nuclear weapon states such as South Africa \nas a condition for continued significant U.S. nuclear exports.\n  In July 1991 South Africa, in a momentous policy reversal, acceded to \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and \npromptly entered into a full-scope safeguards agreement with the IAEA \nas required by the Treaty. South Africa has been fully cooperative with \nthe IAEA in carrying out its safeguards responsibilities.\n  Further, in March 1993 South Africa took the dramatic and candid step \nof revealing the existence of its past nuclear weapons program and \nreported that it had dismantled all of its six nuclear devices prior to \nits accession to the NPT. It also invited the IAEA to inspect its \nformerly nuclear weapons-related facilities to demonstrate the openness \nof its nuclear program and its genuine commitment to non-proliferation.\n  South Africa has also taken a number of additional important non-\nproliferation steps. In July 1993 it put into effect a law banning all \nweapons of mass destruction. In April 1995 it became a member of the \nNuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), formally committing itself to abide by \nthe NSG's stringent guidelines for nuclear exports. At the 1995 NPT \nReview and Extension Conference it played a decisive role in the \nachievement of indefinite NPT extension--a top U.S. foreign policy and \nnational security goal.\n  These steps are strong and compelling evidence that South Africa is \nnow firmly committed to stopping the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction and to conducting its nuclear program for peaceful purposes \nonly.\n\n[[Page S 14709]]\n\n  In view of South Africa's fundamental reorientation of its nuclear \nprogram, the United States proposes to enter into a new agreement for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with South Africa. Although cooperation \ncould have been resumed under the 1957 agreement, both we and South \nAfrica believe that it is preferable to have a new agreement completely \nsatisfying, as the proposed new agreement does, the current legal and \npolicy criteria of both sides, and that reflects, among other things:\n  Additional international non-proliferation commitments entered into \nby the parties since 1974, when the old agreement was last amended, \nincluding, for South Africa, its adherence to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons;\n  Reciprocity in the application of the terms and conditions of \ncooperation between the parties; and\n  An updating of terms and conditions to take account of intervening \nchanges in the respective domestic legal and regulatory frameworks of \nthe parties in the area of peaceful nuclear cooperation.\n  For the United States, the proposed new agreement also represents an \nadditional instance of compliance with section 404(a) of the NNPA, \nwhich calls for an effort to renegotiate existing agreements for \ncooperation to include the more stringent requirements established by \nthe NNPA.\n  The proposed new agreement with South Africa permits the transfer of \ntechnology, material, equipment (including reactors), and components \nfor nuclear research and nuclear power production. It provides for U.S. \nconsent rights to retransfers, enrichment, and reprocessing as required \nby U.S. law. It does not permit transfers of any sensitive nuclear \ntechnology, restricted data, or sensitive nuclear facilities or major \ncritical components thereof. In the event of termination, key \nconditions and controls continue with respect to material and equipment \nsubject to the agreement.\n  From the United States perspective the proposed new agreement \nimproves on the 1957 agreement by the addition of a number of important \nprovisions. These include the provisions for full-scope safeguard; \nperpetuity of safeguards; a ban on ``peaceful'' nuclear explosives; a \nright to require the return of exported nuclear items in certain \ncircumstances; a guarantee of adequate physical security; and a consent \nright to enrichment of nuclear material subject to the agreement.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123 a. of that Act. This \ntransmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections \n123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act. The Administration is \nprepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations and House International Relations Committees as provided in \nsection 123 b.

A bill to reauthorize and amend the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Recovery, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n   the accelerated cleanup and environmental restoration act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, when the Superfund Program was enacted in \n1980, it was expected that only a few hundred sites would need to be \ncleaned up, at a relatively modest cost. Today, we know those \nexpectations were misguided. There are more than 1,300 sites on the \nnational priorities list, and the EPA has been adding an average of 30-\n40 new sites per year. To date, the construction of long-term cleanup \nremedies have been completed at fewer than 300 contaminated sites.\n  The Superfund saga has been running now for 15 years. The cast \nincludes a bewildering mix of lawyers, bureaucrats, insurers, small \nbusiness owners, polluters and others trapped in a tangled web of \nretroactive, joint, strict and several liability. The Superfund story \nis one of good intentions gone bad while a Government program ran amok.\n  I am here today to announce that this sorry show will be coming to an \nend, soon. My goal this year has been nothing short of a comprehensive, \ncommon sense reform of the Superfund Program.\n  The Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk Assessment, \nwhich I chair, held 7 hearings and received testimony from more than 60 \nwitnesses in an effort to formally incorporate a wide variety of views \non the issue of Superfund reform. On June 28, I released a detailed \noutline of a Superfund reform plan and asked for comments from \ninterested parties. I received more than 150 constructive comments and \nsuggestions.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senators Chafee, Bond, Inhofe, \nThomas, Kempthorne, Faircloth, Lott, McConnell, Warner and Gregg \nrespond to the broad-based concerns and problems with the Superfund \nProgram. The Accelerated Cleanup and Environmental Restoration Act will \ndo just what the title says. The legislation will accelerate the pace \nof cleanups by reducing cleanup costs, reducing litigation costs, and \nproviding economic incentives for PRPs to stay on site and get the job \ndone.\n  The legislation will establish a fair, cost-effective and balanced \napproach to cleaning up hazardous waste sites and returning them to \nproductive use.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a title-by-title summary \nof legislation be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

States may request \n     delegation of authority to perform one or more of the \n     following activities at non-Federal NPL sites: Site \n     investigations and risk analysis; alternatives development \n     and remedy selection (including feasibility studies and \n     issuance of records of decision); remedial design; remedial \n     action and operation and maintenance (including removal \n     actions); liability allocation (including identification of \n     PRPs and issuance of settlement agreements); and enforcement \n     (including compliance orders, cost recovery, and imposition \n     of civil penalties).\n       Designates the state as the sole regulator and allows the \n     state to use its own remedy selection process at those sites \n     where the state accepts all EPA authority.\n       Requires the Fund to continue to pay its share of cleanup \n     costs at delegated sites, as long as the selected remedy is \n     protective of human health and the environment and is no more \n     costly than the one that would have been selected under the \n     Federal program.\n       Authorizes use of the Fund to make capacity building grants \n     to delegated states.\n\n                      TITLE III: VOLUNTARY CLEANUP\n\n       Goal--To provide greater flexibility to communities in \n     protecting human health and the environment and provide \n     incentives for the voluntary cleanup of industrial sites and \n     expedited reutilization and economic redevelopment of urban \n     areas.\n       Authorizes grants of up to $25 million in yearly funding \n     for states to manage voluntary cleanup programs at non-NPL \n     sites.\n       Authorizes interest free loans to local governments of up \n     to $200,000 per site to promote ``brownfields'' \n     redevelopment.\n       Protects from liability purchasers of contaminated property \n     if they did not contribute to the contamination and conducted \n     appropriate inquiries prior to the purchase.\n       Limits the liability of lenders or lessors that: Acquire \n     property through foreclosure; hold a security interest in the \n     property; hold property as a lessor pursuant to an extension \n     of credit; or exercise financial control pursuant to the \n     terms of an extension of credit.\n       Excludes from liability landholders who's property was \n     contaminated by a contiguous NPL site, if they did not \n     contribute to the contamination and are not designated as an \n     owner or operator.\n\n                TITLE IV: Selection of Remedial Actions\n\n       Goal--To base cleanup decisions on a careful analysis of \n     the actual or plausible risks to human health and the \n     environment.\n       Requires selection of the remedy that protects human health \n     and the environment in the most cost-effective manner.\n       Requires remedial actions to be selected according to site \n     specific conditions and risks based on the reasonably \n     anticipated future use of the site. Remedial actions would be \n     selected according to: actual or plausible exposure pathways \n     based on actual or planned future use of the land and water \n     resources (industrial, commercial, residential, etc.); site-\n     specific data, in preference to default assumptions; and \n     where site-specific data are unavailable, an acceptable range \n     of realistic and plausible default assumptions regarding \n     actual or likely human exposures and site-specific \n     conditions, instead of worst case default assumptions.\n       Requires consideration of the following balancing factors \n     in selecting a remedy: effectiveness in protecting human \n     health; long-term reliability; short-term risks; acceptance \n     by the local community; and technical practicability.\n       Cuts by half the number of steps required to implement \n     cleanup remedies by establishing the following accelerated \n     remedy selection procss: Facility Evaluation, Remedial Action \n     Planning, and Remedial Action.\n       Eliminates the preferences for permanence, allowing \n     consideration of all cleanup options at a site that are \n     protective of human health and the environment, including, \n     containment, treatment, institutional controls, natural \n     attenuation, or a combination of these alternatives.\n       Eliminates the requirement that remedial actions meet \n     applicable, relevant and appropriate requirements \n     (``ARARs'').\n       Requires assessment of the actual or planned future use of \n     the contaminated land and water resources based on a mix of \n     several factors including: (1) current zoning requirements \n     and projected future land uses; (2) site analysis and \n     surrounding land use growth patterns; (3) previous use of the \n     landholdings; and (4) input from the CRO, elected municipal \n     and county officials, local planning and zoning authorities, \n     facility owners and potentially responsible parties.\n       Establishes a higher level of protection for groundwater \n     that is currently uncontaminated.\n       Allows certain past records of decision to be modified, if \n     applying the new remedy selection process can demonstrate \n     life-cycle savings of at least 10% over the existing remedy.\n       Enhances emergency response capabilities by increasing the \n     duration of emergency response actions to 24 months, and \n     increasing the authorized spending cap to $4 million per \n     site.\n       Allows de-listing and reuse of the uncontaminated portions \n     of NPL sites.\n       Provides expedited de-listing of NPL sites where \n     construction of the remedy is complete and operation and \n     maintenance activities are continued.\n\n                     TITLE V: Liability Allocations\n\n       Goal--Accelerate cleanup by providing broad based fairness \n     in allocating liability.\n       Establishes a mandatory, non-binding allocation process for \n     multi-party sites, whereby PRPs would be assessed only for \n     the costs of cleanup associated with their actions. This \n     allocation process would be mandatory at all sites where \n     response actions occurred after June 15, 1995, and would \n     divide unidentifiable shares equally among the parties to the \n     allocation. Shares that are attributable to bankrupt or \n     insolvent parties would be borne by an ``orphan share'' paid \n     out of the Trust Fund.\n       Makes available to those PRPs that accept the allocator's \n     finding a 50% tax credit for the PRP's pre-1980 cleanup \n     costs, if the PRP stays on-site to conduct the cleanup. This \n     approach would: provide an incentive for PRPs to accelerate \n     cleanup; significantly decrease litigation by creating \n     incentives for PRPs to settle their liability; provide \n     significant, broad-based relief of pre-1980 liability for \n     most PRPs; avoid creating a ``public works'' program in \n     Superfund; and ensure greater efficiency by keeping PRPs on-\n     site.\n       Allows PRPs who conducted response actions before June 15, \n     1995, to request allocation of shares, but would not allow \n     them to qualify for tax credits or orphan share funding.\n       Limits liability for religious, charitable, and other \n     ``501(c)(3)'' organizations.\n       Assigns the cost of ``orphan shares,'' (which include the \n     shares attributed to bankrupt or dissolved parties) to the \n     Fund. Any PRP unwilling to pay its allocated share would be \n     held liable for any unrecovered costs at the site, including \n     unidentifiable shares. Settling parties would receive \n     complete contribution protection.\n       Provides for an early dollar settlement for those ``de-\n     minimus'' parties whose liability is 1% or less total site \n     liability.\n       Releases from all liability those ``de-micromis'' parties \n     who contributed not more than 110 gallons of liquid material \n     containing hazardous waste or not more than 200 pounds of \n     solid material containing hazardous waste to a site.\n       Provides increased protection from liability for response \n     action contractors by excluding them from being labeled \n     ``owners or \n\n[[Page S 14737]]\n     operators'' and establishing a negligence standard for their activities \n     at NPL sites.\n\n                      TITLE VI: Federal Facilities\n\n       Goal--Enhance state participation in cleaning up and \n     reutilizing Federal facilities while ensuring the Federal \n     taxpayers get the maximum return for cleanup dollars spent.\n       Allows delegation of Federal facilities to qualified \n     states, if that state takes the entire site and utilizes the \n     Federal remedy selection process and standards.\n       Ensures that states: (1) apply cleanup standards that are \n     equivalent to non-Federal cleanup sites; (2) allow \n     uncontaminated or cleaned up parcels of property to be reused \n     as rapidly as possible; and (3) apply a definition of \n     uncontaminated property that includes property where \n     hazardous materials were once stored, but not released to the \n     environment.\n       Facilitates use of Federal facilities to promote \n     development and demonstration of innovative cleanup \n     technologies.\n\n                  TITLE VII: Natural Resource Damages\n\n       Goal--Provide for the rapid restoration and replacement of \n     significant natural resources that have been damaged by the \n     release of hazardous materials.\n       Favors actual restoration of resources over assessing \n     arbitrary, punitive damages.\n       Eliminates non-use damages. Eliminates all lost use damages \n     for pre-1980 activities. Limits recovery to the restoration \n     of baseline ecological services.\n       Allows for de novo court review of a trustee's assessment \n     of whether a party is liable and the extent of any such \n     liability.\n       Requires trustees to give equal consideration to natural \n     attenuation and recovery as a viable restoration method.\n       Requires selection of the most cost effective method of \n     restoring a resource to the condition that would have existed \n     if not for the release of hazardous material.\n       Requires that the NRD provisions to receive ``double \n     recovery'' for damages if compensation has already been \n     provided pursuant to CERCLA or any other federal or state \n     law.\n\n                       TITLE VIII: MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       Requires the Administrator to establish a ``results \n     oriented'' engineering approach to accelerate response \n     actions, including site evaluations, response goals, and \n     oversight.\n       Targets limited funds toward those sites currently on the \n     NPL by limiting new NPL listings to 30 sites per year for the \n     next three years and capping the list thereafter.\n\n                           TITLE IX: Funding\n\n       Introduces a new accelerated cleanup tax credit of 50% for \n     PRPs that conduct cleanups.\n       Authorizes continuation of the Superfund program at $1.75 \n     billion for fiscal years 1996-2000. $1.5 billion from the \n     Trust Fund; and $250 million from general revenue.\n       Reauthorizes current Superfund taxes: (Corporate \n     Environmental Income Tax, Petroleum Feedstock Tax, and \n     Chemical Feedstock Tax). Assumes continuation of current \n     taxes will generate sufficient revenue to offset accelerated \n     cleanup tax credits.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, Superfund is broken, and today the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee is putting forward a plan that \nwill fix it. Senator Bob Smith and his staff on the Superfund \nsubcommittee have produced a remarkable reform package, one deserving \nof widespread support. I want to make it clear to everyone that \nSuperfund reform will be a priority for the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee for the rest of this year, and we will move to mark up \nthis bill and bring it to the floor as quickly as possible.\n  Superfund's troubled history and problems are news to no one, but \nfixing Superfund's plainly evident problems--too much litigation, not \nenough cleanup, inefficient use of scarce resources, blighted cities--\nhas eluded us now for more than 5 years, as one interest group after \nanother sought their vision of a ``perfect'' reform. No plan is \nperfect, but his bill that Senator Smith and his staff prepared, with \nthe help of my staff, is a tremendous improvement over the status quo. \nIt is all the more remarkable for what it achieves in an era of tightly \nconstrained budgets.\n  This is real reform for Superfund that we can afford. This bill will:\n  Streamline the cleanup process by eliminating overlapping studies of \ncontaminated sites.\n  Require EPA to consider the future use of resources when it decides \nhow clean a site must be. Why clean up a site that will be a parking \nlot to the same level as a day care center?\n  Let the States take as much of the Superfund Program as they want or \ncan handle.\n  Address the Brownfields problem by providing grants and loans to \nStates for voluntary cleanup programs, and assessment of contamination \nlevels at these sites. We also protect potential investors, innocent \nlandowners and lenders so that entrepreneurs will step forward and be \nable to secure financing.\n  Eliminate the unfairness of Joint & Several liability by having the \nfund, and not other parties, pay the share of those parties who cannot \nbe found or are bankrupt.\n  Provide significant relief to small waste contributors, usually small \nbusiness, with an expanded de micromis exemption, and expedited, fair \nde minimis settlements.\n  Make restoration the goal of natural resource damages recovery, not \nspeculative punitive damages.\n  Relieve as much of the pain as we can afford on retroactive \nliability, through the use of a tax credit for costs associated with \nliability for things people did, legally, before Superfund was enacted \nin 1980. On this point, I know Senator Smith wanted to do more, but the \nfacts of the budget frustrated his attempts. I want to salute him. He \ntook the best run at it he could, and then came forward, at some \npersonal political risk, with this fiscally credible plan.\n  Some will charge that the use of tax credits to relieve some of the \nunfairness of retroactive liability is corporate welfare. Any such \ncharge about this tax credit proposal is merit-less, as the tax credits \nare tightly tied to the existing Superfund taxes. In this proposal, the \ntax credit is fully funded by the Superfund taxes that these \ncorporations pay. It does not come out of general tax revenues. I would \npoint out that, for the past several years, Superfund tax revenues have \nfar outrun Superfund's annual appropriation, resulting in a Superfund \ntrust fund balance of over $3 billion. I would also add that there is \nsomething fundamentally unfair about holding people liable for acts \nthat were legal when they occurred. This credit helps to relieve some \nof that unfairness.\n  I want to issue an invitation, and a warning, to all those out there \nwho will say, ``This does not go far enough,'' or ``This is too much.'' \nFirst, the invitation. This bill is a work in progress. There will be a \nhearing on it before a markup, so make your views and suggestions \nknown--but move with alacrity, because we will take this up in the \ncommittee as soon as we possibly can. Senator Smith's staff and my \nstaff are ready to work with you on this.\n  Second, the warning. If we fail, everyone loses. There is no longer a \nstatus quo for Superfund--just look at the cut the program took $1.33 \nbillion down to $1 billion in both the Senate and House versions of the \nEPA appropriations bill. Unless we pass a new Superfund law, we are \nlooking at a $1 billion program, with even less in 1997 and beyond, \nprobably with the existing taxes reauthorized. This will be the lose/\nlose scenario:\n  PRP's, and their insurers, lose. If you thought Enforcement First was \nbad, wait until Enforcement Only. The existing litigation machine rolls \non. EPA, without many resources, runs the program by issuing section \n106 orders, or suing a handful of parties for cost recovery.\n  EPA and all the agencies getting money from Superfund lose as the \nprogram slowly contacts, losing the expertise we want to keep on \ntechnical issues, until all that is left is a handful of lawyers to \nwrite those section 106 orders.\n  Protection of human health and the environment loses, because the \npace of Federally funded cleanup slows down in the face of declining \nbudgets until the Federal Superfund becomes Enforcement Only.\n  People paying Superfund taxes lose. Their taxes will probably get \nextended, but only two-thirds of those taxes will go to Superfund \ncleanup this year, and less in the future. And corporations paying \nSuperfund taxes can still get sued by EPA or other PRP's. They will pay \ntwice.\n  So I end with a call for common sense and realistic expectations. \nWhen you make suggestions to improve this bill, please furnish us with \nan estimate of how much it will cost, where the money will come from, \nand how we can spend the money given the budget caps and firewalls.\n  I want to assure all the members of the committee, and the Senate, \nthat we will work to accommodate their concerns as we move forward on \nthis bill. This is not a perfect bill, but neither Senator Smith nor I \nplan to repeat last year's so-called delicate balance \n\n[[Page S 14738]]\nSuperfund bill, a deal made off the Hill that was so fragile that could \nnot be changed without the deal falling apart. Some members of the \ncommittee have expressed concerns with some provisions in the bill as \nintroduced. Senator Kempthorne has expressed concern about the impact \nof Superfund on dry cleaners. Senator Warner is concerned about the \npotential impact on recycling operations, and in how the States and \nFederal Government will control the costs of federal facility cleanups. \nSenator Inhofe would like to see more protection for acts that occurred \nin the distant past. I will continue to work with Senator Smith on \nissues of concern to me, including groundwater and natural resource \ndamage provisions. I know that other members of the Committee have \nother concerns as well. We will work to resolve these concerns as we \nmove forward. This bill is no fragil compromise, and we will work \nwithin the budget constraints that we must all live with to get the \nbest bill we can.\n  Again, I want to commend Senator Smith and his staff for putting this \ncomplex bill together and bringing it quickly forward to this point. We \nhave been working together on this since the start of the Congress, and \ntoday is an important milestone. It will not be easy to meet the goal \nwe share--passage this year--but it will not be for lack of a continued \nteam effort on this committee.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SMITH:\n  S. 1286. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act regarding \nmanagement of remediation waste, certain recyclable industrial \nmaterials, and certain products, coproducts, and intermediate products, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n               the resource conservation and recovery act\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in addition to the Superfund Accelerated \nCleanup bill, I would also like to introduce today a targeted Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act--or ``rick-ra''--reform bill. I offer \nthis bill in the hopes that it will supplement and enhance the reforms \nwe are proposing to Superfund.\n  It is my feeling that these changes are consistent with the goals of \nthe RCRA ``Rifle Shot'' proposal being discussed within the \nAdministration.\n  My targeted bill is intended to: Provide greater consistency among \nenvironmental statutes; make RCRA more user friendly; eliminate costly \nand ineffective bureaucratic burdens; and maintain, or improve, current \nprotections to human health and the environment.\n  I feel the provisions of this bill will greatly enhance recycling and \nreuse of hazardous materials and will begin to provide cohesiveness \nbetween the two largest hazardous waste laws--Superfund and RCRA.\n  We are trying to accomplish three things with this act:\n  First, remove some recyclable hazardous materials from current RCRA \nprovisions, and instead, subject them to a tailored set of standards \nwhich will facilitate the reuse of these materials in an \nenvironmentally friendly way.\n  Under current law, the only option is to discard such materials.\n  Second, specify a reasonable point at which a material is considered \nhazardous.\n  Currently, EPA is required to apply very strict controls once a \nhazardous material is created, even if it is created very early in a \nmanufacturing process.\n  This greatly increases the costs of managing wastes, regardless of \nwhether they ever come in contact with the environment.\n  Third, allow EPA to determine when a hazardous material is no longer \nconsidered hazardous.\n  Under the current law, EPA does not have the authority to tailor its \nstandards to specific risks posed by some hazardous substances.\n  This greatly increases the cost of treating materials that pose \nlittle or no risk.\n  Mr. President, these changes will not only save money on waste \nmanagement and cleanup, it will also greatly increase the effectiveness \nof our waste management laws in protecting human health and the \nenvironment. I urge its passage at the earliest possible date.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1286\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

An act to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to provide that Federal employees who are erroneously covered by \nthe Civil Service Retirement System may elect to continue such coverage \nor transfer to coverage under the Federal Employees Retirement System, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n     Federal Employee Retirement system (FERS) Transfer Legislation\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which \noffers a legislative solution for a number of Federal employees who \nhave been the unwitting victims of paperwork errors. Over 10 years ago, \nCongress passed a Public Law 98-369, which eliminated the Social \nSecurity exclusion for Federal employees with prior military service. \nThis law was made retroactive to January of that year, and it was up to \neach Federal agency to find the individual workers who were affected by \nthis law and change them from the old Civil Service Retirement System \n[CSRS] into the Federal Employee Retirement System [FERS].\n  Unfortunately, a small but important group of workers have remained \nin the CSRS retirement system, because of agency error. Over time, \nthese agencies have belatedly discovered employees who are improperly \nenrolled in CSRS and are forcing them back to FERS. This has been \ndisruptive and unfair to the affected employees, since they are losing \nmany years of contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan, which my \ncolleagues know is critical to any FERS retirement. In many cases, the \nagencies reluctantly made this switch, but they had no authority to \ngive a waiver to these public servants.\n  Today I am offering a bill which will allow Federal employees who \nwere inadvertently enrolled in the wrong retirement system to remain in \nCSRS. It is nearly impossible to make an employee whole after many \nyears of contributing to the wrong retirement system, despite agency \nefforts to do so.

A bill to reduce the deficit; to the Committee on the \nBudget.\n\n\n                           budget legislation\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I introduce a ``Budget Buster Bill'' \nthat strips more than $90 billion from the budget and cuts 40 programs \nwhich I consider to be pointless, wasteful, antiquated, or just plain \nsilly.\n  Our priority is people not ``pork'' or special interests, and this \nproposal recognizes the need to cut while at the same time \nunderstanding the need to invest in those things that bring this Nation \nits greatest return.\n  I know that the budget debate is philosophically driven, and that \nthere are diametrically opposed positions on the legitimate role of \ngovernment. But no matter where one falls on the political spectrum, it \nbehooves us to point to specific savings that cross philosophical lines \nwhich can and should be made.\n  We came to our senses last week, and in a display of commonsense \nbipartisanship, we overwhelmingly passed an amendment that cut the mink \nsubsidy. There are other similar programs that we should cut, and this \nbill cuts them.\n  It cuts $11 billion for the space station. It cuts $10 billion from \ndefense spending. It saves $360 million by reducing the number of \npolitical appointees in the Federal Government; and it cuts 37 other \nprograms.\n  I know that this bill, in and of itself, won't balance the budget, \nbut it is one Senator's commonsense effort to answer the question, ``if \nyou really want to cut the budget, what would you cut and how would you \ndo it?''\n  Mr. President, there is no magic in this bill, but there is a healthy \ndose of common sense that seems to be sorely lacking in the \nideologically driven budget debate that is speaking to the activist \nextremes and ignoring the silent middle.\n  Despite the fact that a huge portion of the public has said they \ndon't like the way we do business; despite the fact that we talk about \nchange but rarely accomplish it; despite the fact that we claim to want \nbipartisanship and avoid politics as usual, Congress and the President \ntogether are willfully moving down a road that is guaranteed to leave \nmost Americans questioning the degree to which people here are in \ntouch.\n  I find that a profoundly disturbing direction, and I find it contrary \nto all of the things that people are asking us to try to do. People \nwant us to behave like adults down here. They want an assurance that \ncritical services are not going to be made the poker chips of political \ngamesmanship.\n  The point is that there are some basic needs that this country faces \nand, to the best of my knowledge, most Americans think about having a \njob and raising their paychecks sufficiently that they have quality of \nlife to be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor.\n  And most people think that the real concerns they express about \nmaking sure their kids have the best education in the world, and that \nthey can walk through a neighborhood that is safe to get to a school \nthat is safe when they get there.\n  People are concerned about the quality of the education that they're \ngoing to get in that school. And yet, the debate in this country has \nbeen dominated by the return of a contribution to a campaign from a \nRepublican gay person; the symbolic issue of English as our national \nlanguage--which it is and ought to be; a constitutional amendment to \nprotect the flag. These truly are not the paramount concerns of \nAmericans but more of the traditional symbols of politics that are \nbeginning to make people question the entire political process.\n  Americans want to know if we're going to do the job. And the job we \nwere sent here to do is to produce a budget by the end of this month.\n  Rather than truly working on that budget, we are engaged in a charade \nwhere we're going to pass a continuing resolution and a series of \nappropriation bills without a true legislative effort but with one \nparty ordained to march in lock step to refuse any legislative \nproposals that might improve it.\n  I believe that is an unacceptable way to do business and an avoidance \nof our responsibility.\n  Frankly, it is time we put the interests of the Nation first, get off \nthe partisan track, and put America back on track.\n  Mr. President, this is a debate about economic fairness. It is about \nwhat we believe in and what we stand for as a nation. It's about the \ncreation and preservation of jobs. It's a debate not about class \nwarfare--rich against poor--but about the working class and how we can \nlegislate in their interests for their future.\n  It's a debate about commitment to family, about realistic tax policy, \nabout access to education, and investments in our future.\n  It's about addressing the three deficits we face that I have \nmentioned many times on this floor: the fiscal deficit, the investment \ndeficit, and the spiritual deficit.\n  I believe that this debate is fundamentally about how we can grow as \nan economy, a nation, and a people, and about what the proper role and \nsize of the Federal Government should be.\n  For my part, any consensus on the budget must recognize four \nprinciples: First that we will not compromise our commitment to \neducation, to jobs, to working families, and to senior citizens \nstruggling to make ends meet; that we will not dis-invest in our \neconomic, social, and cultural infrastructure; that we will not dis-\ninvest in necessary technologies and science; and that we will not cut \ntaxes unless and until we say to working Americans that there will be \nan increase in the minimum wage.\n  I believe the cuts I am proposing and the bipartisan, commonsense \ndirection in which they take us is in our best interest.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S. 1292. A bill to designate the U.S. Post Office building located at \n201 East Pikes Peak Avenue in Colorado Springs, CO, as the ``Winfield \nScott Stratton Post Office,'' and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              the winfield scott stratton post office act\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I would like to introduce \nlegislation that would designate the U.S. Post Office building located \nat 201 East Pikes Peak Avenue in Colorado Springs, CO, the Winfield \nScott Stratton Post Office.\n  This designation will honor the memory of a man who contributed \ngreatly to the community of Colorado Springs. Working as a carpenter \nand prospector for over 18 years, Winfield Scott Stratton was one of \nthe many adventurers who came to Colorado looking for their fortune. In \nhis case, the fortune was a rich deposit of gold in Cripple Creek, CO.\n  Mr. Stratton's lifestyle changed little after his gold strike. He \nbelieved it was the duty of anyone who made a fortune to use his wealth \nin the development of his community. In keeping with that philosophy, \nMr. Stratton dedicated the rest of his life to helping others less \nfortunate and to advancing the development of Colorado Springs and \nColorado.\n  He purchased and gave Colorado Springs the ground for its city hall; \nhe helped finance a new courthouse; he purchased and upgraded the \nstreet railway system; he built the first privately funded building at \nthe Colorado School of Mines; and he endowed the Myron \n\n[[Page S 14742]]\nStratton Home, a foster home for children and impoverished elderly \nwhich is still serving the Colorado Springs community today. Thousands \nof Coloradans today are the direct beneficiaries of Mr. Stratton's \ngenerosity.\n  Regarding this bill, it is noteworthy that Winfield Scott Stratton \nalso purchased the property at 201 East Pikes Peak Avenue and sold it \nto the Federal Government for half its value on the condition that the \nFederal Government build the post office which stands there today.\n  In view of Mr. Stratton's contribution to the existing post office \nand to Colorado as a whole, it is an entirely fitting and appropriate \ngesture to name this U.S. Post Office the Winfield Scott Stratton Post \nOffice. He was a man who shared his riches with an entire State, and he \nleft a legacy of love and care which continues today.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n        Nickles):\n  S. 1293. A bill to provide for implementation of the Agreed Framework \nwith North Korea regarding resolution of the nuclear issue on the \nKorean Peninsula, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n agreed framework between the united states and north korea legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nalong with Senators Helms, McCain, and Nickles, which would provide a \nmeans for the Congress to monitor the implementation of the ``Agreed \nFramework between the United States and North Korea'' on nuclear \nissues. This will ensure that when and if we vote funds for that \npurpose, we know that that money is achieving the agreed objectives. \nThe legislation conditions the availability of U.S. funds for \nfulfilling the accord on North Korea's abiding by the terms of the \nAgreed Framework and Confidential Minute in accordance with the \nschedule set forth in the agreement. Thus it adds necessary specificity \nto the timing and sequencing of all aspects of the Agreed Framework.\n  The Agreed Framework is written in traditional diplomatic language, \nwith insufficient detail on the timing and nature of actions which both \nNorth Korea and the United States must take to implement it. While I \nappreciate the Administration's desire to have flexibility in \nimplementing the accord, it will be important that the North Koreans \nand the Administration understand that the Congress desires greater \nspecificity if it is going to authorize and appropriate funds for this \naccord.\n  I would add, Mr. President, that the legislation I am proposing is \nfully consistent with the Agreed Framework and with current U.S. \npolicy. However, if this legislation causes difficulties for the \nAdministration at some point, the President can waive the provisions of \nthe legislation if he certifies to the Congress that it is vital to the \nnational security interests of the United States to do so.\n  In sum, the legislation provides the following:\n  Full political and economic normalization of relations--specifically \nthe exchange of Ambassadors and the total lifting of the economic \nembargo--with North Korea can occur only after:\n  IAEA safeguards requirements are met, including inspections of 2 \nsuspected nuclear waste sites.\n  Progress has been made in talks between North and South Korea.\n  A more effective, regularized process has been created to return U.S. \nMIAs from the Korean War, including through joint field activities, as \nin Vietnam.\n  North Korea no longer meets the criteria for inclusion on the list of \ncountries the governments of which support international terrorism.\n  North Korea takes positive steps to demonstrate greater respect for \nhuman rights.\n  North Korea agrees to abide by Missile Technology Control Regime.\n  All spent fuel has been removed from North Korea to a third country.\n  North Korea's graphite reactors have been dismantled in a manner that \nbars reactivation of such reactors and related facilities.\n  In short, until North Korea proves it is no longer a renegade state \nand wishes to behave as a normal, respected member of the international \ncommunity, including through negotiating peacefully with the Republic \nof Korea concerning the future of the Korean peninsula, we should not \nestablish full economic and political relations.\n  Interim steps toward full economic and political relations, such as \nsetting up diplomatic liaison offices and lifting certain economic \nregulatory sanctions, are not restricted under the legislation. In \nfact, I believe they can help provide incentives for the North Koreans \nto move ahead in these areas of concern while also giving the \nAdministration useful leverage.\n  The legislation also provides that the United States will suspend \nrelevant activities described in the Agreed Framework if North Korea \nreloads its existing 5 megawatt reactor or resumes construction of \nnuclear facilities other than those permitted to be built under the \nAgreed Framework.\n  The legislation also restricts United States direct or indirect \nsupport for exports of heavy fuel oil to North Korea if that state does \nnot maintain the freeze on its nuclear program or takes steps regarding \nthat oil which are not permitted under the Agreed Framework.\n  Finally, the legislation has a reporting requirement to ensure that \ncongressional monitoring of the implementation of the Agreed Framework \nand that the taxpayers' money is being spent effectively.\n  I look forward to extensive debate on this legislation and its early \npassage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I have often said, I have serious \nreservations about the October 1994 Nuclear Framework Agreement with \nNorth Korea. Therefore, I am pleased to be an original sponsor, with \nSenator Murkowski and others, of this legislation which would establish \nneeded specificity to the vagaries of the agreement and provide clearly \nstated incentives for North Korean compliance with its terms.\n  This legislation would prohibit the use of any U.S. taxpayer dollars \nto implement the Framework Agreement unless the Congress passes a law \nauthorizing and appropriating the funds. The President would also be \nrequired to certify that North Korea is in full compliance with the \nterms of the Framework Agreement before any authorized funds can be \nspent.\n  The legislation would prohibit normalization of diplomatic and \neconomic relations between the United States and North Korea until \nseveral conditions are met--conditions which clearly serve our national \ninterests, including the following:\n  North Korea must fully comply with the IAEA safeguards agreement for \nits nuclear program.\n  North Korea must forswear any support for international terrorism, \nand must demonstrate greater respect for human rights.\n  North Korea must halt the export of ballistic missiles and related \ntechnology and agree to adhere to the Missile Technology Control \nRegime.\n  The IAEA has inspected all suspected nuclear waste sites in North \nKorea.\n  And most important, in my view, all spent nuclear fuel must be \nremoved from North Korea, and their existing graphite-based nuclear \nreactors must be destroyed.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to discuss some of the glaring \nflaws in the Framework Agreement, which are the principal reasons for \nmy sponsorship of this legislation, and my predictions for the failure \nof the agreement.\n  The most charitable appraisal I can give the agreement is that it \nrepresents a tendered bribe to North Korea in exchange for a limit on \nits nuclear weapons program. The underlying problem with the Nuclear \nFramework Agreement is that it is based not on trust, but on wishful \nthinking. North Korea has a well-established record of breaking its \ncommitments to the U.S. and to the international community. At least \nnine times during the past two-and-a-half years, the North Koreans have \nreneged on their commitments. This agreement relies very heavily on \nNorth Korean good faith--indeed, it virtually tempts the North Koreans \nto break their word. That is its fundamental flaw.\n\n  The foolish time lags between North Korea's receipt of the benefits \nof this agreement and the points at which they are required to prove \ntheir good faith will, I believe, prove an irresistible temptation to \nthe North Koreans. This deal is front-end loaded in favor of North \nKorea. Under the deal, North \n\n[[Page S 14743]]\nKorea gets free oil, the benefits of trade and diplomatic relations, \ntwo new nuclear reactors, and untold additional benefits, including \ntacit forgiveness of their blatant violation of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty--most before incurring any real damage to their \nnuclear weapons program.\n  Thus far, North Korea is only required to freeze its nuclear program \nat Yongbyon, and freeze construction of two larger reactors. Since none \nof these facilities fueled a single light bulb in North Korea (the \nYongbyon reactor was never connected to a power grid), this is not much \nof a hardship.\n  The first serious obligation imposed on North Korea under the terms \nof the agreement will not occur for 3 to 5 years from now. At that \ntime, they must begin to transfer the spent fuel rods to an undisclosed \nthird country. Regrettably, the Administration either doesn't know or \nrefuses to disclose when this transfer will occur and which country is \nprepared to take the rods. We should insist on the transfer \nimmediately.\n  At that same time, as much as 5 years in the future, North Korea is \nsupposed to accept its second major obligation--challenge inspections \nof undisclosed nuclear sites--especially the two suspected nuclear \nwaste sites. These inspections are the only hope we have of determining \nwhat happened to the plutonium diverted during reprocessing in 1989. If \nNorth Korea reneges on the deal at this point--after receiving all the \nup-front benefits of the deal--we still won't know the truth about the \n1989 refueling of the Yongbyon reactor, and thus the truth about North \nKorea's nuclear weapons program.\n  Finally, the dismantlement of any of the North Korean nuclear \nfacilities will not begin until they have received one, fully \noperational, $2 billion light water reactor. This could be 7 or more \nyears away. And they don't have to complete dismantlement of their \nnuclear facilities until the second reactor is completed, perhaps at \nmuch as 10 years from now.\n  The harsh truth is that, by the time the North Koreans remove one \nbrick from any of their nuclear facilities, they will have received \nfrom the U.S. and our Asian allies as much as 5 million tons of oil, \ninestimable millions in trade and investment opportunities, the \npropaganda value of improved relations with the United States--quite \npossibly at the expense of our relationship with South Korea, and a $2 \nbillion, fully operational, state of the art, light water reactor--the \nsame kind we have pressured Russia and France not to sell to Iran.\n\n  The practical effect of providing significant amounts of energy and \neconomic aid to North Korea is to free up scarce hard currency for \nNorth Korea to use for almost any purpose--whether it is beefing up \ntheir military capability or rebuilding their failing infrastructure. \nEither way, their economy is almost certainly going to improve, and we \nmay be facing a firmly entrenched Communist regime in North Korea for \ndecades to come.\n  Given North Korea's long history of broken promises and violated \nagreements, why wouldn't we expect them to break their word again, \nafter collecting the many benefits of this agreement, and resume the \noperation of their current facilities after 5 or 8 or 10 years. This \nlegislation would create clearly stated incentives for the North \nKoreans to honor their commitments under the agreement and dismantle \ntheir nuclear weapons program--incentives which were not included in \nthe agreement itself.\n  Mr. President, although I believe the framework agreement is \nseriously flawed, I strongly believe that Congress should not overturn \nthe agreement. I do not want the U.S. Congress blamed for something \nthat will really be the result of North Korean duplicity. When this \nagreement fails, I want it to be clear to all who is responsible for \nthe failure--so that we can proceed immediately to organize \ninternational sanctions and other punitive measures which are designed \nto remove the threat of nuclear proliferation from the Korean Peninsula \nonce and for all. That is what we should have done last year.\n  At the same time, the American taxpayer should not be expected to \nunderwrite this agreement--with one exception, which I will explain in \na moment.\n  Initially, the administration promised that the only financial \ncommitment undertaken by the United States in the agreement was a one-\ntime shipment of oil worth roughly $5 million. Subsequent to that \ndeclaration, we learned that the President sent a letter to Kim Jong Il \npromising to ask Congress to pay for the new reactors if funding cannot \nbe found elsewhere. To pay for the oil shipment, the administration \navoided coming to Congress and took $4.7 million from Defense \nDepartment funds, using a little-known authority that is supposed to be \nused for ``emergencies and extraordinary expenses''--and they did it \nwithout giving Congress any prior notice.\n  I should note that this little-known ``emergency and extraordinary \nexpenses'' authority will not in the future be misused in such a \nfashion. I was successful in including a provision in the fiscal year \n1996 Defense authorization bill which establishes specific notification \nrequirements when the authority is exercised for any expenditure \nexceeding $500,000. This provision will become law as part of the FY \n1996 Defense Authorization Act.\n\n  Now, the Administration says that the U.S. financial commitment to \nthis agreement may ultimately amount to $20-30 million per year, or \n$200-300 million over the ten-year period of the agreement.\n  Since the Administration claims they did not guarantee North Korea \nthat we will contribute anything more than the agreed upon oil \nshipment, and since the Administration has already demonstrated its \nintention to cut Congress out of the loop as much as possible, I think \nCongress should decline to appropriate any further funds to implement \nthis accord--with one exception. That exception is with respect to the \nsecurity, safe storage, and subsequent removal from North Korea of the \n8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods corroding in a cooling pond at Yongbyon.\n  I believe we should test North Korea's intentions as early as \npossible. I believe we should identify a country willing to receive the \nfuel rods, and ask North Korea to ship them there. Should they comply, \nthe U.S. should pay for the transfer. It's worth the cost, because we \nwill remove from North Korea enough plutonium for 5 or 6 nuclear \nweapons, and we will have an early--though certainly not a definitive--\nindicator of how seriously North Korea is taking its commitments under \nthis agreement.\n  Until the fuel is removed from North Korea, I believe it is \nimperative to ensure the security and safe storage of the spent fuel. I \nworked successfully in the Senate Armed Services Committee for a \nprovision allowing up to $5 million of DOE funds to be used to complete \nwork on the safe storage, or canning, of the spent nuclear fuel at the \nYongbyon reactor site. Some of my colleagues wanted to refuse even this \nsmall amount of money, but I believe it would be counter-productive to \nallow the spent fuel to remain in an open and degrading storage pond, \nwhen we could at least ensure that it was less easily accessible to \nNorth Korea in the event the agreement fails. This provision will \nbecome law as part of the FY 1996 Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today, with Senator \nMurkowski and others, is entirely consistent with the provisions of the \nFramework Agreement between the U.S. and North Korea. It merely adds \nspecificity to the vagaries of the agreement, as well as incentives for \nNorth Korean compliance with the agreement. It also ensures that North \nKorea realizes a small part of the price it will pay for breaking its \nword to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. And it permits the \nPresident to waive any of its restrictive provisions if he certifies \nthat it is vital to U.S. national security to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It will ensure that \nthe laudable goals of the Framework Agreement are realized by fixing \nits flaws.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1294. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to repeal the \nrequirement that amounts paid to a member of the Armed Forces under the \nSpecial Separation Benefits Program of the Department of Defense, or \nunder the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program of that Department, be \noffset from amounts subsequently paid to that \n\n[[Page S 14744]]\nmember by the Department of Veterans Affairs as disability \ncompensation; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                     title 10 amendment legislation\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I reintroduce a bill to change \ncurrent law that requires amounts paid to a member of the Armed Forces \nunder the Special Separation Benefits and Voluntary Separation \nIncentive Programs be offset from amounts subsequently paid to that \nindividual by the Department of Veterans Affairs as disability \ncompensation.\n  Since the end of the cold war, our country has called on military \npersonnel to participate in several dangerous military operations, most \nrecently in the Persian Gulf, Somalia, and Haiti. These personnel have \nserved our country well. Unfortunately, due to language in the \nDepartment of Defense [DOD] Authorization Act for fiscal years 1992 and \n1993, veterans who participate in the Department of Defense's \ndownsizing by selecting one of two options, either a special separation \nbonus [SSB] lump sum payment or a voluntary separation incentive [VSI] \nmonthly payment, are prevented from receiving both disability \ncompensation from the VA and benefits from the SSB and VSI programs \nuntil the separation compensation is offset completely. My bill will \naddress this injustice by repealing these provisions and allow for \nconcurrent receipt. It will also be retroactive to December 5, 1991, so \nservice members not able to receive payment concurrently since 1991 \nwill be reimbursed for their lost compensation.\n   Mr. President, SSB and VSI benefits are for services rendered as \nwell as compensation for the veterans' participation in the DOD's \ndownsizing. VA disability pay is compensation for mental or physical \ndisabilities incurred in that service. These are two separate \ncompensations serving two very different purposes. Therefore, it is \nunfair to the veteran to offset one payment with another.\n  Aside from the unfairness of offsetting the costs of unrelated \ncompensation benefits, many veterans who returned from the Persian Gulf \nwar have come down with strange illnesses which are believed to be \nrelated to their service in the Persian Gulf. Individuals who have \naccepted SSB or VSI payments are suffering both physically and \nfinancially, as many cannot work under the conditions from which they \nare suffering. Repealing the offset will help ease this financial \nsuffering.\n  I urge the Congress to correct this injustice to our Nation's \nveterans and provide these veterans with the proper care and \ncompensation they deserve.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Faircloth, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1295.

Mr. President, North Carolina is the home of professional \nauto racing and it is on behalf of literally thousands of Tar Heels and \nmillions of other NASCAR racing fans across America that I today offer \nin the Senate the companion bill of the Motor Sports Protection Act \nwhich was introduced in the House on September 6 by the Honorable David \nFunderburk, who ably represents the Second North Carolina Congressional \nDistrict.\n  Mr. President, the announcement last month of plans by the Food and \nDrug Administration to designate tobacco has created much concern in my \nState, and other tobacco-producing southern States. This is an example \nof how Washington bureaucrats increase their regulatory power at the \nexpense of the livelihoods of the Nation's farmers and manufacturers. \nThe FDA's attack on tobacco advertising is sure to have a tremendously \nadverse effect on NASCAR racing.\n  The issue is whether companies have a right to advertise \ntheir products. Advertising is a lawful act and tobacco is a lawful \ncommodity. Unless and until tobacco is banned, proper advertising of \nthis lawful product must not be denied by bureaucratic wherein.\n\n  So, this bill will limit the Federal bureaucracy from imposing \nadvertising restrictions on any sponsors of pro racing. The motor \nsports industry contributes more than $2 billion to the South's economy \nevery year. Racing fans are hard working, law-abiding Americans--they \ndon't deserve bureaucratic mistreatment.\n  Mr. President, not too long ago, the ``King'' of racing Richard Petty \nretired. He left at a time when his name was synonymous with NASCAR \nracing. He was a perfect example of what can be accomplished with \ndetermination, faith, and family values. Richard Petty's success was \nbuilt on the cooperation of his family, friend, and companies that \nsupported him throughout his career.\n  My friend, Richard Petty sends word that he will very much appreciate \nSenators' support of this bill, and so will I.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                North Carolina Motor Speedway,\n\n                               Rockingham, NC, September 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Jesse A. Helms,\n     Senate Dirkson Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I am writing to express my concern \n     about President Clinton's plan to regulate tobacco and their \n     sponsorship of motorsports events at North Carolina Motor \n     Speedway. The FDA's proposed regulation will have a severe \n     impact, not only on the Speedway, but also on Moore, \n     Richmond, and surrounding counties. Loss of sponsorships \n     might mean ticket prices could go up, quality of events and \n     facilities could go down, which could contribute to lower \n     attendance. Our area depends heavily on revenue from those \n     attending motorsports and other sponsored events. Local \n     communities will be an economic loser from reduced attendance \n     at events.\n       I would appreciate you writing back to me with your views \n     on this important issue. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jo DeWitt Wilson,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. \n        Cochran):\n  S. 1296. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to clarify the treatment of a qualified football coaches plan; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n the qualified football coaches plan technical corrections act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Breaux, I \nrise today to introduce the Qualified Football Coaches Plan Technical \nCorrections Act of 1995. We are joined in this effort by Senators \nLugar, and Cochran.\n  As the title indicates, this bill is a technical correction to ensure \nthe proper qualification of a retirement plan for many of America's \ncollege football coaches. All of us in this body are in favor of \nencouraging retirement saving. However, the retirement plan set up for \nmany of these football coaches is in serious jeopardy.\n  Mr. President, let me explain what brought us to the point we are \ntoday on this issue. In 1987, Congress recognized the unique aspects of \nthe coaching profession and passed legislation to permit the American \nFootball Coaches Association [AFCA] to set up and maintain a qualified \ncash and deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal \nRevenue Code. The bill amended Title I of ERISA to permit such a plan \nto be treated as a qualified multiemployer plan. Due to the frequency \nwith which football coaches change jobs, legislation was needed to \nassist them in maintaining a retirement plan that is adequately \nportable.\n  In reliance on this legislation, the American Football Coaches \nAssociation, which represents over 4,400 college football coaches at \n676 schools, sponsored a 401(k) plan for its members that today has \nover 500 participants.\n  However, on the same day this legislation was passed, Congress was \ninvolved in addressing another problem contained in ERISA that was \nunrelated to the football coaches retirement plan. The problem was an \nunfavorable Tax Court ruling that held that the ERISA standard \nregarding employer withdrawals from pension plans, rather than the \nstandard under the Internal \n\n[[Page S 14745]]\nRevenue Code of 1986, applied for purposes of interpreting the Internal \nRevenue Code. Thus, Congress, in an attempt to reject the holding of \nthe Tax Court as it applied to Title I of ERISA, included a provision \nstating that Title I and Title IV of ERISA are not appicable in \ninterpreting the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This, of course, had \nthe unintended consequence of deeming the football coaches retirement \nplan an invalid plan for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Following the creation of the retirement plan, the coaches \nassociation asked the Internal Revenue Service to confirm the \ntax qualified status of the retirement plan. On three separate \noccasions, Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Service issued \ndetermination letters confirming the tax qualified status of the plan \nfor years 1988, 1989, and 1991. It was not until 1992 that the Internal \nRevenue Service determined that the 1987 provision invalidates what \nCongress did in Title I of ERISA to authorize the coaches 401(k) plan. \nIn that year, the IRS changed its position on the exempt status of the \ncoaches' retirement plan and indicated it would revoke the \ndetermination letters unless clarifying legislation is passed. The \nhorrible result will be a forced termination of the plan by the end of \n1995 which will impose a substantial cost on the football coaches and \nleave them without a retirement plan.\n\n  Mr. President, the original enacting legislation in 1987 was a \nbipartisan effort cosponsored by 34 Members of the Senate and 151 \nMembers in the House. This clarifying legislation is also a bipartisan \neffort. This bill eliminate the uncertainty that these coaches have \nbeen forced to live with since 1988.\n  Mr. President, I have requested the Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimate the revenue impact of this bill. The Joint Committee concluded \nthat this change is technical in nature and would have no revenue \nimpact. However, I do want to point out that if this change is not \nmade, hundreds of coaches will risk the loss of retirement benefits. \nThis is not the message we should send to those who follow in good \nfaith, the actions of a prior Congress.\n  I wish to commend the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, for his \nleadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. It is the right thing to do and is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

An Act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify certain provisions applicable to real estate investment \ntrusts.\n\n\n    THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST TAX SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator D'Amato, I \nrise today to introduce the Real Estate Investment Trust Tax \nSimplification Act of 1995, legislation to simplify and reform the tax \nlaw concerning Real Estate Investment Trusts [REITs]. Similar \nlegislation has been introduced in the House by Representative E. Clay \nShaw, Jr. along with many other Representatives.\n  REITs were designed to allow small investors to invest in large real \nestate projects that they otherwise could not afford to enter including \napartment buildings, office buildings, shopping centers, malls, \nwarehouses, etc. Real Estate Investment Trusts have become a very \npopular from of investment as indicated by the fact that the market \ncapitalization in the whole industry has risen from $9 billion in 1991 \nto over $50 billion today.\n  Mr. President, if a REIT properly follows all of the rules, it is not \nnormally taxed at the entity level, but passes through most items of \nincome to the shareholders to report on their own individual tax \nreturns. However, there are many complexities and uncertainties--\nminefields, if you will, for the unwary that can inadvertently penalize \ninvestors and even the general public in some circumstances. This bill \nis designed to alleviate these minefields.\n  Let me share with my colleagues an example of one of these \nminefields. Under the current rules, in order to gain the benefits of \nREIT taxation, the investment has to be passive in nature. Hence, the \nnormal procedure is for the REIT to buy the underlying property and \nlease it out to tenants. However, the REIT must be careful not to \nprovide directly to the tenants any services that are not customary in \nthe real estate business. If this rule is violated, severe consequences \ncan follow. For example, under a literal interpretation of the law, if \na REIT that operates a retail mall provides wheelchairs to the \ncustomers of the retail tenants, or even assist the tenant in moving \ninto it space, the entity's very status as a REIT could be placed in \njeopardy. This is ridiculous and needs to be changed.\n  Another unnecessary rule, Mr. President, could conceivably cause an \nentire community to lost its health care facility. Let me explain. \nUnder the current law, if an operator of a health care facility owned \nby a REIT defaults on its rent payments to the REIT, that health care \nfacility could be shut down for a long period of time, even though \nthere may be other health care operators willing and able to take over \nthe facility. Why? Because current law basically prohibits the REIT \nfrom operating the facility itself and, at the same time, artificially \nreduces the pool of potential operators that can run the health care \nfacility without causing undue tax problems to the REIT and its owners. \nThis potential problem faces many REITs and many communities inasmuch \nas REITs currently own about $10 billion of investments in health care \nfacilities around the nation. This bill will eliminate the perverse \nincentive to shut down such critical facilities in the unfortunate case \nof foreclosure.\n  Mr. President, this bill also relaxes some of the current law's \nonerous penalties for failing to perform some record keeping \nrequirements. Currently a REIT could lose its favored tax status simply \nby failing to send out or receive back shareholder demand letters for \nthe purpose of verifying the fact that no five or fewer parties own \ncontrolling interests in the REIT. So, even though the REIT in fact \nmeets this test, Mr. President, simply by failing to have on file \nsufficient shareholder letters substantiating this fact, all of the \nREIT shareholders could face the extremely harsh penalty of REIT \ndisqualification and double taxation.\n  Rather than penalizing the REIT so severely for this oversight, Mr. \npresident, this bill would impose a $25,000 penalty for failure to \ncomply with this requirement, if the failure is inadvertent in nature. \nThe penalty would rise to $50,000 in the case of willful noncompliance. \nI believe my colleagues would agree that this approach makes much more \nsense that the current rules since it serves as an adequate incentive \nto keep the appropriate records without causing the unsuspecting, \ninnocent investors severe and unnecessary personal tax penalties.\n  Mr. President, this bill also addresses other problems that are \ndetailed in the summary of the bill that I ask unanimous consent to be \nincluded in the Record after my remarks.\n  This bill is not controversial and will have a negligible effect on \nrevenues, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is important \nto note that this bill is endorsed by the National Association of Real \nEstate Investment Trusts, which represents a high percentage of the \nREIT industry. Whenever we can do things to simplify the tax code \nwithout causing substantial \n\n[[Page S 14746]]\nrevenue loss or negative policy consequences, we should do it. Mr. \nPresident, this is an opportunity for us to do just that in the area of \nReal Estate Investment Trusts. I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to join me in reforming and simplifying the tax law regarding \nthis very difficult and complex area of the law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na detailed summary of its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as the follows:\n\n                                S. 1297\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REMOVAL OF TAX TRAPS FOR THE UNWARY\n\n     SEC. 101. SHAREHOLDER DEMAND LETTER\n\n       Sections 856(a)(5) and 856(a)(6) require that a REIT have \n     at least 100 beneficial owners, and that it not be ``closely \n     held'' within the meaning of the personal holding company \n     rules. A REIT that is disqualified because it fails to meet \n     the requirements in section 856(a) generally may not elect \n     REIT status again for a period of 5 years.\n       In addition, section 857(a)(2) disqualified a REIT for any \n     year in which it does not comply with Internal Revenue \n     Service (``IRS'') regulations prescribed to ascertain the \n     ``actual ownership'' of the REIT's outstanding shares. \n     Sections 1.857-8(d) and (e) of the Income Tax Regulations \n     (the ``Regulations'') \n\n[[Page S 14748]]\n     require a REIT to demand, from its shareholders of record, a written \n     statement identifying the ``actual owner'' (for income tax \n     purposes) of the stock held in such shareholder's name. The \n     Regulations specify which shareholders must be sent such \n     letter, based on the total number of REIT shareholders and \n     the percentage of shares held by each record holder. This \n     demand letter must be sent within 30 days of the close of the \n     REIT's taxable year.\n       Failure to comply with the rules in Regulations section \n     1.857-8, through inadvertence or otherwise, technically \n     causes disqualification of REIT status for the taxable year, \n     notwithstanding that the REIT may satisfy the substantive \n     share ownership rules in section 856(a)(6). As in the case of \n     any disqualification under section 856(a), a REIT that is \n     disqualified under the shareholder demand letter regulations \n     may not elect REIT status again for a period of 5 years \n     without IRS consent.\n       Even those REITs that comply with the demand letter \n     regulations, and are not aware of any violations of the \n     ownership test, cannot know for certain whether they complied \n     with such tests, the ownership information is not in the \n     hands of the REIT and the REIT cannot compel its shareholders \n     to respond to the demand letter. This uncertainty is \n     increased for publicly-traded REITs that have a large portion \n     of their shares held in ``street name.''\n       This bill proposes that a failure to comply with the \n     shareholder demand letter regulations should not, by itself, \n     disqualify a REIT if the REIT otherwise establishes that it \n     satisfies the substantive rules involved. Under these \n     circumstances, a $25,000 penalty ($50,000 for intentional \n     violations) would be imposed for any year in which the REIT \n     did not comply with the shareholder demand letter regulations \n     and the REIT would be required, when requested by the IRS, \n     to send curative demand letters. This bill strikes the \n     right balance between the ``atomic bomb'' consequences of \n     present law and the need to provide a disincentive for \n     REITs not to send out demand letters.\n       Also under this bill, a REIT would be deemed to satisfy the \n     share ownership requirements in section 856(a)(6) if it \n     complies with the shareholder demand letter regulations and \n     does not know, or have reason to know, of an actual violation \n     of the ownership rules. Thus, a REIT that complies with the \n     regulations, but is unable to discover an actual ownership \n     violation and has no reason to suspect such a violation, \n     would not be disqualified before it has reason to know of \n     such violation. This amendment is vital to protect companies \n     that exercise their best efforts to comply with the ownership \n     rules, but somehow later discover that a technical violation \n     exists.\n\n     SEC. 102. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT--DE MINIMIS RULE FOR TENANT \n                   SERVICES INCOME.\n\n       The REIT tax provisions include several independent \n     contractor rules. The primary rule is found in section \n     856(d)(2)(C), which generally provides that ``rents from real \n     property'' do not include amounts received with respect to \n     the property if the REIT furnishes services to the tenants, \n     or manages or operates the property, other than through an \n     independent contractor. Congress modified this rule in 1986 \n     by adding the language at the end of section 856(d)(2)(C). \n     This language permits the REIT to receive amounts for \n     furnishing customary services or managing property, without \n     using an independent contractor, provided such amounts would \n     be excluded from unrelated business taxable income under \n     section 512(b)(3) if received by a section 511(a)(2) exempt \n     organization.\n       Congress' relaxation of the independent contractor rule has \n     helped the industry in efficiently managing rental properties \n     on a competitive basis. However, certain problems persist. \n     Under the existing language of section 856(d)(2)(C), the \n     receipt of even a de minimis amount of non-qualified income \n     or rendering a small amount of impermissible services with \n     respect to a given property may disqualify all rents received \n     with respect to such property. The disqualification of the \n     entire property's rents could jeopardize the REITS's \n     qualified status.\n       The present independent contractor rule creates significant \n     administrative burdens for REITs because of the need to \n     ensure that no REIT personnel ever perform any disqualifying \n     service. In addition, due to the inherent ambiguity of the \n     rule, significant time and expense are incurred by both REITs \n     and the IRS in applying for and issuing private letter \n     rulings that delineate permissible and impermissible \n     services. Further, even a vigilant and conservative REIT \n     cannot control whether a particular employee performs a \n     service to its tenants that may taint the rents on a \n     property. Last, the present rule unreasonably penalizes a \n     REIT for providing services (which may be directly related to \n     the operation of its property) to a tenant (by tainting all \n     amounts received from that tenant) that it may, with much \n     less chance of disqualification, provide to third parties.\n       This bill proposes a de minimis exception to the \n     independent contractor rule. This proposal would simplify \n     REIT administration and would remove the risk of \n     disqualifying a REIT that inadvertently performs nominal, \n     although impressible, services. Further, the proposal would \n     not encourage international disregard for the independent \n     contractor rule, because of the relatively small amount of \n     services that it would permit.\n       The approach taken in this bill would provide a simple, \n     bright line test that the IRS could administer easily.\n\n     SEC. 103. ATTRIBUTION RULES APPLICABLE TO TENANT OWNERSHIP.\n\n       Section 856(d)(2)(B) generally disqualifies rents received \n     from any person, if the REIT owns 10% or more of the \n     ownership interests in such person or has an interest equal \n     to 10% or more in the assets or net profits of such person. \n     For purposes of determining the REIT's ownership interest in \n     a tenant, the attribution rules of section 318 apply, except \n     that 10% is substituted for 50% when it appears in \n     subparagraph (C) of section 318(a)(2) and 318(a)(3). Under \n     section 318(a)(3)(A), stock owned, directly or indirectly, by \n     a partner is considered owned by the partnership. In \n     addition, under section 318(a)(3)(C) a corporation is \n     considered as owning stock that is owned, directly or \n     indirectly, by or for a person who also owns more than 50% \n     (10% for REITs) of the stock in such corporation.\n       The attribution rules may create an unintended result when \n     several persons who own collectively 10% of a REIT's tenant, \n     also own collectively 10% of the REIT. So long as these \n     persons are unrelated and their individual interest in each \n     entity is less than 10%, then no violation of section \n     856(d)(2) occurs. However, if each of these persons happen to \n     obtain an interest, no matter how small, in the same \n     unrelated partnership, then the attribution rules may cause \n     the rents received from the tenant to be disqualified under \n     section 856(d)(2). Such a result could occur even though \n     section 318(a)(5)(C) specifically provides that the stock \n     ownership interests of a partner are not to be attributed to \n     another partner via the partnership.\n       Under one understanding of current law, the problem arises \n     because all of the partners' shares of stock in the tenant \n     are attributed to the unrelated partnership under section \n     318(a)(3)(A). Since the partnership also is considered as \n     owning the partners' shares in the REIT, section 318(a)(3)(C) \n     treats the REIT as owning all of the shares in the tenant \n     that are deemed held by the partnership. Thus, the rule in \n     section 856(d)(2) is violated.\n       The potential for disqualification, under one reading of \n     current law, is detailed in the following example: Pension \n     Plan A holds stock representing 10% of the value in REIT. The \n     remaining shares of REIT are publicly held. Pension Plan A \n     and Corporation B each hold a 1% interest by value in \n     Partnership, and the remainder of Partnership's interests are \n     publicly held. Partnership holds various securities in \n     entities other than REIT. Tenant, which leases retail space \n     from REIT, is 10% owned by Corporation B, with the remaining \n     interest publicly-held. Under section 318(A)(3)(A), \n     Partnership is deemed to own A's 10% interest in the value of \n     REIT and B's 10% interest in Tenant. Further, section \n     318(a)(3)(C) provides that REIT is deemed to own any stock \n     held by its 10% shareholder. As a result, REIT could be \n     deemed to own Partnership's deemed interest in Tenant. If \n     so, the Tenant's rent payments to REIT would be \n     disqualified.\n       These attribution rules disqualify amounts as rent even \n     when the relationship between the tenant and the REIT is \n     tenuous at best and abuse of the REIT concept is \n     inconceivable. In any event, the rules are largely \n     unenforceable because one partner will not know what the \n     other partners own. The problem is particularly problematic \n     with institutional investors that own small percentage \n     interests in multiple partnerships owning securities and \n     other assets unrelated to a REIT.\n       One understanding of the interplay between section \n     318(a)(3)(A) and (a)(3)(C) with the facts described above is \n     equivalent to applying attribution rules to shares of stock \n     held by partners. As noted, this is contrary to the policy \n     set forth in section 318(a)(5)(C), which prohibits the \n     reattribution of stock constructively owned by a partnership \n     (via a partner) to another partner in the partnership. \n     Without this partner-to-partner attribution, neither A nor B \n     in the examples above, directly or indirectly, hold the 10% \n     interest in both REIT and Tenant that section 856(d)(2)(B) \n     requires for disqualification. Congress solved a similar \n     problem of ``partner to partner'' attribution in another REIT \n     context. In determining whether a REIT is ``closely held'' \n     for purposes of section 856(a)(6), the attribution rules in \n     section 544 apply. In 1986, Congress enacted section 856(h), \n     which provides in part that the attribution rules in section \n     544 will apply as if they did not include the phrase ``or by \n     or for his partner.''\n       This bill would modify the application of section \n     318(a)(3)(A) (attribution to partnerships), for purposes of \n     section 856(d)(2), so that attribution would occur only when \n     a partner owns a 25% or greater interest in the partnership. \n     Applying a percentage threshold (rather than suspending \n     entirely the application of section 318(a)(3)(A) would \n     prevent the potentially abusive technique of placing \n     ``dummy'' partnerships between individuals and the REIT. This \n     is a common sense approach that would simplify monitoring the \n     ownership interests of all involved parties.\n\n      TITLE II. CONFORMITY WITH REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY RULES\n\n     SEC. 201. CREDIT FOR TAX PAID BY REIT ON RETAINED CAPITAL \n                   GAINS.\n\n       Under the regulated investment company ((``RIC'') \n     provisions, RICs (also known as mutual funds) always have \n     been permitted to pass through a credit to their shareholders \n     for taxes paid on retained capital gains. This \n\n[[Page S 14749]]\n     treatment helps preserve the capital base of the company, \n     while respecting the principle of a single level of \n     taxation.\n       Under section 857(b)(3)(A)(ii) and section 4981(c)(1)(B), a \n     REIT need not distribute capital gains to its shareholders, \n     but may be subject to tax on such undistributed gains under \n     section 1201(a). A subsequent distribution of such gains is \n     taxable to the REIT's shareholders, resulting in a double \n     tax.\n       This double tax is inconsistent with the original \n     Congressional intent to create a real estate entity parallel \n     to RICs, and limits a REIT's ability to effectively manage \n     assets. Because of the potential double tax on capital \n     transactions, a REIT usually is compelled to either \n     distribute any sale proceeds or not complete the transaction.\n       This would amend section 857(b)(3) to mirror the rules \n     applicable to RICs.\n\n                    TITLE III. OTHER SIMPLIFICATION\n\n     SEC. 301. EARNINGS & PROFITS--DISTRIBUTION RULE.\n\n       Enacted in 1986, section 857(a)(3) requires newly-electing \n     REITs to distribute, during their first REIT taxable year, \n     earnings and profits (``E'') that were accumulated in non-\n     REIT years. The ordering rule in section 316 complicates the \n     E distribution requirement, by treating all distributions \n     as being made from the most recently accumulated E Under \n     this rule, the unexpected realization of income near the end \n     of the year can convert previous distributions of accumulated \n     E into distributions from current E For example, assume \n     a company distributes $200x in November, which represents its \n     current E to date ($100x) and its entire accumulated E \n     ($100x), and makes no other distributions during the year. If \n     the company earns an additional $10x in December, its \n     accumulated E as of the end of the year is $10x, \n     notwithstanding the prior $200x distribution.\n       The effect of the E rule in section 316 could be \n     disastrous for a newly-electing REIT that is required to \n     distribute all of its accumulated E during its first REIT \n     year. The year-end receipt of any form of unanticipated \n     income, such as unexpected overages from shopping mall \n     tenants, could cost the new REIT its qualification. Most \n     REITs (and most taxpayers, for that matter) cannot determine \n     precisely the amount of their income before the end of the \n     year. Ordinarily, the receipt of nominal amounts of income \n     near the end of the year do not cause problems for \n     established REITs, since they can use the ``subsequent \n     declared dividend'' election in section 858 to make sure they \n     meet their annual requirements to distribute 95 percent of \n     their income.\n       However, the requirement in section 857(a)(3) effectively \n     overrides the 95 percent income distribution requirement, \n     since no accumulated E can be distributed until the REIT \n     distributes 100 percent of current E In addition, the \n     section 858 election, which historically was available \n     for all required distributions, cannot be used for section \n     857(a)(3) distributions since this election is available \n     only for distributions of current E\n       The ability to retain a small percentage of current \n     earnings and the section 858 election both have been part of \n     the REIT tax rules since 1960. Until 1986, REITs were not \n     required to distribute any portion of their accumulated E \n     These adverse effects of the new accumulated E distribution \n     requirement on both of these provisions is an unintended \n     consequence of the 1986 change.\n       This bill would deem section 857(a)(3) distributions as \n     being made first from accumulated E, then from current E \n     This provision would ensure that year-end receipts of \n     unanticipated income would not cause a new REIT to be \n     disqualified. The proposal would not affect the requirement \n     that such REIT also must distribute 95% of its current \n     income, nor would it otherwise alter the traditional ordering \n     rule for E distributions.\n\n     SEC. 302. FORECLOSURE PROPERTY.\n\n       A REIT is permitted to conduct a trade or business using \n     property acquired through foreclosure for 90 days after it \n     acquired such property, provided the REIT makes a foreclosure \n     property election. After the 90-day period, the REIT may no \n     longer conduct such trade or business, except through an \n     independent contractor from whom the REIT does not derive or \n     receive any income. Property is eligible for a foreclosure \n     election if a REIT acquired it through foreclosure on a loan \n     or default on a lease, but not if a REIT acquired it because \n     a lease expired.\n       If it makes the foreclosure property election in section \n     856(e)(5), a REIT may hold foreclosure property for resale to \n     customers without being subject to the 100% penalty tax under \n     the prohibited transaction rules. Non-qualifying income from \n     foreclosure property generally is subject to the highest \n     corporate tax rate. The foreclosure property election is \n     valid for 2 years, but may be extended up to 6 years with the \n     IRS' consent. Under section 856(e)(4)(C), foreclosure \n     property status is lost if, at some time after 90 days from \n     the date such property is acquired, the property is used in a \n     trade or business conducted by the REIT (other than through \n     an independent contractor from whom the REIT does not derive \n     any income).\n       This bill would make the period covered by an election \n     three years and the initial foreclosure property election \n     valid until the last day of the third full taxable year \n     following the election. The present 2-year period is not a \n     realistic time period for disposing of foreclosure property, \n     especially in a depressed real estate market. In addition, \n     this bill would reduce recordkeeping and filing requirements \n     associated with managing foreclosure property and the need \n     for the IRS to review extension requests.\n       Further, this bill would modify the rule in section \n     856(e)(4)(C) that requires a REIT to use an independent \n     contractor to manage foreclosure properties. This \n     modification would make the rule parallel to the primary \n     independent contractor rule in section 856(d)(2)(C). This \n     change would reduce the technical complexity and \n     administrative costs associated with managing foreclosure \n     property: it would provide a single, consistent standard \n     for managing both foreclosure and non-foreclosure \n     properties.\n\n     SEC. 303. SPECIAL FORECLOSURE RULES FOR HEALTH CARE \n                   PROPERTIES.\n\n       Health care REITs play an important economic role in both \n     the health care and REIT industries. For example, REITs have \n     invested about $10 billion in health care properties, either \n     as owners or lenders. This amount represents approximately \n     13% of the real estate investment by all REITs. These \n     properties range from nursing homes and extended care \n     facilities to acute care facilities.\n       These REITs face unique problems under the foreclosure \n     property rules when the lessee/operator of a health care \n     facility terminates its lease, either through expiration or \n     default. Unlike most other forms of rental properties, if a \n     health care property lease terminates, it is extremely \n     difficult to close the facility because medical services to \n     patients must be maintained. In fact, a variety of government \n     regulations mandate measures to protect patients' welfare, \n     which greatly restrict the ability to simply terminate the \n     facility. In addition, because of the limited number of \n     qualified health care providers, it can be very difficult to \n     find a substitute provider that also will lease the property.\n       When a health care REIT acquires property either through a \n     loan foreclosure, lease default, or lease expiration, the \n     REIT must be able to ensure that the facility will remain \n     open beyond the initial 90-day period. For many patients, \n     especially those in rural areas, there may be no available \n     alternative facilities in the locality. Frequently, if space \n     is available in an alternative facility, such facility may \n     not accept government-paid patients (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid \n     or county assistance), which account for 70% of the residents \n     in properties of health care REITs. Patients in facilities \n     owned by health care REITs typically include the frail \n     elderly, the chronically ill and the disabled who require \n     long term care. They cannot, and should not, be evicted and \n     forced to relocate away from supportive family and friends, \n     which could jeopardize their health and cause treatment \n     setbacks.\n       The 90-day time period during which a REIT is permitted to \n     operate a facility is inadequate for the REIT to conclude a \n     lease with a health care provider. Health care properties \n     typically are acquired in a sale-leaseback transaction in \n     which the original owner continues to operate the facility as \n     a lessee. After this lessee vacates the property, it is very \n     difficult to find a qualified health care provider that is \n     willing to assume not only the operational responsibilities \n     for the facility, but also the long-term financial risks \n     associated with being a lessee. This is particularly true \n     when the original lessee abandoned the facilities because of \n     financial problems.\n       Regulatory requirements further complicate and delay the \n     releasing process. Potential lessees may be required to \n     obtain up to 30 separate licenses from separate government \n     agencies before they can assume control of a facility. In \n     addition, many states impose certificate of need requirements \n     when facility operators are changed. These proceedings can \n     become adversarial and protracted.\n       Therefore, in order to keep a health care facility \n     operational after the 90-day period has expired under the \n     foreclosure property rules, a REIT must be able to hire a \n     licensed health care provider that also qualifies as an \n     independent contractor (a party from whom the REIT does not \n     derive or receive any income or profits). The limited pool of \n     licensed providers that could qualify as independent \n     contractors may be dramatically reduced, since many of these \n     providers already lease other health care properties owned by \n     the REIT. As existing lessees of the REIT, these providers \n     generate income to the REIT, and thus may be viewed by the \n     IRS as disqualified from serving as independent contractors \n     with respect to a second REIT property.\n       The problems that arise from foreclosing on a defaulted \n     lease or mortgage also exist in the case of a health care \n     provider/lessee who abandons the facility upon the expiration \n     of a lease. A final decision whether or not to renew the \n     lease may not be made until expiration occurs, giving the \n     REIT little or no lead time to find a substitute provider/\n     lessee. Even if adequate notice is given to the REIT that the \n     provider/lessee intends to quit the business, this notice \n     does not increase the pool of health care providers that \n     could qualify as independent contractors.\n       This bill provides that in the case of qualified health \n     care properties, a health care provider will not be \n     disqualified as an independent contractor for purposes of the \n     foreclosure property rules solely because the REIT receives \n     rental income from the provider with respect to one or more \n     other properties. In addition, the bill provides that REIT \n     could make a foreclosure property election with respect to \n     lease expirations of qualified health care properties.\n\n[[Page S 14750]]\n\n       These changes would help ensure that important health care \n     facilities are not forced to be closed because of a technical \n     requirement in the Code. As with any properties that are \n     subject to a foreclosure election, non-rental income realized \n     by the REIT under this proposal would be subject to the \n     highest corporate tax rate.\n\n     SEC. 304. PAYMENTS UNDER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.\n\n       In 1988, Congress added section 856(c)(6)(G), which \n     generally provides that income from an interest rate swap or \n     cap agreement used to hedge a variable rate indebtedness is \n     treated as qualifying income under section 856(c)(2). In \n     addition, such agreement is treated as a security for \n     purposes of section 856(c)(4)(A), which limits a REIT's gain \n     on the sale of securities held for less than 1 year to 30% of \n     gross income.\n       A swap agreement is a contractual arrangement between \n     parties that permits them to convert existing variable rate \n     interest payments or receipts into fixed rates, and vice \n     versa. Thus, swaps may be used to hedge against potential \n     increases in interest rates on debt exposures, as well as to \n     capture higher rates on fixed income streams. Interest rate \n     caps likewise may be used to hedge interest payments or \n     receipts, but such hedge is effective only over a specified \n     range.\n       There are a number of financial products available, in \n     addition to swaps and caps, that may be important tools in a \n     company's effort to hedge its exposure to increased \n     liabilities and to protect current high returns. As the REIT \n     industry has grown and become more knowledgeable in managing \n     its investments, more and more REITs are using financial \n     instruments of all kinds as a conservative method of managing \n     their interest rate exposure.\n       A REIT should be permitted to use the wide variety of \n     financial instruments that are available for managing its \n     liability exposures, whether the interest rates are fixed or \n     variable. Financial markets world-wide have undergone \n     revolutionary changes over the past decade. These changes \n     have brought about dramatic liquidity in interest rate and \n     currency markets, which in turn have significantly increased \n     the volatility in these markets.\n       This bill would amend the REIT rules to allow all types of \n     hedges of REIT liabilities. It would also insure that any \n     income from a hedge mechanism will be excluded from either \n     the numerator or denominator of any of the REIT income tests. \n     This rule would not permit a REIT to speculate in hedging \n     instruments, nor alter the REIT's primary mission to invest \n     in real estate assets.\n\n     SEC. 305. EXCESS NONCASH INCOME.\n\n       Generally, REITs are required to distribute 95% of their \n     taxable income to shareholders each year. In 1986, Congress \n     recognized the inequity of requiring a REIT to distribute \n     ``phantom income'' items, in which the REIT recognizes income \n     but receives no corresponding cash. Congress enacted section \n     857(a)(1)(B) to exclude certain excess noncash income from \n     the distribution requirement.\n       A REIT has been compelled to return property to a seller \n     rather than accept a cancellation and restructuring of a \n     seller-financed mortgage, because of the REIT's inability to \n     distribute the resulting noncash income. Moreover, REITs \n     often accrue original issue discount (``OID'') income \n     resulting from their investments. In addition, REITs are \n     precluded under the current rules from repurchasing bonds at \n     a discount that were issued at rates that are now ``above \n     market.'' This inability to refinance adversely affects the \n     capital requirements for REITs.\n       Under this bill, all forms of OID and REMIC excess \n     inclusion income (to the extent not offset by distributions), \n     and cancellation of indebtedness income would be treated as \n     excess noncash income for purposes of the distribution \n     requirement in section 857(a). As a matter of policy, these \n     forms of noncash income are indistinguishable from the types \n     that are excepted from the distribution requirement. This \n     bill would extend the special rules for OID income and REMIC \n     excess inclusion income to both accrual basis and cash basis \n     REITs. The bill would not alter the existing rule that \n     imposes an excise tax on certain undistributed REIT income.\n       In addition, since the proposal would affect only a REIT's \n     distribution requirements, a REIT would not receive a \n     dividends paid deduction with respect to the phantom income. \n     Thus, a REIT might be compelled to pay a corporate level tax \n     to the extent its dividends paid deductions is less than \n     its taxable income. These changes are just a logical \n     extension of the 1986 changes.\n\n     SEC. 306. PROHIBITED TRANSACTION SAFE HARBOR.\n\n       A REIT may be subject to a 100% tax on net income from \n     sales of property in the ordinary course of business \n     (``prohibited transactions''). In 1986, Congress recognized \n     the need for a bright line safe harbor for determining \n     whether a REIT's property sale constituted a prohibited \n     transaction. Congress further liberalized these rules in 1978 \n     and 1986 to better comport with industry practice and to \n     simplify a REIT's ability to sell long-term investment \n     property without fear of being taxed at a 100% rate.\n       Because of certain limitations contained in the safe \n     harbor, some of the industry's largest and most successful \n     members cannot use the exception, thus, their ability to \n     responsibly manage their property portfolio is impeded. The \n     most restrictive limitation for these companies is the \n     limitation on the number of sales per year.\n       The limitation relating to aggregate tax bases penalizes \n     the companies that are the least likely to have engaged in \n     dealer activity. The most successful REITs have typically \n     held their properties the longest, resulting in low adjusted \n     bases due to depreciation or amortization deductions. Thus, \n     the aggregate bases of all the REIT properties will be \n     relatively much lower for purposes of the safe harbor \n     exception than a REIT that routinely turns over its \n     properties every 4 years. Accordingly, the REIT that holds \n     its properties for the longer term is penalized.\n       Under this bill, any real property asset disposed of as a \n     result of an involuntary conversion (e.g., its destruction, \n     seizure, or condemnation) would not be considered for \n     purposes of determining compliance with the 7 sales per year \n     safe harbor. This change would ensure that a diligent REIT is \n     not removed for the safe harbor as a result of events beyond \n     its control.\n       In addition, in order not to penalize companies that hold a \n     large number of depreciated properties as long-term \n     investments, this bill would change the alternative aggregate \n     bases exception to use the adjusted bases of properties \n     before reduction for any allowed or allowable depreciation or \n     amortization. This change simply carries out the intent of \n     the safe harbor.\n\n     SEC. 307. SHARED APPRECIATION MORTGAGES.\n\n       Section 856(j) generally provides that income recognized by \n     a REIT from a shorter holding period is substituted for that \n     of the contract for the purposes of applying the 30% \n     limitation in section 856(c)(4) and the prohibited \n     transaction safe harbor rule of section 857(b)(6)(C)(i). The \n     character of the underlying property as dealer property \n     (i.e., section 1221(l) property) in its holder's hands also \n     is substituted for the shared appreciation mortgage (``SAM'') \n     contract's character for purposes of imposing the prohibited \n     transaction tax.\n       Congress enacted section 856(j) in 1986, partly in response \n     to the REIT industry's request for statutory authority that a \n     REIT may receive interest based on a borrower's sales profits \n     under limited circumstances. As a practical matter, a REIT \n     cannot control the holding period, character or disposition \n     of property underlying a SAM contract that it does not own. \n     Attempts to provide contractual controls on these items give \n     little assurance to a REIT and merely dilute its competitive \n     position as a lender.\n       This bill would create a safe harbor that would not \n     penalize a REIT lender for events beyond its control, for \n     example, the borrower's bankruptcy. It also would clarify \n     that shared appreciation mortgages can be based on \n     appreciation in value as well as gain.\n\n     SEC. 308. WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES.\n\n       In 1986, Congress recognized that for purposes of limiting \n     liability, investors commonly hold separate parcels of real \n     estate in separate corporations. Congress therefore enacted \n     section 856(i), under which a REIT ``qualified subsidiary'' \n     that holds property as a separate corporation is ignored for \n     federal tax purposes. To be a qualified subsidiary, the REIT \n     must own 100% of a corporation's stock ``at all times during \n     the period such corporation was in existence.''\n       The requirement in the phrase quoted above has presented \n     some problems not envisioned in 1986. For example, several \n     real estate operating companies operating as regular C \n     corporations have elected REIT status since 1991. As is \n     typical with corporations owning real estate, these electing \n     companies had subsidiaries that owned various real estate \n     properties. The IRS was asked whether the existing \n     subsidiaries could be REIT qualifying subsidiaries because \n     before the parent's REIT election, the subsidiaries were not \n     held by a REIT. The IRS has issued several private letter \n     rulings holding that they can so qualify. However, to reach \n     this result, the IRS used the artificial construct of deeming \n     the subsidiaries as being liquidated as of the REIT election \n     and then reincorporated.\\2\\ Similar issues arise if a REIT \n     acquires all of the stock of a non-REIT corporation owning \n     real estate, either in a taxable or tax-free transaction.\n     \\1\\ ``Section'' refers to a section of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986, as amended (``Code''), unless otherwise \n     indicated.\n     \\2\\ See PLRs 9527020, 9421034, 9307018, 9205030, 9124041 and \n     9051043. See also PLR 9409035.\n       There is no sound policy reason why a non-REIT corporation \n     may not become a qualified subsidiary once a REIT owns all of \n     its stock. Under section 857(a)(3)(B), all pre-REIT E of \n     the subsidiary should be distributed to the REIT's \n     shareholders before the end of the REIT's taxable year. In \n     addition, all of the subsidiary's pre-REIT built-in gain \n     should be subject to tax under the normal rules of section \n     337(d).\n       This bill provides that any corporation could be a \n     qualified subsidiary if a REIT owns all of its shares, \n     regardless of the prior ownership of its shares. Again, this \n     approach is a logical modification of the 1986 change that \n     should remove an unnecessary barrier to REIT acquisitions.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. \n        Smith):\n  S.J.Res. 38. A joint resolution granting the consent of Congress to \nthe Vermont-New Hampshire Interstate Public Water Supply Compact; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S 14751]]\n\n\n\n     VERMONT-NEW HAMPSHIRE INTERSTATE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY COMPACT \n                              LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a \njoint resolution with Senators Jeffords, Gregg and Smith to allow the \nStates of Vermont and New Hampshire to implement an interstate public \nwater supply compact. Both States have enacted this compact through \ntheir State legislature, and the affected towns are currently awaiting \ncongressional approval so that they can move forward in their \npartnership.\n  Most members are familiar with compacts since they have become common \ntools to address local problems. Like all compacts, this one is a \nbinding agreement between States established for the purpose of \naddressing problems shared by those States. This particular compact \nallows Vermont and New Hampshire to construct and maintain joint public \ndrinking water systems.\n  According to the compact in this Senate joint resolution, Vermont and \nNew Hampshire municipalities are granted the authority to apply jointly \nfor federal financing and raise appropriate revenue for the creation of \ndrinking water facilities. The agreement also allows for joint \nmanagement and maintenance to help cut costs while still meeting \nminimum health standards for drinking water. While public water \nprojects will be carried out according to eight common guidelines \nstipulated in the joint resolution, this joint resolution does not \ncreate a new governmental authority and does not supersede any existing \nlaws or agreements of member states. Finally, the States of Vermont and \nNew Hampshire initiated and drafted this compact cooperatively and \nenactment was pursued voluntarily by each legislature.\n  This compact carries on a tradition of cooperative efforts to meet \ninterstate objectives between Vermont and New Hampshire. These two \nStates currently implement the New Hampshire-Vermont interstate sewage \nand waste disposal facilities compact. In addition, both States are \nmembers of the broader New England interstate water pollution control \ncompact and the Connecticut River Valley Flood control compact. On a \nnational level, literally dozens of compacts have been considered and \napproved by Congress to address water issues. The Vermont-New Hampshire \nPublic Water Supply compact reflects the principles of previous \ncompacts which have effectively addressed interstate concerns.\n  We are introducing this bill today in order to satisfy article 1, \nsection 10 of the U.S. Constitution. Article 1, section 10 mandates \nthat ``No state shall without the consent of Congress enter into \nagreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power.'' The \ncourts have established two reasons for Congressional consent. One is \nto prevent undue injury to the interest of noncompacting states, the \nother is to protect the Constitutional interests of the federal \ngovernment against interference from the states. I believe that this \ncompact serves the interests of the two member states well, does not \naffect other states, and protects the constitutional interests of the \nfederal government. It is in this spirit that I introduce this joint \nresolution for the consideration and approval by the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

STANDDOWN 1995\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 28\n\n       Whereas grassroots community StandDowns help homeless \n     veterans' life on the streets and have provided thousands of \n     homeless veterans with life's necessities including food, \n     clothing, medical attention, legal counseling, mental health \n     treatments and job counseling and referrals;\n       Whereas the growth of StandDowns has displayed both its \n     popularity and effectiveness as a means of addressing the \n     unique needs of homeless veterans; and\n       Whereas StandDowns have offered a familiar and comforting \n     atmosphere to as many as 25,000 homeless veterans in the \n     past: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR THE D.C. STANDDOWN '95.\n\n       The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans shall be \n     permitted to host a public event on the Upper Senate Park \n     Portion of the Capitol Grounds during the period beginning on \n     October 23, 1995, and ending on October 30, 1995.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONDITIONS.\n\n       The event to be carried out under this resolution shall be \n     arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress, under \n     conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol \n     and the Capitol Hill Police Board, except that the National \n     Coalition for Homeless Veterans shall assume full \n     responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident to \n     all activities associated with the event.\n\n     SEC. 3. STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT.\n\n       For the purposes of this resolution, the National Coalition \n     for Homeless Veterans is authorized to erect upon the Capitol \n     grounds, subject to the approval of the Architect of the \n     Capitol, such stage, sound amplification devices, and other \n     related structures and equipment as may be required for the \n     event to be carried out under this resolution.\n\n     SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.\n\n       The Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Hill Police \n     Board are authorized to make such additional arrangements as \n     may be required to carry out the event under this resolution.\n\n     SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON REPRESENTATIONS.\n\n       The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans shall not \n     represent, either directly or indirectly, that this \n     resolution or any activity carried out under this resolution \n     in any way constitutes approval or endorsement by the Federal \n     Government of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans or \n     any services offered by the National Coalition for Homeless \n     Veterans.\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I submit a resolution to \nauthorize the use of the Capitol Grounds for D.C. StandDown '95. D.C. \nStandDown '95 will involve over 500 staffers and volunteers from public \nand private sector organizations, including the National Coalition for \nHomeless Veterans, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the United \nStates Naval Medical Center, and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. D.C. StandDown '95 will provide hundreds of homeless \nveterans with food, clothing, medical attention, legal counseling, \nmental health treatment and job counseling. Because the District of \nColumbia has the highest number of homeless veterans per capita in the \nNation, authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for D.C. StandDown \n'95 is essential.\n  Veterans' standdowns have proven to be the best way to address the \nunique needs of veterans and to reach veterans who rarely take \nadvantage of the services they are entitled to. Standdowns have grown \nin popularity around the country. Over 25,000 homeless veterans have \nbeen served in previous standdowns, and I am pleased that passage of my \nresolution will aid another 350 homeless veterans who seek physical, \nmental, and employment counseling assistance.\n  My resolution will permit the National Coalition for Homeless \nVeterans to host the event on the Upper Senate Park portion of the \nCapitol Grounds between October 23, 1995, and October 30, 1995. The \ncoalition will be responsible for all expenses and liabilities related \nto the event. Any effort to erect a stage, sound system or any other \nstructure would need to be approved by the Architect of the Capitol. \nFinally, the coalition can not characterize passage of this resolution \nas constituting an endorsement by the Federal Government.\n  I am pleased that Representative Joseph Kennedy feels as strong as I \ndo about the effectiveness and necessary of veterans' standdowns, as he \nhas agreed to introduce a companion resolution in the House of \nRepresentatives. We as a Nation must continue to provide assistance to \nhomeless veterans and foster their eventual return to healthy, self-\nsufficient and productive lives. I believe that D.C. StandDown '95 will \ncontribute to this return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14752-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 29--RELATIVE TO JERUSALEM\n\n  Mr. DOLE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Res. 177\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, one \n     hundred eighty-two thousand \n\n[[Page S 14753]]\n     women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995, and forty-six \n     thousand women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas in the decade of the 1990s, it is estimated that \n     about two million women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, \n     resulting in nearly five hundred thousand deaths;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age seventy having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease than a woman at age fifty;\n       Whereas 80 percent of the women who get breast cancer have \n     no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide a safe and quick diagnosis;\n       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method \n     of early detection of breast cancer, and early detection is \n     the key to saving lives; and\n       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers \n     of up to two years or more before regular clinical breast \n     examination or breast self-examination (BSE), saving as many \n     as a third more lives: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designate October 19, 1995 as \n     ``National Mammography Day.''\n       The Senate requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     day with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ndesignating October 19, 1995 as ``National Mammography Day.''\n  Over the course of the past 2 years, I have introduced joint \nresolutions that designate October 19th as a special day to encourage \nwomen to get mammograms as part of the early detection process in the \nfight against breast cancer. Both times the joint resolution has been \nsigned into law by President Clinton.\n  This year, the House of Representatives is no longer considering \ncommemoratives. Nevertheless, I feel that the Senate should go on \nrecord to continue to educate and raise the consciousness about the \nimportance of early detection and the value of mammography.\n  Mr. President, according to the American Cancer Society, national \nfigures on breast cancer indicate that, in 1995 alone, 182,000 women \nwill be diagnosed with breast cancer. Forty-six thousand women will \nsuccumb to this disease.\n  My home State of Delaware still ranks among the worst in breast \ncancer mortality, with an estimated 570 new breast cancer cases and \nover 150 breast cancer deaths.\n  Although a cure for breast cancer may be some time away, early \ndetection and treatment are crucial to ensure survival. Studies have \nshown and experts agree, that mammography is one of the best methods to \ndetect breast cancer in its early stages. Mammograms can reveal the \npresence of small cancers up to 2 years before regular clinical breast \nexaminations or breast self-examinations [BSE], saving as many as a \nthird more lives of those diagnosed with the disease.\n  With 50 percent of the breast cancer cases occurring in women over \nage 65, no women can be considered immune from the disease; in fact, 80 \npercent of the women who get breast cancer have no family history of \nthe disease.\n  Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting today sets aside 1 day \nin the midst of ``National Breast Cancer Awareness Month''--to \nencourage women to receive or sign up for a mammogram, as well as to \nbring about greater awareness and understanding of one of the key \ncomponents in fighting this disease.\n  Once again, I am pleased to sponsor this resolution, and invite all \nof my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14752-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 178--DESIGNATING NATIONAL CHILDREN'S DAY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bond, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \nD'Amato, Mr. Dole, Mr. Gorton, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Specter, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Warner, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kerrey, \nMr. Daschle, Mr. Levin, and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution, which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 179\n\n       Concerning a joint meeting of Congress and the closing of \n     the commemorations for the Fiftieth Anniversary of World War \n     II.\n       Whereas 50 years ago, this Nation had just emerged from a \n     war that found Americans fighting a common foe with 32 allied \n     countries and in which over 17,000,000 Americans served in \n     the military;\n       Whereas the United States suffered over 670,000 casualties, \n     with more than 290,000 deaths, while over 105,000 Americans \n     were held as prisoners of war by * * *;\n       Whereas on the home front, Americans mobilized to support \n     the war by increasing the output of manufactured goods by 300 \n     percent and by causing a second agricultural revolution \n     through the efforts and imagination of our people as the \n     American farmers mobilized to support the world;\n       Whereas the war led to dramatic social changes as more than \n     19,500,000 women joined the workforce at the Nation's defense \n     plants and 350,000 joined the military;\n       Whereas the roles of minorities in both the military and \n     industry were changed forever as more opportunities for \n     employment and involvement in the defense of the United \n     States presented themselves;\n       Whereas the contributions by women, minorities, and all \n     those on the home front were legion;\n       Whereas the bringing to a close of the commemorations for \n     the Fiftieth Anniversary of World War II should be celebrated \n     across the Nation with programs and activities to thank and \n     honor the World War II generation, our veterans, their \n     families, those who lost loved ones, and all who served on \n     the home front; and\n       Whereas it is important to educate the generations that \n     followed World War II on the lessons of this horrific \n     conflict and to reaffirm the values of human decency: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n           Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate and the House of Representatives, by \n     previous agreement, shall assemble in the Hall of the House \n     of Representatives on October 11, 1995, for the purpose of \n     saying to the Nation and the world that the American people \n     will never forget those who served our Nation and saved the \n     world, our veterans, and those who served on the home front \n     as we close the commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of \n     World War II;\n       (2)(A) November 4, 1995, through November 11, 1995, is \n     designated as a ``Week of National Remembrance and the \n     Closing of the Fiftieth Anniversary of World War II'', with \n     National \n\n[[Page S 14754]]\n     Days of Prayer on November 4 and November 5, 1995, and a World War II \n     Education Day across America on November 8, 1995, and the \n     President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe that \n     period with appropriate ceremonies and activities;\n       (B) commemorations during the ``Week of National \n     Remembrance and the Closing of the Fiftieth Anniversary of \n     World War II'' shall include the dedication of the future \n     site of the Nation's World War II Memorial in Washington, \n     D.C.;\n       (3) Veterans Day, November 11, 1995, is designated as a \n     ``National Day of Observance and Celebration of the Fiftieth \n     Anniversary of World War II'', and the President is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on \n     the people of the United States to observe that day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Code of Conduct on Arms \n     Transfers Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Approximately 40,000,000 people, over 75 percent \n     civilians, died as a result of civil and international wars \n     fought with conventional weapons during the 45 years of the \n     Cold War, demonstrating that conventional weapons can in fact \n     be weapons of mass destruction.\n       (2) Conflict has actually increased in the post-Cold War \n     era, with 34 major wars in progress during 1993.\n       (3) War is both a human tragedy and an ongoing economic \n     disaster affecting the entire world, including the United \n     States and its economy, because it decimates both local \n     investment and potential export markets.\n       (4) International trade in conventional weapons increases \n     the risk and impact of war in an already over-militarized \n     world, creating far more costs than benefits for the United \n     States economy through increased United States defense and \n     foreign assistance spending and reduced demand for United \n     States civilian exports.\n       (5) The newly established United Nations Register of \n     Conventional Arms can be an effective first step in support \n     of limitations on the supply of conventional weapons to \n     developing countries, and compliance with its reporting \n     requirements by a foreign government can be an integral tool \n     in determining the worthiness of such government for the \n     receipts of United States military assistance and arms \n     transfers.\n       (6) It is in the national security and economic interests \n     of the United States to reduce dramatically the \n     $1,038,000,000,000 that all countries spend on armed forces \n     every year, $242,000,000,000 of which is spent by developing \n     countries, an amount equivalent to 4 times the total \n     bilateral and multilateral foreign assistance such countries \n     receive every year.\n       (7) According to the Congressional Research Service of the \n     Library of Congress, the United States supplies more \n     conventional weapons to developing countries than all other \n     countries combined, averaging $14,956,000,000 each year in \n     agreements to supply such weapons to developing countries \n     since the end of the Cold War, compared to $7,300,000,000 \n     each year in such agreements prior to the dissolution of the \n     Soviet Union.\n       (8) In recent years the vast majority of United States arms \n     transfers to developing countries are to countries with an \n     undemocratic form of government whose citizens, according to \n     the Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights \n     Practices do \n\n[[Page S 14755]]\n     not have the ability to peaceably change their form of government.\n       (9) Although a goal of United States foreign policy should \n     be to work with foreign governments and international \n     organizations to reduce militarization and dictatorship and \n     therefore prevent conflicts before they arise, during 4 \n     recent deployments of United States Armed Forces--to the \n     Republic of Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, and Haiti--the \n     Armed Forces faced conventional weapons that had been \n     provided or financed by the United States to undemocratic \n     governments.\n       (10) The proliferation of conventional arms and conflicts \n     around the globe is a multilateral problem, and the fact that \n     the United States has emerged as the world's primary seller \n     of conventional weapons, together with the world leadership \n     role of the United States, signifies that the United States \n     is in a position to seek multilateral restraints on the \n     competition for and transfers of conventional weapons.\n       (11) The Congress has the constitutional responsibility to \n     participate with the executive branch of Government in \n     decisions to provide military assistance and arms transfers \n     to a foreign government, and in the formulation of a policy \n     designed to reduce dramatically the level of international \n     militarization.\n       (12) A decision to provide military assistance and arms \n     transfers to a government that is undemocratic, does not \n     adequately protect human rights, is currently engaged in acts \n     of armed aggression, or is not fully participating in the \n     United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, should require \n     a higher level of scrutiny than does a decision to provide \n     such assistance and arms transfers to a government to which \n     these conditions do not apply.\n\n     SEC. 803. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide clear policy \n     guidelines and congressional responsibility for determining \n     the eligibility of foreign governments to be considered for \n     United States military assistance and arms transfers.\n\n     SEC. 804.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives and \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate should hold \n     hearings on controversial certifications submitted under \n     section 804(a) and all requests for exemptions submitted \n     under section 804(c).\n\n     SEC. 806.

Mr. President, when the House adjourns toady for \nthe Columbus Day recess, it will also mark the end of the congressional \ncareer of Representative Norman Mineta of San Jose, CA. Norm Mineta and \nI came to Congress together in January 1975 and over the past two \ndecades he has been a remarkable public servant.\n  There was Cynicism about Washington when we arrived in the Watergate \nclass of 1974 and, sadly, there is loss of faith in our political \nsystem today. But there has never been a question about the \ncontributions Norm Mineta has made to make this country a better place.\n  While ably representing the people of his district, Norm Mineta has \nalso developed a natural, national constituency among Asian-Pacific-\nAmericans. \n\n[[Page S 14767]]\nMany people do not realize that the State of Illinois has the fifth \nlargest Asian-American population of any State. Over the years, Norm \nMineta and I have worked closely on many issues, particularly those \naffecting our Asian-Pacific-Americans constituents.\n  In the 1970s', we worked together on the inclusion of Asian-Americans \nin the decennial census. In the 1980's, we worked to ensure that Asian \nAmericans were included in the Higher Education Act. In this decade, we \nhave worked on passing hate crimes legislation and saving the \nimmigration preference for brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, which \nsadly is being threatened again today. In 1992, he was particularly \nhelpful to me and my staff on extending the important bilingual \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act.\n  Perhaps most of all, Norm Mineta will be remembered for his work to \ndo what should have been done long previously by Congress--enactment of \nthe Civil Liberties Act of 1988 providing redress for Japanese-\nAmericans interned during World War II. I was a teenager living on the \nwest cost when that episode occurred in our Nation's history. My family \nwas not uprooted like Norm Mineta's and those of 120,000 Japanese-\nAmericans. But my father, who was a Lutheran minister, spoke out \npublicly against what was happening to Japanese-Americans. He was \ncriticized for that, but, as I look back, it was one of the things I am \nmost proud of him--standing up for what was right in the face of what \nwas the popular mood.\n  Norm Mineta has always stood for what is best in public service and I \nwish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14766-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14767-S14768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AWARDING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM TO GAYLORD NELSON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto extend congratulations to Gaylord Nelson, a former Member of this \nbody and a distinguished former Governor of the State of Wisconsin, who \nis receiving America's highest civilian honor today--the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom. Gaylord Nelson receives this award in recognition of \nhis lifelong commitment to leadership on issues of environmental \nprotection, and his tremendous efforts to ensure that both our \ncountry's public policy and its citizens sustain and preserve America's \ninvaluable natural resources.\n  Nelson's career is truly a remarkable one, and I am proud to now hold \nthe Senate seat he held with distinction from 1963 to 1981. Gaylord \nNelson began his political career in 1948, when he became the first \nDemocratic State senator elected from Dane County in this century. He \nserved three terms in the Wisconsin State senate from 1948 to 1956, \nacting as the Democratic floor leader for 8 of those years. He was a \ntwo-term Governor of my State, elected in 1958, and like the noteworthy \naccomplishment of his election to State senate, Nelson was Wisconsin's \nsecond Democratic governor in this century and, upon reelection in \n1960, he became the only Democrat in Wisconsin to win two terms at \nGovernor since 1892. During his gubernatorial tenure, the environment \nbecame a priority for the State with the creation of a $50 million \noutdoor resources acquisition program, putting Wisconsin far ahead in \nrecreational opportunities for the general public.\n  As those who served with him in this body remember well, Nelson is \nbest described like the main character in Dr. Seuss' children's story \nThe Lorax--the man ``who speaks for the trees.'' During his 18 years of \nservice in the Senate, Gaylord Nelson affected significant change for \nthe ``greener'' in both our Nation's law and the institution of the \nSenate itself. He is the co-author of the Environmental Education Act, \nwhich he sponsored with the senior Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and sponsored an \namendment to give the St. Croix and the Namekagon Rivers scenic \nprotection. In the wake of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, Gaylord \nNelson, along with Senator Philip Hart of Michigan, ushered in national \nattention to the documented persistent bioaccumulative effects of \norganochlorine pesticides used in the Great Lakes by authoring the ban \non DDT in 1972. He was the primary sponsor of the Apostle Islands \nNational Lakeshore Act, one of Northern Wisconsin's most beautiful \nareas at which I spend a portion of my vacation time with my family \nevery year, and an area which just celebrated its 25th anniversary last \nmonth with an event at which Nelson and I both spoke.\n  Nelson, of course, is best remembered as being the founder of Earth \nDay. As one of the first Senators to oppose the U.S. military buildup \nin Vietnam, Gaylord Nelson took his inspiration for Earth Day from the \nanti-war teach-ins on college campuses. He described in a floor \nstatement on the development of the event:\n\n       It suddenly occurred to me, why not have a nationwide \n     teach-in on the environment.\n\n  Gaylord Nelson announced the idea at a speech in Seattle in 1969, and \nthe idea has been a sustained vision for 25 years.\n  Earth Day is an event which in addition to changing the environmental \nconsciousness of the country, as colleagues who were present will \nremember, literally stopped the Senate. Members of both bodies voted to \nadjourn their respective houses in the middle of the legislative week \nto attend Earth Day events, an adjournment that would be extremely rare \ntoday. Here in this body, the Congressional Record indicates, at 3:31 \np.m. on Tuesday, April 20, 1970, our colleague the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia [Mr. Byrd] adjourned the Senate until Friday, April 23, \n1970. In the other body, chamber action was adjourned from the middle \nof the day on April 21, 1970, the actual date of the first Earth Day, \nthrough April 23 of that year.\n  Gaylord Nelson's environmental activism also changed the way we in \nCongress run our personal offices. Last year, in an E Magazine \ninterview which Nelson gave for the 25th Anniversary of Earth Day, he \ndescribed that back in 1970 he believed he was the only person in the \nSenate to have a full time environmental staffer. In 1995, it is \ndifficult to imagine that there is any Member of this body or the other \nthat does not have a member of their staff designated to handle \nenvironmental issues.\n  After his defeat in the race for a fourth Senate term in 1980, Nelson \njoined the national conservation group, the Wilderness Society. In \n1990, Nelson founded another group in Washington called Green Seal, \nwhich he created to certify the environmental claims of consumer \nproducts by developing innovative environmentally based product \nstandards and comparing classes of marketed products to those \nstandards.\n  Mr. President, leadership is not only the willingness to assume the \nrole of being a primary spokesperson on important issues, but what one \nactually says and does about those issues. With a combination of words \nand activism, Gaylord Nelson actively used his position to make changes \nfor the better. In a 1994 Chicago Tribune article, Thomas Huffman, a \nprofessor of history at St. John's University in Collegeville, MN, \nobserved about Gaylord Nelson:\n\n       Almost every campaign speech he [Nelson] gave from 1960 on \n     had an environmental component. Often times that was the \n     whole speech. There were many in his party who thought he was \n     crazy, that it was not really an issue.\n\n  Despite the fact that some were skeptical about Nelson's message at \nfirst, the directness and forcefulness of his statements are \nundeniable. In his 1969 book on the environment, entitled America's \nLast Chance, written after 6 years of service in the Senate, Nelson \nissues a political challenge:\n\n       Through the past decade of work in this field, I have come \n     to the conclusion that the number one domestic problem facing \n     this country is the threatened destruction of our natural \n     resources and the disaster which would confront mankind \n     should such destruction occur. There is a real question as to \n     whether the nation, which has spent some two hundred years \n     developing an intricate system of local, State and Federal \n     Government to deal with the public's problems, will be bold, \n     imaginative and flexible enough to meet this supreme test.\n\n  Nelson's message was one of urgency and of bipartisanship. His time \nin the Senate saw this body establish, under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, an Environment and Public Works Committee, \npass the majority of our Federal environmental statutes with \nsignificant bipartisan support, and create the Environmental Protection \nAgency. In his speech at the University of Wisconsin on the first Earth \nDay, Nelson said:\n\n\n[[Page S 14768]]\n\n       Our goal is an environment of decency, quality, and mutual \n     respect for human creatures and all other living creatures. \n     An environment without ugliness, without ghettos, without \n     discrimination, without hunger, without poverty, and without \n     war.\n\n  In recognizing Gaylord Nelson's accomplishments, I hope that all in \nthis body will be mindful of the need to be committed to the protection \nof the environment and to work in a bipartisan fashion toward that end. \nI believe that to have this body embrace and resonate his enthusiasm on \nthese issues would be a fitting tribute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14767-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HISTORIC RECONCILIATION BETWEEN ROMANIA AND HUNGARY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this week President Clinton \nwelcomed President Ion Iliescu of Romania at the White House. On this \noccasion, I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues \nPresident Iliescu's initiative to bring about an historic \nreconciliation between Romania and Hungary.\n  I know from my visit to Romania, where I was an official observer of \nthe 1992 elections, the Romanian and Hungarian peoples both have rich \ncultural traditions. As in many parts of Europe and elsewhere, ethnic \nand cultural traditions in these nations are not bound by national \nborders. Certain politicians in these nations have sought to repress \nethnic and cultural minorities and increase long-standing tensions. \nEthnic Hungarians in Romanian Transylvania in particular have been \ndenied full human and civil rights. The tragic conflicts in the former \nYugoslavia are a constant reminder of the risks of extreme nationalism \nand ethnic and cultural divisions.\n  Mr. President, on August 30, President Iliescu called for an historic \nreconciliation between Hungary and Romania. In a statesmanlike speech, \nPresident Iliescu committed himself and his country to seeking a \npeaceful solution to the problems which have long damaged normal \nrelations between Romania and Hungary. He cited as his model the \nFranco-German reconciliation that occurred when Charles de Gaulle and \nKonrad Adenauer committed their governments and their nations to \nforgive the past and jointly move forward to help create a more \nprosperous and more peaceful Europe. It is an important model to \nemulate.\n  President Iliescu's overture is welcome news for Romanians and \nHungarians, Europeans and Americans.\n  For the ethnic Hungarians of Transylvania and other minority groups \nin Romania and Hungary, there is new hope that human rights and freedom \nof expression will be respected.\n  For all the people of Hungary and Romania, there is new hope for \nfreedom and democracy, peaceful cooperation, economic growth and \nintegration with the West and its economic and political institutions.\n  For the people of America and Europe, there is new hope for \nstrengthened economic and political ties which will integrate Hungary \nand Romania into economic and political institutions on the basis of \nshared values.\n  Romania and Hungary must now take real steps to ensure that these \nhopes are realized. Both governments must work to reach and implement \nbroad and concrete agreements which will guarantee respect for human \nrights, confirm national borders, and expand opportunities for free and \nfair trade. Fortunately, this process is underway.\n  The United States should support reconciliation between Hungary and \nRomania, and their integration into Western institutions. This \nreconciliation would mean a more stable world with more economic \nopportunities for Americans.\n  Mr. President, I hope that President Iliescu's visit to Washington \nhas strengthened the friendship between our two countries on the basis \nof a shared interest in freedom and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14768-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO MR.

He entered \nthe U.S. Navy in February of 1963. On January 16, 1965 he married \nJudith I.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy friend and associate, Gordon Lau. Over the years, I have worked \nclosely with Gordon as San Francisco supervisors and as partners in \nestablishing the first Sino-America Sister City relationship between \nSan Francisco and Shanghai. I am proud of what we have managed to \naccomplish together.\n  Gordon is a longstanding pillar of the Chinese community in San \nFrancisco and a key leader for crucial non-profits such as the Self-\nHelp for the Elderly and the Chinese Culture Foundation.\n  Since Gordon graduated from the University of San Francisco Law \nSchool he has worked as an attorney and spent a great deal of his time \nin public service. Gordon was appointed to the San Francisco Board of \nSupervisors by former Mayor George Moscone in 1977. He later kept his \nseat in district elections becoming San Francisco's first Asian-\nAmerican supervisor.\n  Gordon also served the city of San Francisco as a past board member \nfor the Legal Aid Society, as founding member of San Francisco Lawyers \nCommittee for Urban Affairs and Civil Rights, and as a former San \nFrancisco Port Commissioner and the San Francisco Planning Commission.\n  I have worked closely with Gordon and the San Francisco-Shanghai \nSister City Committee. Since the creation of this sister city committee \nin 1979, Gordon has played a crucial role in its development and \nserved, virtually uninterrupted, as its chairman. This partnership is \nvery dear to me and nobody has worked harder to make it the success \nthat it is than Gordon.\n  Since 1979, there have been 150 exchanges between San Francisco and \nShanghai making it not only the first, but most active, sister city \nrelationship between China and the United States. Sister Cities \nInternational ranks the San Francisco-Shanghai relationship as the most \nactive of any cities involved in sister city partnerships.\n  People-to-people relationships are critically important in overall \nforeign relations. During many complicated times between the United \nStates and China this sister city relationship has provided a strong \nlink between the people of San Francisco and Shanghai.\n  Since its inception, the San Francisco-Shanghai Sister City Committee \nhas produced 150 projects in art, culture, law, economics, medicine, \neducation, development, trade, investments, and public works. One of \nthe highlights has been business management training program in which \nSan Francisco businesses participate in the training of China's new \nbusiness leaders. This training of midlevel managers has been pointed \nto repeatedly as one of the most effective in supporting the economic \nchanges underway in China.\n  The success of this sister city relationship culminated with the \ncelebration of Shanghai Week in San Francisco this past July, \ncelebrating a 15-year relationship between San Francisco and Shanghai. \n\n[[Page S 14769]]\n\n  Gordon Lau is truly a model of dedication to a community and to a \ncause. I join with his wonderful wife Mary, a public school teacher in \nSan Francisco, their remarkable daughters, Stephanie, Diane and \nCarolyn, as well as the people of San Francisco and Shanghai in \nthanking Gordon for his devotion and hard work.\n  There are people in life who quietly go about the business of getting \nthings done. Gordon sets a perfect example of what can be accomplished \nwhen you believe in what you do and work hard to achieve success. He \nhas worked, year after year, with little fanfare to achieve one of the \nworld's most productive sister city relationships in the world. It is \ntime that we say thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14768-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AWARD OF PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM TO WALTER REUTHER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. president, today the President is awarding, \nposthumously, the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Walter Reuther. I \nwish to add my voice to the chorus honoring this fine man, who \ndedicated his life to helping the working men and women of America. \nWalter Reuther, son of immigrants, tool and die worker, labor organizer \nand President of the UAW lived for the union movement.\n  My own father was a UAW member, so I know full well the many benefits \nworking families gained from Walter Reuther's leadership. Higher wages, \nbetter benefits and safer working conditions all resulted from Mr. \nReuther's tireless work on behalf of workers. My father achieved the \nrespect he deserved and our family and our neighbors achieved a decent \nlife in part because of Walter Reuther's efforts.\n  At one point Mr. Reuther was shot in the back for his positions and \nactions. Despite the dangers, and the pain, he carried on. He refused \nto be cowed by bullies or by anybody else. He would fight for the \nworkers in whom he believed, no matter what the cost. His determination \nmade him, more than any other man, the one responsible for unionization \nof the auto industry.\n  Committed to helping workers, he nonetheless avoided political \nextremism, purging his own union of its extremist elements and making \nit safe for good, honest Americans.\n  Walter Reuther died in 1970. He and his wife were victims of a plane \naccident. But his union survives, as does his vision of a society in \nwhich working men and women are given their proper respect.\n  On behalf of the people of Michigan allow me to express our gratitude \nto the President for bestowing this honor on one of our own, and to \nWalter Reuther for his inspiring contribution to our way of life; a \ncontribution that makes him most worthy of this Presidential Medal of \nFreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14769-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LOREN TORKELSON\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, while we all have different people \nwe admire and want to emulate, there are a few individuals that \neveryone can agree is a true hero and model citizen. Loren Torkelson \nwas one such individual. Loren, a Billings, MT, native, passed away on \nSeptember 17 in Lexington, KY. He was 54.\n  In 1966, after graduating from the University of North Dakota, he \njoined the Air Force and became a pilot. During his second combat tour, \nhe was shot down and taken prisoner. He spent 6 years in the infamous \n``Hanoi Hilton'' suffering constant abuse until his release in 1973. He \nwas a highly decorated officer, receiving two Silver Stars, three \nflying crosses, 16 Air Medals, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star for \nValor, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air Force Commendation \nMedal.\n  Yet for all the hardship he experienced, he acted like a hero in his \nprivate life as well. After the war, he earned a law degree from the \nUniversity of North Dakota. After serving as a judge advocate, he \njoined and later became a partner in the law firm of Richter and \nAssociates. He spent his legal career as a trial lawyer fighting for \nindividual rights.\n  His foremost passion was his family. It always came first. He lived a \nprivate life, never seeking gratification for his numerous \naccomplishments. There are few individuals who can lead such an \nexemplary professional and personal life.\n  The way in which he lived his life will always be a model for others. \nHe will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14769-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14769-S14770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FRANKENMUTH, MICHIGAN'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud to rise to honor the \n150th anniversary of the town of Frankenmuth, MI, which we have been \ncelebrating throughout the year. October 6, 1995, which is officially \ndesignated as German-American Day, is an especially appropriate time to \ncommemorate this historic milestone in Frankenmuth.\n  Frankenmuth is a unique community and one of Michigan's largest \ntourist attractions. It is a quaint Bavarian village which maintains a \nfestival atmosphere year-round. Everything from its authentic \narchitecture to the popular Frankenmuth Bavarian and Oktoberfest \ncelebrations make this community a special place to live in and to \nvisit. Frankenmuth has provided an experience to countless visitors \nover the years which is rich with history and ethnic culture.\n  In 1840, the German missionary, Frederick Wyneken, initiated the idea \nof the founding of Frankenmuth when he wrote an appeal to all the \nLutherans in Germany. He asked for their help in teaching Christianity \nto the Chippewa Indians. Wyneken's call for assistance appealed to \nWilhelm Loehe, who was an influential pastor in a country church in \nNeuendettelsau, Mittelfranken, Kingdom of Bavaria. Loehe championed the \nidea of sending a mission to the Saginaw Valley to give spiritual \ncomfort to the German pioneers in the area as well as teaching \nChristianity to the native Americans. Loehe approved a location along \nthe Cass River in Michigan as the site of the mission and named it \n``Frankenmuth.''\n  Loehe selected Pastor August Cramer, who at the time was teaching \nGerman at Oxford, England, to lead the mission. Thirteen people from \nBavaria volunteered to be a part of the mission. Frankenmuth's first \nsettlers were mostly farmers. Months before they were to depart for \nAmerica, the colonists gathered to decide on the congregation's \nconstitution. In it, they proposed to remain loyal to their German-\nLutheran background and language.\n  The mission set sail on April 20, 1845, aboard the SS Caroline. The \njourney across the Atlantic was a treacherous one. The ship encountered \nviolent storms, strong winds, and dense fog which altered its route \nconsiderably. By the end of the journey, with their food becoming \nstale, almost all of the settlers had contracted smallpox. The group \nreached New York Harbor on June 8, after 50 days at sea. The trip from \nNew York to the Saginaw River would have the settlers travel on four \nmore ships and a train.\n  When the settlers finally reached the Saginaw Valley, they selected a \nhilly area as the site of their future settlement because it reminded \nthem of their homeland. On August 18, 1845, nearly 4 months after \nleaving Mittelfranken, the mission had arrived at its new home. The \nmission purchased 680 acres of Indian reservation land from the \nGovernment for a total of $1,700.\n  The group quickly began building a combination church-school-\nparsonage in the form of a large log cabin. The church was named St. \nLorenz after their mother church in Germany. The settlers then decided \nto divide the land into 120-acre farms and cleared the land in order to \nfarm and build their houses.\n  In 1846 a second group of about 90 emigrants from Germany arrived at \nFrankenmuth. The new group bought land and built their own homes as \nwell as St. Lorenz Church which was completed on December 26, 1846.\n  Immigration continued throughout the 1800's, as immigrants arrived to \nreunite with their relatives. As the town grew, so did its commerce. \nThe new immigrants included woodcarvers, sausage makers, wool \nprocessors, millers, and brewers. The community continued its Bavarian \nheritage as it grew.\n  After World War II and the development of the interstate highway \nsystem, Frankenmuth became a national favorite for tourists. Its unique \ncharacter as a traditional Bavaria town in the heart \n\n[[Page S 14770]]\nof the American Midwest drew Americans of all backgrounds.\n  Today, Frankenmuth continues to cherish its rich Bavarian heritage. \nIt is a great testament to all of the people of Frankenmuth and their \nancestors that they have been able to maintain their town and continue \nacross all of these years to honor the principles on which it was \nfounded. All of us in Michigan and the region have benefitted from the \ncontribution which Frankenmuth and its citizens have made to the \ndiversity of the American fabric.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that I will be in the town of \nFrankenmuth on German-American Day. If there is one place in the United \nStates which could be said to represent what it means to be a German-\nAmerican, it is Frankenmuth, MI. In fact, Frankenmuth serves to remind \nus all of our cultural roots and of the rich mosaic of cultural \nheritage which we have in America.\n  I am certain that all of my colleagues in the Senate join me in \ncongratulating the Frankenmuth Historical Museum, the Frankenmuth \nChamber of Commerce and all of those whose efforts over the years have \ncontributed to this German-American success story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14769-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the greatest problems facing \nthe world is the staggering rate of population growth. Over 90 percent \nof all new births take place in developing countries, including many in \ncountries that cannot even feed their people. The Earth's population is \nprojected to double and possibly triple in the next century, with \nstaggering implications for the world's food supply, environment, and \nthe political and economic stability of every country.\n  It is critically important that we recognize that what we do today \nwill determine the kind of world inhabited by our children and \ngrandchildren. World Population Awareness Week will be held from \nOctober 22 to October 29. It will focus on implementing the program of \naction of the International Conference on Population and Development \nand educating the public about the dangers of unchecked population \ngrowth.\n  At a time when our foreign aid budget is being slashed, I was \nencouraged by the Senate's recent passage of my amendment to provide up \nto $35 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The UNFPA \nis the largest voluntary family planning agency in the world. With \nprograms in 140 countries, it provides family planning information and \nservices to hundreds of millions of people who would otherwise have no \naccess to family planning. By restoring funding for the UNFPA, the \nSenate has wisely chosen to support international efforts to reduce \nrates of population growth.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a proclamation by Gov. Howard Dean of \nVermont proclaiming October 22-29 World Population Week, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The proclamation follows:\n       Whereas the world's population of 5.7 billion is increasing \n     by nearly 100 million per year, with virtually all of this \n     growth added to the poorest countries and regions; and\n       Whereas three billion people--the equivalent of the entire \n     world population as recently as 1960--will be reaching their \n     reproductive years within the next generation; and\n       Whereas the environmental and economic impacts of this \n     growth will almost certainly prevent inhabitants of poorer \n     countries from improving their quality of life, and, at the \n     same time, have deleterious repercussions for the standard of \n     living in more affluent regions; and\n       Whereas the 1994 International Conference on Population and \n     Development in Cairo, Egypt resulted in 180 nations approving \n     a 20-year Program of Action for achieving a more equitable \n     balance between the world's population, environment and \n     resources; and\n       Whereas World Population Awareness activities this year \n     will focus on implementing the Cairo Conference Program of \n     Action.\n       Now, therefore, I, Howard Dean, Governor, do hereby \n     proclaim the week of October 22-29, 1995 as World Population \n     Awareness Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14770-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF MS.

Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \nthe Fulbright Program. This worthwhile program was established in 1946 \nby a great Arkansan, the late Senator J. William Fulbright. I was a \ngreat admirer of Senator Fulbright throughout his public and private \nlife. He made significant contributions to my State, to our Nation, and \nto the world. The educational exchange program that bears his name is \njust one of many outstanding contributions to education and to world \npeace that Senator Fulbright made during his 30 years in the Senate.\n  The Fulbright Program promotes understanding between the United \nStates and other countries. It is the largest, best-known and most \nprestigious educational exchange program in the world.\n  Mr. President, this program is a valuable addition to our foreign \npolicy. It would be contrary to our national interests to make \nsignificant cuts to this program at this time. It is as relevant today \nas when it was founded. Over 200,000 students have participated in the \nprogram in some 100 countries over the years. It offers Americans \ninvaluable preparation to succeed in a global economy. This program \nalso provides those from other countries direct exposure to American \nsociety and to our political and economic systems. Many Fulbright \nscholars go on to key positions in Government, business, and education.\n  The Fulbright program is a cost-effective means of advancing American \ninterests around the world. It involves partnerships between our Nation \nand other countries. Many of these countries make substantial financial \ncontributions to the Fulbright Program. In addition, a portion of the \nprogram costs come from private sources.\n  Mr. President, the Fulbright Program has enjoyed bipartisan support \nfrom Presidents and Congress throughout its history This program helps \nmaintain American leadership throughout the world. It merits our \ncontinued support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14770-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14770-S14771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         U.S.S. ``CHANDELEUR''\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, fifty years ago, the ship's \ncompany of the Navy seaplane tender U.S.S. Chandeleur, AV-10, together \nwith the aviators of the ship's squadrons, proudly participated in the \nacceptance of the surrender of the Japanese military forces in Honshu, \nthe central island of Japan, at ceremonies in the harbor of Ominato, \nthe final end of the global warfare of World War II.\n  They had earned this honor by 3 full years of combat and hard work in \nservice to the U.S. fleet, materially contributing to the victory in \nthe Pacific.\n  The U.S.S. Chandeleur was built in South San Francisco and \ncommissioned in San Francisco on November 19, 1942. It sailed \nimmediately for combat operations in the Pacific, not to return to the \nGolden Gate until November 1945.\n  During that period, she served as an advanced mobile operating base \nfor several squadrons of seaplanes engaged in bombing, reconnaissance, \npatrol, search and rescue, and other vital services, extending the \n``eyes'' of the fleet commander far beyond the horizons. The aircraft \nwould not have been able to sustain continual operations without her \nsupport. The U.S.S. Chandeleur was truly a part of the victory in the \nPacific. \n\n[[Page S 14771]]\n\n  For her valiant services, U.S.S. Chandeleur was awarded six bronze \nengagement stars for operations at Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Saipan, \nPalau, Okinawa, as well as air operations off the coasts of China, \nKorea, and Japan, and participation in the early occupation of Japan.\n  During these operations, the ship and crew survived a number of \nwithering attacks by Japanese vessels and aircraft, including a near \nmiss by a Kamikaze bomber off Okinawa, sustaining multiple battle \ncasualties and deaths of her crew members and air crews.\n  Soon after her return from the Pacific, U.S.S. Chandeleur was \n``mothballed'' at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and later scrapped, but \nthe ship's company and aviators have remained close.\n  They have gathered periodically in reunions widely separated across \nthe United States, from Boston to San Diego. For their 27th reunion on \nthe 50th anniversary of the victory they so valiantly helped to bring \nabout, they have gathered in the ship's ``native'' city, San Francisco, \nwhere they will be together at the Marine Memorial Club from September \n27 through October 1, 1995.\n  It is fitting that on the 50-year anniversary of this historic \nmission that the ship's companies and aviators gather once again in the \nship's home city of San Francisco. And, on behalf of the United States \nSenate, I would like to extend my most sincere welcome to those \ngathering to remember the valiant mission of the U.S.S. \nChandeleur. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14770-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VILLAGE OF EMPIRE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n100th anniversary of the village of Empire. The community of Empire has \nplanned many events for this significant milestone.\n  The Village of Empire is known today as the home of the Sleeping Bear \nDunes National Lakeshore Park Headquarters. The residents of Empire are \nrenowned for their friendliness in welcoming over a million visitors to \nthe lakeshore each year. With its beautiful beaches, hiking trails, \nabundant natural resources, and rich history, Empire is a recreational \nhaven known the world over.\n  Empire was settled in the mid 1850's. It quickly established itself \nas a lumbering center, the largest and best equipped hardwood mill in \nthe State. Many Norwegians, recruited to operate the mill, settled \nhere. With the manpower, modern equipment, and plentiful supply of \nwood, this mill produced up to ten million feet of lumber each year, \nand was a model of efficiency across the State.\n  The village of Empire formally incorporated on October 16, 1895. It \nwas probably named after the Empire State, a steamer-sidewheeler that \nran aground nearby in 1849, and the Empire, a schooner that also ran \naground in the area in 1865.\n  The lumber mill burned in 1917, and the residents of Empire quickly \nadapted to produce agricultural products. Lands which had been cleared \nby the lumbering industry were replanted with fruit trees or became \ngrazing for livestock. Empire drew many seasonal workers anxious to \nwork the harvest, and fruit companies and slaughterhouses sent \nrepresentatives to view and buy the goods Empire produced.\n  In 1949, the Empire Air Force Station was established. The 752d \nAircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned 300 personnel, \nalmost doubling Empire's population. This station remained a part of \nEmpire until the 1980's. The former station is now controlled by the \nFAA and provides essential radar services to the area.\n  Empire's long and rich history was recognized through the \nauthorization of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in 1970. \nThe National Park Service has improved the recreational resources in \nthe area, while preserving cultural resources. The partnership between \nthe residents of Empire and the national lakeshore will continue to \ndraw many visitors in the years to come. Michigan is fortunate to boast \nof the contributions of the village of Empire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14771-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14771-S14772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to address one of \nthe most important legislative changes the Congress will be addressing \nthis year--changes in the way we finance and the way senior citizens \nand persons with disabilities receive Medicare coverage. I \nwholeheartedly support reducing the Federal deficit, as well as, moving \nthe Government out of the role of running a health plan, for the \nelderly and disabled, and into the role of contracting with private \nhealth plans. I commend Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee for its \ncommitment to these very important goals.\n  Having studied the health care system in the United States for many \nyears I have come to the conclusion that the reason the Government's \nhealth care spending is out of control is really twofold. First, is the \nway we have chosen to pay for and purchase services. When Medicare was \ndesigned in the 1960's it was modeled after private Blue Cross fee-for-\nservice plans. The Government paid providers directly for each \nprocedure.\n  Paying for services rendered at a distance without any effective \nutilization control has been a disaster. Our failed attempts to control \ncosts, by continuing to cut payments to providers and increasing costs \nto beneficiaries, is a major reason why our Federal deficit is so \nexorbitant.\n  I hope that in our efforts to reduce the deficit, we have not set \nourselves up to cut too deeply into the Medicare payment system. Many \ntechnical changes have been suggested by the Finance Committee to the \nreimbursement policies for hospitals and providers. Some of these \nchanges have allocated additional funding to rural areas. I look \nforward to discussing the total cost impact on Vermont with both the \nhospital association as well as other provider groups in Vermont, as \nwell as with my colleagues on the Finance Committee.\n  Second, by segregating the elderly and disabled, into separate risk \npools, the Government has become responsible for providing health \ninsurance for the riskiest members of society. This segmentation has \nnot provided any incentives for the private sector to find innovative \nways to manage the highest cost cases in the delivery system. \nUnfortunately, it was the private market's failure to provide \naffordable coverage on reasonable terms, to the elderly and disabled, \nthat led to the political demand for the Government to create Medicare \nand Medicaid in the first place.\n  Providing Medicare beneficiaries a choice of private health plans is \na wonderful idea and one that I have been advocating. Hopefully, the \nimpact will not be the same as the greatest criticism against the \nFederal employee plan. One experience with this program has found \nadverse selection among plans--that is the people that need the most \ncare seem to migrate to the high option Blue Cross fee-for-service \nplan--creating an upward cost spiral for members of this plan.\n  Now I'd like to turn to the two charts I have here. The first chart \nwas duplicated from hearings on the Eisenhower administration's health \nreinsurance legislation back in 1954. This was before we had Medicare \nand Medicaid. As you can see, 41 percent of the population had no \ninsurance protection at all and 36 percent of the population had what I \nwould call limited coverage. More startling only 3 percent of the \npopulation has what most Americans take for granted today--\ncomprehensive coverage.\n  Compare this chart with my second chart which does not emphasize the \ntype of coverage but the source of coverage. Over 55 percent of \nAmericans in 1993 had coverage provided through their employer. As you \ncan see, 15 percent of the population is uninsured--compared to 41 \npercent in 1953. Medicare is the primary insurance for 12 percent of \nthe population and 9 percent of the population receives coverage \nthrough Medicaid.\n  As we tackle one of the biggest problems for the Federal Government, \nour deficit, we must keep in mind a goal we all agreed to last year--\nthe goal of moving towards universal coverage for all Americans. We \nmust keep in mind that any changes we make to the public programs of \nMedicare and Medicaid must not add to the rolls of the uninsured, \nespecially if it is due to unintended consequences of our changes to \n\n[[Page S 14772]]\nthese programs. More uninsured Americans will only increase total costs \nto the health care system.\n  We must keep in mind that Medicare and Medicaid were created because \nproper incentives were never placed in the private market to enable it \nto accept the risks associated with insuring the elderly and disabled. \nAs we encourage the Medicare population to move into private health \nplans we must be sure to do what President Eisenhower tried to do over \n40 years ago--we must be sure to place the proper incentives in the \nprivate market that will encourage it to compete for the chronically \nill high cost population on quality and price.\n  As we move to a system in which we offer Medicare beneficiaries \nthroughout the country greater choice and coordinated care, we must not \nforget to address the following concerns. First, what types of choices \nwill be available for rural and underserved areas which have little or \nno penetration of the private managed care marketplace? Second, how can \nwe provide coordinated care for beneficiaries who decide to stay in the \ncurrent fee-for-service Medicare program? Third, how can we address the \nbifurcated finances and benefits offered to the aged and disabled \npopulation through the Medicare and Medicaid programs?\n\n  Many rural and underserved areas of this country, like Vermont, which \ndo not have an over abundance of hospitals and other health providers, \nhave not seen the benefits experienced by a mature managed care \nmarketplace such as Minnesota or Washington. I was very pleased to see \nthat the Finance Committee has recommended that the AAPCC be modified \nto increase the per month payment per Medicare beneficiary in rural \narea. Hopefully, more managed care plans will decide to start up \nbusiness in rural parts of this country. But this change will take some \ntime.\n  Market alternative's to managed care health plans have been springing \nup all over rural America. For example, although Vermont does not have \na multitude of managed care health plans operating, providers have been \ndeveloping networks that offer a continuum of care to Vermonters. \nNetworks that provide acute, home health and residential care. They \nprovide direct medical care, as well as, the personal services needed \nfor individuals to manage their own care needs. This coordination of \ncare is very similar to what Blue Cross of western Pennsylvania is \nproviding its fee-for-service clients through case management. Like \nBlue Cross, many private sector fee-for-service health plans have begun \nto provide case management on a voluntary basis to individuals with \nhigh-cost conditions, generally chronic or catastrophic care cases. \nThese programs offer greater flexibility in the array of services \nneeded, on a case by case basis, and have proven very cost effective.\n  HCFA has demonstrated that a small proportion of Medicare \nbeneficiaries account for a high proportion of payments. In 1992, about \n9.8 percent--3.5 million--of all Medicare enrollees accounted for 68.4 \npercent--$82.6 billion--of all Medicare payments. The experience for \nthe last 20 years of the program has shown that 80 percent of the \nbeneficiaries account for only 20 percent of the costs of the Medicare \nprogram. In the Medicaid program 30 percent of the population, the aged \nand disabled, accounts for 70 percent of Medicaid expenditures. \nFurthermore, this is the cost in the Medicaid Program that is growing \nthe fastest. Finding a means to manage high cost cases in these two \nprograms is essential if we are going to reduce costs in both of these \nprograms.\n  To add to the distortion and inefficiencies in providing care for \nelderly and disabled persons is that many of these people are both \nMedicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. These people are termed \ndually eligibles today. This creates numerous clinical, operation, and \nfinancial problems, particularly as these two programs are taking \nextraordinary steps to control spending. In order to access the full \nrange of care that is necessary an individual must deal with two very \ndifferent systems. The care received by a dually eligible consumer is \ntherefore, often fragmented, reimbursement driven, and inappropriate.\n  Service decisions are routinely made by providers based on which \nprogram pays better. This result is not always a care plan that is in \nthe best interest of the consumer or the most cost effective. Because \ntwo payors offering distinct yet overlapping benefit packages with \ndifferent sets of rules are responsible for the same consumer, much \nconfusion exists for all parties. It is often impossible for States to \nknow what service decisions, which ultimately tap Medicaid funding, are \nbeing made while the senior citizen is in the Medicare system. Another \nsource of much provider discontent and inefficiency is the dual \nadministration of claims payments. One of the major reasons for this \nproblem is that Medicare and Medicaid claims processing systems are not \ncompatible and Medicare and Medicaid payment policies differ. The \nresult is needless inefficiencies and expense.\n  As attempts to control Medicare spending and to block grant Medicaid \nmove forward, the problem of dual eligibles becomes an obstacle to \nachieve both goals. Medicare cannot control the cost of this population \nunless Medicaid funded services are used to lower Medicare's acute care \ncosts. Medicaid cannot manage and coordinate the care of the elderly \nand disabled unless it is given responsibility for the full continuum \nof care. One answer is a case managed system for the dual eligibles \nwhich merges Medicare and Medicaid coverage and is administered by the \nStates on Medicare's behalf. This would be a thoughtful approach in \naddressing the highest cost cases in both programs by replacing the \nfragmented, costly and inefficient system of today with an integrated, \nmanaged care approach designed to keep people healthier and lower costs \nfor both public programs.\n  I have been working with Senators Kassebaum, Cohen and Chafee on this \nvery key issue as we look forward to restructuring our public programs. \nOnce we have created a delivery system that provides high quality, \nappropriate, cost effective care for the people who need the system the \nmost--we will have restructured a health care system that works for all \nAmericans. Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle in a thoughtful debate on how to modify both \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14771-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14772-S14777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WELFARE REFORM VOTES\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during the Senate's consideration of the \nwelfare reform bill there was often very little time available for \nSenators to debate the amendments which were offered. I would like to \ntake a moment of the Senate's time now to comment on various votes \nwhich were cast during that debate.\n  Mr. President, no single issue dominated our deliberations more than \nthe subject of illegitimacy. Republican or Democrat. Liberal or \nConservative. I believe nearly every Senator emphasized the need for \nour society to curtail the dramatic rise in illegitimacy--or else face \nthe tragic consequences.\n  Given our near universal expression of concern and the overwhelming \nurgency of the situation, the logical question became: What steps do we \nin Congress take to combat this vexing problem?\n  A number of proposals were presented for the Senate to consider. \nThere was the family cap: Essentially denying additional benefits to \nmothers already on welfare for any additional children they have. There \nwas the issue of denying any assistance at all to unwed teen mothers. \nAnd there was the illegitimacy ratio bonus which would provide \nadditional financial assistance to States which successfully lowered \ntheir out-of-wedlock birth rate.\n  My general philosophy when it comes to an issue such as welfare \nreform is to give the States maximum flexibility in designing and \noperating their own programs. I think this is especially important when \ndealing with the matter of illegitimacy. While a great deal of \nattention has been paid to this issue lately, at present, there is no \nconcrete evidence that any specific program or approach has proven to \nbe consistently effective in stemming the tide of illegitimacy.\n  Mr. President, the States have shown they are best suited to serve as \nlaboratories where experimentation can take place and truly innovative \nsolutions will be found. However, if this is to \n\n[[Page S 14773]]\nhappen, we must resist the temptation to coerce the States into \nadopting any one particular approach as the best or only way to combat \nillegitimacy.\n  The State of New Jersey has over the last couple of years instituted \na family cap as part of its welfare program. I applaud their leadership \nin attempting to reverse the devastating effects of rampant \nillegitimacy. Nevertheless, there are conflicting reports about the \nresults in New Jersey thus far. At this time, it is unclear what \nconclusions we in Congress can fairly glean from their experience. \nAbsent credible evidence of success, how can we justify imposing any \none approach on every State in the Nation?\n  A far preferable approach, Mr. President, is to set national goals \nand give the States incentives to pursue them. This is why I fought to \nadd the illegitimacy ratio bonus mechanism to the welfare reform bill. \nWith the bonus, we are giving States a substantial financial incentive \nto be vigorous in dealing with their out-of-wedlock birth rates without \nthe constraints of a specific policy regimen. It is intended precisely \nto reward those States which are innovative, assiduous, and successful. \nAnd because the award is so substantial, we included language in the \nprovision protecting against States using abortion as a means of \nachieving these drops in out-of-wedlock births.\n  With these thoughts in mind, Mr. President, I voted for the motion to \nstrike the family cap offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici. The Dole family cap language required every State to deny \ncash benefits for additional children born to mothers already on \nwelfare. There was no opt-out available to States. There was no ability \nfor States to modify the cap to suit their circumstances or to get out \nfrom under it if unintended consequences ensued.\n  Many people believe the crisis of illegitimacy is sufficiently dire \nthat dramatic steps must be taken. I concur with that assessment. I \nsimply question the wisdom of forcing all 50 States to adopt a rigid \nprescription for combatting illegitimacy at the same time we are giving \nthem limited resources and asking them to be creative in designing \ntheir own welfare programs. The illegitimacy ratio bonus--providing \nStates the incentive of additional resources if they make use of the \nflexibility we allow and design effective programs--is I think a better \nway to induce States to address this problem.\n  Mr. President, this same rationale persuaded me to vote in favor of \nthe Faircloth amendment which combined a Federal requirement that \nStates deny cash assistance to unwed teen mothers with a State opt-out \nprovision. The reason for requiring States to affirmatively opt-out of \nthe Federal requirement is to ensure that States at least engage in a \nformal debate on how they plan to address the issue of illegitimacy.\n  Given the severity of the problem and the catastrophic ramifications \nof our doing nothing, I do not believe that requiring States to debate \nthe wisdom of this particular proposal is an unnecessary infringement \non State prerogatives or flexibility. It is also important to remember \nthat there is nothing in this legislation which would have prevented \nStates from doing this once the bill was passed. Under the Senate bill, \nStates are free to enact such policies, and I suspect a number of them \nwill.\n  Mr. President, let me stress one final, important point. I have said \nthat I believe States should be given the opportunity to devise and \nimplement their own programs to counter the skyrocketing out-of-wedlock \nbirth rate. I fully expect them to make the most of this opportunity.\n  Should States either fail to address this issue or to deal with it \neffectively, I believe the Congress will have no choice but to step in \nand dictate a more prescriptive approach. Likewise, if particular \ninitiatives yield concrete results at the State level, it would then \nbecome more reasonable for the Federal Government to push States to \nadopt such policies--though not to the exclusion of all other \napproaches.\n  Mr. President, another area of concern to many Senators was the issue \nof requiring States to maintain a level of spending on welfare \nconsistent with that of previous years. I think the proponents of such \nmeasures--commonly referred to as ``maintenance of effort''--operate \nout of a genuine concern that States not take advantage of this new \nFederal-State relationship. Nevertheless, I believe these efforts are \nmisguided for two principal reasons.\n  First, I believe most of these proposals originate out of the false \nnotion that States, once relieved of massive Federal regulation and \noversight of these programs, will immediately begin a race to the \nbottom. Once States are relieved of a required level of spending, it is \nargued, they will quickly cut benefits and shift their own resources to \nother areas. As I have stated on other occasions, I find this argument \nto be both naive and condescending.\n  I think our experience in Michigan shows that States--if given the \nlatitude to run their own programs--can be both efficient and \ncompassionate. The first reforms Michigan instituted, once it received \nthe requisite waivers from HHS, were not designed merely to get people \noff welfare and save money. In fact, the actual effect of many of these \ninitiatives was this: To allow people to stay on welfare and, at the \nsame time, to remain a two-parent family, or, to take a job and earn \nsome additional money, or, in some instances, to facilitate the welfare \nrecipient's eligibility to receive Medicaid, to which they would not \notherwise be entitled.\n  Far from our State's program being more harsh, I believe we in \nMichigan have been in many ways more realistic and more compassionate \nthan the Federal Government.\n  The second reason the rationale behind maintenance of effort \nrequirements is flawed is that they are simply not realistic. Again, I \nthink Michigan's experience is instructive.\n  Over the last 3 years, Michigan was able to reduce its welfare \ncaseload by approximately 14 percent. In September 1992, our AFDC \ncaseload was almost 222,000 cases and as of August 1995 our caseload \nhas dropped to just over 190,000. Because of this, welfare spending in \nour State decreased from $485 million in fiscal year 1993 to $451 \nmillion in fiscal year 1994--a difference of $34 million or 7 percent. \nAnd fiscal year 1995, which is about to end, is expected to be \nconsiderably lower than the previous year.\n  Mr. President, there are those who will argue about whether \nMichigan's caseload reduction is due to our welfare reform program or \nour strong economy. Frankly, that misses the point. A strong economy \nhas certainly had a beneficial effect on our welfare caseload. However, \neven if the caseload reduction were due solely to the State's improved \neconomy, the simple fact remains that there normally would be a \ncorrespondingly large reduction in State spending on welfare. And this \nwould occur without any negative impact on the services or benefits \navailable to individuals who remain on welfare.\n  Why, Mr. President, should a State have to continue to spend the same \namount on welfare if its caseload has been reduced by 10 percent, 20 \npercent or even 30 percent?\n  Nevertheless, during consideration of the welfare reform bill, the \nSenate was repeatedly confronted with attempts to impose a maintenance \nof effort requirement. The original Dole-Packwood bill did not contain \na maintenance of effort provision. It was subsequently modified to \nprovide for a 75-percent maintenance of effort for the first 3 years. \nWe then upped that figure to 80 percent, and later extended the effort \nrequirement to 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I supported those changes because I understood that \nthese were sincere attempts to accommodate Senators with serious \nconcerns about this issue. I was willing to agree to these changes \nprecisely because the level of effort required--75 percent or 80 \npercent--allowed a reasonable degree of latitude for States to adjust \ntheir spending levels to meet exigent circumstances. However, the \nBreaux amendment--which I opposed--required a 90-percent maintenance of \neffort or a decrease in the State's AFDC grant proportionate to the \namount the State's spending fell below 90 percent of previous levels.\n  And shortly before final passage, we were asked to vote on the final \nDole modification package which contained two additional maintenance of \neffort provisions. The first one was tied to the additional $3 billion \nmade available \n\n[[Page S 14774]]\nto States for child care. To be eligible for these funds, States were \nrequired to maintain 100 percent of their fiscal year 1994 spending on \nAFDC child care --even though they would still have to match these \nFederal funds at the standard Medicaid matching rate. The second was \ntied to the contingency fund, for which States were only eligible if \nthey maintained 100 percent of their AFDC spending for fiscal year \n1994.\n\n  Mr. President, I realize many of my colleagues are concerned about \nStates not carrying their weight, not paying their fair share. This \nSenator was willing to support a symbolic level of effort--and did. \nHowever, I felt the two additional maintenance of effort provisions in \nthe final Dole modification simply went too far. The effect of all of \nthese provisions, I believe, would be to force States to adopt spending \npriorities that were inconsistent with their caseloads, their costs or \nother factors.\n  Why is that a legitimate concern? It amounts to subtle coercion and \ncontradicts what we are purportedly attempting to accomplish by \ncreating the block grant. It violates part of the bargain into which I \nthought we were entering.\n  We promised to give States essentially a fixed block of money with \nwhich to design and operate their own welfare system. The incentive for \nthe States to run a tough, fair and efficient system was that they \ncould decrease the overall amount they spent on welfare and, thereby, \nfree up some of their own funds for use in other areas. By adopting \nthese various maintenance of effort requirements, we have violated that \ntacit agreement and--I believe--undermined States' ability to succeed. \nI think that was a mistake.\n  It was for that reason I voted ``No'' on the final Dole modification. \nHowever, I still strongly supported the bill on final passage. There \nare too many other important elements in the legislation. And inclusion \nof this provision in the bill does not, in my mind, jeopardize the \noverall feasibility of the welfare block grant scheme.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there were a number of votes on amendments to \nTitle V of the bill which dealt with the provision of Federal means-\ntested benefits to non-citizens. Let me briefly address a couple of \nthese.\n  First, I see no merit or justification--where the U.S. Constitution \nis silent--in drawing distinctions between naturalized and native-born \ncitizens. Where the Constitution makes distinctions, we must abide by \nits directives. Beyond that, I believe all citizens, regardless of how \nthey arrived at their citizenship, ought to be treated equally under \nthe law.\n  America is a nation built by immigrants. It has always served as a \nshining beacon of freedom to those fleeing tyranny and those seeking \nopportunity. In the case of my own grandparents, they came here merely \nlooking for an opportunity to build a life for themselves. Once they \nbecame U.S. citizens, the place of their birth should have had no \nbearing on their rights or privileges in this country.\n  This is why I voted for the amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, to remove language in the underlying \nDole proposal which would deny cash and non-cash welfare benefits to \nnaturalized citizens during the ``deeming\" period. The ``deeming'' \nperiod refers to the time during which the assets of the immigrant's \nsponsors are counted in evaluating the need for means-tested government \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment is clearly unconstitutional. \nWe are talking about American citizens, not legal aliens. As Senator \nFeinstein indicated during the debate, the Supreme Court in 1964, in \nthe case Schneider v. Rusk ruled that ``the rights of citizenship of \nthe native born and of the naturalized citizens are of the same dignity \nand coextensive.'' There can be no rationale for explicitly or \nimplicitly designating as ``second-class'' citizens individuals who \nhave come by their citizenship legally. It is as simple as that. The \nFeinstein amendment would have eliminated any disparate treatment once \ncitizenship has been achieved. That is what the Constitution requires, \nand that is why I supported her amendment.\n  The other amendments in this area addressed extending federally \nmeans-tested benefits to non-citizens. Unlike the issue in the \naforementioned Feinstein amendment, in these instances I felt there \ncould be a legitimate policy distinction between citizens and non-\ncitizens. Exact symmetry in our treatment of these groups is not \nnecessary--and, in certain situations, not appropriate.\n  A second Feinstein amendment dealing with immigration would limit the \ndeeming requirements to only cash and cash-like Federal benefits. \nTherefore, legal aliens with sponsors would not have to have their \nsponsor's income taken into consideration when applying for such \nFederal benefits as Medicaid and Head Start.\n  This amendment raises three issues. First, the letter of the law is \nthat all legal immigrants entering this country--even those who \nultimately plan to stay permanently and become citizens--must assure \nimmigration officials that they will not become public charges while \nthey are here. They must show sufficient resources either of their own \nor belonging to their sponsor. While this law has not been diligently \nenforced, it is important to remember that those are the terms of an \nimmigrant's entrance into our country.\n  Second, we are in the process of making difficult budget decisions on \nmany programs--including Medicaid and Head Start. Are we prepared to \nfacilitate the ability of non-citizens to gain access to these programs \nat the same time we are placing limits on the funding available to meet \nthe needs of our own citizens?\n  Last, the argument is made that, if these people are not eligible for \nFederal benefits, the States will end up bearing the cost of providing \nthese services. The bill does make exceptions --such as emergency \nmedical care, disaster relief, school lunches, child nutrition, and \nimmunization against disease--so that under certain circumstances the \nFederal Government will cover the cost of certain benefits. Aside from \nthose instances, States must decide what level of services they are \nwilling to provide, and they are free to spend their resources in those \nareas as they see fit. I did not see a compelling reason to add to the \nexceptions already provided for in the bill, and therefore, I could not \nsupport the Feinstein amendment.\n  Senators Simon and Graham offered an amendment which would have \neliminated any retroactivity effect from the Dole bill's provision to \nincrease the deeming requirement in all cases to a 5-year period. \nCurrently, there are some government benefits, education assistance \nbeing a primary example, for which non-citizens residing legally in the \nUnited States can become eligible earlier than the five year deeming \nperiod which exists for most means-tested Federal benefits.\n  This provision would apply to a relatively narrow segment of people: \nonly legal aliens who have been in this country less than five years \nand who either are currently receiving some form of assistance or are \neligible to receive some form of assistance because the respective \ndeeming period has expired. As I have indicated, immigrants legally \nadmitted to the United States are asked to pledge that they will either \nbe self-supporting or supported by their sponsors.\n  I regret that some people may be adversely affected by this \nprovision. Nevertheless, it has become too easy in many instances for \nnon-citizens to receive government benefits while our own citizens \noften go without. At a time when we are making difficult budget cuts \nwhich will impact the lives of American citizens, I think we owe it to \nthem to ensure that we are not conferring non-essential benefits to \nnon-citizens. For that reason, I opposed the Simon-Graham amendment on \ndeeming retroactivity.\n  Mr. President, let me quickly describe a number of other issues which \narose during the Senate's consideration of the welfare reform bill.\n  Formula issues are always among the most contentious of the matters \nwe deal with in the Senate. On welfare reform, this was once again the \ncase. There were two formula-related amendments offered on the floor: \nthe Graham Children's Fair Share formula and the Feinstein Growth \nFormula Adjustment.\n  Formulas are usually made up of a number of different variables, but \nthese \n\n[[Page S 14775]]\nvariables tend to represent three general indexes. These factors are: \nHow wealthy is the State? What has the State's effort in this area been \nin the past? And what are the State's needs? The formula's end product \ndepends as much on which of these factors you stress most as it depends \non the relevant statistics from the State.\n  In the case of the Graham amendment, the so-called growth States were \npitted directly against those States which traditionally had the \nhighest welfare caseload and highest level of expenditures. If the \nGraham amendment had passed, it would have been devastating to the \nState of Michigan, and thus I felt compelled to oppose it.\n  The Feinstein amendment was a closer call. The Feinstein amendment \nwas identical to the House formula, and apparently no State would have \nlost money under its provisions. In fact, the State of Michigan stood \nto receive a slight increase under the Feinstein proposal. However, \nbecause formula fights are so contentious, if every State only looks at \nthe bottom line, we stand either to make bad policy or to be unable to \nwin passage of the bill.\n  In the case of the Feinstein amendment, a compromise had already been \nworked out between the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, and the \nMajority Leader which addressed many of the concerns of the so-called \ngrowth States. This was a fragile compromise and passage of Feinstein \namendment would have abrogated it, effectively increasing the \nlikelihood of the Graham amendment passing. That would have been \ndevastating to Michigan. My vote against the Feinstein amendment was an \nattempt to ensure ultimate passage of the bill while also guaranteeing \nadequate funding for my State.\n  The Senator from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun offered two \namendments that dealt with cutting off benefits. The first stipulated \nthat the 5-year cumulative time limit on benefits for welfare \nrecipients would not apply if any State did not provide employment, job \ntraining or job counseling to the recipient. The problem with this \namendment is that it places the entire burden on the State to provide \nthe work-activity related services'' to the recipient, thus alleviating \nthe individual of any need to exert the effort and responsibility \nnecessary to seek out and obtain job training or employment.\n\n  We already have a requirement that States get welfare recipients into \nwork-related activities; it is called the participation rate. States \nwhich do not meet this will themselves be sanctioned. Mr. President, if \nindividuals desire to get off welfare and into training or employment, \nthey will find an eager partner in the State welfare agency. For those \nrecipients who are less motivated--or not motivated at all--we need the \n5-year time limit. Adopting this amendment would, in my estimation, \nemasculate the 5-year time limit, and for that reason I opposed it.\n  The second Moseley-Braun amendment dealt with the consequences of \nwhat happens to children if their parents are sanctioned for any reason \nand lose their benefits. It would have required States to replace the \nlost benefits with vouchers for goods and services equal to each \nchild's share of the benefits. I am sympathetic to the problem the \nSenator from Illinois sought to rectify. I am simply concerned that, in \nthis instance, her solution was too far-reaching.\n  As with ``strings'' in other areas--for instance illegitimacy--I am \nreluctant to tell States they must address a potential problem with a \nparticular remedy. States are free, under this bill, to do exactly what \nthis amendment proposes with their own funds. And I believe many will. \nBut by passing this amendment, we would be limiting the options \navailable to the State to address certain exigencies. I believe that \nwould be a mistake, and for that reason I voted against this particular \namendment of the Senator from Illinois.\n  The Senate also considered a similar amendment offered by the \nMinority Leader and the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nwhich would permit States to use Federal funds to provide non-cash \nassistance to children whose parents become ineligible for assistance \ndue to the five year time limit. As I stated above, States are, of \ncourse, perfectly free and capable to provide this assistance with \ntheir own funds. However, there is another provision of the Dole bill \nwhich could apply in such instances.\n  The Dole bill does allow States a hardship exemption to protect \nfamilies from the five year time limit when circumstances warrant. In \nfact, the Majority Leader, at the request of the Minority Leader, \nraised the level of hardship exemptions States can claim from 15 \npercent to 20 percent precisely to address this concern. So I am \nconfident that sufficient resources and flexibility exist for States to \ntake care of children who may be affected by the 5-year time limit.\n  Mr. President, I have a lot more faith than apparently is held on the \nother side of the aisle that Governors and State legislators--whether \nthey are Republicans or Democrats--will not allow children in their \nStates to suffer. I know that many people believe that will occur. I do \nnot. I believe that any elected official who allows that to take place \non their watch will pay the price at the ballot box at the next \nelection. And frankly, Mr. President, there is already considerable \nsuffering occurring under the present system. I do not imagine the \nStates could do much worse.\n  There were two amendments from the Senator from Maryland that I would \nlike to discuss. One dealt with an issue both she and I had addressed \nearlier this year in the Labor Committee. Her amendment proposed to \nstrike from the workforce development portion of the welfare bill the \nrepeal of Title V of the Older Americans Act which applies to senior \ncommunity service employment programs. While the workforce development \nsection now has been separated from the welfare reform bill to be taken \nup as a free-standing measure, let me describe the rationale behind my \nopposition to the Mikulski amendment.\n  The existing Senior Community Service Employment program gives \napproximately $320 million to about 10 national seniors groups. It is \nthen left to those groups to set up programs that benefit the seniors \nat the State and local level. By many accounts, that presently is not \nhappening. During the Labor Committee's consideration of the workforce \ndevelopment bill, I heard from seniors groups in Michigan. They \nsupported the concept of block granting these funds to the State level \nprecisely because they are not receiving adequate funding under the \ncurrent structure.\n  The General Accounting Office reportedly will soon release a report \ndocumenting the degree to which these funds fail to ever reach the \nsenior citizens and local seniors groups they are meant to benefit. \nReportedly, one fifth of the $320 million is going to administrative \ncosts including salaries, fringe benefits and expenses. Only a fraction \nof the remainder reaches the grass roots level. This is the type of \narrangement that my constituents sent me to Washington to rectify. That \nis why I supported block granting these funds to the States and why I \nvoted against the Senator from Maryland's amendment.\n  The second Mikulski amendment was very attractive in theory, but it \ncontained a couple of elements which I could not justify supporting. \nThe purpose of the amendment was noble: to create incentives for \nfamilies to stay intact and to remove any existing disincentives from \nthe law. Regrettably, one of the incentives was a mandate on States to \nestablish job training and employment programs for non-custodial \nparents to help them get jobs, earn an income, and pay child support.\n  That is a laudable objective, Mr. President. However, how do we \nexplain to the lower-middle class working parent, who may already be \nholding down two or three jobs himself or herself, that we are setting \nup a new program to provide a dead-beat dad job training when we are \nnot providing them the same opportunity. I think the existing penalties \nfor dead-beat parents--and the additional ones provided in this bill--\nwill give them sufficient incentive, if they are so inclined, to seek \nout training and work. And there are plenty of existing job training \nand employment service programs available to meet the needs of any non-\ncustodial parents needing assistance.\n  Second, this amendment attempted to re-insert into the bill a \ncontroversial provision which had already been struck: namely, the $50 \npass-through. \n\n[[Page S 14776]]\nIn most, if not every State, the policy is that when delinquent child \nsupport payments are finally collected, the State is first entitled to \nsubtract the costs it incurred in providing assistance to the family \nwhile child support was not forthcoming. It then passes any remaining \nmoney on to the mother.\n  This amendment would propose that the first fifty dollars collected \nin back child support be passed directly through to the mother before \nthe State attempts to defray its costs in caring for the family. Mr. \nPresident, State child support agencies oppose this amendment as an \nadded and unnecessary administrative burden and as an obstacle to \nStates' attempts to recoup monies they have spent supporting these \nfamilies. We are not talking about States taking money which rightfully \nbelongs to others. We are talking about State's being reimbursed for \ntheir expenditures when remuneration becomes available, and therefore, \nbeing able to support another needy family at a later date. That is \nentirely reasonable and fair, and thus, I believe such a proposal is \nmisguided.\n  The Mikulski amendment does contain a provision which I strongly \nsupport: the elimination of the 100-hour work limit or the man in the \nhouse rule. However, the other aforementioned elements of the amendment \nare not sound policy to my mind, and therefore, I felt constrained to \noppose the amendment.\n  As an aside, Mr. President, back in 1992 the State of Michigan sought \nand received a waiver from HHS from the man in the house regulation as \nwell as the work history requirement before families can become \neligible for AFDC. Please understand this incongruity: For a two parent \nfamily to be eligible for AFDC, one of the parents must have a recent \nwork history, but at the same time, that parent cannot be working more \nthan 100 hours in a given month. That, Mr. President, is why we need to \nfree States from the Federal micro-management which has, I think, \nplagued our national social policy over the last thirty years.\n  On another matter, the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, \noffered an amendment to increase funding levels for treatment programs \nfor drug abuse and alcohol treatment. Senator Bingaman's amendment \nsought to increase funding for these programs by an additional $300 \nmillion. This was after the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader had \nalready included in the final modification package a funding level of \n$50 million for the next two years. The Senator from New Mexico \npreferred $100 million for the next 4 years.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that substance abuse and alcoholism \nare severe problems for our society and not simply characteristic of \nwelfare populations. Nevertheless, research confirms that a very \nsizable segment of the long-term welfare dependent population has \neither a substance or alcohol abuse problem. Any effective welfare \nreform program at the State level will have to deal with this dilemma.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that we have very limited resources \nwith which to work. If we add $300 million dollars in substance abuse \ntreatment, it will come from one of two places. It can come right off \nthe top of each State's welfare block grant. But this is money already \ngoing to the States, and under this amendment, the States would have no \noption but to use it exclusively for treatment. At least under the Dole \nproposal, States can assess their own needs in determining what is a \nreasonable level of expenditure.\n  The only other recourse we would have is to tell the Finance \nCommittee that they now, during the reconciliation process, need to \ncome up with another $300 million from somewhere. Will it be Medicare? \nWill it be Medicaid? Who knows? The responsible thing, I believe, Mr. \nPresident, is to allow the States to determine their own needs and give \nthem the flexibility to direct the necessary resources to meet that \nneed. For that reason, I voted against the Bingaman amendment.\n  That same day we also considered a Sense of the Senate amendment by \nthe Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, which stated that ``any \nMedicaid reform enacted by the Senate this year should require that \nStates continue to provide Medicaid for 12 months to families who lose \neligibility for welfare benefits because of more earnings or hours of \nemployment.''\n  Mr. President, this is one of those amendments that appears \nwell intentioned and reasonable, but serves, I think, to replicate the \ntype of over-regulation that has hampered our Federal social programs \nfor years. In Michigan, as I have already noted, we were able to secure \na waiver from HHS that would allow us to opt out of a Federal \nregulation which served to limit people's access to Medicaid. Once \nMichigan obtained the waiver, between October 1992 and December 1992 \nover 4,500 cases were transferred from our State Family Assistance \nProgram to Medicaid.\n\n  In 1994, Michigan sought another waiver from HHS. The State wanted to \neliminate the disincentive which often exists when people face the \nprospect of losing Medicaid if they find employment and leave AFDC. \nMichigan proposed to offer a Medicaid ``Buy-In'' option for individuals \nwhose transitional Medicaid coverage had expired and for whom employer-\nbased health coverage was not available. This program would also cover \nchildren for whom a child support order requires the purchase of health \ncoverage. Regrettably, our State has still not received a waiver from \nHHS so they cannot move forward with this program. Because of this \ninaction, people in my State go without health care coverage or remain \non welfare.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues: Where is the compassion in that? \nThis program would in fact be even more generous than what the Senator \nfrom Minnesota has suggested in his amendment. The State of Michigan \nwas not under duress when it requested this waiver; it was good social \npolicy. It is experiences like this that give me confidence that the \nStates are going to perform much better than people think, and better \nthan the Federal Government has performed in many areas.\n  Perhaps the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota is not misguided \nin intent, but I am afraid it is misguided in effect. It states that \none particular approach is ideal in all situations. There is not even \nan allowance for States to deny benefits to individuals earning over a \nreasonable income limit; it only states ``families who lose \neligibility'' because of ``more earnings'' should retain their Medicaid \neligibility for an additional 12 months. This amendment is simply \nunrealistic, and it undermines our efforts to give States maximum \nflexibility in responding to various exigencies. I felt it was \nnecessary to oppose it.\n  Following the Wellstone amendment, the Senate took up an amendment \noffered by the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. The Kohl amendment \nwould have exempted senior citizens, the disabled, and children from \nthe optional food stamp block grant which is part of the Dole bill. \nFirst let me point out that, through burdensome regulations and \nrestrictions, we have already made the ``option'' for States to elect a \nfood stamp block grant fairly unattractive. This would make it only \nmore so. Imagine the administrative nightmare for a State to run a \nsystem in which some of its citizens are in the State program and some \nare still in the Federal system. That would prove to be unworkable.\n  There is also the matter of cost. This provision would reportedly \ncost an additional $1.4 billion. As I have already indicated, it can \nonly come from two places: decreasing the amount going to States in \ntheir welfare block grants--meaning less money in assistance--or \nfurther reductions in other federal programs like Medicare or Medicaid. \nI do not believe that either of those results is acceptable, and \ntherefore, I voted against the Kohl amendment.\n  The Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, offered an amendment which \nwould undermine the tough work requirement in the Dole bill by allowing \nthe Secretary of HHS to modify each State's work participation rate to \nreflect the varying levels of Federal assistance. I agree that some \nStates are farther along than others in developing a welfare program \ncapable of meeting the ambitious participation rates contained in the \nDole bill. However, I also believe that States are given sufficient \ntools and enough flexibility in this bill to meet these targets in the \ntime allotted.\n\n[[Page S 14777]]\n\n  My concern, Mr. President, is that if we do not have tough, uniform \nwork requirements, States will have every incentive to come up with \nreasons that these target rates are not achievable. As it now stands, \nStates know what is expected of them, and they are given five years to \nmeet these targets. And we have made a number of changes to facilitate \ntheir task. To have accepted this amendment would have set us back \nconsiderably from our goal to have people on welfare performing real \nwork. For that reason, I could not support the Graham amendment.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe the Senate's passage of this \nlegislation was a momentous occasion. It marked, I think, a watershed \nin our approach to social policy in this Nation. There were a number of \nconsiderable accomplishments in this measure.\n  We were able to end the ``entitlement'' status of welfare benefits. \nThe American people have made it clear that they want a welfare system \nwhich does more than simply provide government hand-outs. They expect \nsomething from the recipient in return--self-discipline, a work ethic, \npersonal responsibility. But it is practically impossible to have real \nwelfare reform without the ability to sanction those recipients who \nfail to abide by the terms of the program.\n  As long as welfare is treated as an entitlement--essentially a right \nand not a benefit--the courts have ruled that the same due process \nrights exists for the welfare recipient as for a homeowner or property \nowner. In fact, some would argue it would be easier for the Government \nto take your property away. Without this legislation, sanctioning \nrecipients who refuse to work will be administratively unduly \nburdensome if not impossible.\n  The second major achievement of the welfare bill was to erect a \nstrong work requirement for States to use in developing their programs. \nWe started by giving States difficult targets to reach in the form of \nwork participation rates among welfare recipients--and without \nexemptions. Exemptions only serve to exaggerate the number of people \nworking in any State. We then crafted a strict definition of what \nconstitutes work so that we could be confident that the States had \ngenuine work programs. Other than those parameters, Mr. President, we \ntell the States that they are free to determine by themselves how they \nwish to meet those targets.\n  Third, while the Senate did not go as far as many people wished, we \ntook a sizable and laudable first step toward addressing the crisis of \nillegitimacy. We made illegitimacy a core feature of the welfare reform \nbill, and we gave States a carrot and stick. The carrot comes in the \nform of the illegitimacy ratio bonus. The stick, I believe, is the \ninevitability of Congress taking much more drastic, prescriptive \nactions if States fail to effectively combat their out-of-wedlock birth \nrates.\n  Finally, the bill gives the States tremendous latitude and \nflexibility in designing and running the programs we are block granting \nand sending back to them. That is critical if the block grant approach \nis to ever succeed.\n  For years, many of us have said that the Federal Government does not \nhave all the answers. We have repeatedly proclaimed that too often \nbureaucrats in Washington have actually created many of our problems or \nwere hindrances to others' attempts at finding solutions.\n  Mr. President, this Senator simply does not believe that government \nat any level--Federal, State or local--has the resources or the \ningenuity to solve all of our Nation's social problems. That is \nespecially true when we are talking about many of the issues related to \nwelfare reform: illegitimacy, child care, education and job training, \npaternity establishment and child support.\n  If all we ask of our welfare system is to provide a safety net for \npeople who have fallen on hard times, then we can content ourselves \nwith Government merely getting money or goods into peoples' hands. \nHowever, if we want our welfare system to be one in which individuals \nneeding assistance are given the tools and the opportunities to get off \nwelfare and never return, the assistance we provide has to be more than \nsimply a government hand-out.\n  To accomplish this will require input from a whole host of other \ninstitutions in our society beyond government--our churches, our \nschools, our businesses, our civic associations--in essence, our entire \ncommunity. For too many years, Government has seen itself as the sole \npurveyor of opportunity for the less fortunate and, in the process, has \nstifled the efforts of other institutions desirous of sharing the \nworkload. With the passage of this welfare reform bill, we are telling \nGovernment that it must begin to share the responsibilities and the \nresources with other partners in this endeavor.\n  That is why I believe the legislation we passed last week is such a \ntremendous accomplishment. I trust the conferees will work diligently \nto come up with a similarly tough and balanced measure, one that most \nof us can wholeheartedly support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14772-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR \n                                THE ARTS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to mark the 30th anniversary of the National Endowment for the \nArts. Thirty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson initiated a program \nwhich gave the government a modest role in bringing the arts and \nculture to all the people of our great nation. Today, 30 years later, \nthis small investment is being called into question, ignoring that the \nNational Endowment for the Arts has made a substantial contribution to \nthe cultural lives of Americans in all corners of the nation. The NEA \nhas lived up to the purposes for which Congress established, \nspecifically, ``to ensure that the arts and humanities belong to all \npeople of the United States.'' This has been no small achievement, and \nis one which the Endowment can stake claim to--broadening accessibility \nand increasing the breadth of participation.\n  For much of our Nation's history, one had to travel to the biggest \ncities--New York, Chicago, Boston or Los Angeles--to participate and \nenjoy the best of what the arts had to offer. This is no longer the \ncase. The Endowment has encouraged a real flowering of the arts across \nthe nation and provided the seeds for each community to celebrate its \nuniqueness and its creativity. While one could not say that the \nEndowment is the creator of art--certainly the arts would exist and \nhave existed without it--one can safely say it has been a catalyst for \nensuring that the very best of the arts are available to even the \nsmallest corner of the nation and to all segments of the population.\n  All across America, millions of children and their families have had \nthe chance to see the great masterpieces of the visual arts, hear the \nmasterworks of American composers, and read the novels and stories and \npoems of America's great writers. The gift of the Endowment to our \nNation is realized by each person, young and old, whose horizon is \nbroadened through dancing and writing, whose self esteem is reinforced \nthrough participation in the arts, who is able to communicate through \ncreating. Bringing the magic and wonder of the arts to all of us, is \nthe triumph of the NEA.\n  Mr. President, on this 30th anniversary, I would also like to take a \nmoment to pay tribute to one of the founding fathers of the NEA, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island, Clairborne Pell, who \nhas been a true champion of the arts. He, too, should be recognized on \nthis anniversary for his extraordinary contributions. As a long time \nsupporter of this agency and sponsor of legislation to reauthorize the \nNational Endowment for the Arts in 1995, I am proud to come to the \nSenate floor and make note of this special day.\n  Now that it appears that the Endowment is secure, I would like to \nthank all my colleagues who helped through this difficult time. We \nshould not allow for controversy to overshadow this agency's great \naccomplishments. It is my hope that the National Endowment for the Arts \nwill continue to serve the American public will into the next \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14777-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14777-S14778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 908\n\n  Mr. COATS.

REDUCTION OF SENTENCING DISPARITY.\n\n       (a) Recommendations.--\n       (1) In general.--The United States Sentencing Commission \n     shall submit to Congress recommendations (and an explanation \n     therefor) regarding changes to the statutes and Sentencing \n     Guidelines governing sentences for unlawful manufacturing, \n     importing, exporting, and trafficking of cocaine, and like \n     offenses, including unlawful possession, possession with \n     intent to commit any of the forgoing offenses, and attempt \n     and conspiracy to commit any of the forgoing offenses. The \n     recommendations shall reflect the following considerations:\n       (A) the sentence imposed for trafficking in a quantity of \n     crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed \n     for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine;\n       (B) high-level wholesale cocaine traffickers, organizers, \n     and leaders, of criminal activities should generally receive \n     longer sentences than low-level retail cocaine traffickers \n     and those who played a minor or minimal role in such criminal \n     activity;\n       (C) if the Government establishes that a defendant who \n     traffics in powder cocaine has knowledge that such cocaine \n     will be converted into crack cocaine prior to its \n     distribution to individual users, the defendant should be \n     treated at sentencing as though the defendant had trafficked \n     in crack cocaine; and\n       (D) an enhanced sentence should generally be imposed on a \n     defendant who, in the course of an offense described in this \n     subsection--\n       (i) murders or causes serious bodily injury to an \n     individual;\n       (ii) uses a dangerous weapon;\n       (iii) uses or possesses a firearm;\n       (iv) involves a juvenile or a woman who the defendant knows \n     or should know to be pregnant;\n       (v) engages in a continuing criminal enterprise or commits \n     other criminal offenses in order to facilitate his drug \n     trafficking activities;\n\n[[Page S 14780]]\n\n       (vi) knows, or should know, that he is involving an \n     unusually vulnerable person;\n       (vii) restrains a victim;\n       (viii) traffics in cocaine within 500 feet of a school;\n       (ix) obstructs justice;\n       (x) has a significant prior criminal record; or\n       (xi) is an organizer or leader of drug trafficking \n     activities involving five or more persons.\n       (2) Ratio.--The recommendations described in the preceding \n     subsection shall propose revision of the drug quantity ratio \n     of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant \n     statutes and guidelines in a manner consistent with the \n     ratios set for other drugs, and consistent with the \n     objectives set forth in 28 U.S.C. 3553(a).\n       (b) Study.--No later than May 1, 1996, the Department of \n     Justice shall submit to the Judiciary Committees of the \n     Senate and House of Representatives a report on the charging \n     and plea practices of federal prosecutors with respect to the \n     offense of money laundering. Such study shall include an \n     account of the steps taken or to be taken by the Justice \n     Department to ensure consistency and appropriateness in the \n     use of the money laundering statute. The Sentencing \n     Commission shall submit to the Judiciary Committees comments \n     on the study prepared by the Department of Justice.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my amendment to the Abraham bill is \ndesigned to keep alive the hope that this Congress will someday soon \naddress the festering issue of racial disparity in our Nation's cocaine \nsentencing laws.\n  Few matters are as fundamental to the integrity of the judicial \nsystem as maintaining the confidence of the country that it is free \nfrom racial bias. That issue has been raised very clearly and very \nintensely in the O.J. Simpson trial. It is also raised in other serious \nways, including by the controversy over the disparity in sentences \ninvolving the drug cocaine.\n  Cocaine is one of the most addictive and dangerous of all illegal \ndrugs, and those who traffic in it deserve tough, lengthy punishment. \nBut if the criminal justice system is to command the respect of all \nAmericans, punishment must not only be tough--it must be fair. Similar \ndefendants must receive similar sentences. We must do all we can to \nensure that the Federal criminal justice system is free from even the \nslightest taint of racial discrimination.\n  In the 1980's, Congress passed a number of bills to respond \naggressively to the drug crisis. But in at least one respect we may \nhave inadvertently created an injustice--the much harsher sentences \nimposed for crack cocaine than for powdered cocaine.\n  A mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years is imposed in current law \nbased on the weight of the drug involved. But it takes 100 times more \npowdered cocaine to trigger the mandatory minimum sentence than crack \ncocaine.\n  In other words, a defendant who sells five grams of crack cocaine \nreceives the same mandatory minimum 5-year sentence as a defendant who \nsells 500 grams of powdered cocaine. Possession of five grams of crack \nis subject to a 5-year minimum sentence, but possession of five grams \nof powdered cocaine is subject to only a 1-year maximum sentence.\n  The overwhelming view of scientists is that this disparity is \nunjustified. Powder and crack cocaine are two forms of the same drug. \nTheir biological effects are similar. There is no justification for the \npreposterous 100 to 1 ratio in current law.\n\n  But the issue goes beyond science. Blacks account for 88 percent of \nall defendants in crack cases, while blacks, whites, and Hispanics are \nequally likely to be defendants in powdered cocaine cases. As a result, \nthe minimum sentences mandated for crack cases under the law are \nimposed overwhelmingly on black defendants.\n  The current law has caused serious injustices in a number of cases. \nThe Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Arthur Curry, a retired \nschool principal, whose 19-year-old son was sentenced to 20 years \nwithout parole for playing a minor role in a drug conspiracy. The FBI \ncalled him a ``flunky'', with below-average intelligence. He had no \nprior criminal record. But the judge had no choice, and sent 19-year-\nold Derrick Curry to Federal prison for the next 20 years. That young \nman's life is destroyed. He'll come out of prison in 20 years a \nhardened criminal, and the cost to the American taxpayer is enormous.\n  And Derrick Curry is not alone. A 1994 Justice Department study found \nthat 21 percent of all Federal prisoners are low-level, non-violent \ndrug offenders.\n  Last year, in response to cases like the Curry case, Congress \ndirected the Sentencing Commission to study the cocaine issue. The \nCommission produced an excellent report that persuasively demonstrates \nthe irrationality of the 100 to 1 ratio. The Commission has voted to \neliminate the disparity, and to strengthen the guidelines in cases \ninvolving violence in drug trafficking.\n  Congress created the Sentencing Commission for the express purpose of \neliminating this kind of unwarranted sentencing disparity. The sponsors \nof the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act, including Senator Thurmond, Senator \nHatch, Senator Biden, and myself, sought to make sense of the \nsentencing process and to solve the problem of similar defendants \nreceiving grossly different sentences. The act specifically directed \nthe Commission to ensure that the Federal sentencing system is racially \nneutral.\n  The Commission has done an outstanding job. It has carefully examined \nthe empirical and scientific data. It has compiled that information in \na comprehensive report, and made appropriate adjustments in the \nguidelines. To simply reject the Commission's action is to repudiate \nthe sensible process established in the 1984 Act to take politics out \nof sentencing.\n  The Commission's proposal provides lengthy punishment for crack \ndefendants based on conduct, not race. The proposed enhancements for \nusing weapons during drug offenses mean that armed drug dealers will be \npunished more severely. On the average, crack defendants will still \nreceive sentences that are 2\\1/2\\ times longer than defendants in \npowdered cocaine cases. But the defendants who receive that longer \npunishment will have earned it by their own conduct, and that's how it \nshould be.\n\n  The current disparity is also an example of a basic problem with all \nmandatory minimum sentences. Congress sets a minimum number of years \nfor a certain crime, without reference to other crimes. A 5-year \nsentence for selling five grams of crack cocaine may have seemed \nappropriate to Congress in 1986, but it is illogical and \ndisproportionate when compared to other sentences. With a Sentencing \nCommission and a guideline system in place, mandatory minimum \nsentencing laws are unnecessary and often counterproductive. Here, as \nelsewhere, they prevent the Commission from overseeing the sentencing \nsystem fairly.\n  We've all heard from judges in our States about the problems caused \nby mandatory minimums. The crack cocaine issue is at the heart of those \ncomplaints. If we cannot solve this problem fairly, we may never \nachieve the goal of a rational sentencing system.\n  The chief sponsor of the Commission's proposed amendment is Wayne \nBudd, a Republican who served as the third highest ranking official in \nPresident Bush's Justice Department. Before that, as the U.S. attorney \nin Massachusetts, Wayne Budd put many criminals behind bars. So when a \nperson of Wayne Budd's credentials says that the 100-to-1 ratio is \nunfair, Congress should take careful notice.\n  I support Wayne Budd's proposal to completely eliminate the 100-to-1 \ndisparity between crack and powder cocaine. But I recognize that a 1-\nto-1 ratio is unacceptable to a majority of the Senate. Accordingly, I \nam reluctantly consenting to passage of the Abraham bill, which would \nreject the Commission's proposed 1-to-1 ratio. But in an attempt to \nmaintain some momentum for change, my amendment would send the matter \nback to the Commission with specific directions, including a mandate to \nrevise the ratio in a manner consistent with the ratios governing other \nillicit drugs.\n  My amendment not only directs the Commission to change the cocaine \nsentencing ratio. It also instructs the Commission to ensure that \ncocaine defendants whose cases involve aggravated circumstances receive \nenhanced punishment. Unlike mandatory minimums, the guidelines already \ndistinguish, for example, between violent and non-violent defendants, \nand my amendment would put the Senate firmly on record in favor of the \ntoughest punishment for the worst criminals. \n\n[[Page S 14781]]\n\n  We cannot close our eyes to the distrust with which many African-\nAmericans view the criminal justice system. When the realities behind \nthat perception are identified, they must be remedied. Fixing this ill-\nconsidered law is a good place to start, and we should let the \nSentencing Commission stay on the job.\n  Maybe a 1 to 1 ratio is unacceptable to the Senate. But if the \nCommission recommends a ratio of 5 to 1 or 10 to 1, I hold out hope \nthat Congress will permit that change to become law.\n  Finally, my amendment also attempts to salvage some progress toward \nfairness in the application of the money laundering statute.\n  The current sentencing guidelines for this crime are flawed because \nthey treat technical violations of the money laundering statute as \nseriously as complex, sophisticated financial crimes. For example, an \nelderly postal worker who steals a check and deposits it in the bank \nreceives the same punishment as the financial manager of a major drug \ntrafficking operation. The Commission's proposal ensures tough \npunishment for money laundering but distinguishes the culpability of \ndifferent defendants.\n  I support the Commission's proposal on money laundering, but as in \nthe cocaine context, the will of the Senate is clearly to block this \namendment due to the self-interested recommendation of the Justice \nDepartment. But here, as well, I am reluctant to simply let the \nCommission's good work perish in vain.\n  My amendment, therefore, directs the Justice Department to report to \nCongress on the charging and plea practices of Federal prosecutors with \nrespect to the money laundering statute. I intend to review that study \ncarefully. And if it does not make a compelling case that the \nDepartment is addressing the problem itself, I will work to improve the \nstatutes and the sentencing guidelines that cover this unduly elastic \ncrime.\n  It is inherently difficult for a legislature to grapple with the \ncomplex and politically sensitive subject of sentencing. We created a \nnon-political, independent Commission in 1984 for that very reason. \nPassage of the Abraham bill marks the first time that the Senate has \nrejected major guideline amendments proposed by the Sentencing \nCommission, and that development bodes ill for the long-term vitality \nof the sentencing guideline scheme.\n  Nonetheless, I retain hope that the decades-long effort to develop a \nfair and rational sentencing system will continue. The goal of \nequitable sentencing for the crimes of cocaine sentencing, money \nlaundering and every other offense in the Federal code is not furthered \nby passage of this bill. But the goal remains in sight, and we must \ncontinue to pursue it.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I accept the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. As is plain from its language, it does not request \nthe Commission to send new guideline changes. Rather, it requests the \nCommission's recommendations for how the laws and guidelines should be \nchanged. That is the course that in my view is appropriate for the \nCommission to take, since under current law, the sentences are largely \ndictated by mandatory minimums set by Congress. Accordingly, major \nchanges in this area have to come from Congress, and until such changes \nare made the guidelines should conform with existing law. Thus, while \nthe amendment does not detract from the Commission's existing statutory \nauthority to propose amendments to the guidelines, that is not what the \namendment asks the Commission to send us. Rather, the amendment merely \nasks for a policy recommendation.\n  As I indicated on introducing this bill, I have some sympathy with \nsome of the concerns the Commission has raised about present law. In \nparticular, I am concerned that some powder defendants at the top of \ncrack distribution networks seem to be getting lower sentences than \nretail distributors. I also think that while there is good reason for \nsignificant differential treatment of powder and crack, we should have \na look more generally at whether the present differential represents \nthe best policy.\n  In my view, however, the Commission resolved these concerns the wrong \nway: by lowering sentences for crack, rather than by raising sentences \nfor powder. Along with several of my colleagues, I would like to see \nthese issues addressed from the other end: by raising the sentences for \npowder distribution. My specific proposal, embodied in the companion \nbill I sponsored along with Senators Kyl, Feinstein, Brown, and \nMcConnell, is to lower the trigger for powder sentences from 500 to 100 \ngrams for mandatory 5-five year sentences, and from 5,000 to 1,000 \ngrams for mandatory 10 year sentences. I believe this resolution of the \nmatter is entirely consistent with the criteria set out in Senator \nKennedy's amendment.\n  I should only add that I would be very concerned about any resolution \nof this matter that is predicated on the lowering of sentences for \ncrack distributors. I believe that would send exactly the wrong \nmessage: that in the war against crack society blinked. I believe the \namendment proposed by Senator Kennedy is entirely consistent with these \nviews, and I therefore accept his amendment on that basis.\n  Mr. Hatch. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment to \nblock reductions in penalties for crack dealing proposed by the U.S. \nSentencing Commission. If the Congress does not act, those changes will \ntake effect this November 1.\n  According to the Department of Justice, which has also asked us to \nblock implementation of the changes, the new penalty structure will \nmake base sentences for crack anywhere from two to six times shorter \nthan they are now. The Department of Justice written to tell us that \nthey ``strongly support S. 1254'' which is ``very similar to our \nproposal.\n  That is simply irresponsible public policy. It would send a terrible \nmessage both to crack dealers and to communities trying to fight back \nagainst the crack trade.\n  No one, not even the Sentencing Commission, denies that the brunt of \ncrack's social consequences have fallen on poor, urban, minority, \nresidents. Given what crack has done to our cities, it frankly amazes \nme to hear people arguing for lower sentences. Especially from people \nwho wouldn't for one moment tolerate an open-air crack market in their \nneighborhood in Scarsdale or Chevy Chase.\n  The Commission's own report, moreover, acknowledges that crack's \npsychoactive effects are far more intense than powder cocaine, which \nmeans that crack is far more additive.\n  Members of the Sentencing Commission are concerned that the current \nsentencing structure creates a perception of unfairness because most \nconvicted crack dealers are Africans-Americans, whereas a majority of \nconvicted powder dealers are white or Hispanic. I am sensitive to these \nconcerns. This Congress will deal severely and aggressively with any \nindication that prosecution or sentencing is being driven by racial \nconsiderations. We will not tolerate any racial discrimination in our \ncriminal justice system.\n  But Mr. President, it is also important to remember that the number \nof people convicted for crack violations each year is just 3,430. I am \nmore concerned, to be blunt, about the millions of people living in our \ncities whose quality of life is being ruined. These people have equal \nrights to safe neighborhoods.\n\n  To those who say the Federal Government is locking up tens of \nthousands of nonviolent, low-level offenders, let me say this: We \nstudied that question. What we found was that out of the 3,430 crack \ndefendants convicted in 1994, the number of youthful, small-time crack \noffenders with no prior criminal history and no weapons involvement, \nsentenced in Federal courts, was just 51. The median crack defendant \nwas convicted of trafficking 109 grams--more than 2,000 ``rocks'' or \ndoses. Only 10 percent of crack defendants had trafficked less than 2-3 \ngrams of crack--the equivalent of 40-60 doses.\n  And finally, on Tuesday, September 12, HHS released alarming figures \nshowing drug use up sharply among our young people. Mr. President, this \nis not the time to be sending the message that we are weakening social \nsanctions against the drug trade.\n  One additional point. The amendment would also block another set of \nproposed changes--relating to money laundering--offered by the \nSentencing Commission. Here too, the Commission's amendments would \ndramatically lower the penalties for many money \n\n[[Page S 14782]]\nlaundering offenders, including those engaged in the laundering of \nproceeds of both financial and drug offenses.\n  Under the current guidelines, for instance, an offender who launders \n$110,000 worth of proceeds would face a range of 37-46 months. Under \nthe Commission's proposed changes, the guideline range would be just \n21-27 months in prison. An offender who laundered $110,000 worth of \nillegal drug proceeds would receive a sentence of 51-63 months under \nthe current guidelines. The Commission's amendments would change that \nto 33-41 months.\n  The money laundering guidelines need to be reviewed, but the changes \nrecommended by the Commission are simply too sweeping. As with the \namendments to lower crack sentences, the Department of Justice has \nurged us to reject the money laundering proposal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The \n     recommendations shall reflect the following considerations--\n       (A) the sentence imposed for trafficking in a quantity of \n     crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed \n     for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine;\n       (B) high-level wholesale cocaine traffickers, organizers, \n     and leaders, of criminal activities should generally receive \n     longer sentences than low-level retail cocaine traffickers \n     and those who played a minor or minimal role in such criminal \n     activity;\n       (C) if the Government establishes that a defendant who \n     traffics in powder cocaine has knowledge that such cocaine \n     will be converted into crack cocaine prior to its \n     distribution to individual users, the defendant should be \n     treated at sentencing as though the defendant had trafficked \n     in crack cocaine; and\n       (D) an enhanced sentence should generally be imposed on a \n     defendant who, in the course of an offense described in this \n     subsection--\n       (i) murders or causes serious bodily injury to an \n     individual;\n       (ii) uses a dangerous weapon;\n       (iii) uses or possesses a firearm;\n       (iv) involves a juvenile or a woman who the defendant knows \n     or should know to be pregnant;\n       (v) engages in a continuing criminal enterprise or commits \n     other criminal offenses in order to facilitate his drug \n     trafficking activities;\n       (vi) knows, or should know, that he is involving an \n     unusually vulnerable person;\n       (vii) restrains a victim;\n       (viii) traffics in cocaine within 500 feet of a school;\n       (ix) obstructs justice;\n       (x) has a significant prior criminal record; or\n       (xi) is an organizer or leader of drug trafficking \n     activities involving five or more persons.\n       (2) Ratio.--The recommendations described in the preceding \n     subsection shall propose revision of the drug quantity ratio \n     of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant \n     statutes and guidelines in a manner consistent with the \n     ratios set for other drugs and consistent with the objectives \n     set forth in section 3553(a) of title 28 United States Code.\n       (b) Study.--No later than May 1, 1996, the Department of \n     Justice shall submit to the Judiciary Committees of the \n     Senate and House of Representatives a report on the charging \n     and plea practices of Federal prosecutors with respect to the \n     offense of money laundering. Such study shall include an \n     account of the steps taken or to be taken by the Justice \n     Department to ensure consistency and appropriateness in the \n     use of the money laundering statute. The Sentencing \n     Commission shall submit to the Judiciary Committees comments \n     on the study prepared by the Department of Justice.\n\n  Mr. COATS.

As the Members are aware, the \nConference Committee on the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n1996 recently reduced the NRO appropriation in an amount equal to the \nexcess funds accumulated in the carry-forward accounts. The amendment \nensures that the cut in Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations for NRO is also \nreflected in the authorization. The second amendment is designed to \nprospectively address the NRO carry-forward accounts and financial \nmanagement generally by imposing a statutory cap of 1 month on carry-\nforward accounts (in line with DOD general policy); requiring a joint \nreview by the Inspectors General for CIA and DOD of NRO's financial \nmanagement to evaluate the effectiveness of policies and internal \ncontrols over the NRO budget; and requiring the President to report no \nlater than January 30, 1996 on a proposal to subject the budget of the \nintelligence community to greater executive branch oversight, including \nthe possibility of a statutory financial control officer and greater \nOMB review of the NRO budget. The President shall also report on the \nimpact, if any, on national security brought about by reduction in the \ncarry forward accounts at NRO.\n  These amendments addresses an issue that the committee first \nidentified in 1992 but which has received a good deal of press \nattention in the past several days and has raised questions about the \nNational Reconnaissance Office's financial management practices. It has \nbeen alleged that the NRO has accumulated more than $1 billion in \nunspent funds without informing the Pentagon, CIA, or Congress. It has \nbeen further alleged that this is one more example of how intelligence \nagencies sometimes use their secret status to avoid accountability. \nThese are serious charges which the committee has been looking into, \nmost recently with a closed hearing on Wednesday, September 27, at \nwhich we questioned Mr. George Tenet and Mr. Keith Hall from the Office \nof the Director of Central Intelligence, and Mr. Jeff Harris and Mr. \nJimmie Hill, the Director and Deputy Director of the NRO.\n  As I have noted, the Intelligence Committee first identified this \nissue in 1992 when it determined that NRO had accumulated an unusually \nlarge sum of \n\n[[Page S 14786]]\nfunds in some of its forward-funding accounts. Some forward funding, \ngenerally up to 1 month, is normal for NRO research and development \naccounts to cover unforseen overruns on contracts and bridge any gaps \nin fiscal year funding that may result from a delay in appropriations. \nNRO assured the Committee in 1992 that the excessive funds that had \naccumulated would be eliminated within 4 years. We now understand that \nthis obligation was not fulfilled. Hence, our amendment reduces the \nfunds in conformance with the appropriations bill.\n\n  Let me emphasize, however, that while public attention has focused on \none element of those practices--those that involve the carry-forward \naccounts in the National Reconnaissance Office, a broader inquiry is \nbeing undertaken by the Intelligence Committee and is reflected in the \nsecond amendment related to the NRO. It is important to determine if \nthe NRO's past financial management practices in this area have been as \ntight as they should have been. While the NRO sits in the Department of \nDefense, it is a critical element of the national intelligence \ncommunity. Thus, it is also essential that we gain an understanding of \nany management practices which need to be changed in order to \nstrengthen the role of the Director of Central Intelligence so that he \ncan manage more completely the intelligence community. These are some \nof the issues the Intelligence Committee will be examining in the \ncoming months as it reviews the intelligence community's role in the \npost-cold-war world and how that community should be restructured or \nrefocused to meet the challenges of this changed environment.\n  Mr. President, acknowledging that this is just one step in a broader \neffort to address legitimate public concerns about the NRO and the \nintelligence community as a whole, I urge adoption of these amendments.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2882\n\n (Purpose: To provide for improvements in the financial management of \n  the National Reconnaissance Office) At the appropriate place in the \n                bill, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 310.

Mr. President, I rise to express deep concerns regarding \nan example of financial mismanagement and waste within the intelligence \ncommunity. I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 1996 Intelligence \nAuthorization bill that has been accepted by the full Intelligence \nCommittee and by the Senate. This amendment is intended to put a stop \nto the rampant mismanagement of funding at the National Reconnaissance \nOffice.\n  Mr. President, there is a disturbing sense of deja vu as I stand here \non the floor today. One year ago, I was shocked to learn that the \nNational Reconnaissance Office was constructing a massive headquarters \nfacility out near Dulles Airport in Virginia. Not only did this \nfacility include floor space far in excess of what was necessary, but \nthe record showed a disturbing lack of candor in informing the \ncongressional oversight committees regarding the scope and expense of \nthis project.\n  Last week, the public was informed of another example of gross \nfinancial mismanagement by the NRO. As the papers reported, the NRO has \naccumulated more than $1.5 billion in unspent appropriations. In this \ntime of severe budgetary constraints, when we are cutting Medicare, \nMedicaid, veterans' benefits, student loan assistance, it is \ninexcusable that an agency can be hoarding well over a billion dollars.\n  My amendment includes a number of provisions to ensure this situation \nis resolved and does not occur again.\n  First, my amendment directs that the NRO may not carry over more than \n1 month in funds into a subsequent fiscal year.\n  Second, my amendment requires the Department of Defense and Central \nIntelligence Agency inspectors general to undertake a comprehensive NRO \nfinancial management review. This review will not only cover the issue \nof carry-forward funding, but will also examine the overall \neffectiveness of policies and internal controls over the NRO budget. \nThe amendment also requires that the IG report is unclassified, and can \nbe released to the public.\n  Finally, my amendment directs the President to report to the \nIntelligence Committees early next year on a proposal to subject the \nbudget of the intelligence community to greater executive branch \noversight. The report must include procedures to allow the Office of \nManagement and Budget to have full review of the NRO budget.\n  I recently received a call from Director of Central Intelligence Dr. \nJohn Deutch on this issue. I was pleased by Dr. Deutch's comments in \nwhich he agreed that stronger financial controls over the NRO are \nnecessary. Dr. Deutch also stated that he was not aware of the size of \nthis carry-forward account either in his previous position as Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, or in his current position.\n  It is unfortunate that this amendment is necessary. But these latest \nrevelations do great damage to the public's trust, and to the \ncredibility of the NRO and the Intelligence Community as a whole. The \nNRO seems to be an agency that is out of control, with no intention of \ncorrecting its ways. Hopefully, opening the NRO budget to increased \nscrutiny will help restore confidence in the ability of the NRO to \naccomplish its important mission.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  \n[[Page S 14787]]\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2883\n\n(Purpose: To enhance the capabilities of certain intelligence stations, \nand to extend the Central Intelligence Agency Voluntary Separation Pay \n                                  Act)\n\n       On page 11, strike lines 17 through 21 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 401.

ENHANCEMENT OF CAPABILITIES OF CERTAIN INTELLIGENCE \n                   STATIONS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--(1) In addition to funds otherwise \n     available for such purpose, the Secretary of the Army is \n     authorized to transfer or reprogram funds for the enhancement \n     of the capabilities of the Bad Aibling Station and the \n     Menwith Hill Station, including improvements of facility \n     infrastructure and quality of life programs at both \n     installations.\n       (2) The authority of paragraph (1) may be exercised \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law.\n       (b) Funding.--Funds available for the Army for operations \n     and maintenance for any fiscal year shall be available to \n     carry out subsection (a).\n       (c) Congressional Notification.--Whenever the Secretary of \n     the Army determines that an amount to be transferred or \n     reprogrammed under this section would cause the total amounts \n     transferred or reprogrammed in that fiscal year to exceed \n     $1,000,000, the Secretary shall notify in advance the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Armed Services, \n     and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on \n     National Security, and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives and provide a justification for the \n     increased expenditure.\n       (d) Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed to modify or obviate existing law or practice with \n     regard to the transfer or reprogramming of substantial sums \n     of money from the Department of the Army to the Bad Aibling \n     or Menwith Hill Stations.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment along with the \nvice chairman to address two issues that arose after the committee \nmarkup of this bill. The first provision of the amendment is intended \nto assist the Department of the Army as it assumes Executive Agent \nresponsibility for the Bad Aibling and Menwith Hill stations.\n  Specifically, this provision would permit the Department of the Army \nto use up to $2 million of appropriated O funds per annum, at Menwith \nHill and Bad Aibling, to rectify infrastructure and quality of life \nproblems. The amendment make clear that it would in no way obviate or \nmodify current law or practice with regard to reprogramming amounts in \nexcess of $2 million,\n  At the present time, the Army is prohibited by 31 U.S.C. section \n1301, from using appropriated funds to support an NSA installation, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the Army has become the Executive Agent \nfor these field sites. Although the Director of Central Intelligence \ncould use his special authorities under section 104(d) of the National \nSecurity Act of 1947, the procedures available under that law are \nextremely time consuming and were not intended to accommodate \nrelatively minor transfers of funds.\n  A good example of the problems that this amendment is intended to \nrectify is contained in a memorandum prepared by a joint NSA/Army \ninspection team entitled. ``DoD Child Development Program Inspection \nReport'' dated June 23, 1995. The memo, which describes the childcare \nfacility at Menwith Hill station states:\n\n       The Child Development Center (CDC), originally constructed \n     as a office building, is a 35 year old dilapidated structure \n     with major health and safety violations. The CDC capacity of \n     89 children cannot accommodate the increasing demands for \n     child care. The current station population includes 289 \n     children ages four and under. As a result of the conversion \n     from a civilian to a military facility, the demographics are \n     changing to younger, junior enlisted personnel with many \n     single parents who will rely on based-provided child care. \n     There are no similar facilities available on the economy . . \n     . Six major deficiencies, those that severely affect health, \n     safety, and the well-being of staff were identified in this \n     inspection. All five categories relating to health and safety \n     were in major violation.\n\n  Last fall, two members of the committee staff visited the Menwith \nHill Station and toured its Child Development Center. Their views are \nfully consistent with the findings described in this memo. The staff \ncan also attest to the fact that there are many other maintenance and \nqualify of life issues at these two facilities, particularly Menwith \nHill, that need to be urgently addressed.\n  My colleagues should understand that this legislation was requested \nby the Department of the Army and enjoys the full support of the \nDirector of the National Security Agency. It is also worth noting that \nthe Department of the Army has consulted with the Senate Appropriations \nand Armed Services Committees and encountered no objections.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Admiral McConnel \nrequesting this legislation, and the memorandum I quoted from earlier, \nbe included in the Record at this point.\n  The second provision in this amendment is designed to offset the \ndirect spending cost of the extension of the authority provided for in \nthe CIA Voluntary Separation Pay Act as provided in section 402 of our \nbill. Specifically, it establishes procedures to conform with the pay-\nas-you-go provision, section 252, of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act, by requiring the Director of Central Intelligence \nto remit to the Treasury an amount equal to 15 percent of the final \nbasic pay of each employee who, in fiscal year 1998 or fiscal year \n1999, retires voluntarily or who resigns and to whom a voluntary \nseparation incentive payment has been or is to be paid.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2884\n\n(Purpose: To require a description and analysis of voluntary separation \n incentive proposals in the report required by the legislation and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       On page 10, line 7, after ``(22 U.S.C. 4008),'' insert \n     ``and to provide for other personnel review systems,''.\n       On page 10, at the end of line 10 add the following new \n     sentence: ``The report shall also contain a description and \n     analysis of voluntary separation incentive proposals, \n     including a waiver of the two-percent penalty reduction for \n     early retirement.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on June 14, 1995, my distinguished \ncolleague and vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence \n[SSCI], Senator Kerrey, and I filed a bill which authorizes \nappropriations for fiscal year 1996 for the intelligence activities and \nprograms of the United States Government. The Select Committee on \nIntelligence approved the bill by a unanimous vote on May 24, 1995, and \nordered that it be favorably reported. The bill was subsequently \nreferred to the Senate Armed Services Committee [SASC] for up to 30 \ndays, as it has been every year. The Armed Services Committee reported \nthe bill at the end of the 30-day period, on August 4, 1995, with one \namendment.\n  This bill would: Authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for \nfirst, the intelligence activities and programs of the United States \nGovernment; second, the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and \nDisability System; and third, the Community Management Account of the \nDirector of Central Intelligence; authorize the personnel ceilings as \nof September 30, 1996, for the intelligence activities of the United \nStates and for the Community Management Account of the Director of \nCentral Intelligence; authorize the Director of Central Intelligence, \nwith Office of Management and Budget approval, to exceed the personnel \nceilings by up to 2 percent; permit the President to delay the \nimposition of sanctions related to proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction when necessary to protect an intelligence source or method \nor an ongoing criminal investigation; provide for forfeiture of the \nU.S. Government contribution to \n\n[[Page S 14788]]\nthe Thrift Savings Plan under the Federal Employees Retirement System \n[FERS], along with interest, if an employee is convicted of national \nsecurity offenses; restore spousal benefits to the spouse of an \nemployee so convicted if the spouse cooperates in the investigation and \nprosecution; allow employees of the excepted services to take an active \npart in certain local elections; amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to \npermit the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain consumer credit \nreports necessary to foreign counterintelligence investigations under \ncertain circumstances and subject to appropriate controls on the use of \nsuch reports; and make certain other changes of technical nature to \nexisting law governing intelligence agencies.\n  As it does annually, the committee conducted a detailed review of the \nadministration's budget request for the National Foreign Intelligence \nProgram [NFIP] for fiscal year 1996. The committee also reviewed the \nadministration's fiscal year 1996 request for a new intelligence budget \ncategory, called the Joint Military Intelligence Program [JMIP]. The \ncommittee's review included a series of briefings and hearings with the \nDirector of Central Intelligence [DCI], the Acting Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and other senior \nofficials from the Intelligence Community, numerous staff briefings, \nreview of budget justification materials and numerous written responses \nprovided by the Intelligence Community to specific questions posed by \nthe committee.\n  In addition to its annual review of the administration's budget \nrequest, the committee performs continuing oversight of various \nintelligence activities and programs, to include the conduct of audits \nand reviews by the committee's audit staff. These inquires frequently \nlead to actions initiated by the committee with respect to the budget \nof the activity or program concerned.\n  The Intelligence Committee's consideration of the authorization bill \nthis year coincides with a major review effort by this committee, its \nHouse counterpart, and a Presidential Commission mandated by Congress \nlast year. This review is aimed at examining how changes in the world, \nparticularly since the fall of the Soviet Union, should be reflected in \nthe roles and missions of the intelligence community. A major part of \nthis examination will include determining how the intelligence \ncommunity might better be organized to accomplish those changing roles \nand missions.\n  While this review by the committee in not likely to conclude until \nearly next year, one of the issues already emerging is the need for \nstronger, more coherent management of the intelligence community. The \nnominal head of the community, the DCI, must become the de facto head \nof the community--with the authority to make adjustments and trade-offs \nbetween its disparate elements. One example of a problem resulting, in \npart, from the lack of unified management is the disconnect between the \nvast amounts of intelligence we are now capable of collecting and our \ncapacity for analyzing and disseminating that intelligence in a way \nthat is useful for decisonmakers. We cannot afford to continue spending \nmoney in one area without ensuring that its objectives are not \nfrustrated by inadequate funding in another. Yet, it is difficult to \nstrike the necessary balance if you do not have the authority to move \nfunding from one area to another.\n  The same principle is at work in congressional oversight, where a \ncomprehensive and coherent review of intelligence programs is \nessential. When the SSCI was established in 1976, the Senate, in Senate \nResolution 400, chose to give the committee jurisdiction over all \nintelligence activities, including those of the Department of Defense. \n``Intelligence activities'' are defined very broadly in the charter \nlegislation, but expressly exclude ``tactical foreign military \nintelligence serving no national policymaking function.'' Over the \nyears, this has been interpreted to mean that programs and activities \nfunded in the [TIARA]--which stands for tactical intelligence and \nrelated activities--budget category have been authorized by the Armed \nServices Committee in the Defense authorization bill, with the SSCI \nproviding recommendations in a letter to the SASC. All activities \nfunded in the NFIP, or National Foreign Intelligence Program, have been \nauthorized by the Intelligence Committee in the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act, which is automatically referred sequentially to the \nArmed Services Committee before going to the floor.\n\n  Traditionally, this breakdown between the strictly tactical \nactivities supporting the battlefield commander--which are logically \nsubject to Armed Services oversight--and activities serving some \nbroader national policymaking function--over which integrated oversight \nby the Intelligence Committee is essential--has worked well and our two \ncommittees have cooperated very closely. Today, however, I believe both \ncommittees recognizes that it is increasingly difficult to classify \nintelligence systems as either strictly national or strictly tactical. \nThe same images of Bosnia taken by aerial reconnaissance can be used \nsimultaneously by Admiral Smith to protect our pilots, by Assistant \nSecretary of State Holbrooke to show his interlocutors the true \nsituation on the ground, and by the President's National Security \nAdvisor to determine if a change in policy is indicated. U-2 \nphotography of Iraq helps the commanders of our joint task forces \nenforce the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq. Ambassador \nMadeleine Albright uses the same images to great effect in convincing \nother countries on the United Nations Security Council to keep in force \nthe sanctions against Iraq.\n  Budget politics has also contributed to the blurring of the two \nbudget categories. Over the last 5 years the executive branch has moved \nprograms from the national portion of the budget into the tactical, at \nleast in part to get out from under a perceived spending ``ceiling'' on \nthe national budget. When the administration created the new JMIP \nbudget category this year, a number of these formerly NFIP programs \nwere included.\n  The committees acknowledge that a number of the programs in this new \nbudget category serve important national policymaking functions and \npreviously have been authorized by this committee--programs like the U-\n2 spyplane and unmanned aerial vehicles such as those that have \nprovided important intelligence on Bosnia to the decisionmakers at \nState and in the White House. However, this new budget category also \ncontains some programs that are tactical in nature and would normally \nhave been within the sole jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n  When considering how to approach this new budget category for fiscal \nyear 1996, the Intelligence Committee turned to Senate Resolution 400. \nWe determined that the national policymaking-related activities in JMIP \nmeant that it did not fit that statue's definition for items excluded \nfrom committee jurisdiction. Thus, the SSCI used the expertise \ndeveloped from day-to-day oversight of all intelligence activities to \nformulate authorization recommendations for all of the activities in \nthis program. When the SASC received our bill on sequential, as it \nroutinely does, that committee disagreed with our assertion of \nauthorization jurisdiction.\n  The Armed Services Committee took the position that the Intelligence \nCommittee had no oversight interest in the JMIP programs and voted to \noffer an amendment to the Intelligence authorization bill to strip it \nof all JMIP authorization.\n  After extensive discussion, we have arrived at a compromise that will \nallow the Intelligence authorization bill to move forward, recognize \nthe national interest served by the oversight of each of the \ncommittees--SSCI and SASC--and set up a mechanism for addressing these \nissues in the coming year. In order to resolve the disagreement for \nthis year and bring this bill before the Senate in a timely fashion, we \nhave agreed that the Armed Services Committee will authorize and \nconference JMIP for fiscal year 1996. The Intelligence Committee has \nprovided its JMIP recommendations to the Armed Services Committee, and \nI think the two committees concur on the details of almost every JMIP \nactivity for this year.\n\n[[Page S 14789]]\n\n  At the same time, the chairmen and ranking members of the two \ncommittees agree that this action does not reflect a determination that \nSenate Resolution 400 does not provide authorizing jurisdiction for the \nIntelligence Committee over JMIP. It is, rather, a compromise to allow \nthis bill, this year, to go to the floor.\n  Left unresolved, then, it how the Senate should conduct oversight and \nauthorization of the Intelligence Community in today's changing world. \nAs I have previously noted, there have been significant changes over \nthe years that have been reflected in the way intelligence activities \nare budgeted. In the coming years, we see even greater change. Our \ncommittee, the House Intelligence Committee, and the Brown Commission \non Intelligence Roles and Capabilities, are examining what changes \nshould be made in the intelligence community in the post-cold-war \nworld. Together, these efforts comprise the greatest opportunity to \nimprove U.S. intelligence since 1947. Budget categories, and many other \nfamiliar features of today's intelligence landscape, are likely to \nchange still further. To make sure that the Senate's authorization \nprocess appropriately reflects the changes that have already occurred \nand that may be coming, Senator Kerrey and I, together with Chairman \nThurmond and Senator Nunn, have directed our staffs to form a working \ngroup to recommend to the two committees how authorization \nresponsibilities should apply to specific categories or activities.\n  Mr. President, we will be prepared for the future, and I think the \nSenate and the country will be the beneficiaries of our collaboration. \nI am most grateful for the vast knowledge and the attitude of \nconstructive cooperation which the President pro tempore and Senator \nNunn brought to this problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to describe a bill which has not \nattracted much attention this year, the intelligence authorization bill \nfor fiscal year 1996. This year the intelligence bill is not the venue \nfor controversies over the foreign policy issues or levels of national \nsecurity spending, but it is an important piece of legislation \nnonetheless.\n  Much has been written about the Presidential Commission and \ncongressional and private sector studies underway to redefine and \nreorganize the intelligence community. Few have noted that no matter \nwhat the outcome of all this discussion, the actual intelligence \ncommunity, with its real and serious continuing requirements to keep \nour leaders informed and our military warned, must be budgeted and \nguided to do its job.\n  This bill provides the budget authorization and the priorities our \nintelligence professionals need for the year ahead.\n  The bill attempts to fix the imbalance between collection, which we \nhave a great deal of, and processing, where we see shortfalls.\n  The bill supports efforts to track the transnational targets, threats \nlike terrorism, weapons proliferation, and narcotrafficking, which are \ndirected against us from many countries.\n  The bill acknowledges the indispensable role of intelligence in \nmonitoring the arms control treaties we entered into, and it funds the \nsystems which provide that intelligence.\n  The bill supports innovative technologies and the leveraging of \nprivate sector achievements and market requirements for the benefit of \nintelligence.\n  The bill supports research and development for the agencies whose \nmission depends on technology, and it addresses the growing imbalance \nbetween rising personnel costs and the shrinking availability of \nresearch funds.\n  The intelligence authorization bill also closes some of the remaining \nloopholes noted in the aftermath of the Ames case. The Intelligence \nCommittee wants to make sure Americans who commit espionage forfeit all \nthe financial gains from their espionage and from their pretense of \nbeing loyal American officials. Consequently the bill would require \nforfeiture of a convicted spy's Thrift Savings Account, if the spy were \na civil servant. The bill also provides for the innocent spouse of a \nconvicted spy to keep some of his or her assets, provided he or she \ncooperates with the authorities regarding the espionage case. Access to \npersonal financial data was a problem in the Ames case, so the bill \nwould permit FBI to have access to consumer credit reports on a \nsuspected spy earlier in the investigative process.\n  CIA has been criticized for retaining Ames in the clandestine service \nlong after his mediocrity was apparent. Although the great majority of \nintelligence personnel I meet are clearly talented people making a \ncontribution to their country, the intelligence community's retention \nof the few people whose performance would get them fired in the private \nsector is a problem we need to fix. Consequently the bill asks the \nDirector of Central Intelligence to implement an up-or-out policy \nacross the intelligence community, similar to the policies of the State \nDepartment and the military. Such a provision would be one of the few \npositive outcomes of the Ames case. Not only would it strengthen \npersonnel quality, it would also help the intelligence agencies manage \ntheir retention and overstrength problems.\n  The bill supports counterintelligence programs because America has \nsecrets worth protecting, and those secrets are threatened by foreign \nintelligence services and Americans who would sell those secrets to \nthem. As former DCI Woolsey explained to the committee in our first \nhearing of this Congress, no one can guarantee that Ames was the last \nof his breed. Given human nature and the size of the intelligence \ncommunity, it is likely we will see more espionage cases. We don't need \nwitch hunts. We do need vigilance and deterrence.\n  Many people presumed that the end of the cold war meant the end of \nspying and secrecy, and the Ames case led them to ask why the material \nbeing protected mattered any more. Of course, the costs of Ames' \ntreachery in human lives alone is enough to justify his sentence. A \nlife sentence for what he did is merciful, in my view. But there are \nadditional reasons why our secrets are important, and must be \nprotected.\n  Simply put, our ability to monitor and predict threats to this \ncountry is essential to saving the lives of Americans. Whether \nintelligence brings the warning of a strategic attack or accidental \nmissile launch, or an impending terrorist attack, or the decision of \nsome foreign leader to develop a clandestine program of biological \nweapons, our national lives and our individual lives hinge, in part, on \nthe capabilities of the intelligence community. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the intelligence authorization bill.\n  We buy many expensive things in the name of national security which \nare never used in combat. We buy some things the Pentagon doesn't even \nwant. Their defenders justify them with theories. The contributions of \nintelligence are not theoretical. I can take any Member to CIA or the \nNSA or the NRO or over to the Joint Intelligence Center at the Pentagon \nand demonstrate how intelligence is being used today to inform and \nsupport U.S. policy and U.S. military operations.\n  We read in the September 27 Washington Post how crucial intelligence \nis to NATO operations over Bosnia, and how the intelligence is getting \nto the warfighter so much faster than in the gulf war. The gulf war \nitself was a triumph of dominant battlefield awareness, to use the \ncurrent catchphrase. General Schwartzkopf knew vastly more about the \nenemy and the situation than the Iraqis did about us, and we all saw on \ntelevision the fruits of that superior intelligence. With these events \nso fresh on our consciousness it is easy to forget that as essential as \nit is to support the military with intelligence, the priority customer \nfor intelligence in peacetime must be the President and the \npolicymakers around him.\n  Who, more than the President, needs a clear understanding of our \nvulnerabilities and our opportunities? With the best intelligence, the \nPresident can shape a policy that addresses the weaknesses of our \nadversaries and the requirements of our allies. Intelligence is the key \nto effective policy, and effective policy ought to achieve its goal, \nmost of the time, without the need to employ our Armed Forces in \ncombat. In my view, preventing the war, getting what we want without \nthe war, is far better than having the war. \n\n[[Page S 14790]]\nYou can't do that without dominant knowledge.\n  Once the President has formed the policy, intelligence can also help \nin its execution. To keep the U.N. Security Council solid in keeping \nsanctions against Iraq, Ambassador Albright last year showed U-2 \nphotographs of Saddam Hussein's new palaces and continuing weapons \nprograms to ten of her foreign colleagues on the Security Council. \nSimilar images of the killing fields of Bosnia are pinpointing the \natrocities there and will be useful as evidence in war crimes trials. \nUnited States showed the world North Korea's true purposes at the \nnuclear facility at Yong Byon.\n  As these and many other daily cases show, intelligence is a national \nasset. It plays a national role every day, whether or not our military \nis engaged somewhere. There used to be a clear distinction between \nnational and tactical intelligence, but the line is blurred today. \nIncreasingly, the same agencies and collection systems that produce \nintelligence for the national policymaker also support the military, \neven at the tactical level. The same U-2 mission can bring back \ninformation on a Bosnian Serb air defense mission, intelligence for the \nlocal NATO, and simultaneously take pictures of refugee flows or mass \ngraves that our policymakers and diplomats can use in their negotiating \nefforts. This growing dual capability of intelligence is often \noverlooked by those who associate intelligence exclusively with \nmilitary operations.\n  The annual authorization process is a time to ask how our \nintelligence efforts can maximize their contribution to the nation. \nThere are new directions I believe intelligence must take.\n  First, intelligence must get closer to its customers. The age of \nivory-tower analysis is over. Intelligence managers have been much more \nresponsive to customers in recent years, but more must be done. I would \neven consider physically moving teams of analysts right into the \ncustomers' offices. The intelligence community must also make maximum \nuse of computer-based interactive communication with its customers. The \nanalysts need to get into the customers' heads, so to speak. The \nchallenge is to do so without taking on the policy biases of the \ncustomer, because the intelligence must not only be useful and \nresponsive to the customer, it must also be absolutely honest. When the \nPresident's policy isn't working, or the efforts of the customer's \norganization are backfiring, the analyst must tell it like it is. Not \nall the bravery in national security takes place on the battlefield.\n\n  Second, intelligence should be predictive, even risking that its \npredictions could occasionally be wrong. It should look to the margins \nof likely future events and trends and analyze the less likely events \nwhich would most endanger U.S. interests. As the devaluation of the \nMexican peso demonstrated, the less likely events nonetheless sometimes \nhappen, and they can have a deep impact on Americans.\n  Third, intelligence must adapt to a world which has not only seen the \nend of Communism, but which is best suited for small, fast-moving, \nentrepreneurial organizations, a world which puts its greatest premium \non knowledge, and a world in which the market, not the government, \ndrives the improvement of technology. This new world brings Director \nDeutch many new tasks. He must develop his human collectors, planning \nten or more years in advance for their peak usefulness, in the same way \nwe acquire satellites. He must modify the personnel management culture \nthat periodically moves people for its own internal bureaucratic \npurposes. Similarly, the managers of military intelligence personnel \nmust find a place in their services for the handful of military \npersonnel who have mastered foreign languages and cultures. We cannot \nhave a first class HUMINT service without nurturing the people who \nserve in it, both civilian and military.\n  The explosion of commercial technology presents big potential \nadvantages to the intelligence community, and it fundamentally \nchallenges traditional methods of procurement. The traditional way to \nprocure intelligence technology is for the government to pay for the \nresearch, development, and testing, as well as for the finished \nproduct. Consequently, the collection systems and processing and \ndissemination equipment for the Intelligence community cost the \nGovernment a lot of money. The unit cost is also high because the \nintelligence community buys relatively few of the finished items.\n  The Government tends to buy hundreds of something unique and pays \nmillions for each one. The commercial world buys millions of something \nbroadly available and pays hundreds for each one. The challenge is to \nfind commercial applications for intelligence equipment, and thus \nreduce the government's acquisition cost. The Intelligence Committee \nhas supported this approach for several years, starting with permitting \nU.S. Companies to offer one-meter space imagery and imaging systems to \nthe commercial market. Another trailblazing effort is ongoing at David \nSarnoff Laboratories in Princeton, NJ, where researchers have created \nimage analysis equipment which simultaneously answers the needs of \nintelligence analysts looking for evidence of weapons on the ground and \nthe needs of radiologists looking for evidence of tumors in mammograms. \nIn both uses, this equipment saves lives. It also provides a model for \nthe intelligence community on how to procure the latest equipment more \ncheaply.\n  I have spoken about how our intelligence capability should adapt \nitself to the world of today. Under the leadership of one of the most \ncapable executives and scientists in the country, this adaptation will \nproceed swiftly. I only wish the authority of the DCI over other \nagencies were stronger, so they could get the benefit of strong, \ncentralized leadership. That is an issue for another day. My point \ntoday is the central, day-to-day importance of intelligence. The lives \nof individuals and at times our national life depends on its \nexcellence, it is an essential function of government, and we are not \nabout to block grant it to the states. That is why the intelligence \nauthorization bill is an important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee and the \nIntelligence Committee have worked closely together over the past \nnineteen years, and that cooperation is going to grow even closer in \nthe years ahead. The Armed Services Committee greatly appreciates the \nadvice of the Intelligence Committee regarding tactical intelligence \nprograms.\n  I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee \nthat the creation of the JMIP budget category is a sign of the times. \nAll the programs in JMIP have been previously found in the tactical \ncategory, but several were recently in the national category and others \nhave clear national, as well as tactical, application. In fact, there \nare very few intelligence activities today that do not have potential \nbenefit for both the policymaker and the tactical military commander. \nFor that reason, the Intelligence Committee sought to have a formal \nrole in authorizing and overseeing JMIP.\n  I believe that the Committee on Armed Services should be the \ncommittee of jurisdiction for JMIP for fiscal year 1996. The Armed \nServices Committee benefited this year from the Intelligence \nCommittee's work on JMIP, and in almost every case we agreed with the \nIntelligence Committee. Our close working relationship has resulted in \ngeneral agreement on the JMIP issues and an efficient allocation of the \nwork to be done.\n  However, I also agree that this decision to allow JMIP to be \nauthorized in the Defense Authorization bill rather than the \nIntelligence Authorization bill this year does not reflect a judgment \non the scope of authority provided to the Intelligence Committee by \nSenate Resolution 400.\n  There is great change on the horizon for intelligence. Major \nreorganization may occur next year, and our legislative process must \nkeep pace with it. My colleagues on the Committee on Armed Services and \nI look forward to working with the Intelligence Committee to determine \nthe best way for the Senate to authorize and oversee the JMIP next \nyear, as well as any new categories of intelligence programs that may \ncome out of the newly reorganized intelligence community.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \n\n[[Page S 14791]]\n  from Nebraska for their cooperation, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to endorse the views of my Chairman \nand Chairman Thurmond. Continued close collaboration between the \nIntelligence Committee and the Armed Service Committee can only result \nin the best possible intelligence for the military, together with \ngreater efficiency.\n  Although the two committees disagree on this jurisdictional issue, in \nfact the cooperative process worked quite well this year on JMIP. The \nIntelligence Committee studied the individual JMIP programs in the \ncontext of all intelligence activities and the Armed Services Committee \nlooked at them in terms of the military's requirements. On the \nsubstance, the two committees are, as usual, in broad agreement. We \ndisagree on one program. I think the merits of that argument are on the \nside of the Intelligence Committee, but I agree that the Armed Services \nCommittee should have the last word on authorizing programs whose \nnormal function is support to tactical operations.\n  We have worked out a good solution for this year on JMIP, Next year's \npossible reorganization of the Intelligence Community could produce a \nwhole new aggregation of intelligence programs. So I look forward to \njoining in a working group with the Armed Services Committee to \ndetermine how the Senate should authorize and oversee these programs so \nthe needs of the policymaker and the tactical commander are fully \naddressed in the coming years. The Intelligence Committee has great \nexperience and expertise in monitoring all the country's intelligence \nactivities, and we offer them freely to the Senate without concern for \nturf or pride of authorship.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania was quite right when he said that the \ncreation of this new joint military budget account was a sign of the \ntimes. The old accounting categories are becoming blurred by the \nversatility of intelligence systems today. The creation of JMIP put a \nstrain on the relationship between the two committees, but I think we \nhave fixed it for this year in a satisfactory way. Next year may bring \nadditional change, and we are creating an inter-committee working group \nto determine how we adapt our procedures to the changed circumstances. \nI understand, and I believe my Intelligence Committee colleagues \nunderstand, that each committee has a distinct and complementary role \nin authorizing these programs. We will do a far better job working \ntogether than separately.\n  Let me explain the Armed Services Committee's concerns about these \nprograms. There have been occasions in the past when the Intelligence \nCommittee and the Armed Services Committee disagreed about systems to \nsupport the military which we and the military thought were extremely \nimportant. One of these was Joint STARS, a program that made a great \ncontribution during the gulf war and is now a mainstay of tactical \nintelligence. We had sole authorization over the budget category of \nwhich Joint STARS had a part. If our Committee had not supported it \nstrongly, our military, might not have this system today. So we take \nour responsibilities regarding intelligence support to the military \nvery seriously. The chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee are no less serious, and we have six crossover Members to \ninsure that our common efforts keep on track. I am, therefore, \nconfident that our close relation will continue, to the country's \nbenefit.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, while I believe this bill is the best that \ncan be achieved during this period of tight budgets and a changing \nworld, there is one part of it that makes me uneasy. All of us were \npresented earlier this week with media stories that the National \nReconnaissance Office once again has secretly kept large sums of money \nstashed away. Supposedly, DOD, CIA, and the Congress didn't know \nanything about $1 billion that had been ``hoarded'' away in carry-\nforward accounts.\n  The committee has already held a hearing on this subject. Based on \nthe information presented and on the tough questions asked by committee \nmembers, several things are quite clear.\n  One, this is not a secret ``slush'' fund that no one knew anything \nabout. In fact, these were funds maintained in accordance with the \nappropriate DOD manual. Moreover, DOD has known about the account since \nat least 1989 when the DOD Inspector General audited the NRO and agreed \nwith the NRO's proposal on the size and method of accounting for these \nfunds.\n  Second, the Committee has been overseeing and not overlooking the \nNRO's budget. We are all very much aware of the debate about the NRO in \nwhich the previous Director of Central Intelligence and the Congress \nwere engaged. I say we are aware of it because even though the NRO's \nactivities are highly classified--and they should be for good reasons--\nthe news media carried the stories about the intensity of the debate \nbetween the Committee and the DIC. That debate has ended because we \nhave a new DCI, and the Committee is moving ahead with its close \nscrutiny of the NRO.\n  Third, the manager's amendment to the bill conforms our authorization \nlevel for the NRO's carry-forward accounts to the amount of the \nreductions in these accounts legislated by the Defense appropriations \nconference bill. The committee has done this so we can move ahead to a \nconference with our House counterparts. But, Mr. President, I want \neveryone to understand the implications of what is happening here.\n  In the opinion of the Director of the Intelligence Community \nManagement Staff, the cuts being taken against these accounts could \nhave far-reaching effects on the country's ability to collect extremely \nvaluable information involving our most vital interests. The National \nReconnaissance Office collects sensitive information better than anyone \nelse, anywhere else in the world. Let me repeat that: no one, \nanywhere--the Russians, the French, the Germans, the Japanese, even \nDOD--is better at this business than the NRO.\n  If any of my colleagues believes I may be exaggerating about the \nimportance and usefulness of this information, let me make a standing \ninvitation to those of my colleagues who might have doubts. You can \npick any day of any week, and we will go together to find out what the \nNRO has collected, and is collecting on that day. I can guarantee you, \nyou will walk away from the experience with a far better appreciation \nof just how good our satellite systems are, and with a better \nunderstanding that the NRO's contributions are vital to our military \nand foreign policy successes.\n  This year, when the NRO presented its Future Years Defense Plan to \nthe Congress, it gave us a very aggressive plan. It provides for big \nsavings by consolidating operations. It restructures our satellite \nconstellations, moving them away from a Cold War focus and instead \ndirecting them against future problems. In order to execute that plan, \nthe NRO says it needs all of the money contained in its request. The \nsize of the cut contained in the Defense appropriations conference bill \nand mirrored in the manager's amendment offered with the Intelligence \nAuthorization Bill probably means the plan cannot be executed unless \nthe money is restored. So I just want my colleagues to know that if the \nNRO is correct, next year important satellite programs will be cut and \nothers will be pushed far out into the future if a substantial amount \nof this money is not restored.\n  It is very difficult to discuss--in an unclassified statement on the \nfloor of the Senate--the enormous problem this cut could create. I \ncould tell my colleagues that as result of these cuts, when they, or \ntheir successors, get a classified briefing in S-407 five years from \nnow, there may not be any satellite images available to help explain \nthe situation. But I don't know for certain if this is true. \nNevertheless, I want to alert my colleagues to the potential \nrepercussion this cut could have, if the money is not restored in \nsubsequent years of the NRO's Future Years Defense Plan.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the \nfiscal year 1996 intelligence authorization bill. Although most of the \nprograms authorized by this bill remain classified, there are a number \nof general points that are worth noting as the \n\n[[Page S 14792]]\nSenate considers this important legislation.\n  First, the time has long since passed when the intelligence budget \nescaped serious scrutiny within Congress or the executive branch. Let \nme briefly outline the current process:\n  Prior to its submission to Congress, the intelligence budget is \nreviewed by the DCI's Community Management Staff, the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense, and the Office of Management and Budget.\n  The intelligence budget is then reviewed by no less than six \ncongressional committees. It is available to all 535 members of \nCongress, and indeed, every year the Senate Intelligence Committee \nsends a written invitation to each member of the Senate inviting them \nto review the President's request and the committee's recommendations. \nTo the best of my knowledge, this degree of access is not available to \nmembers of the British or French Parliaments, the Israeli Knesset, or \nrepresentatives of the world's other great democracies. Every Senator \nhas the right to review the classified annex accompanying this bill \nprior to voting on it.\n  In addition to the scrutiny provided by the House and Senate \nIntelligence, Armed Services, and Appropriations Committees, GAO has \npersonnel who routinely audit a variety of intelligence programs.\n  The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board [PFIAB] also has \naccess to budget and operational information as does the \ncongressionally mandated Presidential Commission on Intelligence Roles \nand Missions.\n  The CIA has a statutory IG with broad powers to investigate \nprogrammatic issues as well as alleged improprieties.\n  In short, the intelligence community's black budget is subjected to \ncareful scrutiny each and every year.\n  Some may say, if that is all true, how could the NRO secretly hoard \nover $1 billion without Congress, DOD, or the DCI being aware of these \nfunds? The fact is that the DOD IG became aware of the NRO's policy \nwith regard to carry forward accounts in 1989. Further, in 1992 the \naudit staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee uncovered the NRO 3-\nmonth carry-forward policy and learned that this policy was a response \nto increased technical risks associated with launch problems that \ndeveloped in the mid-eighties. The committee was assured that the 3-\nmonth carry-forward policy would be reduced to a 1-month margin by \n1996. That did not occur in a timely fashion as promised, and the \nCongress has intervened to remedy the problem. So I would submit to my \ncolleagues that although the oversight process continues to evolve and \nimprove, it was that very process which brought the NRO carry-forward \naccounts to light.\n  I think we all need to be clear about the NRO issue. There is no \nevidence that funds were misspent or laws broken. Every dollar was duly \nauthorized and appropriated and every dollar that is taken out of the \nNRO's so-called carry forward accounts this year will need to be \nrestored in future budgets. The NRO was excessively conservative in its \nplanning and budgeting, which has not increased the overall acquisition \ncosts for satellites, but has reduced the funds available in the near \nterm for other important intelligence programs. That problem has been \nbrought to light and is being rectified.\n  Because there are a number of misperceptions about the NRO funding \nissue, as well as other aspects of the intelligence budget, I would \nlike to briefly comment on what we are authorizing in this bill and why \nit is still necessary, notwithstanding the end of the cold war, to \ndevote considerable resources to intelligence programs.\n  We are not buying a crystal ball that will bring future events \nclearly into focus. No matter how much we spend on intelligence, there \nwill never be a foolproof method for predicting the future of Bosnia, \nRussia, or the Middle East. There are no documents we can acquire, \nphotographs we can take, or sources we can recruit that will foretell \nthe future of these turbulent regions.\n  As my colleagues may know, the intelligence community was not able to \npredict the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait with certainty. It is quite \npossible that Saddam Hussein himself did not decide to proceed with the \ninvasion until the final hours--therefore no matter what access the \nUnited States had had in Baghdad the invasion of Kuwait could not have \nbeen confidently predicted in advance. What United States intelligence \ncould and did do, however, was provide substantial detail on the Iraqi \ntroop buildup along the Kuwaiti border in the weeks prior to the \ninvasion. Developing a policy in response to the buildup then became a \nmatter for the President and Congress. Then, after the invasion, the \nintelligence community provided General Schwarzkopf with the \ninformation needed to decisively defeat Iraq with a minimum of allied \ncasualties. That is the primary rationale for the programs authorized \nin this bill--to provide critical information to policymakers and if \ndiplomacy fails, to fight and prevail with a minimum of casualties.\n  As a member of both the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services \nCommittees, I am keenly aware of the vital linkage between intelligence \nprograms and military operations. Roughly 85 percent of the \nintelligence budget is executed by the military services or defense \ndepartment agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office [NRO], \nthe National Security Agency [NSA], and the Defense Intelligence Agency \n[DIA]. These agencies, which are designated Combat Support Agencies \npursuant to the Goldwater-Nichols Act, provide intelligence and warning \nin peacetime and direct combat support in wartime. The Defense \nDepartment is by far the Nation's leading consumer of intelligence \ninformation and most of the programs authorized by this bill have been \ndeveloped in response to military requirements. Many of the systems \nthat support the U.S. military, however, are also used on a daily basis \nto monitor arms control agreements, detect and track illegal narcotics, \nmonitor the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and monitor \nterrorist organizations. To a large extent, the intelligence produced \non these topics is a dividend made possible in peacetime by an \nintelligence system geared for the wartime requirements of the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  My colleagues should also appreciate the fact that the dependence of \nthe U.S. military on sophisticated intelligence systems is increasing. \nAs the U.S. military force structure shrinks, the Pentagon has \nconsciously decided to compensate for smaller numbers of men and \nequipment by placing increased reliance on sophisticated intelligence \nand communications systems. Precision guided munitions require precise \ntargeting information; smaller numbers of more advanced ships and \nplanes need to be allocated against the highest priority targets; and \nas the force structure shrinks each of our remaining military assets \nbecomes more valuable and its potential loss more costly to the \nmilitary. Further, in many of the politically sensitive conflicts \nunderway in the world today, an option that involves substantial, so-\ncalled collateral damage is not a politically viable option for the \nPresident. For all of these reasons, the Department of Defense needs \nand expects voluminous amounts of precise intelligence information to \nsupport military operations. In sum, intelligence is a force multiplier \nthat permits the U.S. military to do more with less.\n  In conclusion, all Senators should understand that the Armed Forces \nare the primary advocates for the programs in this bill, and the \noverwhelming majority of the funds this bill authorizes will be \nexecuted by the Department of Defense. I should also point out that the \nDCI has publicly stated that his top priority is support to the U.S. \nmilitary. As a former Deputy Secretary of Defense, he certainly \nunderstands the importance of this mission, and I know he is dedicated \nto providing the best support possible to our men and women in uniform.\n  The world we live in is turbulent and dangerous. The proliferation of \nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons concerns us all. Terrorism is \na continuing threat--one that could become far more dangerous in the \nfuture given the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Intelligence is \ncontributing to recent arrests that have severely damaged the Cali \ncartel. As the Ames case demonstrates, counterintelligence operations \nremain critical to U.S. national security. And without national \nintelligence systems, it would be difficult to enter into verifiable \narms control \n\n[[Page S 14793]]\nagreements. Yet, even if none of these requirements for intelligence \ncollection existed, the great majority of the spending in this bill \nwould still be necessary to support our men and women in uniform.\n  For all of these reasons, I believe that intelligence activities \nremain vital to U.S. national security and this legislation deserves \nthe support of every member of the Senate.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nfiscal year 1996 intelligence authorization bill.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, as well as the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, I have been involved in reviewing \nU.S. intelligence requirements and programs. While most of the programs \nauthorized by this legislation are classified, there is much that can \nbe said in general terms about the importance of this measure.\n  My colleagues should understand that although the end of the cold war \nhas lessened the threat to the United States, it has not reduced the \ndemands for information imposed on the Intelligence Community by its \nmany consumers. We live in an era described as the ``age of \ninformation,'' and that applies to the public sector no less than the \nprivate sector. In fact, the instability and turbulence unleashed by \nthe collapse of the Soviet empire has led to increased requests for \ninformation on a wide variety of new topics, countries, and conflicts.\n  For example, in recent years the U.S. has become involved in \nconflicts in Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia. In each case, the \nDefense Department has depended on the Intelligence Community for the \ninformation necessary to perform assigned military missions with a \nminimum of risk to U.S. personnel. These operations, including the \nongoing U.S. military involvement in Bosnia, should demonstrate beyond \nany doubt that the demise of the Soviet Union has not lead to reduced \nrequirements for intelligence information, either to support the U.S. \nmilitary, or to support civilian policymakers engaged in arms control, \ncounternarcotics, political or economic negotiations, monitoring \ninternational embargoes, or the routine conduct of foreign policy.\n  Ironically, our national security is becoming more dependent on \nintelligence collection, rather than less dependent, in the post cold \nwar era. This is primarily the result of a reduced military force \nstructure that is increasingly dependent on superior intelligence to \ncompensate for smaller numbers. For example, the U.S. Army has shrunk \nfrom 18 Active Duty Divisions in the mid-eighties to only 10 today. The \nU.S. Army is now the eighth largest in the world, and it is stretched \nthin at many points, as in South Korea, where 37,000 U.S. military \npersonnel and 500,000 South Korean soldiers are confronted by a North \nKorean Army that is twice as large.\n  The U.S. Navy and Air Force are engaged in similar reductions. The \nAir Force now has 20 active and reserve fighter wings, down from the 38 \nfighter wings available during the Reagan Administration. Similarly, \nthe Navy has long since abandoned the goal of a 600 ship fleet and is \nnow planning for a force some 30% smaller. With this reduced force \nstructure, the U.S. can still prevail, even against much larger \nadversaries fighting close to their own shores, but only if the U.S. \nmaintains superior personnel, weapons systems, and intelligence and \ncommunications capabilities. The public and my colleagues should be \naware that the overwhelming majority of the funds authorized in this \nbill directly support, and indeed are executed by, the Department of \nDefense. There is simply no way to make substantial, additional \nreductions in intelligence programs without harming U.S. military \nreadiness and capabilities.\n  In addition to the critical support that the Intelligence Community \nprovides the Department of Defense, there are numerous missions \nperformed by the Intelligence Community that are critical to the \nconduct of U.S. foreign policies. The Intelligence Community makes it \npossible to verify arms control agreements; it monitors the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction; it provides unique \ninformation regarding the intentions of foreign governments; it tracks \ninternational terrorism across the globe; and our intelligence \nagencies operate on a global basis to penetrate the international drug \ncartels. Many of these missions involve great difficulty and often \ndanger, but there is no substitute for the painstaking work the \nIntelligence Community quietly performs in many distant lands.\n\n  I believe that the contributions made by the Intelligence Community \nto the war on drugs merit special consideration and increased support. \nDuring the confirmation hearings for DCI John Deutch, I expressed my \nsentiments to the nominee and asked him to consider the evidence \npresented by William Bennett and John Walters in their article of \nFebruary 9, 1995, entitled, ``Why aren't we attacking the supply of \ndrugs?'' The article points out that after the Bush Administration \ndeployed U.S. military forces to help detect and interdict drug \nshipments in 1989, the price of cocaine increased by some 30% within a \nyear's time, and the number of hospital admissions for cocaine \noverdoses declined by a roughly similar amount. The DCI responded to my \nquestions on the counternarcotics issues by saying, ``And I must say, \nSenator, just so there is no misunderstanding, I agree with your point, \nthat here is a place that deserves more resources generally by the \nIntelligence Community, not less.''\n  After the nomination hearings, I wrote the DCI on this issue, and \nsupported increased expenditures for counternarcotics activities during \nthe committee's budget deliberations. I am pleased to say that the \nIntelligence Authorization bill contains additional funds for \ncounternarcotics programs that were not in the Administration's \nrequest. I am also delighted by the progress that has been made over \nthe last few months in apprehending the leaders of the Cali cartel. \nU.S. intelligence agencies have contributed to this success and \nalready, once again, the newspapers are reporting an increase in the \nstreet price of cocaine. The evidence again clearly suggests that \naggressive efforts to attack drug production and transportation can be \neffective. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to press for increased \ncounternarcotics efforts by the Defense Department and the Intelligence \nCommunity.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the far-reaching changes being \nimplemented within the Intelligence Community because too often the \npublic only hears the bad news. The Intelligence Community has \ntightened its belt in terms of both budget and personnel. Substantial \nchanges are being made in the way that the CIA operates overseas; in \nhiring and promotion practices, and in the way that the CIA interacts \nwith its oversight committees. This Intelligence Community is not \ntreading water--DCI John Deutch is implementing profound changes that \nwill increase efficiency, improve intelligence support to consumers, \nand rectify the problems recently brought to light in Guatemala and the \nAmes case. Further, although there was no illegality or impropriety \ninvolved, he is working to ensure that the National Reconnaissance \nOffice [NRO] is not overly conservative in estimating costs and risks, \nleading to excess funds in carry-forward accounts. We are most \nfortunate, in my view, to have a Director of Central Intelligence who \nis intimately familiar with military requirements for intelligence as \nwell as the many technical matters which are so critical to modern \nintelligence collection. I believe that Director Deutch and his team \nwill continue to aggressively implement the changes necessary to assure \naccountability and restore public confidence in the CIA.\n  In conclusion, I believe that the Intelligence Community is moving \nrapidly to keep pace with new missions and new technologies. I also \nbelieve that the programs authorized by this bill are vital to the \nsecurity of the United States and deserve the support of every Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a statement \nrecently made by the DCI addressing the future of the Intelligence \nCommunity, together with my correspondence with him and a relevant \nnewspaper article on counternarcotics issues, be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S 14794]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1995.\n     Hon. John M. Deutch,\n     Deputy Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense, The \n         Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Deutch: As you know, I am delighted that the \n     President has nominated you to be the next Director of \n     Central Intelligence. You bring a great deal of energy and \n     integrity to the position, as well as a nearly unique blend \n     of scientific and governmental experience. I look forward to \n     working with you on intelligence issues in the years ahead.\n       During the course of your confirmation hearings last week, \n     you may recall that I raised the issue of illegal narcotics \n     during both the open and closed sessions. Due to the format \n     of the hearings, however, and the limited amount of time \n     available, I do not feel as though I was able to obtain all \n     the information I sought. Due to the critical importance I \n     attach to this matter, I would therefore like to pursue this \n     issue somewhat further.\n       Specifically: Would you agree that the experience of the \n     early 1900's indicates that increased spending on \n     interdiction, eradication, and disruption of narcotics \n     organizations can substantially reduce drug use in this \n     country? The information in the article I entered into the \n     record during the open hearing, which I have attached, \n     suggests that we have not reached the point of diminishing \n     marginal returns with regard to intelligence and defense \n     programs intended to reduce the supply of illegal narcotics \n     in the United States. If confirmed, will you task the Crime \n     and Narcotics Center, or other appropriate office, to conduct \n     an assessment of this issue and make the results available to \n     the Committee prior to the August recess?\n       Does DoD have a threat assessment with regard to illegal \n     narcotics? Despite the rhetoric we often hear, it seems as \n     though drug smuggling is still treated primarily as an issue \n     for law enforcement rather than a national security matter. \n     As you know, threat assessments drive force structure and \n     planning within the Department of Defense. If there is a DoD \n     threat assessment that I am not aware of? I would appreciate \n     a copy of the report as well as any supporting documentation \n     which explains how the threat assessment has been converted \n     into programmatics. Again, if a threat assessment is not \n     available, I would like to ask that you task the DCI's Crime \n     and Narcotics Center, or the Department of Defense if \n     appropriate, to produce such an assessment prior to the \n     conferences on the Defense and Intelligence Authorization \n     bills this fall.\n       I know that you will face many challenges as the next \n     Director of Central Intelligence. There are many threats \n     facing our country in the uncertain world in which we live. \n     It is worth noting, however, that as horrific as terrorism \n     is, the number of Americans who die or suffer mental or \n     physical damage from illegal narcotics is far greater. I \n     believe that there is much more that can and should be done \n     to staunch the massive flow of illegal narcotics into the \n     United States.\n       I appreciate your consideration of this request. Again, I \n     look forward to working with you in the years ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     The Future of U.S. Intelligence--Charting a Course for Change\n\n           (By John Deutch, Director of Central Intelligence)\n\n       Thank you very much for that introduction.\n       There are two challenges facing the Intelligence Community \n     today:\n       First, we must be effective. We must deploy our \n     considerable resources against the most pressing security \n     threats of the post-Cold War era.\n       Second, we must be accountable. We must carry out our \n     intelligence operations in an efficient and responsible \n     manner. At the same time we must maintain an effective \n     espionage service.\n       When President Clinton asked me to be the Director of \n     Central Intelligence, he instructed me to make whatever \n     changes were necessary to assure that our nation has the best \n     intelligence service in the world and that we carry out our \n     duties with integrity.\n       Today I will outline five broad changes underway to make \n     the Intelligence Community--and the CIA in particular--more \n     effective and more accountable. They are not quick fixes. \n     They do not involve massive new legislation or \n     reorganization. These are measures that lay a foundation for \n     fundamental change in the way we do our business. They will \n     strengthen our intelligence capability, they will not tear it \n     down. There are many things that the Intelligence Community \n     does well. We intend to build on these strengths, but we are \n     determined to address the problems that have damaged the \n     reputation and diminished the effectiveness of the \n     Intelligence Community.\n       These changes are going to require a great deal of work on \n     the part of members of the Community and extensive \n     consultation with the policy makers and military commanders \n     who use our intelligence on a day-to-day basis. I look \n     forward to working with these changes with Members of \n     Congress and others who have the responsibility to review our \n     nation's intelligence programs.\n       I also want to public to understand what we are doing so \n     that they will have confidence that our intelligence \n     activities are carried out in a manner consistent with this \n     nation's interests and values. Accordingly, our process of \n     reform and change will be open for discussion.\n       Our success in strengthening the Intelligence Community is \n     of critical importance to all Americans. The nation faces a \n     multitude of challenges that will test our leadership and \n     influence in post-Cold War world: The proliferation of \n     chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons of mass \n     destruction; the activities of hostile countries like Iran, \n     Iraq, and North Korea; the growing threat of international \n     crime, terrorism and narcotics trafficking; and we must \n     maintain the economic security of our nation\n       We must also keep an eye on the larger, longer term \n     developments. Will an emergent China redraw the political and \n     economic landscape of Asia? Will Russia abandon its steps \n     toward democracy and return to authoritarian rule?\n       When President Clinton visited CIA in July he spoke to the \n     importance of intelligence in addressing these challenges and \n     these questions. President Clinton said: ``The intelligence I \n     receive informs just about every foreign policy decision we \n     make. It's easy to take it for granted. But we couldn't do \n     without it. Unique intelligence makes it less likely that our \n     forces will be sent into battle, less likely that American \n     lives will have to be put at risk. It gives us the chance to \n     prevent crises rather than forcing us to manage them.''\n\n\n                           1. customer focus\n\n       Customer focus is the first change I want to discuss.\n       Our primary mission in intelligence is to provide the \n     President and other senior leaders with the information they \n     need to make and implement foreign policy.\n       When the Intelligence Community focuses closely on what \n     intelligence customers need, when we make the policy makers \n     deadlines and requirements our own, we provide superb \n     support. That means getting the right information to the \n     right person at the right time--that goal hasn't changed. But \n     we are changing significantly the way we get the job \n     accomplished.\n       Interagency intelligence teams have been particularly \n     effective in providing critical, round-the-clock support, \n     from detailed maps of remote areas to human intelligence and \n     amazingly vivid pictures taken from space. For example, both \n     policy makers and military commanders give high marks to \n     Intelligence Community support to humanitarian and \n     peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia.\n       Permanent interdisciplinary centers that bring together \n     collectors and analysts from the CIA and other intelligence \n     agencies have also been the most successful approach to the \n     complex transnational issues of weapons proliferation, \n     terrorism, organized crime and narcotics trafficking.\n       Making sure that our information is the most thorough, most \n     objective available on a day-to-day basis requires discipline \n     on our part, and it requires close and continuous contact \n     with our intelligence customers.\n       Here I would note that giving policy makers the information \n     that they need is not the same as giving them the \n     intelligence judgments that they would like to see. If we \n     want our products to be used, we also have to maintain an \n     unassailable reputation for objectivity. Any effort to tailor \n     our analysis to policy would quickly destroy our credibility.\n       Closer contact with our customers begins, but does not end, \n     with the DCI. I am meeting more often with our key \n     intelligence consumers--at least once a week with the \n     Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the \n     National Security Advisor, and, at least monthly with the \n     Attorney General, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and those \n     officials involved with economic security and trade. And, of \n     course, I meet with the President and Vice President whenever \n     necessary.\n       This contact and awareness of consumer needs must extend to \n     all working levels of the Intelligence Community. \n     Accordingly, we are assigning more intelligence officers on \n     rotation to policymaking offices and to work on site with \n     military units.\n       At a time of tight budgets and a proliferation of \n     intelligence challenges, we cannot afford to collect for the \n     sake of collection or pursue every promising technology. \n     Guided by customer needs, the Intelligence Community must \n     exercise discipline in pursuing only those systems that offer \n     significant promise for meeting customer needs better and \n     more cheaply.\n       For example, we will not only buy expensive new satellites \n     unless there is a significant demand from our national \n     security customers. I have already taken several steps to \n     improve efficiency in the management of our satellite \n     systems.\n       Defense Secretary Bill Perry and I are putting into place a \n     new decisionmaking process--the new Joint Space Management \n     Board--to assure that both intelligence and military \n     satellite acquisition decisions are made efficiently and meet \n     user needs.\n       We are also moving toward consolidating the eight agencies \n     now involved in imagery \n\n[[Page S 14795]]\n     intelligence into a single National Imagery Agency, organized to serve \n     better the joint military commander in wartime and top policy \n     makers in peacetime. The new National Imagery Agency will put \n     together all aspects of collection, analysis, and \n     distribution of imagery. The goal will be to provide the \n     military commander near real time, all source intelligence \n     that will give our forces a unique ``dominant battlefield \n     awareness.''\n       Both these management initiatives will provide better \n     service to our customers and will save money.\n\n\n               2. human intelligence: assuring integrity\n\n       The second area I would like to discuss is major change in \n     the CIA's Directorate of Operations, or DO. The DO manages \n     our spies. Even in this day of highly sophisticated \n     satellites and technical collection systems, there are some \n     types of information that can only be collected by people.\n       Espionage is the core mission of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency. Despite set backs, we must continue to take risks \n     that result in the collection of information that is \n     available by no other means. If we do not take such risks \n     because we are afraid to fail or we are afraid of \n     controversy, then we will fail as an intelligence service in \n     protecting the national security interests of the United \n     States. Therefore we shall not slacken our efforts to recruit \n     informants in hostile governments, terrorist groups or drug \n     trafficking organizations.\n       Let me be clear, we will continue to need to work with \n     unsavory people. We will actively seek out any individual who \n     can provide important intelligence from within a terrorist \n     cell or a factory supplying arms to a rogue state. Why are we \n     doing this? Because such human intelligence can save American \n     lives or avert conflict.\n       What will be different is that we will not do these things \n     blindly, without thorough vetting and established procedures \n     for accoutability. We will not fool ourselves or fool our \n     customers about the risks we have taken.\n       The new Deputy Director for Operations has ordered a \n     complete ``scrub'' of all DO ``assets,'' as the Intelligence \n     Community refers to human agents. This is a rigorous \n     evaluation of each one of the agents that we recruit to give \n     us information. If the information these assets provide is no \n     longer relevant, if we can get the same information \n     elsewhere, if questions of human rights violations or \n     criminal involvement outweigh the value of the information to \n     our national interest, then we will end the relationship with \n     the asset.\n       We are developing new guidelines to ensure that concerns \n     about human rights and criminal activity are taken into \n     account in recruiting, evaluating and managing assets. The \n     guidelines will also include mandatory steps to provide \n     accurate and timely information to Congressional Oversight \n     Committees and law enforcement agencies.\n       Thus these new guidelines will allow us to make informed \n     decisions on asset recruitment and retention; this does not \n     mean that we will slacken our efforts to recruit informants \n     in hostile governments, terrorist organizations, or \n     international crime and drug trafficking organizations. To do \n     so would be to deny our government information that leads to \n     actions that better protect our citizens and their interests.\n       I would like to say a word about covert action--those \n     activities CIA undertakes to influence events overseas that \n     are intended not to be attributable to this country. Since \n     the public controversies of the eighties over Iran-Contra and \n     activities in Central America, we have greatly reduced our \n     capability to engage in covert action. I believe that the US \n     needs to maintain, and perhaps even expand, covert action as \n     a policy tool. But here again, we will not undertake covert \n     action to support policy objectives, unless it is approved at \n     the highest level of government and only if the President \n     authorizes such action after a scrupulous review process, \n     including timely notification of the appropriate \n     Congressional oversight bodies.\n       Finally, the Ames case has taught us that counter \n     intelligence--guarding against penetration of our \n     intelligence or national security agencies by agents of a \n     foreign government--requires constant vigilance. I recently \n     created the position of Associate Deputy Director of \n     Operations for Counterintelligence to assure permanent, high \n     level attention to counter intelligence issues.\n\n\n                  3. law enforcement and intelligence\n\n       The third area of change is to greatly increase our \n     cooperation with the law enforcement community. In the past, \n     we used the borders of the United States as a convenient \n     dividing line between the responsibilities of intelligence \n     agencies and law enforcement agencies. The CIA \n     handled everything that involved foreign intelligence \n     outside the US. The FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency \n     handled law enforcement within the US. Unfortunately \n     international criminals, drug traffickers, and terrorists \n     do not respect these neat distinctions that were \n     introduced over a half century ago.\n       Cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement can \n     produce fantastic success--the arrest of the leaders of the \n     Cali drug cartel in recent months is a tremendous example--\n     but this cooperation has yet to be as effective, extensive, \n     and routine as it needs to be.\n       President Clinton and Vice President Gore are not \n     satisfied, and correctly so, that we have in place the \n     interagency mechanisms that we need to address these threats \n     adequately. We cannot waste any more time worrying about \n     bureaucratic rivalries that go back to the days of J. Edgar \n     Hoover and Allen Dulles.\n       It's time for a fresh approach: a new division of \n     responsibility that realistically reflects the pattern of \n     international activity that exists today in terrorism, crime \n     and drugs. The Intelligence Community must learn that in \n     these areas, the law enforcement community--the FBI, the Drug \n     Enforcement Agency, and US Customs--is the customer for \n     intelligence, just as the Department of State and Defense are \n     the customer for intelligence in the national security arena.\n       And the law enforcement community must accept that it is \n     not necessary or efficient to establish an elaborate new and \n     separate foreign collection system for intelligence.\n       Intelligence and law enforcement professionals need to \n     develop new procedures that will result in more effective \n     cooperation. For example, intelligence and law enforcement \n     must modify some of their most strongly held beliefs about \n     not sharing information about their sources with each other.\n       This does not mean that intelligence agencies will spy on \n     US citizens. Our collection activities will not infringe on \n     the rights of US citizens. Nor will CIA or other intelligence \n     agencies take on any law enforcement duties. Attorney General \n     Reno and I are simply seeking to build a new relationship \n     between intelligence and law enforcement that will improve \n     the country's performance in curbing international crime, \n     drugs, and terrorism.\n\n\n    4. carrying out intelligence operations in an efficient fashion\n\n       The fourth change that I want to address is the initiation \n     of an integrated approach to resource planning and \n     programming for all the agencies of the Intelligence \n     Community.\n       In this era of tight budgets, the Intelligence Community \n     has to undergo serious reexamination of its needs and its \n     resources and, indeed, downsizing has been going on for some \n     time--for example, since 1990, the number of people in the \n     Intelligence Community has been reduced by 17% and an \n     additional 10% reduction is planned by the end of the \n     century.\n       However, up to the present, the Intelligence Community has \n     been relatively free from the systematic planning, \n     programming, and budgeting process that is the hallmark of \n     efficient government.\n       The reason for this absence of management scrutiny is not \n     because the intelligence budget is ``secret.'' The reason is \n     that intelligence activities are carried out by different \n     agencies--NSA, DIA, CIA--and are carried out under separate \n     budgets. There is no mechanism to compare the budgets of the \n     various intelligence agencies and assess how they contribute \n     to the missions of U.S. intelligence. The present system does \n     not permit resource-saving tradeoff analysis: for example, \n     the possibility of substituting satellites for aircraft \n     imagery or signals collection, or assigning intelligence \n     analysis responsibilities among the different agencies, \n     considering the capabilities of the entire community.\n       It is the responsibility of the Director of Central \n     Intelligence to review the nation's intelligence budget as a \n     whole and justify it to Congress. As the system now stands, \n     the DCI does not have the tools to do this job properly.\n       In preparing the FY97 budget, I am insisting that all \n     agencies present their intelligence budgets in a manner that \n     will allow us to make more informed hard decisions on \n     resource allocation.\n       Simply put, the problem is to make a ``symphony'' from the \n     diverse instruments represented by the various agencies. We \n     need to assure that all elements of the community work in \n     harmony. A mission oriented Intelligence Community multi-year \n     program period will identify the resources needed to carry \n     out our activities and assess the value of individual \n     programs. An added benefit of this approach is that it will \n     provide a clear description of what the Intelligence \n     Community is doing and what is the value to both President \n     Clinton and to the Congress.\n\n\n                 5. improving the quality of the people\n\n       The most important element of success in the Intelligence \n     Community is the quality of its people. Historically, we have \n     attracted outstanding and highly motivated individuals. \n     Unfortunately, some parts of the Intelligence Community are \n     in danger of losing the ability to attract and retain the \n     best people. This is particularly true of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency and its Directorate of Operations. The \n     fifth and last change I will discuss today is a new \n     approach to personnel management.\n       We must replace CIA's personnel system with one that is \n     better suited to the special nature of the work its employees \n     must perform. We must reexamine the use of the polygraph in \n     hiring and create a system that encourages employees to gain \n     wider experience within the agency and discourages the \n     development of barriers between the different directorates \n     and cultures within CIA.\n       I have assigned CIA's Executive Director the task of \n     reviewing past studies and designing a new system that will \n     allow individuals to advance according to their \n     accomplishments without regard to gender or race, a system \n     that will be perceived as fair by employees throughout CIA. \n     As intelligence officers, it is our job to understand and be \n     able to operate in widely different cultures. A diverse \n     workforce is absolutely essential to our ability to be an \n     effective intelligence Agency in the next century.\n\n[[Page S 14796]]\n\n       This same emphasis on personnel management must extend to \n     all other agencies of the Intelligence Community. All \n     agencies need to recruit top people; all need career \n     development programs; and all need to welcome diversity in \n     the workplace. We need health promotion opportunities that \n     are comparable across the Intelligence Community, and we need \n     a retirement system that upholds the contract we have made \n     with the good people who have dedicated their careers to our \n     national security.\n       We will need to seek new authority to allow more flexible \n     management of the very special Intelligence Community work \n     force to assure, in a time of downsizing, that there is a \n     reasonable prospect for advancement and provisions for early \n     retirement within the Community.\n\n\n                          concluding remarks.\n\n       I have presented five fundamental changes that are \n     necessary to improve the performance of the Intelligence \n     Community: a significantly sharper focus on the needs of the \n     intelligence customer; more selective and effective human \n     intelligence; a new cooperative relationship between law \n     enforcement and the Intelligence Community; a more efficient \n     system for allocating the resources of the Intelligence \n     Community; and revitalizing the personnel system to better \n     serve all of the employees of the Intelligence Community.\n       These changes will enable the Intelligence Community to \n     efficiently and effectively address the intelligence \n     challenges of the post-Cold War era. I will devote my energy \n     and my influence to assuring that each of these changes is \n     made--thoroughly and promptly.\n       I hope that the media, Congress, and public opinion will \n     give the Intelligence Community a chance to demonstrate what \n     it can do. In a democracy, all the failures become public, \n     the successes do not. It takes good will along with vigilant \n     skepticism to give the intelligence enterprise a fair shake--\n     to balance accounts about past excesses with reporting that \n     assesses current accomplishments. Thank you very much.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n        Columbia Arrests Raise Price of Cocaine in New York City\n\n                          (By Clifford Brauss)\n\n       Only a few months after the Colombian Government began \n     arresting the top leaders of the Cali drug cartel, law \n     enforcement officials said the supply and potency of cocaine \n     in New York City is dwindling, forcing wholesale and street \n     prices to soar.\n       In what officials described as the most precipitous shift \n     in almost six years, the wholesale price of cocaine has \n     increased nearly 50 percent since May, while retail prices \n     have gone up 30 percent. Similar increases, they said, are \n     evident in other big Eastern cities dependent on New York-\n     based Cali operatives for supplies.\n       In addition, they said, recent seizures and intelligence \n     indicate that the size and number of shipments of cocaine \n     into the New York area have declined. Only four months ago, \n     Federal agents say, shipments weighing 1,000 pounds or more \n     were coming into the city in trucks, ships and airplanes; \n     now, they typically weigh less than 200 pounds.\n       The shifts are also evident in the city's drug markets. \n     Drug dealers in Washington Square Park said this week that \n     the same gram of cocaine that sold for $50 in May now goes \n     for $80, an increase that they said was beginning to drive \n     away younger buyers who come to Greenwich Village from New \n     Jersey.\n       ``I've been around 39 years,'' said one Washington Square \n     dealer, whispering as he gave knowing glances to prospective \n     buyers walking through the park. ``So I know when they bust \n     the big guys in Colombia, that's when the coke goes up.''\n       Law enforcement authorities cautioned that the shifts in \n     supply and price might be temporary, evidence of another \n     periodic realignment of international trafficking networks \n     with little long-lasting importance. But they said that the \n     declining sizes of cocaine shipments and five recent fatal \n     shootings between competing drug gangs in Queens appeared to \n     be strong signs that the world's richest drug trafficking \n     organization is at least going through a painful period of \n     adjustment.\n       ```Maybe it's only a breather that is benefiting the \n     community,'' said Peter A. Crusco, chief of narcotics \n     investigations in the Queens District Attorney's office ``But \n     relatively little is coming in. The big-level people are not \n     risking moving the cocaine.''\n       Officials say cocaine buyers can still find the drug in \n     neighborhoods across the city, but New York police officials \n     say laboratory tests show that dealers are now mixing their \n     small bags and tins of cocaine power with 30 percent more \n     sugar or baking power to stretch supplies.\n       On the other hand, officials say supplies and prices of \n     crack--the cocaine-based drug of choice among many poor \n     users--have not been affected, because its purity is low to \n     begin with and abusers need little to become intoxicated.\n       Though they are encouraged by the tightened supply of \n     cocaine, some police officials expressed concern that \n     shortages of cocaine could eventually increase demand for \n     heroin, which is already gaining in popularity and is mostly \n     distributed by organized crime groups that compete with the \n     Cali cartel.\n       They also worry that if drug profits continue to be \n     stretched, street gangs competing for customers, territory \n     and supplies could turn more violent, much as they did when \n     crack first became popular in the late 1980's.\n       Investigators said information collected through wiretaps \n     and informers indicate that supplies of cocaine are being \n     held up in Colombia and Mexico, where they are stockpiled \n     before moving across the border, because the leaders who once \n     personally supervised their release are in jail or on the \n     run.\n       Middle-level traffickers, the wiretaps and informers \n     indicated are holding back shipments, in part because they \n     feared that the captured leaders might be trading information \n     about cartel operations in exchange for more lenient \n     treatment.\n       ``The one person who moved the cocaine between Colombia and \n     Mexico, Miguel Angel Rodriguez Orejuela, is out of commission \n     for at least the moment,'' said a senior Drug Enforcement \n     Administration official who spoke on condition that he not be \n     named. ``One can logically surmise that right now there is a \n     quandary, a state of confusion, and problems with people \n     hooking up with the traffickers both in Colombia and \n     Mexico.''\n       The most striking effect of the arrests in Colombia have so \n     far been at the wholesale level of the drug trade, officials \n     said. Responding to the decreased supplies, several law \n     enforcement officials said top cocaine dealers have increased \n     their prices to their largest distributors to an average of \n     $26,000 per kilogram, from $18,000 only four months ago.\n       In Detroit, the Drug Enforcement Administration has \n     reported an increase in wholesale prices from $22,000 to \n     $32,000 per kilogram in the last two months alone.\n       A bodega owner in Washington Heights with broad knowledge \n     of the cocaine trade in New York said the recent increase had \n     forced middle-level dealers to drop some street sellers, \n     shave profits, dilute their inventory and hoard supplies in \n     case the current shortages continued.\n       ``A lot of people are just holding onto their good stuff \n     for when prices really go up,'' he said.\n       The last time cocaine prices in New York rose so much and \n     so fast was in late 1989, when a shooting war broke out \n     between the Medellin cartel and the Colombian Government. The \n     Medellin group never recovered, but within months the Cali \n     cartel picked up the trafficking slack, and prices returned \n     to normal levels.\n       State Department and law enforcement officials said that \n     Mexican trafficking groups and smaller Colombian cartels \n     operating on Colombia's northern coast are now jockeying for \n     new markets. Mexican traffickers have already taken control \n     of much of the cocaine market in the Southwest, they said, \n     and wholesale prices there have not risen as sharply as in \n     New York.\n       But Thomas A. Constantine, the head of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration, said in a recent interview that there was no \n     cartel waiting in the wings that could match the Cali group's \n     financial resources, political clout in Colombia, and \n     international trafficking connections.\n       ``Nobody out there even compares,'' he said, saying that \n     the Cali group had already surpassed the Medellin cartel in \n     sophistication and resources at the time of the Medellin \n     group's downfall.\n       But Mr. Constantine and other officials cautioned that it \n     was too soon to tell how harshly the Colombian authorities \n     would punish the six top Cali leaders they captured this \n     year. United States officials noted that the cartel leaders \n     were able to negotiate some of the terms of their surrender, \n     and none have suffered confiscations of ill-gotten gains like \n     their mountainside mansions or fleets of yachts.\n       In addition, the United States officials say, the cartel \n     leaders are still able to communicate with their lieutenants \n     sporadically through family members who visit them in jail \n     and by paying off guards. But perhaps because their telephone \n     conversations are being monitored the officials say, they \n     have not directed their underlings to release huge loads of \n     cocaine warehoused in Colombia and Mexico.\n       Whatever the long-term impact, law-enforcement officials \n     say, the latest price rises demonstrate that the cartel's top \n     leaders direct the most minute details of their cocaine \n     wholesale operations in the New York area. Recent captures of \n     cartel records include items like personnel evaluations and \n     Con Edison bills.\n       ``We have done investigations involving wiretaps,'' said \n     Robert H. Silbering, the Special Assistant District Attorney \n     in charge of citywide narcotics cases, ``that show a direct \n     link from the streets of New York to the estates of Cali.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, all parents understand the pride and joy \nwe have in our children. They are the apple of our eyes, our most \nprecious resource, our future, and our hope. Today I rise with many of \nmy colleagues to submit a bipartisan resolution declaring the second \nSunday in October, ``National Children's Day.'' National Children's Day \nis about hope--the hopes we have for children and the hope they should \nhave for themselves.\n  We live in a rapidly changing world--a world of difficulties and \nuncertainties for many children. Many children growing up today must \novercome tremendous obstacles and challenges, such as drug and alcohol \nabuse, illiteracy, poverty, pregnancy, physical abuse, absentee \nparents, and neighborhood violence. How does the future appear for \nchildren who do not have a supportive, nurturing environment? To some, \nthe future is uncertain and dark. According to the Children's Defense \nFund, 15.7 million children lived in poverty in 1993 and every 98 \nminutes a child was killed in 1992.\n  Children need nurturing, guidance, time, understanding and the \nreassurance of a childhood and hope in their future. The fortunate \nchildren receive all the love and support they need. However, many \nchildren do not receive the appreciation they deserve. Children are our \nmost precious human resource, for they hold our future in their hands, \nhearts, and minds.\n  Mr. President, you may be interested to learn that the first \nChildren's Day was celebrated on the second Sunday in October 46 years \nago on the campus of Notre Dame University. Dr. Patrick McCusker and \nhis wife Mary decided to honor not only their children but children \nthroughout the country. This year marks the 6th year a Senate \nresolution has commemorated this traditional day.\n  The intent of National Children's Day has not changed. National \nChildren's Day assures children, as a Nation, that we will be here for \nthem. As a Nation, we will try our best to provide for them, look out \nfor them, and to give them the best our Nation can. National Children's \nDay reaffirms, that we will keep our children in mind. National \nChildren's Day is a celebration of America's hope in the children of \ntoday and tomorrow.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 178) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to submit, along with 34 of \nmy colleagues, a resolution which commemorates the 50th anniversary of \nthe end of World War II.\n  September 2d of this year marked this 50th anniversary. World War II \nchanged the face of the world like no other in our history. We owe this \ndistinction to our veterans, their families, and those who served on \nthe home front to support the war effort. Americans made tremendous \nsacrifices to protect the ideals of freedom and democracy. Their \naccomplishments should not be forgotten. Many American men and women \nanswered the call of their country, left their homes and jobs, and \nboldly entered the war. Civilians on the home front performed the \nimpossible by manufacturing goods at a rate that astonished the world. \nOur country joined together to ration food and grow victory gardens \nwhich aided the war effort. American farmers stepped forward and grew \nenough produce to support the allied forces.\n  The troops overseas offered the ultimate sacrifice as they fought in \nthe deserts of North Africa, on the streets of European cities, under \nthe Atlantic Ocean, and on the islands of the Pacific. The Americans \nthat served and died gave the greatest honor possible to their families \nand their country. We should honor these veterans to show that we are a \ngrateful nation.\n  Our support of this resolution sends a clear message to all \nAmericans. It is a reminder to them that we will not forget those that \nanswered the call of \n\n[[Page S 14798]]\nduty. This resolution designates the week of November 4-11 as the \nClosing Week of Commemorations for the 50th Anniversary of World War \nII. This week will be celebrated across the United States. Activities \nand honors will be held to recognize the 17-million Americans that \nserved. The President will also be asked to arrange for any \ncelebrations he deems appropriate. It is of vital importance that we \nnot only honor these men and women, but also ensure that the current \ngeneration of Americans are educated about this war and its \nconsequences. The Bells of Peace will ring on November 11th at 11 a.m., \nstriking 50 times for the 50 years without a world war and symbolizing \nthe hope for at least 50 more years of peace and freedom.\n  This national recognition of Veterans, their families, and all those \nwho served at home is well deserved. The dedication and sacrifice of \nall our Americans must not be forgotten. We celebrate the valor of \nthose involved to honor the past.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 179) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 179\n\n       Whereas 50 years ago, this Nation had just emerged from a \n     war that found Americans fighting a common foe with 32 allied \n     countries and in which over 17,000,000 Americans served in \n     the military;\n       Whereas the United States suffered over 670,000 casualties, \n     with more than 290,000 deaths, while over 105,000 Americans \n     were held as prisoners of war;\n       Whereas on the home front, Americans mobilized to support \n     the war by increasing the output of manufactured goods by 300 \n     percent and by causing a second agricultural revolution \n     through the efforts and imagination of our people as the \n     American farmers mobilized to support the world;\n       Whereas the war led to dramatic social changes as more than \n     19,500,000 women joined the workforce at the Nation's defense \n     plants and 350,000 joined the military;\n       Whereas the roles of minorities in both the military and \n     industry were changed forever as more opportunities for \n     employment and involvement in the defense of the United \n     States presented themselves;\n       Whereas the contributions by women, minorities, and all \n     those on the home front were legion;\n       Whereas the bringing to a close of the commemorations for \n     the Fiftieth Anniversary of World War II should be celebrated \n     across the Nation with programs and activities to thank and \n     honor the World War II generation, our veterans, their \n     families, those who lost loved ones, and all who served on \n     the home front; and\n       Whereas it is important to educate the generations that \n     followed World War II on the lessons of this horrific \n     conflict and to reaffirm the values of human decency: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate and the House of Representatives, by \n     previous agreement, shall assemble in the Hall of the House \n     of Representatives on October 11, 1995, for the purpose of \n     saying to the Nation and the world that the American people \n     will never forget those who served our Nation and saved the \n     world, our veterans, and those who served on the home front \n     as we close the commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of \n     World War II;\n       (2)(A) November 4, 1995, through November 11, 1995, is \n     designated as a ``Week of National Remembrance and the \n     Closing of the Fiftieth Anniversary of World War II'', with \n     National Days of Prayer on November 4 and November 5, 1995, \n     and a World War II Education Day across America on November \n     8, 1995, and the President is authorized and requested to \n     issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United \n     States to observe that period with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities;\n       (B) commemorations during the ``Week of National \n     Remembrance and the Closing of the Fiftieth Anniversary of \n     World War II'' shall include the dedication of the future \n     site of the Nation's World War II Memorial in Washington, \n     D.C.;\n       (3) Veterans Day, November 11, 1995, is designated as a \n     ``National Day of Observance and Celebration of the Fiftieth \n     Anniversary of World War II'', and the President is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on \n     the people of the United States to observe that day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) each State Governor and each chief executive of each \n     political subdivision of each State, is urged to issue a \n     proclamation (or other appropriate official statement) \n     calling upon the citizens of such State or political \n     subdivision of a State to participate on November 11, 1995, \n     at 11 a.m., in the ringing of the Bells of Peace and Freedom \n     by striking all bells of the Nation 50 times to signify the \n     50 years without a world war and the world's hope to achieve \n     another 50 years of peace and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/29/senate-section/article/S14797-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATION OF JERUSALEM'S 3000TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. COATS.

I say to my friend from Kentucky that my persuasive manner \nand nature has allowed us now to--as I read the clock, it is 10:07 p.m. \non Friday evening.
