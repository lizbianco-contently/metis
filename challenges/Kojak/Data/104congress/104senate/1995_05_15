The \n     discussions in Tucson were cordial, comprehensive, and \n     candid, aimed at exchanging views on five principal subjects, \n     expanding mutual understanding, and advancing a positive, \n     practical agenda for improving relations across the board.\n\n\n                    nafta and hemispheric free trade\n\n       The Delegations discussed the expansion of economic \n     relations among Canada, Mexico, and the United States under \n     the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Delegations \n     discussed ideas for the acceleration of tariff phase-out \n     periods and the complete implementation of NAFTA and \n     committed themselves to encourage the timely consideration of \n     initiatives to expand free trade in the Americas.\n\n\n                         economic stabilization\n\n       The Delegations discussed current economic conditions and \n     measures established in Mexico's economic adjustment program \n     and stressed that both countries have an interest in the \n     complete and early recovery of the Mexican economy. In \n     particular, the Delegations recognized that both Congresses \n     will continue to review implementation, within their \n     respective constitutional authorities, of the economic \n     stabilization package being carried out under the ``U.S.-\n     Mexico Framework Agreement'' and accompanying accords signed \n     on February 21, 1995.\n                           BORDER COOPERATION\n\n       The discussions in Tucson provided ample opportunity for \n     the exchange of views on expanding border cooperation, \n     including issues of tourism, customs, safe border crossing, \n     health, and environment. The Delegations committed themselves \n     to following through on initiatives to improve the quality of \n     life of persons who live and work in communities along the \n     2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border and to facilitate the growing \n     commerce through regional ports. In addition, problems of \n     port security and border crossings in violation of the law \n     were discussed.\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n       The Delegations recognized the need to respect the \n     fundamental human rights of all persons, as well as the \n     sovereign right of all states to make autonomous decisions \n     regarding domestic social programs and their territorial \n     integrity, in accordance with the constitution of each \n     country. When considering this issue, the Delegations agreed \n     on the importance of utilizing the consultative mechanisms \n     established in the U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission and \n     other appropriate channels.\n\n\n                        COMBATTING ILLEGAL DRUGS\n\n       In the strongest possible terms, the Delegations agreed \n     that combatting illegal drugs is a priority for both \n     countries. The Delegations acknowledged that current \n     bilateral anti-drug cooperation is unprecedented in its scope \n     and intensity, and that both governments must redouble their \n     efforts and commit the necessary resources in order to \n     strictly apply the law to criminals and to attack the drug \n     problem more effectively in all its manifestations, including \n     production, trafficking, and consumption. The Delegations \n     agreed on the need to strengthen actions to fight organized \n     crime, money-laundering, and corruption through cooperation \n     and with absolute respect for the sovereignty of each \n     country.\n\n\n                          FOLLOW-UP MECHANISMS\n\n       The Delegations agreed to consider establishing special \n     congressional working groups on bilateral issues, including a \n     process to develop specific recommendations and follow-up \n     actions for future interparliamentary meetings. They also \n     agreed to consider holding a United States-Mexico-Canada \n     Interparliamentary Meeting in the future.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       The Mexican Delegation expressed its satisfaction for the \n     atmosphere of frank, open, and candid dialogue that prevailed \n     at the discussions in Tucson. The Mexican legislators thanked \n     their U.S. colleagues for their hospitality and extended \n     their best wishes to the people of the United States. The \n     United States Delegation extended their thanks to their \n     Mexican counterparts and best wishes to the Mexican people.\n                                     Senator Fernando Ortiz Arana,\n                               Chairman, Mexican State Delegation.\n     Deputy Augusto Gomez Villanueva,\n                                         Chairman, Mexican Chamber\n                                           of Deputies Delegation.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n                                 Chairman, U.S. Senate Delegation.\n                                         Representative Jim Kolbe,\n                                  Chairman, U.S. House Delegation.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this conference, which was the 34th meeting \nof the United States and Mexican parliamentarians, covered a wide range \nof topics. It focused in two general areas: On the economic and \npolitical issues.\n  On the economic issues, matters that were discussed included the \nimplementation of NAFTA and other hemispheric free-trade issues, the \nissues regarding economic stabilization for the Mexican economy, border \ncooperation in a whole variety of different ways, problems relating to \nimmigration and, most important, combating illegal drugs.\n  I might note just in that regard that the communique notes in the \nstrongest possible terms, the delegates believe that both countries \nneed to work even more closely together to solve this problem that is \nso critical to both of our countries.\n  We also included in the communique follow-up mechanisms that would \nenable us to continue our work together as parliamentarians, including \nthe possibility that we would meet with our Canadian counterparts as \nwell in a three-part kind of meeting.\n  Mr. President, the key, I think, to this meeting was a recognition \nthat perhaps more than any other time in history, the Congresses of our \ntwo countries have changed dramatically. We are aware of the fact that \nfor the first time in 40 years, the Republican Party now controls both \nHouses of the U.S. Congress, and that is creating great changes in our \nlegislative policy.\n  By the same token, the Congress in Mexico is undergoing substantial \nchange as well. In addition to the fact that you have four different \nparties in the Congress, the parliamentarians who met this weekend all \nnoted that the role that the Congress is playing in Mexico is a much \nmore active and robust role than has been true in years past. \nTherefore, the areas of cooperation between the two Congresses take on \nan even greater importance as both of our countries face the next few \nyears and going into the next century.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with a great deal of pride and with a degree \nof humility that I appear with these members of the House and Senate of \nMexico and present them to you and, again, express my very strong sense \nthat this kind of meeting is critical to the future of our two \ncountries which share a 2,000-mile-long border and have a very bright \nfuture together. We treat that border as an opportunity, and I think \nthat was the keyword in the entire conference, was the opportunity that \nis presented by the working together of our two countries.\n  Mr. President, now we have the privilege of going to the White House \nand meeting with President Clinton. We know that that meeting will be \nfruitful as well. I note finally that there were seven Senators from \nthe United States who attended that meeting, as well as both \nAmbassadors from the United States and Mexico. Therefore, it was a most \nproductive conference.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chamber is honored by the visit of our \ncolleagues and friends. You are most welcome in this Chamber. We \nappreciate your visit very much.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. \n[[Page S6647]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, again, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.

Mr. President, yesterday, on May 14, 1995, Minnesotans \nmarked two annual occasions: one that millions of families look forward \nto each year, and one that millions of Minnesota taxpayers await with a \nmixture of anger and frustration.\n  First and foremost, of course, was Mother's Day, the day we all honor \nour mothers for the love and support they have given us.\n  The second, less well-known but equally significant event was \nMinnesota Tax Freedom Day, the day Minnesotans quit working to pay \ntaxes at the Federal, State, and local levels of government and begin \nworking for themselves. Every dollar my constituents have earned so far \nthis year has gone to pay taxes. For a total of 134 days, Minnesotans \nhave been working for the government; 85 of these days were spent \npaying off Federal taxes, while the remaining 49 days were spent paying \noff State and local taxes.\n  Tax Freedom Day comes much later in the year to Minnesota than it \ndoes to the Nation at large, which means Minnesotans spend longer than \nmost Americans working to pay off their tax bills.\n  For the average American taxpayer, Tax Freedom Day is on May 6, but \nMinnesotans must work more than a week longer for Uncle Sam and his \ncousins at the State and local levels.\n  My constituents are encumbered with the sixth highest tax rate in the \ncountry. The only States whose Tax Freedom Days come after Minnesota's \nare Connecticut and New York, who both mark Tax Freedom Day on May 24; \nWashington, DC, and New Jersey, on May 18; and Hawaii, on May 17.\n  For 2 years, the tax load borne by Minnesotans has remained constant, \nand Tax Freedom Day has fallen on the same day, May 14. But sadly, a \nlot has changed since President Clinton's 1993 budget package.\n  In 1993, Tax Freedom Day in Minnesota was May 9. In effect, the tax \nincreases imposed in President Clinton's 1993 budget have forced \nMinnesotans to work an additional 5 days just to pay off those new \ntaxes.\n  These 5 days could have been spent on a family vacation, but there is \nno time for fun when you are working to pay off the Government's \nspending splurges.\n  The average per capita income of Minnesota is $24,403, 36.6 percent \nof which goes to pay taxes.\n  Translated into dollar terms, the average annual tax bill for every \nMinnesota taxpayer this year will be $8,926, or over one-third of their \nhard-earned income.\n  Americans face a veritable cornucopia of tax burdens in their day-to-\nday lives, overflowing with the income taxes and payroll taxes which \nrepresent the largest component of the average American's tax bill.\n  In addition to these more visible taxes, the cost of nearly all goods \nand services are inflated by sales and excise taxes. There are property \ntaxes, estate and other business taxes, and let us not forget the \ncorporate income taxes which are passed along to consumers and \nemployees in the form of higher prices and lower wages.\n  The perverse thing about our current progressive income tax system is \nthat as national income increases, the tax burden increases along with \nit, more than proportionally. As a result, economic contractions tend \nto reduce American's tax burden while economic expansions tend to \nincrease it.\n  It makes no sense that taxpayers should be penalized for robust \neconomic growth by extracting more money from their paychecks.\n  This is why I support tax cuts--real tax cuts--that help American \nfamilies keep more of what they earn. The $500 per child tax credit \ngoes a long way toward that end. Middle-class families could save more, \nor they could spend more--they would be given the freedom to do \nwhatever they want with their money because it belongs to them.\n  We may never see Tax Freedom Day coincide with New Year's Day or even \nValentine's Day, but let us face it: We are about to begin debate on a \nnew budget resolution, one that can counteract the onerous effects of \nClinton's package of tax hikes 2 years ago. Let us not miss this \nopportunity to offer tax relief to America's families. Let us ensure \nthat Tax Freedom Day comes a lot earlier next year than it did last \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6647-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 395\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, there has been much discussion about the \nbudget of the United States that will be brought to this floor by \nSenator Domenici and the Budget Committee soon. I believe strongly we \nmust do something in this country or Medicare will go broke and our \ncountry will go broke. That is the alternative on one side. The \nalternative on the other side is to do something about it.\n  Those are two rather grim alternatives. Because if we continue down \nthe road with a $4.8 trillion debt in a $6.9 trillion economy, our \nmoney will soon become worthless. We are already seeing signs of this: \nthe decline in the value of the dollar, particularly the unexplained \ncollapse of the dollar against the yen and against the German mark. So \nsomething is wrong in our economy. In fact, I predict that at some \npoint in the next 5 or 10 years we will have a cataclysmic event, \neconomically speaking, in our country if we do not do something now \nabout the Federal deficit.\n  We also have learned that Medicare will go broke by the year 2002 \nunless something is done. I have been a champion of senior citizens. I \nwould ask our senior citizens, would we rather have a Medicare system \nthat is broke, or would we rather have one that is solvent even though \nwe may have to make certain changes? So that is where we stand as a \ncountry, basically, with this budget coming to the floor. It is a \nhistoric turning point in our country's history. We have to make a \ndecision as to whether or not we are going to face up to the facts.\n  We had a debate on this Senate floor about the balanced budget \namendment recently. The Democrats pointed out that our side of the \naisle had no plan. They said, what is your plan to balance the budget? \nWe do have a plan. It is the Domenici plan that will come to this \nfloor. It has a lot of cuts; some cuts I do not personally agree with, \nbut I am going to support the Domenici budget plan, generally speaking, \nbecause in part it is the only game in town.\n  The Democrats do not have a plan. Yet, they are criticizing our plan. \nThat is unfortunate. The Democrats have [[Page S6648]] the White House. \nThey are supposed to provide leadership in this area also. But they do \nnot want to. So it is our burden in the Republican majority to provide \ncommonsense leadership, to take the hits, to make the tough votes.\n  Mr. President, one of the newspapers in South Dakota this morning \nreported that the Federal Government--the Treasury--released how much \nmy State would suffer if some of the budget cuts were made. I say to my \nfellow South Dakotans, that is the oldest trick in the book by the \nFederal bureaucracy. They release how much people are going to suffer, \nand how much money is going to be lost. They do not say that they might \nhave to reduce the number of bureaucrats in Washington or at the Denver \nregional headquarters. They do not say that they are counting as part \nof the budget impact the elimination of bureaucrats and regulators \nwhose work may involve South Dakota, but actually live in Washington, \nDC, or Denver. They merely say, ``Your State is going to be hurt this \nmuch,'' and, ``Senator, if you vote to cut us, you are hurting your \nState.'' Those numbers that are released in such a timely fashion show \nhow skillful the Federal bureaucracy is at trying to protect themselves \nby politically hurting Senators and Congressmen who vote for cuts in \nthe budget.\n  So I urge all South Dakotans, and all Americans, to take a close look \nat exactly what they are talking about.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, on the budget, we face a very painful \nchoice. On the one hand, we can go broke as a nation and see the value \nof the dollar decline and leave a great debt for future generations. We \nalso can keep spending in Medicare at the same level without making \nchanges and have it go broke by the year 2002.\n  On the other hand, we can take a responsible course. We can follow \nthe outline of Pete Domenici's budget, which he is bringing to this \nfloor.\n  The Republicans in the Senate have a plan. The Democrats do not. They \nare criticizing our plan. That is fine. We will take the criticism. But \nI want to say to the people in my State and to this country that I hope \nthey give us the understanding and the credit for taking leadership, \nfor taking the tough votes we will soon take, because the other side is \nmerely throwing rocks at us as we are trying to climb up the hill.\n  Let us remember that our country is at a historic point. We could \nchoose to go bankrupt, with a $4 trillion debt this year. With many \nprograms such as Medicare going broke, we can keep doing what we are \ndoing, and if so, it is going to lead to a cataclysmic event. Or we can \ntake some tough medicine, and take some tough votes.\n  In the next 6 months, I believe that I will be casting the toughest \nvotes of my Senate career. I ask for the understanding of my \nconstituents because it is not easy. I would rather be voting to give \neverybody everything. It must have been fun to be a Senator in the \n1960's, when you could vote for amendments without having any budget \noffset. Now, with every amendment we have, if we add something to the \nbudget, we have to say where we are taking it from. We have to state \nunder the budget rules what this is going to do to the Federal budget.\n  So the whole tone of the next 6 months in this Chamber is going to be \na very difficult one. We are going to see Senators struggle in their \nvotes. It is going to be easier to demagog and to say let us wait until \nnext year, or delay it 3 or 5 years. But the time has come to stand up \nand be counted. I believe that we can do a great deal for the future of \nthe United States if we do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues a little noticed, but I think significant, event that \noccurred last week.\n  Last Thursday, Northern States Power transferred spent nuclear fuel \nfrom its reactor pool at Prairie Island into a new dry storage cask \nlocated at the reactor site.\n  Prairie Island, near Red Wing, MN, is the location of two of Northern \nStates Power's three nuclear power reactors.\n  Licensed to operate starting in 1973 and 1974 respectively, Prairie \nIsland 1 and Prairie Island 2 share a spent fuel storage pool.\n  Today, 20 years into the 40-year licensed life of the reactors, the \npool is filling up.\n  Northern States Power needed to find more storage for the waste \ngenerated at Prairie Island. Fortunately, licensed technology, dry cask \nstorage, was available which would allow the utility to move the oldest \nspent fuel assemblies out of the pool.\n  NSP proposed to locate the casks at the reactor site.\n  Thursday's announcement of final NRC approval to load the casks is \nthe final chapter in a prolonged political and public relations effort \nby NSP to resolve until the year 2002 its Prairie Island waste problem.\n  The public outcry that erupted after NSP proposed to expand on-site \nstorage is every utility executive's nightmare, and led to the \nperception of the Prairie Island situation as the poster child of the \nnuclear power industry's current propaganda campaign for interim \nstorage of high-level nuclear waste in Nevada.\n  In spite of the obvious solution available to NSP, on-site dry casks, \nthe Prairie Island situation has, for several years now, been held up \nas the prime example of why Congress must immediately reopen the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act to speed up progress on moving high-level \nnuclear waste to Nevada.\n  Twenty percent of the Nation's electricity power supply, we have been \ntold, is at risk if Congress does not act soon.\n  Reactors will shut down, cities will go dark, and electricity rates \nwill skyrocket, if Congress does not take the waste off the hands of \nthe utilities soon--according to the nuclear power industry. The \nnuclear power industry's shameless campaign to get the Federal \nGovernment to take responsibility for its waste is not new.\n  In 1980, at the same time Congress was considering options for the \npermanent disposal of high-level waste, the nuclear power industry was \npushing for away-from-reactor storage, or AFR.\n  Without a Federal AFR facility, according to the industry, reactors \nwould begin closing by 1983.\n  Of course, no Federal AFR was built, and no reactors closed for lack \nof storage.\n  Besides creating the misleading impression of a crisis, of impending \ndoom, the nuclear power propaganda campaign has always sought to create \nthe impression that there is only one solution, one option for avoiding \nthe supposedly catastrophic consequences of reactor shutdowns: move the \nhigh-level nuclear waste to Nevada. That is the only proposal that is \noffered.\n  First, we as a State were targeted for a permanent repository.\n  That program is an acknowledged failure.\n  Now we are targeted for interim storage.\n  For the nuclear power industry, that means 100 years, subject to \nrenewal. That amounts to de facto permanent storage.\n  According to the nuclear power industry, interim storage in Nevada is \nthe only salvation for the future of nuclear power.\n  Nevadans have made it crystal clear that we want no part of the \nnuclear power industry's solution to its waste problem. Nuclear waste \nis not welcome in Nevada.\n  Nevertheless, the nuclear power industry, and its surrogate for this \nmatter, the Department of Energy, has been relentless in its efforts to \nforce Nevadans to bear the health and safety risks of solving a problem \nwe had no role in creating.\n  Mr. President, there are solutions to the nuclear waste storage \nproblem that do not include Nevada. Last weeks events at Prairie Island \nmake that abundantly clear. [[Page S6649]] \n  For all their propaganda, and all their complaining to Congress, the \nnuclear utilities find a way to handle their waste, and keep reactors \nopen and running.\n  The CEO of Northern States Power, John Howard, has said ``Resolution \nof interim storage for spent nuclear fuel from our country's commercial \npower plants has reached crisis proportions.''\n  Mr. Howard's assessment--that interim storage of nuclear waste is an \nimpending crisis, and, thus, Congress must act to move this waste to \nNevada as soon as possible--is a common theme in the nuclear power \nindustry.\n  As the Prairie Island situation demonstrates, however, the crisis \nscenario is simply not true from a technical or scientific perspective.\n  Of course, I do not expect many of my colleagues will hear much about \nthe resolution of the supposed crisis at Prairie Island.\n  The resolution of the Prairie Island waste situation simply does not \ntrack with the contrived crisis scenario developed by the nuclear power \nindustry and its lobbyists.\n  To admit that nuclear utilities can find ways to take care of their \nown waste would shatter the carefully constructed fiction that interim \nstorage in Nevada is the only possible alternative to shutting\n down the reactors.\n\n  It should be acknowledged that Northern States Power paid a price for \nthe approval of additional storage at Prairie Island.\n  The debate over increased storage was intense, and many are still not \nhappy.\n  NSP was forced to make concessions, such as building more renewable \nenergy sources.\n  Other utilities are not anxious to go through what NSP went through.\n  The unfortunate fact for nuclear utilities is that nuclear power, and \nnuclear waste, are not popular.\n  The public relations and political problems associated with expanding \nstorage capacity at reactors is an inescapable cost of nuclear power.\n  Northern States Power also paid a financial price for expanding \nstorage at Prairie Island.\n  As other utilities do the same, especially after the 1998 goal for \noperation of a permanent repository included in the 1982 Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act, some action ought to be taken to provide some relief to the \nratepayers who have paid in the first instance into the nuclear waste \nfund and who are not receiving the storage at that fund which they \ncontemplated would be operational by the year 1998.\n  I might say parenthetically, as the distinguished occupant of the \nchair knows, under no scenario, under absolutely none, will a facility \nbe opened by the year 1998.\n  So I believe as a matter of fairness that ratepayers are entitled to \nsome relief in terms of payment into the nuclear waste fund.\n  I have reintroduced in this Congress, as I have on previous \noccasions, legislation which this year bears the number of S. 429 which \nwill provide a credit against nuclear waste fund contributions for \nutilities forced to build on-site storage after 1998.\n  Under S. 429, ratepayers will not be financially penalized for the \nmisguided and mismanaged efforts of the nuclear power industry and the \nDepartment of Energy to build a permanent repository in Nevada.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the nuclear power industry's newest \nassault on the people of Nevada, and support S. 429.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, last Friday, President Clinton declared a \nmajor disaster for the State of Mississippi, due to damage resulting \nfrom severe storms, flooding, and related problems, weather problems \nthat occurred on May 8 and during the days following. This declaration \nis deeply appreciated by the people of Mississippi and the State of \nMississippi because very severe damage has occurred in our State as all \nof us know who had an opportunity to watch television and read about \nthe devastating floods that occurred all across the gulf coast, from \nNew Orleans to Mobile and beyond. Included in this area of severe \nweather damage was my State of Mississippi. All of the coast counties \nand some of those counties that are more inland received severe damage.\n  This declaration makes it possible now for the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, led by James Lee Witt, to provide private, \nindividual assistance to those disaster victims who qualify under \nFederal legislation. The letter also states that additional public \nassistance may be added at a later date.\n  It is my understanding that the Governor's office and his staff are \nworking with Federal agents at this time in Mississippi, to try to \nensure that all possible assistance, emergency and otherwise, is made \navailable to these disaster victims. I commend the Governor and his \nstaff for the fine work they are doing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of the President's \nletter to our Governor, Kirk Fordice, be printed at this point in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, May 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Kirk Fordice,\n     Governor of Mississippi,\n     State Capitol, Jackson, MS.\n       Dear Governor Fordice: As requested, I have declared a \n     major disaster under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) for the State \n     of Mississippi due to damage resulting from severe storms, \n     tornadoes, and flooding on May 8, 1995, and continuing. I \n     have authorized Federal relief and recovery assistance in the \n     affected area.\n       Individual Assistance will be provided. Public Assistance \n     may be added at a later date, if warranted. Consistent with \n     the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any \n     Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public \n     Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total \n     eligible costs in the designated areas.\n       The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will \n     coordinate Federal assistance efforts and designate specific \n     areas eligible for such assistance. The Federal Coordinating \n     Officer will be Mr. Michael J. Polny of FEMA. He will consult \n     with you and assist in the execution of the FEMA-State \n     Disaster Assistance Agreement governing the expenditure of \n     Federal funds.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this also brings to mind legislation that \nI introduced recently to bring under the purview of the Public Safety \nOfficers Benefits Act the employees of FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, as well as employees of State and local emergency \nmanagement and civil defense agencies.\n  Senators may not realize this, but State and local police officers, \nfirefighters, State and local rescue squads [[Page S6650]] and \nambulance crews, Federal law enforcement officers and firefighters, are \nall covered under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act, which \nprovides death benefits and permanent disability benefits for those who \nare injured with some traumatic injury while in the line of duty.\n  Excluded under this act are those who work for civil defense agencies \nand the employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. This had \nbeen brought to my attention a few years ago, and during the \nconfirmation hearings in our Governmental Affairs Committee of James \nLee Witt, the current FEMA Director, I asked him his reaction to \nlegislation that would expand coverage of this act and his responses \nwere very favorable.\n  I introduced the legislation. It was not adopted in the last \nCongress, but I have recently reintroduced the bill and it is now \npending in the Senate as S. 791. I hope Senators will take a look at \nthis bill and consider cosponsoring the legislation, or supporting its \npassage.\n  I am today sending a letter to all Senators, inviting their attention \nto this legislation and the circumstances of it. The enactment of this \nbill will provide these civil defense employees and emergency \nmanagement employees with the same kind of assurance that others who \nare similarly employed will have, should death or disabling injury \nresult from the performance of their duty. Their families would receive \nsurvivor benefits, and they could be made eligible for disability \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of my ``Dear \nColleague'' letter to which I have referred be printed at this point in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: I recently introduced S. 791, a bill to \n     extend coverage under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act \n     to employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA) and employees of State and local emergency management \n     and civil defense agencies.\n       The Public Safety Officers Benefits Act provides benefits \n     to the eligible survivors of a public safety officer whose \n     death is the direct result of a traumatic injury sustained in \n     the line of duty. The Act also provides benefits to those \n     officers who are permanently and totally disabled as the \n     direct result of a catastrophic personal injury sustained in \n     the line of duty.\n       The Act now covers State and local law enforcement officers \n     and fire fighters, Federal law enforcement officers and fire \n     fighters, and Federal, State, and local rescue squads and \n     ambulance crews. However, an employee of a State or local \n     emergency management or civil defense agency, or an employee \n     of FEMA who is killed or permanently disabled performing his \n     or her duty in responding to a disaster is not covered under \n     the Act.\n       Enactment of S. 791 will remedy this situation by extending \n     the Act to those employees. This will ensure that the \n     survivors and family members of an employee killed in the \n     line of duty will receive benefits and that an employee \n     permanently and totally disabled as a result of injury \n     sustained in the line of duty will also receive disability \n     benefits of the Act.\n       During his confirmation hearing in the last Congress, FEMA \n     Director James Lee Witt said that emergency management and \n     civil defense employees put their lives on the line just \n     about every time they respond to an event. Enactment of this \n     legislation will provide them with some assurance that, \n     should death or disabling injury result from the performance \n     of their duty, their families will receive survivor benefits \n     or they will receive disability benefits.\n       If you would like to cosponsor this bill, please have your \n     staff contact Michael Loesch at 4-7412.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Thad Cochran,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This [Act] title and the amendments made by it shall take \n     effect on the date of enactment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington and I have \nbeen in discussion. It is my understanding that the Senator from \nWashington has agreed to taking up the debate on the bill at this time.\n  I ask the Chair for unanimous consent that the committee amendment be \nadopted and considered to be the original text for further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in view of the objection, it would be \nmy intent to announce to the body that I would move to table. I want to \naccommodate my friend from Washington, but I will suggest that at 2:30 \nI will move to table the committee amendment at that hour.\n  Mr. President, let me begin with my opening statement relative to S. \n395.\n  Mr. President, on February 13, the senior Senator, Senator Stevens, \nand I introduced Senate bill 395. Title I of this bill provides for the \nsale of the Alaska Power Administration--known as the APA--the assets \nof that and the termination of the Alaska Power Administration once the \nsale occurs.\n  Further, title II would allow exports of Alaska's North Slope oil, \nreferred to as ANS crude oil, when carried only on U.S.-flag vessels. \nIt is my understanding that Senator Feinstein and Senator Kyl later \ncosponsored S. 395.\n  On March 1 the committee heard testimony from the administration, \nfrom the Lieutenant Governor of Alaska, the State of California, the \nCalifornia independent producers, maritime labor, and other proponents \nof Senate bill 395. The administration testified in support of lifting \nthe Alaska North Slope crude oil export ban, and they indicated that \nthe bill should be amended to provide for an appropriate environmental \nreview to allow the Secretary of Commerce to prevent anticompetitive \nbehavior by exporters and to establish a licensing system. And then on \nMarch 15, after agreeing to work with the administration on these \nconcerns prior to bringing the bill to the floor, the committee adopted \nSenate bill 395 by an overwhelming vote. The vote on that was 14 to 4. \nSo it was truly bipartisan support relative to the merits of S. 395.\n  Further, Mr. President, Senator Johnston and I were pleased to offer \na committee substitute. We propose that now as in the original bill. \nTitle I would provide for the sale of the assets of the Alaska Power \nAdministration and title II would authorize exports of Alaska North \nSlope crude carried on American flag vessels with changes to satisfy \nsome Members and administration concerns.\n  Title I of S. 395 provides for the sale of the Alaska Power \nAdministration's assets and the termination of the Alaska Power \nAdministration once the sale is completed.\n  Further, I am pleased to state that the Department of Energy has \ntestified in support of the Alaska Power Administration's asset sale \nand agency termination.\n  In addition, on April 7, 1995, the administration submitted \nlegislation to Congress substantially similar to title I of S. 395. The \ntransmittal letter says:\n\n       This legislation, which is proposed in the President's FY \n     1996 budget, is part of the administration's ongoing effort \n     to reinvent the Federal Government.\n\n  The Alaska Power Administration is quite unique among the Federal \npower marketing administrations. First, unlike the other Federal power \nmarketing administrations, the Alaska Power Administration owns its \npower-generating facilities, which consist of two hydroelectric \nprojects.\n  Second, these single-purpose hydroelectric projects were not built as \na result of the water resource management plan as is the case or was \nthe case with most other Federal hydroelectric dams. Instead, they were \nbuilt to promote economic development and the establishment of \nessential industries.\n  Third, the Alaska Power Administration operates entirely in one \nState, the State of Alaska.\n  Fourth, the Alaska Power Administration was never intended to remain \nindefinitely under Government control. That is specifically recognized \nin the Eklutna national project authorizing legislation. The Alaska \nPower Administration owns two hydroelectric projects, one near Juneau \nat Snettisham and the other near Anchorage at Eklutna. Snettisham is a \n78-megawatt project located 45 miles from Juneau to the south. It has \nbeen Juneau's main power supply since 1975, accounting for up to 80 \npercent of its electric power. Eklutna is a 30-megawatt project located \n34 miles northeast of Anchorage. It has served the Anchorage and \nMatanuska valleys since about 1955 and accounts for 5 percent of its \nelectric power supply.\n  The Alaska Power Administration's assets will be sold pursuant to the \n1989 purchase agreement between the Department of Energy and the \npurchasers. Snettisham will be sold to the State of Alaska. Eklutna \nwill be sold jointly to the municipality of Anchorage, Chugach Electric \nAssociation, and the Matanuska Electric Association.\n  For both, the sale price is determined under an agreed upon formula. \nIt is the net present value of the remaining debt service payments that \nthe Treasury would receive if the Federal Government had retained \nownership of the two projects. The proceeds from the sale are currently \nestimated to be about $85 million. However, the actual sales price will \nvary with the interest rate at the time of purchase.\n  S. 395, in a separate formula agreement, provided for the full \nprotection of the fish and wildlife in the area. The purchasers, the \nState of Alaska, the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Marine \nFisheries, and the U.S. Department of the Interior, have jointly \nentered into a formal binding agreement providing for postsale \nprotection, mitigation and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources \naffected by Eklutna and Snettisham. The agreement makes that legally \nenforceable. [[Page S6653]] \n  As a result of the formal agreement, the Department of Energy, the \nDepartment of the Interior, and the Department of Commerce will all \nargue that the two hydroelectric projects warrant exemption from FERC \nlicensing under the Federal Power Act. The August 7, 1991 purchase \nagreement states in part that\n\n       The National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, and the State agree that the following \n     mechanism to develop and implement measures to protect and \n     mitigate damages, to enhance fish and wildlife, including \n     related spawning grounds and habitat, obviate the Eklutna \n     purchaser and the EAE to obtain licenses.\n\n  This agreed upon exemption from the Federal Power Act's requirements \nto obtain a FERC license will save the purchasers and their customers \nas much as $1 million in licensing costs for each project plus \nthousands of dollars in annual fees.\n  The Alaska Power Administration has 34 people located in my State of \nAlaska. The purchasers of the two projects have pledged to hire as many \nof these as possible. For those who do not receive offers of \nemployment, the Department of Energy has pledged that it will offer \nemployment to any remaining Alaska Power Administration employees \nalthough the DOE jobs are expected to be in other States.\n  Let me turn to title II, Mr. President, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nAmendment Act of 1995.\n  Title II of S. 395 would at long last allow exports of Alaska's North \nSlope crude oil when carried on U.S.-flag vessels. This legislation \nwill finally allow my State to market its major product in the global \nmarketplace and let the marketplace determine its ultimate usage. The \nexport restrictions were first enacted shortly after the commencement \nof the 1973 Arab-Israel war and the first Arab oil boycott. At that \ntime, many people believed that the enactment of the export \nrestrictions would enhance our Nation's energy security. Indeed, \nfollowing the major oil shock of 1979, Congress effectively imposed a \nban on exports.\n  Well, Mr. President, much has changed since then. In part, due to \nconservation efforts and shift to other fuel sources, total U.S. \npetroleum demand in 1993 actually was lower than in 1978. However, in \nthe last 2 years, our consumption of oil has significantly increased \nand our productive capacity has declined. Our dependence on foreign oil \nsources has now gone up. We now produce almost 3 billion barrels a day \nless than we did in 1973. Employment in the oil and gas production \nindustry has fallen by more than 400,000 jobs since 1982. Production on \nthe North Slope has now entered a period of sustained decline. \nThroughput in the Trans-Alaska pipeline has dropped from 2.2 million \nbarrels a day in 1989 to about 1.5 million barrels a day currently. In \nCalifornia, small independent producers have been forced to abandon \nwells or defer further investments to increase production. By \nprecluding the market from operating normally, the export ban has had \nthe unintended effect of discouraging, discouraging, Mr. President, oil \nproduction in California and Alaska. Lifting the ban on Alaska North \nSlope crude oil exports is the first step, the first step toward \nstopping the decline of this Nation's oil production. ANS oil exports \nwill increase our oil production capacity by opening new reserves to \nproduction. This is oil production that our country can count on if it \nneeds it. With an efficient market brought about by exports, we would \nnot have this increased production and resultant increase in energy \nsecurity. With this market distortion eliminated, producers will make \nsubstantial investments, will make investments in California, they will \nmake investments on the marginal field on the North Slope that will \nlead to additional production. Every barrel of additional oil produced \nin California and on the North Slope is one less that would have to be \nimported from the Mideast or elsewhere in the world.\n  In an effort to quantify the likely production response and to \nevaluate benefits and costs of Alaska oil exports, the Department of \nEnergy has concluded a very comprehensive study last year on the \nmatter. In its June 1994 report, the department concluded ``Alaska oil \nexports would boost production in Alaska as well as California by \napproximately 100,000 to 110,000 barrels per day by the end of the \ncentury.'' The study also concluded ANS exports could create up to \n25,000 jobs. These are new jobs that will be created in California and \nto a lesser degree Alaska. Now, Mr. President, some Senators have \nexpressed concern that lifting the ANS oil export ban will jeopardize \nthe supply of ANS crude on the west coast. This is just simply not the \ncase. Washington and California are and will remain the natural markets \nfor ANS crude. Washington and California ports are the closest to \nAlaska and the ANS crude will continue to be supplied to those \nrefineries. The economics simply dictate that as the closest point from \nAlaska and the closest point to significant distribution capability \nbecause of the populations in those areas near those west coast \nrefineries.\n  Furthermore, the only major refinery that opposes lifting the ban is \none that has a 5-year contract with British Petroleum to keep their \nrefinery supplied. It is my understanding there is still approximately \n4 years left on that contract, so there is no immediate suggestion that \nthis or any other refinery is about to have its operation jeopardized \nby this action.\n  Further, the lifting of the oil export ban would relieve pressure \nthat forces some of the ANS crude oil down to Panama, where it is \nunloaded, transported across Panama via a pipeline, and then reloaded \nonto vessels to take it to the gulf coast. It simply makes no economic \nsense to handle the oil that many times and transport it that long \ndistance. That oil is the oil we are talking about, the available oil \nfrom 75,000 to 200,000 barrels a day that would be exported. The market \nin our opinion should determine the price and destination of the ANS \ncrude oil.\n  Mr. President, there has been a long concern in the domestic maritime \ncommunity that lifting this ban would force the scrapping of the \nindependent tanker fleet--these are U.S.-flag vessels that make up the \nsignificant portion of the U.S. maritime fleet under the American \nflag--and this lifting of the ban would destroy employment \nopportunities for merchant mariners who remain a vital contributor to \nour national security.\n  In recognition of this concern, the proposed legislation before this \nbody would require, and I emphasize require, the use of U.S.-flag \nvessels to carry the available oil that would be exported. This is not \nthe first time the law was changed. Some would suggest that this is an \nissue of precedent, but it is not. The law was changed to allow the \nexport of ANS crude oil in 1988 when Congress passed legislation to \nimplement the United States-Canadian Free-Trade Agreement.\n  It agreed at that time to allow the 50,000 barrels a day of ANS crude \nto be exported to and subject to the oil being carried on Jones Act, \nthat is U.S.-flag, vessels.\n  Mr. President, we have been trying to lift the oil export ban for \nsome time. In the past, maritime unions opposed our efforts because \nthey believed it would increase job losses in that industry. Last year, \nthe maritime unions came to the realization that their unions were \nfacing virtual extinction if Alaska oil production continued to \ndecline; in other words, there would be no oil to haul and, as a \nconsequence, no ships to man. So they initiated support for lifting the \nban to help both Alaska and California production if--and I want to \nemphasize this--if it were transported on U.S.-flag vessels with U.S. \ncrews.\n  Mr. President, this current ban no longer makes economic sense. For \nfar too long, it has hurt the citizens of my State. It has severely \ndamaged the California oil and gas industry and has precluded the \nmarket from functioning normally. In other words, you have a free \nmarket out there. It should function as a free market. If this ban is \nleft in place any longer, there is no question that it will further \ndiscourage energy production. It will destroy jobs in California, or \nthe prospects for jobs, as well as in my State of Alaska, and it will \nultimately be the end of our seafaring mariners, the independent U.S. \ntanker fleet and, as a consequence, the shipbuilding sector of our \nNation because, under the current law, these vessels are required to be \nbuilt in U.S. shipyards. And, clearly, if there is no oil to haul, you \nare not going to need any ships, regardless of the mandate that they be \nU.S. vessels with U.S. crews. [[Page S6654]] \n  I am sure we are going to hear from some of our colleagues today \nexpressing concerns that prices will go up, gas prices, gasoline \nprices, on the west coast, if exports of ANS oil are authorized.\n  Well, Mr. President, there is no indication that this is the case. \nThe Department of Energy carefully studied this issue and concluded \nthat consumers would not see a discernible increase in the price at the \ngas pump. The DOE showed that west coast refineries enjoy the widest \nrefiner gross profit margins in the country. Some would ask: Why? Well, \nwe will get into that later on in the debate, I am sure.\n  In other words, the west coast refineries have been able to buy crude \noil for less per barrel than anywhere else in the country because of \nthe proximity of the refiners to the origin of the oil in Alaska, yet \nthey are selling the gasoline or other refined products for more than \nanywhere else in the country.\n  In 1993, the refiners' gross margin on the west coast was more than \n$4 higher than the U.S. average, according to the Department of Energy. \nWholesale gasoline prices in California are consistently 3 or 4 cents \nhigher than in New York, despite the fact that California refiners are \npurchasing cheaper crude than the foreign crude oil shipped into the \neast coast. One wonders why.\n  Another concern we will probably hear today is ANS oil exports will \ncreate environmental hazards, including increased chances of oilspills. \nHowever, the DOE study has taken that into consideration and found that \nexports of Alaskan oil will actually decrease tanker traffic in U.S. \nwaters. And this is the simple reality. Furthermore, any tankers \nexporting ANS oil exported from Alaska will proceed some 200 miles off \nour coast and stay 200 miles or more off our coast while proceeding \noverseas. In other words, this oil, a small amount, in excess, will \nmove from the Port of Valdez and go straight across the ocean, we \nassume, to refiners in perhaps Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, as opposed to \nthis oil going down to the west coast of Alaska, the west coast of \nBritish Columbia, the west coast of the State of Washington, the State \nof California, and Oregon, as well.\n  So to suggest that there is an increase in environmental hazards of \noil spills is simply not true because we are simply not moving this oil \ndown the west coast. It is much safer, as a matter of fact, to \ntransport it across the ocean than down the west coast of the United \nStates.\n  It is interesting to point out, Mr. President, that this oil, this \nexcess oil, would ordinarily have gone all the way down the west coast \nbeyond California and into the pipeline at the Pacific isthmus in \nPanama, where it would have been unloaded, gone across Panama in the \npipeline, and then again reloaded on smaller United States-flag vessels \nto be delivered to the refineries in the gulf coast. The economics of \nthis double handling is the reason this is no longer a viable \nalternative and why we have this excess oil on the west coast.\n  Now there are other concerns that exporting ANS crude will decrease \nwork for the U.S. shipyards. However, in my opinion, it will have the \nreverse effect, simply because more tankers will be needed to trade, it \nwill be necessary to bring a few more ships out. The lay-up fleet will \nprovide significantly more jobs in the maritime market. The reason for \nthat is you are moving the oil further and when you move it further, it \ntakes more time and, as a consequence, you need more ships.\n  Now, the question that somehow this will result in tankers being \nrepaired overseas if the ban is lifted, I think bears some examination. \nBecause if Alaska crude oil production continues to decline, in part \nbecause of the depressed prices caused by the export ban, there will be \nmore tankers put in lay-up and unavailable for repair. And I would \nfurther advise the Chair that, as far as the threat of tankers being \nlifted overseas, there is a 50-percent surcharge that must be paid to \nthe U.S. Government for tankers that are lifted in foreign yards.\n  So, Mr. President, the reality is that it simply makes no sense to \ncontinue this ban at this time. And the lifting of the ban will, in my \nopinion, increase jobs, certainly increase domestic oil production \nwithout any cost to the country. It will be of great benefit to the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I would like to refer a little bit to a little of the \nhistory relative to this matter and try and put into perspective the \nsituation in the State of Alaska as it exists today.\n  We are all aware that Alaska was a pretty good bargain when we \npurchased it from Russia and we paid a favorable price for it.\n  But, you know, we are a little unique in having come into the Nation \nof States in 1959. We have a population of some 560,000 people spread \nout over a vast area roughly one-fifth the size of the United States. \nUntil a few years ago, we had four time zones in our State; now we have \nthree, simply to make it simpler living in Alaska. We have some 33,000 \nmiles of coastline.\n  We have a unique ownership of our land. We have 365 million acres. \nBut if you look at the ownership of that land, you find that the \nFederal Government still owns over 65 percent of that land. Our State \nof Alaska, the State government itself, has about 28 percent. The \nnative people, the aboriginal people of our State, have some 12 \npercent, and the private ownership in our State is somewhere in the \narea of 3 to 4 percent.\n  Our State has been producing nearly 25 percent of the Nation's total \ncrude oil for the last 16 or 17 years. That production was as high as 2 \nmillion barrels a day. Now it is about 1.6 million barrels a day.\n  Coming into the Union in 1959 with the State of Hawaii, while we had \ncamaraderie and a friendship, we in many ways did not have much in \ncommon. We were a large land mass federally owned; Hawaii, a much \nsmaller island land area.\n  We were separated by the Nation of Canada from the continental United \nStates and, as a consequence, as we began to develop, a rather curious \nset of circumstances came about. We found ourselves subject to pretty \nmuch the whims of the Federal Government with regard to development, \nbecause the wealth and resources of our State, unlike many other \nStates, were not controlled by private individuals or private groups in \nresidence. We found ourselves subject to outside ownership and outside \ncontrol.\n  So, as we look at Alaska today, we really have to look at what \nconstitutes the ownership of our resources, what contributes to our \neconomy, where they are domiciled, where our jobs come from in \nrelationship to the development of those resources.\n  As we look at who owns Alaska today, setting aside the 65-percent \nFederal Government ownership, and identify our industries, we first \nlook at our oil industry and find that our oil industry, which is such \na significant factor, is not an Alaska-based industry. It is based in \nTexas, it is based in California, it is based in England, as a \nconsequence of large international companies and not independents \ndomiciled in our State.\n  Our second-largest industry, fishing, for all practical purposes, is \ncontrolled by interests out of the State of Washington, primarily in \nSeattle, and Japan, where a large percentage of the ownership is \nconcentrated. Very little of our fishing industry, as far as the \nprocessing is concerned, is domiciled with ownership in our State. We \nhave a significant number of fishing vessels in our State, but many of \nthe fishing vessels that fish in our State are domiciled in other \nStates.\n  Timber, which is our third-largest industry, is primarily controlled \nby the Japanese and interests in the State of Oregon and, to a lesser \ndegree, in the State of Washington.\n  Mining, which is a tremendous resource potential for Alaska, is \nprimarily situated in British Columbia, in England, and in Utah.\n  Our airlines, Mr. President, our largest carrier, Alaska Airlines, is \ndomiciled in the Washington State area in Seattle. We are serviced by \nDelta, Northwest, United. As a consequence, the point I am making is \nvirtually everything that comes in or goes out of Alaska goes through \nthe State of Washington. Even our shipping, and virtually everything we \nuse in our State, comes through the State of Washington. Sea-Land is \nassociated in the Seattle area, yet it is a New Jersey corporation. \nTote, which is a carrier that brings two to three ships a week in \nAlaska, is also domiciled in the State of Washington. Previous to that, \n[[Page S6655]] the State was dependent on transportation by Alaska \nSteamship Co.\n  Some of the more senior Members will undoubtedly recall the ongoing \ndebate that occurred for many years between the late Senator Gruening \nand the Alaska Steamship Co. which he claimed had a vice grip on \nAlaska, its transportation system and, as a consequence, controlled, to \nsome degree, the level of Alaska development.\n  As we look at everything we consume in Alaska--virtually everything--\nour foodstuffs, our beverages, our mattresses, our light bulbs, our \ntoilet paper, everything comes up through the State of Washington.\n  We find many of our oil rigs or activities on the North Slope \nrelative to oil and gas production are fabricated in the State of \nLouisiana and brought up. We have our own transportation system, a \nferry system, which sails out of Bellingham, WA, to Alaska. It has been \nestimated that as much as 20 percent of all the economic activity in \nthe State of Washington is directly associated with activities in \nAlaska. So one can say anything that happens in Alaska stimulating the \neconomy also has a multiplying factor on the State of Washington. Even \nour oil tankers that haul oil go to shipyards, not in Alaska, but \nshipyards in Portland and San Diego, and those ships are not crewed \nwith Alaskan crews, but rely on crews supplied from Washington, Oregon, \nand California.\n  Our cruise ships that come up to our State during the summer months \nsail out of Vancouver, BC, where they are supplied and crewed. They are \nowned by Florida and British interests.\n  So as we look at Alaska coming into the Union after all the rest of \nthe States have established their land patterns, and so forth, we found \nthat we had a rather curious set of circumstances. We have the reality \nthat we are dependent, in a sense, for supply by our States to the \nsouth. The benefits are primarily concentrated in the State of \nWashington.\n  I think perhaps a little further history is appropriate as we look \nback on how some of these policies developed, and it is fair to say \nthat back in the twenties there was a fear from the State of \nWashington, the Seattle area, that perhaps Vancouver, BC, or Prince \nRupert, BC, might begin to supply the frontier country of Alaska. To \nensure this profitable business activity generated through the State of \nWashington was not lost, there was an action by the Washington State \ndelegation. That delegation was basically responsible for getting the \nJones Act passed.\n  This was a rather interesting piece of legislation that said that \ngoods and services that moved between two U.S. ports had to go in U.S. \nvessels with U.S. crews, built in U.S. shipyards. This action basically \neliminated the British Columbia supplying Alaska goods originating in \nthe United States and carrying them to ports in Alaska.\n  The question is, Who was Jones? You may have guessed it. He was a \nU.S. Senator from the State of Washington. He served in this body 23 \nyears, from 1909 to 1932. Some would say, why, he was doing his job, as \nsome of the opponents today of this legislation can certainly justify, \nbut we have to question, if you will, in Alaska that we were \ntheoretically at that time denied an opportunity to let the market \ndictate the transportation modes to our State.\n  I wonder how the Senator from Alaska would be treated today if I were \nup here suggesting Washington and Oregon not be allowed to export their \ntimber products to the markets of the world or that Boeing would not be \nallowed to sell their airplanes outside the United States or perhaps \npeople in the State of Washington have to eat all their own delicious \napples. This is a part of the issue as some of us in Alaska see it.\n  Our Washington State opponents say oil export of Alaska's surplus oil \nthat has been on the west coast, formerly went through the Panama \nCanal, would harm Washington State because the excess oil on the west \ncoast would not make it favorable for one of their major independent \nrefiners in that area to be able to buy this oil at perhaps a favorable \nprice that is pending.\n  They say the refinery jobs are threatened. I really think this \nargument has no foundation in reality. As I stated earlier, this \nrefinery in question has 5-year contracts and 4 years remaining with \nBritish Petroleum to supply the amount of oil that it needs to that \nrefinery. Perhaps we will get into refinery returns a little later in \nthe debate. But it is fair to say the consumers of Washington State are \nnot benefiting by the abnormally high rate of return on investment in \ncomparison to the refining industry as a whole in this area.\n  In other words, the profits are not necessarily passed on to the \nconsumer. That is really a case for the Washington delegation to \naddress. But it certainly appears that way from the information \nsupplied us by the Department of Energy, which I will make a part of \nthe Record at a later date.\n  Further production of Alaska oil will always find its natural markets \nin the nearest area where there is a refining concentration simply \nbecause of the costs of transportation; and that equates to the \nexisting refineries on the west coast, which are the closest source of \nAlaskan oil.\n  Oregon's opposition is a little different. Washington State does not \nhave, as I understand it, shipyards with the capacity of lifting many \nof the larger U.S.-flag tankers. Several years ago, the Portland area, \non the basis of the assumption that there would be perhaps more oil \nproduced in Alaska, floated a public bond issue and bought a large dry \ndock from the Columbia River and solicited business of hauling out and \ndry-docking Alaskan tankers that were in the Alaskan trade as well as \nother commercial shipping.\n  As we look at the merits of the volume of oil, a quarter of all U.S. \nproduction, except a small amount, goes to the Virgin Islands--I might \nadd, in foreign vessels--that is exempt, and it goes in in these U.S. \ntankers moved down from Alaska to ports in Washington, California, and \nPanama. The Oregon delegation fears that some of this excess oil that \nused to move through the Panama Canal, now with the proposed \nlegislation that would allow it to move into foreign markets, the free \nmarket, even though it would still have to move in U.S. ships with U.S. \ncrews, these ships might be dry-docked in foreign shipyards, even \nthough there is a more, I think, protective piece of legislation in \nplace that addresses this. As I have said before, this requires U.S. \nowners to pay a 50-percent penalty to the U.S. Government on top of the \nforeign shipyard bill.\n  So what we have here is understandable sensitivity. But not much is \nsaid by our Oregon neighbors as to where their shipyard was built. It \nwas built in Japan. That is obviously a question that they saw fit to \npurchase that yard there rather than build it in the United States. \nUnfortunately, that shipyard has had its ups and downs. It has been out \nof work from time to time. And in making some inquiries, we found that \nmost of the tanker traffic that used to be repaired in Portland is now \nbeing repaired in San Diego because we can only assume that yard \nappears to be more competitive, even though, at our urging, the tanker \nindustry has contracted for the repair of two tankers in the Portland \nyard recently, and we will continue to support that yard as much as \npossible.\n  I hope that we can address the concerns of the Oregon delegation \nbecause we are quite sensitive to the fact that they floated a bond \nissue and those bonds are still being retired, and without an adequate \nvolume of business, the ability to retire those bonds is questionable. \nSo we want to assist in every way possible, and we are working with the \nOregon delegation at this time to try to work out some accord.\n  I do not want to mislead the President about the real issue. There is \nan effort to stop Alaska from exporting its excess oil, and I wanted \nthe Record to reflect on the real story and the reasons why.\n  Now, the issue of why excess oil on the west coast needs relief now \ndeserves a brief, expanded explanation. When we were at an all-time \nhigh of our production--some 2 million barrels a day--we simply had to \nmove this excess oil because the west coast refineries could not \nconsume it; the markets were not big enough. So a pipeline was built, \nand it was very interesting. I went down for the opening of it. It was \nbuilt by the Government of Panama in partnership with Northfield \nIndustries, which is an east coast firm, and Chicago Bridge & Iron. It \nwas built to move the excess oil, so the oil would go down from Valdez \nto the Pacific isthmus in U.S.-flag vessels, unloaded, and moved in the \npipeline. I might add, [[Page S6656]] that pipeline was simply a cat \ntrail in the jungle, and the pipe, for the most part, was on the \nsurface. But it did the job.\n  In any event, once the oil was unloaded, the Pacific isthmus went \nthrough the pipeline, reloaded on U.S. small ships and was taken into \nthe Houston refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. Well, as one can easily \nascertain, the economics of that double handling is no longer \nefficient. As a consequence, they can bring in oil in the gulf and \nHouston refineries from South and Central America, offshore Louisiana, \nand Mexico as well, so they are not interested in taking the volumes of \nthe United States oil which is no longer competitive in that market. \nThat is the reason we have this excess on the west coast today.\n  Now, letting the Pacific rim market absorb the excess oil also \ndeserves a brief explanation. First of all, we are not talking about \nvery much oil. The excess is estimated to be somewhere between 75,000 \nto 200,000 barrels per day. The rest of our 1.6 million acres is \nconsumed on the west coast refineries and will continue to be. So if \none looks at the economics of this excess oil, it is a pretty tough set \nof facts, because it will have to compete on some rather difficult \nterms. I ask the Chair to just compare the costs of marketplaces such \nas Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, to take the oil from Alaska, shipped in \nUnited States-crewed tankers that operate at obviously much higher \ncosts, when those same countries can bring in oil much cheaper in \nforeign tankers than they can bring in oil from the Mideast.\n  So there you have an analysis of the economics associated with the \nmerits of getting some of this excess oil off the west coast. But the \nreal concern is the stimulation of oil production in California and \nbringing on the small producers that have been down for some time. And \nonce this excess is removed, you have the capability of this relatively \nlarge volume of small producers being able to bring their oil in \nbecause of the close proximity and reduced transportation costs \nassociated with bringing that oil into the California refiners.\n  So there you have the real issue before this debate. Alaskans, of \ncourse, are sensitive to the significance of sovereignty as it applies \nto what a State produces in the free market system, having the \ncapability of making a determination of just where those resources will \nbe utilized.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, I have some more detail that I would like \nto present to substantiate our concerns over this legislation. I think \nthe best way to do it is to go into some detail relative to the \nbackground associated with the support for this legislation.\n  Last year, for the first time, imports met more than half of our \ndomestic consumption because the domestic production has drastically \ndeclined. By precluding the market from operating,\n the export ban has had an unintended effect of discouraging further \nenergy production.\n\n  With this market disorientation eliminated, producers would make \nsubstantial investments in California and the North Slope that would \nlead to additional production.\n  Every barrel of additional oil produced in California and on the \nNorth Slope is one less than would have to be imported from the Middle \nEast or elsewhere in the world. As I have said before, Mr. President, \nWashington and California are the natural markets for crude. Washington \nand California ports are closest to Alaska, and the ANS crude will \ncontinue to be supplied to their refiners.\n  It simply no longer makes economic sense to handle the oil as many \ntimes and transport it the long distance that has previously been the \ndisposition of that oil on the west coast of the United States. That is \nthe oil that we are talking about. That is the excess.\n  Let me refer to a report from the Department of Energy that addresses \nthis issue. Lifting the Alaska crude oil export ban would, one, add as \nmuch as $180 million in tax revenue to the U.S. Treasury by the year \n2000. It would allow California to earn as much as $230 million during \nthe same period. It would increase U.S. employment, U.S. jobs, by some \n11,000 to 16,000 jobs by 1995 and 25,000 new jobs by the year 2000. It \nwould preserve as many as 3,300 maritime jobs. It would increase \nAmerican oil production by as much as 110,000 barrels a day by the year \n2000. It would add 200 to 400 million barrels to Alaska's oil reserve.\n  Now, Mr. President, these are not figures that have been put together \nby the Senator from Alaska. These are figures released by the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Mr. President, as we address further consideration of the issues \ncovering Alaska's oil export, I think we have to again rely on the \ncredibility of the information. I was very pleased that the Department \nof Energy did such an exhaustive study relative to this issue, before \nthe administration took a position.\n  I am pleased to say that the President of the United States supports \nthis legislation because this legislation is good for America. It is \ngood for America because it decreases our dependence on foreign \nimports. By so doing, we basically keep our dollars home and keep our \njobs home.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, we find that this report by the \nDepartment of Energy, in substantiating our efforts, keeps America in a \nposition of ensuring that we can, through the incentives offered by \nthis legislation, keep our production again flowing from marginal wells \nthat previously have not been capable of being competitive in the \nmarketplace.\n  I am told that several fields in Alaska adjacent to Prudhoe Bay that \nare currently marginal at this time would be brought into production. \nWhen one begins to add up all the benefits of this, why, clearly, it \nbenefits the maritime industry as well.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, I note that the maritime unions, \nwithout exception, support this legislation. As a consequence, they are \nurging Members to evaluate the merits of the legislation before this \nbody.\n  I have already addressed at some length the issue of increased oil \nproduction. I want to talk very briefly now as to the position of the \nadministration in supporting the lifting of the North Slope crude oil \nexport ban. Inasmuch as their indication that the bill, as proposed, \nshould be amended to provide for an appropriate environmental review, \nnow the question of an environmental review would be to allow the \nSecretary of Commerce to address anticompetitive behavior by exporters, \nand to establish a licensing system of some kind.\n  We have addressed those concerns in the committee amendment. Before \nmaking his national interest determination, the President would be \nrequired, under this legislation, to complete an appropriate \nenvironmental review.\n  In making his national interest determination, the President could \nimpose conditions other than a volume limitation. The Secretary of \nCommerce then would be required to issue any rules necessary to \nimplement the President's affirmative national interest determination \nwithin some 30 days.\n  If the Secretary later found that anticompetitive activity by an \nexporter had caused sustained material oil shortages or sustained \nprices significantly above the world level, and that the shortages or \nhigh prices caused sustained material job losses, he could recommend \nappropriate action by the President against the exporter, including \nmodifications of the authority to export.\n  Under Senate bill 395, the President would retain his authority to \nlater block exports in an emergency. In addition, Israel and other \ncountries, pursuant to an international oil sharing plan, would be \nexempted from the United States flag requirement. The compromise also \nwould retain a requirement of an annual report by the President on the \nability of the refiners to acquire crude oil, and a GAO report \nassessing the impact of ANS exports on consumers, independent refiners, \nshipbuilders, and ship repair yards.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me be specific on some of the principal \nbenefits. The principal benefit, of course, is increased oil \nproduction. The Department of Energy, as I have stated, projects Alaska \nand California production will increase by 100,000 to 110,000 barrels \nper day by the end of the decade. Thus, by the end of this decade, \nexports would stimulate an additional 36.5 million to 40 million \nbarrels per year.\n  And it would create energy sector jobs. Specifically, some 25,000 \njobs on [[Page S6657]] the west coast, as well as an undetermined \nnumber in Alaska. Revenues for the Federal Government, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office scoring, raising $55 million to $59 million \nover 5 years. It would raise State revenues.\n  Using different assumptions, the Department of Energy concluded that \nthe ANS exports would generate up to $1.8 billion in revenues for \nCalifornia and Alaska by the end of the decade.\n  It would decrease net import dependence. It would reduce, as I \nstated, tanker movements by stimulating onshore production in \nCalifornia. Enactment of the bill would actually reduce tanker \nmovements off the California coast, and it would preserve repair \nopportunities by helping preserve the independent fleet that otherwise \nwould be laid up for scrap.\n  The bill would provide shipyard repair work for shipyards in \nPortland, California, and others, that would be lost with the death of \nthe fleet.\n  So, the importance of continued production from Alaska is absolutely \nvital to the continuity of America's merchant marine. And the fact that \nthis legislation would provide relief for the excess oil speaks for \nitself.\n  Let me now draw your attention to some charts that I think explain \nthis in detail, so we will have a little better understanding of just \nwhat the issues are before us. This is the area in Alaska. I wonder if \nI could have the staff provide me with a pointer, if there might be one \navailable at this time, so I can continue my presentation? I think it \nwill be a little more beneficial to have it.\n  What we have here is a chart that depicts in detail the disposition \nof Alaska's north shore crude oil.\n  Let me give this to my associate over here and perhaps he can point \nout where the oil begins, the production area in Prudhoe Bay, which \nwent into production in the 1970's. An 800-mile pipeline was built \nacross the breadth of Alaska. At that time that pipeline was one of the \nengineering wonders of the world. It was first estimated to cost \nsomewhere in the area of $900 million. By the time it was completed, it \nwas somewhere in the area of $7 to $8 billion. There are numerous pump \nstations along the 800 miles of pipeline. The terminus is the Port of \nValdez, and that port handles 25 percent of the total crude oil that is \nproduced in the United States.\n  Let us look at the destination of this oil. Alaska, my State, \nconsumes 70,000 barrels a day in three relatively small refineries. \nThat oil is used in our State for jet fuel, for heating oil, diesel, \ngasoline, and other purposes.\n  Then, first of all we ship from Valdez to our neighboring State of \nHawaii directly, in U.S.-flag vessels, some 60,000 barrels per day. \nThat is utilized in the refinery outside of Honolulu.\n  The second route is a rather curious one. This was by congressional \naction, where we authorized a small amount of oil to go in foreign-flag \nvessels to the Virgin Islands, to the refinery at St. Croix, that is \nthe Amerada Hess refinery in the Virgin Islands which is currently \nunder U.S. flag, obviously, but is not considered a U.S. port in the \ninterpretation of the Jones Act. Some 90,000 barrels of oil go that \ngreat distance around Cape Horn, the southern point of land of South \nAmerica.\n  Then we go to the next half circle. This is the oil we are talking \nabout allowing free market flow, to be exported. This is oil that moves \ndown to Panama. The reason it moves to Panama is, simply, these tankers \ncannot go through the Panama Canal, so they built a pipeline across \nPanama, and it goes to the gulf coast.\n  As a consequence of developments in Colombia, which is down below, \ndevelopments in Venezuela and other areas, including Mexico, the \neconomics of moving this Alaskan oil this great distance, unloading it, \nmoving it across the pipeline and loading it again, and taking it into \nthe gulf coast, when other oil is available, as I have stated, from \nCentral America, South America, and Mexico to the gulf coast--it is \nsimply no longer competitive. So we have this excess of some 75,000 to \n200,000 barrels a day.\n  Let us look at where this oil goes, remaining, in the larger areas. \nThe State of Washington receives some 440,000 barrels per day from \nAlaska. A good portion of Washington--I would say somewhere in the area \nof 95 percent of Washington's consumption is Alaskan oil--as it should \nbe because of the proximity.\n  The rest of the west coast, down in California where we have, in the \nSan Francisco area and Los Angeles area, large accumulations of refined \nproduct. I am told California is currently consuming about 770,000 \nthousand barrels a day. I am very pleased to note the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, is with me on this legislation to allow \nthis export, because she and other Californians recognize the \nsignificant impact of relieving this excess, what it would do to \nstimulate the small operators, and for the creation of new jobs.\n  So that is where the oil goes. I just want to make one more point. As \nAlaska oil declines, the obvious alternative is for these areas to look \ntoward imported oil. That imported oil would not be in U.S.-flag \nvessels. It would come in, in foreign vessels, as some of it currently \ndoes to California and, to a smaller extent, the State of Washington. \nSo that is where the oil goes. It goes in U.S.-flag vessels.\n  What we are talking about, if this legislation is approved by this \nbody, and we do move that surplus out, is a chart very similar to the \nthis one, although you will note there is no oil moving through the \nPanama Canal. We should have included the Virgin Islands as continuing \nto receive their oil, which they will.\n  But the point is the west coast--Washington, Oregon, California--\nclearly are going to receive the same amount of oil. Hawaii will \nreceive the same amount of oil. And this excess that previously went \ndown here is going to be available in the Pacific rim. We have no idea \nwhat the dictate will be, other than it will have to go in U.S.-flag \nvessels and we have reason to believe that those countries have an \ninterest in this oil because of its viscosity and it will be acceptable \nin the marketplace.\n  Mr. FRIST assumed the chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let us see what we have next. These are some rather \ninteresting charts. I talked some time ago about refined gasolines and \nthe price relative to the east coast and west coast. Of course, the \neast coast is dependent on oil coming in from various places around the \nworld. Virtually no Alaskan oil comes on the east coast. It is oil that \ncomes from Central America, Venezuela, the Mideast, and other places. \nWhat we have is the average wholesale price of unleaded regular gas \nfrom California versus New York.\n  We notice in 1985, California was slightly higher than New York; in \n1986 the margin was again substantially higher, 4 cents a gallon; in \n1987 it equalized; in 1988 it equalized. Then, in 1989 we found that \nNew York was higher. In 1990 we found New York was higher. In 1991 we \nfound New York was higher.\n  One would expect the east coast to have higher costs simply because \nof longer transportation to market, bringing that oil in through the \nMideast and other areas.\n  Then, in 1992 we saw a rather curious change. In 1992, we saw New \nYork at 66 and California at 69.\n  When I say California, I am talking about the entire west coast \naverage as opposed to a specific State. When we are talking about New \nYork, we are talking about the entire east coast.\n  In 1993, we saw a differential gain where it was more expensive on \nthe west coast than on the east coast. In 1994, again we saw 57 \ncompared to 60.\n  So the point is that California was higher in the wholesale price of \nunleaded regular gasoline. When one considers that we have had a \nsurplus of oil on the west coast, during that time that we have close \nproximity from the standpoint of Alaskan oil coming down to the \nrefiners, one may begin to question why that is the case.\n  This chart attempts to compare--unfortunately, we could not get more \ncurrent figures than 1993--the refiner growth margins in 1992 dollars \nper barrel. This chart was a consequence of information that was \nprovided us by the Department of Energy. It lists PADD V average, which \nare the distributors of the west coast U.S. refiners. It shows their \ngrowth margins vis-a-vis the U.S. average. As one can see, the west \ncoast gross profit margin per refiner is rather interesting in \ncomparison to the rest of the country. I have no hesitation to \n[[Page S6658]] point out that the business community is entitled to \nwhat the traffic will bear. But it is interesting to see comparisons of \none part of the country vis-a-vis another.\n  This chart actually belonged to the one earlier when we were \ncomparing New York and California or the east coast vis-a-vis the west \ncoast. But as you can see, the spread lengthened over here in 1992 when \nCalifornia wholesale price exceeded that of the east coast price. Maybe \nwe will have a chart that will give us a little further explanation.\n  I would like to defer a little bit to address a concern that we have \nin Alaska. It is evident as we address future years. Clearly, you can \nsee the projections of Alaskan North Slope production. We are here in \n1995, and we are somewhere around 1.6 million barrels per day. That \nproduction, if you will look at the light gray, continues to decline. \nSo this shows how, if we can significantly reduce the decline in the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline oil production, the pipeline will be economically \nviable for a longer period of time. That is what we are talking about \nhere, trying to bring this margin of reserves on line and provide more \njobs and import less oil, all of which I think everyone would agree \nmakes good sense and is in the national interest of our Nation.\n  We have had discussions that would suggest that Alaska North Slope \nexports will increase consumer prices at the gas pump. The reality \ndictates otherwise. The Department of Energy I think carefully studied \nthe issue and found that the consumers would not see any discernible \nincrease in the price at the gas pump. The Department of Energy showed \nthat the west coast refiners, as I have shown on the chart--this is the \nDepartment of Energy talking--enjoyed the widest refiner growth margin \nin the country. West coast refiners are buying crude oil for less per \nbarrel than anywhere in the country. Yet, they are selling their \ngasoline and other refined products for more than anywhere else in the \ncountry. Wholesale gasoline prices, as I have said, in California are \nconsistently 3 or 4 cents higher than in New York.\n  Some say that energy production will not go up, that Alaska North \nSlope exports will not increase oil production in California and \nAlaska. Again, I would defer to the Department of Energy report which \ncarefully studied the issue and concluded that oil production would \nincrease by 100,000 to 110,000 barrels per day by the end of the \ndecade. Both California independents and British Petroleum testified on \nMarch 1 that they expect substantial production increases in California \nand Alaska.\n  Some believe that there will be an increase in oil spills if ANS \ncrude is exported. The reality is that the DOE carefully studied the \nissue and found that the exports will actually reduce tanker traffic in \nU.S. waters, especially in California as a result of the increased on-\nshore production.\n  Furthermore, any tankers exporting ANS oil exported from Alaska will \nproceed as I have said to cross the ocean and not along the shore.\n  Mr. President, I think the Senator from Alaska--I would be happy to \nyield to the Senator from Alaska, if I may retain my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Does that take a \nunanimous-consent?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator use the microphone, please, so we might \nhear what she is saying?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unanimous consent is required.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the President.\n  I am saddened to see the opposition that is coming to the proposal to \ndeal with the distribution of Alaska's oil in the fashion that we are \nfacing right now. I am one of the few Senators who was here at the time \nthe original Mondale amendment passed that restricts the export of \nAlaskan oil. I remember commenting on it at the time that I did not \nthink we would ever sell Alaskan oil to Japan. At that time, we were \nworking on a theory that would have established a crude stream \ninternationally so that Alaskan oil would not be sold to Japan but it \nwould be delivered to Japan, the Saudi Arabian oil would not be sold to \nour east coast but it would be delivered to our east coast, that we \nwould reduce the transportation distance for tankers on the oceans of \nthe world by establishing a crude stream theory, that the crude oil \nwould be delivered to the closest port where it could be utilized, and \nthe sales would take place through arrangements that were made \nthroughout the world with accommodation being made to every producer \nfor the savings on transportation. We were never allowed to establish \nthat concept for a lot of reasons.\n  Just as we still have in place in Alaska the Jones Act that restricts \ntransportation to Alaska of all goods and services from Seattle and \nother places in American-built ships, we are the only place in the \nUnited States where the export of oil is prohibited, and it is only \nprohibited really as far as the oil that is transported in the Alaskan \noil pipeline. I have always said it was unconstitutional. I would \ninvite anyone to read the Constitution.\n It is not constitutional to require that the products of one State be \nexported only through the ports of another State, and that is exactly \nwhat happens to Alaskan oil. Alaskan oil goes to the west coast; it \ngoes to Washington; it goes to Oregon and California, and it is refined \nthere and then the products are exported. They do not consume our oil. \nIt is amazing to see this kind of reaction. I wonder what would happen \nif we said that the corn produced in Iowa can only be exported through \na Chicago exporter. This is the same kind of restriction. It makes no \nsense.\n\n  Interestingly enough, the author of the amendment that originally led \nto this prohibition is now the United States Ambassador to Japan, and \nhe is seeking the removal of the prohibition, as I understand it. We \ncome to the time now where the question is whether there can be an \nexception made for the export of Alaskan oil in U.S.-made vessels, \nU.S.-manned vessels, entirely in accordance with the current situation, \nand have some of the surplus oil that has been developed on the west \ncoast be exported.\n  At the time we passed this amendment, the projections were that what \nwas then known as district 5, the west coast, would be short of oil \nduring this period. To the contrary, because of other imports that are \ncoming into the west coast, there is a surplus of oil in southern \nCalifornia and along the west coast in general. It now appears it would \nbe to the best advantage of our Nation if there is this authority to \nexport a portion of the oil that comes through the oil pipeline.\n  Mind you, Mr. President, that will not apply to any oil discovered in \nAlaska that is now transported through the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. \nIt was one of the conditions we had to agree to at the time we got the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline, authorized by one vote, I might add. It was the \nvote of the then Vice President which broke the tie that developed when \nwe considered the Alaskan oil pipeline amendment to the Right-of-Way \nAct, when that act was originally passed.\n  I find myself in the strange position of wondering why, after so many \nyears, we still have this opposition to Alaskan oil production. It is a \nstrange thing that the area of the country that has benefited most, \nmore than Alaska has ever benefited--Seattle, WA, and Washington State \nhave benefited more from Alaskan oil production than we have in terms \nof jobs and in terms of basic income--it does seem to me it is an odd \nthing that there is opposition to having it go where market forces \nwould take it. I wish we could go back to the concept of the crude \nstream that we were working on at that time. It still makes no sense to \nme to see Middle Eastern oil go around the horn or through other \nmechanisms to get to the Far East, travel all that distance on the \noceans by tanker, and have Alaskan oil reverse that and go down the \nwest coast and through the pipeline [[Page S6659]] and up into the east \ncoast of the United States.\n  That is the system which was brought about by the Mondale amendment \nthat prohibited the export of oil from the United States that had been \ntransported by the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. I do think it is time we \nrecognize that is an unconstitutional restriction on the export of oil \nfrom Alaska only, and remove the obstruction to the export of that \namount that would be exported in American-flag vessels.\n  Now, Alaskans do support the concept of American-flag vessels. That \nis, we like the idea that the American-flag vessels are the vessels \nthat come to the Prince William Sound to receive Alaska's oil for \ntransport. This is a period of time, I think, when we have to recognize \nthat the maldistribution has led to a strange pricing system on the \nwest coast and clearly it will be in the best interests of the United \nStates if we modify this law now.\n  I was most pleased to see the vote on this bill, the amendment to \nthis bill, as it came from the Energy Committee, and I congratulate my \ncolleague and good friend, Senator Murkowski, for the work he has done \nin shepherding this amendment through the committee and to the floor. \nThis was really the subject of the bill that Senator Murkowski and I \nintroduced. S. 395 was introduced in February of this year, and the \nbill has, for all intents and purposes, been added to the bill which \ndeals with the subject of the Alaska Power Administration sale. This is \nan amendment that I think is timely, as I said. We are now in a \nsituation where the pricing of oil is changing drastically. I am sure \nwe have all read the forecasts that are coming now. There is no \nquestion that the concepts of the projections that were made in the \n1960's when we considered this Alaska oil pipeline originally have not \nnow been proven accurate.\n  I do believe that conditions have changed. They have really improved \nto a great extent. In 1978, world crude reserves were estimated to be \n649 billion barrels. But last year, the reserves that had been proven \nreached 1,009 billion barrels. That is a 55-percent increase in the \nworld's known reserves of oil.\n  As a consequence, prices have reflected that increase in reserves. \nThe oil price has dropped. If you put it on a deflator basis and carry \nit through from the times we were debating this basic Mondale \namendment, oil prices are substantially lower than they were then, even \nat today's nominal values.\n  I do believe the Senate ought to take note that even the Washington \nPost reported last year gasoline has never been cheaper than it has \nthis year compared with what people pay for other goods and services. \nIn other words, the distribution system for oil has changed with the \ndiscovery of reservoirs for production of oil throughout the world. We \nhave maintained a protection against a sudden shortage or stoppage such \nas we had at the time we had the Arab oil embargo. We now have a \nstrategic petroleum reserve that has about 600 million barrels of oil. \nWe have other reserves under the control of the Federal Government. \nThere is no reason for us to have a prohibition against the export of \nAlaskan oil based upon a worldwide shortage of reserves.\n  That is also what was talked about back at the time the Mondale \namendment was approved. We thought we were running out of oil and oil \nwas so finite it would not meet the demand of the industrial economies \nover the period ahead, so there was a necessity, they felt, to maintain \nthe oil to be produced from Alaska's North Slope for U.S. markets.\n  Those U.S. markets have been satisfied now, many of them, for years, \nfrom oil from outside the United States at a much lower price than any \noil is produced in the United States. And that is why we are buying it \nfrom overseas.\n  I do not support the concept that we should not have a basic oil and \ngas industry in this country to produce oil and to meet our needs. I do \nthink we should do everything we can to stimulate that industry so it \nhas the productive capability to meet our needs and to continue, along \nwith the strategic petroleum reserve, to meet our needs even in times \nof crisis or embargoes against our purchase from offshore.\n  There is no question that the production of Alaskan oil has changed \nthe overall structure of oil pricing for the great benefit of the \nUnited States, as a matter of fact. We have had considerable impact on \nthe pricing from abroad, and I think that will continue.\n  This is not a bill to bring about the total export of all production \nof Alaskan oil. It is to allow exports on the basis of them being \ntransported out of the United States by American-flag vessels at \nconsiderable cost difference to the prices paid for transportation by \nforeign producers of oil that are bringing oil into the United States.\n  I think that at this time right now, when we need to spur the \ncreation of jobs in the United States, this is a good way to do it. If \nCongress approves this oil export legislation, we believe it will spur \nthe creation of new jobs, spur energy production, and raise revenues \nfor both the Federal and local governments.\n  Small, independent, and other oil producers, maritime labor, and \nindependent tanker owners hope Congress will enact this bill as quickly \nas possible, because they have told us just that. It will create jobs. \nIt will give an incentive to additional energy production and raise \nFederal and State revenues and enhance our basic economic security.\n  I think that energy security is a subject we ought to explore \nsometime. This is part of that concept of spurring the economy to go \nfurther into exploration and discovery of oil. In particular, I think \nit will spur the restoration of the stripper oil wells in the \nsouthwestern part of the United States. The Department of Energy has \nconcluded that if we do export a portion of Alaskan oil, it would \nresult in a substantial net increase in U.S. employment, stimulating \nabout 25,000 new jobs by the end of the decade.\n  As we review this bill, I hope people from throughout the country \nwill understand that approving it will mean that Congress has taken \naction to preserve the independent tanker fleet and to maintain the \nthousands of skilled maritime industry jobs that will be required as we \ngo into this new phase of distribution of Alaskan oil, and it will be \ndone at no cost to the taxpayers. This is a segment of the American \nmerchant marine. They face a bleak future unless there is a stimulus to \nexport some of this oil. The Alaska North Slope exports will help \nsolidify the demand for this tanker fleet.\n  The act of Congress making these exports possible, the Department of \nEnergy has concluded, would raise royalty revenues for the Federal \nGovernment and tax and royalty revenues for the States of Alaska and \nCalifornia. Federal revenues are projected to increase by $99 billion \nto $180 billion in terms of 1992 dollars between 1994 and the year \n2000. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO], has told us that this \nlegislation will raise a net revenue of $55 million. It is a revenue-\nsound proposal.\n  By lifting this ban, Congress will, as I said, restore demand in \nCalifornia and in the Southwest region of the United States. The \nDepartment of Energy projects that oil production will increase by at \nleast 100,000 barrels per day by the end of the decade in that part of \nthe country. That is because the independents face a squeeze in terms \nof the price, due to the fact that there was an excessive amount of oil \nin southern California, in particular. And the stripper wells, the \nsmall producing wells, have gone out of production.\n  We believe that, by giving an incentive to produce, it will bring \nthese new jobs and will give us the chance to have a signal from \nWashington that we believe enhanced drilling activity should take place \nin that part of the country and create new jobs in the area.\n  There is very little, if any, impact of this proposal on the east \ncoast or the gulf coast of the United States. The oil has been going \nthrough the Panama Canal pipeline, the oil that would be exported, and \nthere, too, the markets that the Alaskan oil goes to now have a surplus \nof oil due to the increase of imports in the United States from the \nMiddle East and other parts of the world.\n  My point, Mr. President, is that this is a different oil world than \nwe had when we considered the Alaska oil pipeline amendments in the \n1970's. There is a much greater reserve of oil worldwide, a proven \nreserve, and there [[Page S6660]] is a much different distribution \npattern. The effect of the current distribution pattern is we have \ncreated surpluses on the west coast where, at the time, we had \nprojected that there would have been a shortage if it were not possible \nto limit Alaska's oil production to distribution to south 48 demand \nonly.\n  The administration has supported this bill. The Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee is in support of this legislation. I think \nwe should act on it as soon as possible.\n  The difficulty that I have, really, with the bill is it should have \nhappened a long time ago. We have tried at times to remove this \nprohibition. As the Senate knows, over the years, we had a series of \nvotes on the subject, and always the opposition came from the same \nsource.\n  I hope that the Senate now, with new information, with support of the \nEnergy Department, with the administration's overall support of the \nlegislation, with the concept of American industry now understanding \nwhat it means to them--we now have support from the west coast \nindustries; we have support from the independent tanker operators; we \nhave support from the maritime unions; we have support from the \nmaritime industry in general; and we certainly have support from people \nwho understand what this will mean in terms of restoring jobs along the \nwest coast, as I said, an estimated 25,000 jobs--will support this \nlegislation.\n  This bill also has the sale of the regional Power Marketing \nAdministration, as originally proposed, strangely enough, about the \nsame period of time that the Alaskan oil pipeline amendments were \nadopted, as offered by Senator Mondale, which restricted the export of \noil transported through the pipeline. The administration at that time \nrecommended that the Alaska power authority be sold.\n  We still are working toward getting that approved. The sale of these \nassets will generate between $1.6 and $4.9 billion in terms of the \nDepartment's sale of the regional power marketing administrations. We \nnow have Alaska's marketing agency, a portion of a national plan, and I \nam hopeful that the Congress will approve the national plan, which will \ngo ahead with the recommendations I originally made to the Senate in \nbehalf of the administration in 1973.\n  I think that this will reduce, by the way, the responsibilities of \nthe Department of Energy. There will be a substantial reduction in cost \nto the taxpayers to maintain these regional power marketing \nadministrations, and it makes sense for us to do this now, to take \nadvantage of the circumstances that exist throughout our country and \ntake the Federal Government out of the business of running regional \npower marketing administrations.\n  On permitting export of Alaskan crude, there has been this glut that \nhas been created on the west coast. It keeps the crude oil price \nartificially low. It has meant, as I said, the small stripper wells, \neven some of the medium-sized operators, have gone out of business. \nThey have had no incentive to develop new reserves or to really reach \nout in wildcat areas of great promise.\n  We believe the Mondale amendment has brought about a dependence upon \nthe southwestern area of the United States on cheap oil that comes \nabout because of the cost of transporting that oil beyond California \ndown to Panama through the Panama Canal pipeline, onto another tanker \nand taken up to a market someplace in the south 48 States in the \neastern part of our country.\n  The result of that long trip for the Alaskan oil to reach a market, \nunder the prohibition against export, cannot be sold except in the \nUnited States, is that the sales have been taking place in California \nfar below the market price of oil. It has established, as I said, a \nglut of oil on the west coast. It has kept the prices there so low that \nthey have lost their own industry. We now feel that the California \npeople understand that the result has not been good for that State nor \nfor the Nation. We need the ability to produce from the areas that have \ncapability of producing oil in times of crisis when there is a \nstoppage, when there is a shortage, and this bill before us now will \ngive us that incentive.\n  The Department study that was released in June 1994--I am sure my \ncolleague has talked about it already--has indicated that this will be \nthe case. It has been tested in many places. I do not see anyone \ndiscounting the study that was made by the Department of Energy that \nled to the conclusion that it was in the national interest to pass this \nbill. There are a few local spots where there is a willingness to \nprevent the enactment of legislation in the national interest because \nof some special or private interest on their part. That was an interest \nthat was created, in my judgment, by an unconstitutional provision to \nbegin with, one that should be eliminated. If I had my way it would be \na bill to eliminate it altogether.\n  But this legislation will give authority to export under specific \nconditions. It is a concept that would be consistent with the American \nmerchant marine concept of requiring that our oil be exported in \nAmerican-flag, American-crewed, American-built vessels. I do believe \nthere is a great benefit to the American people as a whole. It is a \nstep that should have been taken a long time ago.\n  It is an interesting thing, I think, to go back and examine some of \nthe history of Alaska's oil industry, Mr. President. When we were \nseeking statehood, there were a great many people who opposed statehood \nfor Alaska because they said such a vast area could not afford self-\ngovernment. And so a series of people made suggestions as to how we \nmight be able to finance our own future, and one of them was to \nincrease the amount of land that Alaska received as compared to other \nStates.\n  The State received from the Federal domain section 16 and 34 out of \nevery township. They had to wait until those townships were surveyed, \nand we find the strange situation that California still is waiting for \na substantial amount of its land, and Utah also and Nevada, because the \nlands have never been surveyed. When we looked at the situation for \nAlaska, when we realized people were willing to allow Alaska to have a \ngreater land grant, and we did obtain a greater land grant, Mr. \nPresident. Congress approved the transfer of 103.5 million acres to \nAlaska out of our 375 million acres. What we did, however, is we \npermitted Alaska to select its land from vacant, unappropriated, \nunreserved lands, and the net result was that we had the opportunity to \ndecide the lands we wanted for our future.\n  The difficulty developed in what we call (D)(2), section 17(D)(2) of \nthe Alaska Statehood Act required us to have a study of the portions of \nour State that should be set aside in the national interest. We then \nproceeded to produce what is known to us as ANILCA, Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act.\n  That lands act restricted our right to the lands we could have and \nrequired a substantial portion of Alaska to be set aside in national \nwithdrawals and no longer available to us for selection.\n  In the process, unfortunately, we have gone back to, again, a real \ndelay factor in the surveying of lands that we have selected. The last \ntime I had an estimate, it would be 2050 before all of the lands we \nhave selected are surveyed and the native lands, Congress subsequently \npassed an act which confers on Alaska Natives a substantial amount of \nland, almost 45 million acres of land, in satisfaction of claims \nagainst the United States for the taking of their lands at the time \nAlaska was acquired from Russia.\n  The reason I mention these delays, Mr. President, is that we have a \nseries of sedimentary basins in Alaska that are capable of producing \noil or gas. Only three of them have been drilled so far. I believe \nthere are 17 of them--I think 15 of them are onshore--that are capable, \nthese areas are capable of producing oil and gas. This bill before us \nhas nothing to do with additional exploration or use of Federal lands, \nbut if you just look at the lands that the State of Alaska has, the \nlands that the native people have a right to under legislation that has \nbeen passed by Congress previously, the great difficulty that we have \nis establishing a mechanism for transport of that oil to market, and \nbeyond that establishing a demand for it.\n  As long as there is a surplus of oil on the west coast, I do not \nperceive that there will be a demand for development of the oil and gas \ncapability of the State of Alaska lands or Alaska Native \n[[Page S6661]] lands. But I do believe that if we can have a bill such \nas this passed and have that glut be removed and restore the incentive \nto the industry to explore for and develop oil in the promising areas \nof the west that are not on Federal lands, they are not in any way \nrestricted by Federal Government policy, then I think we will have a \ndifferent future for our State.\n  That was the intent of the people who brought about the amendments to \nthe Alaska Statehood Act to increase the amount of land to be given to \nour State. I think that our State, in surveying the lands that we would \nselect, tried to select the lands that had potential resource value.\n  However, that resource value is really not predictable now because of \nthis glut of oil. No one really wants to put money into developing oil \nand gas opportunities on Alaska State or Native lands so long as there \nis an existing restriction on the export of oil produced in those \nslopes.\n  Incidentally, that oil is produced from State lands. Many people \nthink the oil is from Federal lands. The State of Alaska owns the land \nfrom which the Prudhoe Bay oil field is produced. We view it as an \nunconstitutional restriction on our State's powers to have this \nrestriction against the export of oil produced from lands owned by the \nState of Alaska.\n  Again, one of the things that makes us so interested in this \nlegislation is the future viability of the lands that we own. Those \nlands are valuable for oil and gas, and I do believe we will see the \nday, when this bill passes, that the independent oil industry will come \nto Alaska and start inventorying these potentials because of the fact \nthat there will be a potential increase in demand for the oil and gas \nfrom our State.\n  We are in a very strange circumstance here, apparently, and that is \nthat we want to try to get this bill to a vote. I, particularly, very \nmuch would like to see that.\n  Mr. President, I am having a little discussion with staff as to the \naccuracy of a comment I made. My memory is that it was the Mondale \namendment. My staff says the amendment that was finally enacted by the \nCongress at the time was the Jackson amendment--the amendment that was \nfinally adopted by the Senate in July 1973. They are right. But I am \nalso right that it was Senator Mondale that raised the subject. I had a \ndebate at length with him at the time, and his amendment was \nsubsequently modified by the former Senator from Washington. It was the \nJackson amendment that finally passed. The initiative for the \nrestriction on the export of Alaskan oil originated with Senator \nMondale. I have, since that time, called it the Mondale amendment. If I \nhave offended anyone by having so referred to it, I am sorry about \nthat. But there is no question that we discussed at length with Senator \nMondale the proposal to restrict the export of oil. I do recall at the \ntime that in order to offset Senator Mondale's proposal, I introduced \nan amendment which would have prohibited the export of oil from any \nState in the Union, which I think would be within the constitutional \npowers of Congress. I did not pursue that, and although Senator Jackson \nopposed the basic Alaska pipeline amendment, he was the one that did \noffer the amendment that was adopted. It was the amendment that \ncurrently is in the law as far as the exporting of Alaskan oil. I hope \nthose on my staff are satisfied.\n  I see my colleague is back. I might say to him, Mr. President, that I \ndo hope that the bill will pass. And as I have said in the Senator's \nabsence, I believe as chairman of the Energy Committee, you have done a \ngreat service for the country, for California, and for our State in \nbringing this subject to the floor in a positive way. I hope other \nMembers of the Senate will address the report he has presented and show \nthe support that we have for the concept now. I do hope that there is \nan overwhelming vote in support of the bill that we have before us to \nbring about both the sale of the power administration, as well as to \nenable the export of Alaskan oil under the circumstances described in \nthe bill.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my senior colleague from Alaska regarding his \ncomments on this very vital issue, which is important not only to our \nState but to the Nation as well.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have a couple of questions that refer to both aspects \nof the bill.\n  First, the power marketing agency. It is my understanding that there \nis a uniqueness to this power marketing agency; for example, the \nWestern Area Power Administration that is in the West, in that \ninstance, it serves a number of States and different municipalities in \na great many uses. It also does not have the generating facility but \nsimply the distribution facility. So it is my understanding that in \nthis bill the Alaska Power Authority is substantially different in \ncomposition, is that correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Wyoming is correct. These two power \nmarketing associations are separate. They are not connected. The \ndistance between Snettisham and Juneau and Anchorage is 600, 700 miles, \nso they are not dependent on one another. The provision for the sale--\nunlike other Federal marketing administrations, the Alaska Power \nAdministration owns its power-generating facilities and hydroelectric \nprojects. It was never contemplated that these two relatively small \nprojects remain under Federal determination. It was the considered \nopinion that once they were up and operating, the contribution to \nutilize the tremendous hydro potential, even though it is a very small \npercentage, that they be disposed of, and as a consequence, we have \nbeen working with the administration in the State of Alaska to achieve \nthis. We feel that the support base is there and, of course, the fact \nthat the Department of Energy and the administration support this, I \nthink, is evidence that we have a constructive proposal here.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator. With respect to the oil export \nportion, I recall the hearings that we had in the Energy Committee. I \nask the Senator if it is not true that we had substantial testimony, \nnot only from Members of Congress from the California delegation, but \nalso representatives of the private sector that dealt with this whole \nbusiness of seeking to develop and encourage the domestic oil market, \nas is the case in Wyoming. We have been very much affected by that. \nThere have been nearly half a million jobs lost in the domestic oil \nindustry over the past 10 years. We now have, of course, the highest \nimports that we have had for a very long time--the highest ever, I \nbelieve. And the testimony, as I recall, was that the opportunity to \nexport some of the oil from Alaska would strengthen the domestic oil \nindustry,\n which would result, I think, in more jobs not only in Alaska but \nperhaps in other parts of the country as well.\n\n  There was testimony about the assistance to the oil production aspect \nto the California economy, as well, of course, as providing an \nopportunity to strengthen the domestic industry as a matter of national \nsecurity. That seemed to me to be the tenor of the testimony. I ask the \nSenator if that is the impression that he had?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, yes, the Senator from Wyoming is \ncorrect. As I recall specifically, the Department recommended in their \nDepartment of Energy report to the U.S. Treasury that by the year 2000 \nthat would be approximately $180 million in tax revenue to the Treasury \nand there would be an increase of employment by some 11,000 to 16,000 \nU.S. jobs immediately, and by the year 2000, 25,000 jobs.\n  I think that was evident in the base of support that was evident when \nthe vote came out of the committee, 14 to 4. The Senator from Wyoming \nwill recall, Senator Domenici, Senator Nickles, Senator Craig, Senator \nThomas, Senator Kyl, Senator Graham, Senator Jeffords, Senator Burns, \nSenator Campbell, Senator Johnston, Senator Ford, Senator Bradley, and \nSenator Bingaman voted to vote out of committee the issue of the oil \nexport relief, as well as the proposal on the Alaska power authority. I \nthink the jobs issue was well covered in that report. [[Page S6662]] \n  Mr. President, I would like to refer to an article that appeared on \nFebruary 22, and it appeared in the Seattle Times. I think it was an \neditorial or an op-ed. It was a column, in any event. It suggests a \nnumber of reasons why it might not be in the national interest to \ncontinue the restrictions on the export of Alaska's North Slope crude \noil.\n  I feel that the facts as confirmed by the U.S. Department of Energy \nreport, the General Accounting Office, and other objective sources show \nthat the export of ANS crude oil on what has been agreed upon, that is \nU.S.-flagged and U.S.-crewed vessels would, indeed, create jobs, \nincrease our energy production, and as a consequence our national \nsecurity, and increase Federal and State revenues.\n  Now, in that particular column there was a reference to the Senator \nfrom Washington that suggested that exports would ``not meet the \nstatutory test designed to protect broader national interests.'' \nFurther, exports would ``seriously hurt consumers, jobs, and the \nenvironment in our own State.''\n  Again, I would refer to the comprehensive June 1994 study by the \nDepartment of Energy which concluded that exporting ANS crude oil on \nU.S.-flagged vessels would, one, again add as much as $180 million in \ntax revenue to the U.S. Treasury by the year 2000; two, increase U.S. \nemployment by 11,000 to 16,000 jobs immediately and by 25,000 jobs by \nthe year 2000; third, preserve as many as 3,300 maritime jobs; fourth, \nincrease American oil production by as much as 110,000 barrels a day by \nthe year 2000; fifth, probably decrease crude oil tanker movement in \nU.S. waters; six, have minimal or nonexistent effect on prices to \nconsumers, since the benefit of the current subsidy to west coast \nrefiners from exports is not shared with consumers of refined products.\n  Now, the statement in the article indicated and was referenced to the \nSenator from Washington that ``over the years Alaska North Slope crude \noil has fueled Washington State. Ninety percent of our crude oil comes \nfrom the North Slope and our refineries are operating at 90 percent \ncapacity. Today this secure supply of oil faces a threat.''\n  The fact is, if exports are permitted, the Pacific Northwest will \ncontinue to be the closest market for ANS crude. Given the low cost of \ntransporting oil to Puget Sound, there is no economic reason why any \noil now going there be in jeopardy.\n  Even the Coalition To Keep Alaskan Oil, which is a rather interesting \norganization--it is an oil refinery-sponsored group, just a few \nrefiners are supporting it now--is opposed to exports. They admitted in \na paper last year that if exports were permitted, only the ANS crude \noil surplus to the west coast requirements would be exported.\n  Excess west coast oil formerly went to Panama and was transported \nacross the isthmus for transfer to smaller United States tankers that \nmoved the oil to gulf coast refineries. That process, which involved \ndual handling of the oil, is now prohibitively expensive given the low \nworld price of oil.\n  Now, the article further attributes to the Senator from Washington \nthat the North Slope has given us a reliable oil supply. Carried aboard \nU.S.-flagged vessels, the ships employ Washingtonians as crew members, \nand ``the tankers, that transport Alaska oil are repaired in the \nPacific Northwest. If export restrictions are lifted, this work will go \noverseas. We could lose 5,000 jobs within our own region and $160 \nmillion in annual employment income. This is more than half of the \nmaritime industry's total west coast employment.''\n  That is not the case. The fact is that exports will aid substantially \nthe maritime industry, and all North Slope crude oil would continue to \nbe carried aboard U.S.-flagged vessels with American crews. Labor \nleaders representing 50,000 members have written the President \nsupporting exports, stating that ``ANS exports will create jobs, help \nmaintain our merchant marine and encourage energy production.''\n  Estimates of job losses are completely unsupported. Further, most of \nthe U.S.-flagged tankers are lifted for repairs in yards currently in \nSan Diego and, to some extent, Portland. The Portland shipyard being \nbuilt in Japan and floated to Portland, portions of that yard have been \nfacing financial problems.\n  I understand there is a competitive posture between Portland and San \nDiego. We have encouraged that consideration be given to the Portland \nbids. As a consequence, it is my understanding that there are two ships \nthat are currently under contract to be repaired in the Portland yard.\n  Further, the article attributes the Senator from Washington saying,\n\n       More than 2,000 jobs at refineries, and Anacortes, \n     Bellingham, and Takoma would be lost. Ninety percent of \n     Alaskan oil is consumed by west coast refiners, and these \n     refiners go into refineries as attributed to the Atlantic \n     Richfield Company, Texaco Company, and Shell, plus \n     independents such as Tosco and a smaller refinery, Summit \n     Oil. Six of these refineries are in our State, the State of \n     Washington, competing against foreign barges willing to pay \n     premium prices. Industry experts predict our refineries will \n     shut down or be forced to pay a premium price to keep their \n     Alaskan supply or to purchase substitute foreign crude.\n\n  That argument just is not based on fact. The facts, the hard, cold \nfacts, are that two of the refiners mentioned support exports--that is \nARCO and British Petroleum--and we have evidence of that, which will be \nentered into the Record. And for Texaco, which has not taken a position \non the issue, supply will be sure. In fact Tosco, one of the refiners, \nhas a supply agreement with British Petroleum that offers, in Tosco's \nown words, ``a reliable, economic supply of Alaska North Slope crude \noil for the next 5 years,'' although it is my understanding there are \nsome 4 years to go on that contractual agreement. Foreign buyers have \nno reason to pay premium prices for Alaska crude, because they can get \ntheir crude oil elsewhere. As stated above, even export opponents have \nadmitted at world prices for Alaska crude oil now going to Puget Sound, \nit will not be exported.\n  Some independent refiners have opposed exports because the market \ndistortion created by the current restrictions allow these refiners to \nenjoy, according to the Department of Energy, ``the largest gross \nrefining margins in the world.''\n  No credible evidence supports the assertion that, ``If forced to \ncompete in a world market like everyone else in the United States, any \nrefiner would have to lay off workers.''\n  Again, I remind my colleagues, one refiner in question, Tosco, \nalready has a long-term contractual supply.\n  Further attributed to the article, the Senator from Washington \nstates:\n\n       Tosco alone has predicted a $1 per gallon increase if \n     exports are permitted.\n\n  The fact is, the Department of Energy has concluded that the \n``economic benefits of export could be achieved without increasing \nprices either in California or in the Nation as a whole, and that the \ncurrent subsidy to west coast refiners from exports is not shared with \nconsumers of refined products.''\n  The refiner, Tosco, in their 1994 quarterly report to the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission stated that:\n\n       At the Ferndale refinery in Washington, refining margins \n     average $4.66 per barrel; retail margins continue to be \n     strong, averaging 11 cents per gallon on sales of some 2.4 \n     million gallons per day.\n\n  Tosco, of course, may be worried about losing this price advantage, \nbut that will not hurt consumers or the national interest. It will \ncontinue to allow this firm to reap profits, which they are entitled \nto. But they are certainly not passing on any savings to the consumer.\n  It is kind of interesting to note why Washington State has some of \nthe highest gasoline prices in the country while the refiners, \nincluding Tosco, have the highest profit margins between the price paid \nfor crude oil and the amount at which they sell their refined product \nor gasoline. In the sense these refiners are closest to the point of \nthe Alaska oil coming down from Valdez, these refiners are those that \nhave the shortest shipping distance; as a consequence, the least \ntransportation costs. But one might conclude the consumers in the State \nof Washington are certainly not recipients of the transportation \nadvantage that is enjoyed by the geographic location of the proximity \nof the refiners to the Alaska oil supply at Valdez.\n  Further reference in the article by the Senator from Washington:\n\n\n[[Page S6663]]\n\n       Since the Arab oil embargoes of the seventies, our reliance \n     on foreign oil has not diminished and the arguments for \n     retaining [that is, the oil export restrictions] remain \n     strong.\n\n  The fact is that exporting Alaska's North Slope--ANS--crude would \nincrease U.S. energy security by stimulating additional production, \nestimated by the Department of Energy at 100,000 to 110,000 barrels per \nday. This will reduce U.S. net oil imports.\n  The United States has already removed restrictions in place in the \n1970's on petroleum product exports and on the price and allocation of \noil, thus improving the efficiency of the market. Exports from every \nState other than Alaska are allowed if certain regulatory requirements \nare met. The effective ban on ANS exports is unique and discriminatory.\n  Further, the article makes reference to comments from the Senator \nfrom Washington:\n\n       With 99 percent of Alaska's crude coming through Puget \n     Sound and 94 percent of this carried on U.S. tankers, foreign \n     replacement oil would not only be more costly, but would be \n     carried on more environmentally risky tankers. The U.S. Coast \n     Guard rates as high-risk one-half of the current foreign \n     tanker fleet that carries crude oil through Puget Sound.\n\n  The fact is, there is simply no basis to assert that the Pacific \nNorthwest will need to import oil to replace ANS crude for the reasons \nalready listed, or that foreign-flag tankers in Puget Sound waters are \nenvironmentally risky.\n  In fact, the Department of Energy has concluded that exports would \n``probably decrease crude oil tanker movement in U.S. waters.'' \nFurther, virtually all the oil coming into Vancouver, BC, comes in \nthrough the Straits of San Juan, adjacent to the State of Washington \nand British Columbia, and it comes in foreign tankers. So there is a \nhigh concentration of foreign tanker activity already coming into the \nSan Juan area, and some of its goes into Puget Sound as well.\n  Another contention is that British Petroleum Corp. would also save \nmoney by having its tankers built and repaired in foreign countries. \nThe fact is that British Petroleum uses and would continue to use U.S.-\nflag, U.S.-built, U.S.-crewed tankers to carry Alaska crude because, \nMr. President, they are a foreign corporation and cannot own U.S. \nvessels. It would make no economic sense for British Petroleum, or any \nother exporter, to reflag foreign-built tonnage to carry Alaska crude, \nwhen abundant U.S.-flag, foreign-built tonnage is already in existence \nin the trade.\n  The ban on the exports of Alaska North Slope crude oil simply makes \nno sense. Reality dictates that it creates an inefficient market that \nbreeds extraordinary returns for a few special interests. And some of \nthese, unfortunately, do not seem to be inclined to pass the benefits \nalong to the consumers. Meanwhile, maritime and oil industry jobs would \nbe lost to this destructive trade restriction.\n  I am sure the Senator from Washington does not begrudge the fact that \nAlaska might benefit from lifting the ban, any more than the fact that \nAlaskans recognize activity in Alaska is very beneficial to the State \nof Washington. I would again suggest, even on this issue, what is good \nfor Alaska is good for the State of Washington.\n  Our States are too close and too intertwined to believe that \nrestrictions on each other's commerce will be good for one at the \nexpense of the other.\n  Mr. President, there are some other items that I want to bring to \nyour attention; that is, some of the charges relative to what the \npassage of this legislation would do.\n  Some have made the argument that as part of the original deal in 1973 \nto authorize construction of the pipeline, Congress saw fit to ban the \nANS exports. Again, I think it is important to note that is not totally \naccurate. Congress did not ban exports in 1973. Instead, for the first \ntime, it restricted all domestically produced crude oil, including ANS \noil, to the same general export restrictions. At the committee's \nhearing on March 1, Senator Stevens, one of the few Senators still \nsitting in this body today who actually cast a vote in 1973, confirmed \nthat there had been no such deal.\n  Mr. President, there is a question of increased foreign oil reliance. \nThe argument is made that by exporting ANS oil, we will increase our \ndependence on the Mideast and other foreign sources of oil. The reply \nto that is quite simple. The Department of Energy concluded that \nenactment of the legislation will decrease our net dependence on \nimports by spurring additional domestic energy production.\n  We have heard the concern expressed from time to time about the \npotential that refinery workers would lose their jobs because refiners \nwould have to pay more for crude oil. Yet, again in response, the \nDepartment of Energy concluded that independent refiners on the west \ncoast have such high gross operating margins that they will be able to \nabsorb any increased crude oil acquisition costs without significant \njob losses. And as the chart that I previously showed, based on the \nfigures at hand, clearly there is justification to understand that is \nindeed the case.\n  There is a question of lost work to foreign yards that would provide \nrepairs. The argument has been made that once exports are authorized, \nthe tankers in the Alaska oil grid will all be repaired in those \nsubsidized foreign shipyards permitting domestic ship repair yards to \nbe no longer economic.\n  Tankers in the Alaskan oil trade are free to go abroad for repairs \ntoday. They rarely do, however, because foreign repairs are subject to \na 50-percent ad valorem duty. One might wonder about some of our \nrestrictive and protectionist types of legislation. This is one of \nthem. A recent court decision, the Texaco Marine decision, will ensure \nthat U.S. Customs will aggressively enforce collection of that 50-\npercent duty, as they should. Some suggested that customs is not doing \nit adequately. I certainly see no reason why customs should not \nactively enforce the law.\n  Furthermore, every tanker that is scrapped as a result of the \ndeclining ANS production is one less tanker that will ever come in for \nneed of repair. By spurring energy production, the bill will actually \nincrease repair opportunities for U.S. shipyards. As long as U.S. \nshipyards, such as the Port of Portland, San Diego, and others, remain \ncompetitive, they should expect to do most of the repair work on the \nfleet simply because the vessels are traversing the waters of the west \ncoast.\n  An argument has been made that ANS exports will destroy the \nshipbuilding sector opportunity to build 1,200 to 1,500 120,000-dead-\nweight-ton tankers over the next 5 years. After this charge was made at \nthe committees hearings, the leading trade association for the tanker \nindustry advised us that not one of its members had a vessel under \nconstruction and not one planned any new building with so many vessels \nsitting.\n  Furthermore, there have been suggestions that there has been some \nviolation of GATT or OECD. The argument has been made that the U.S.-\nflag requirement is an unprecedented extension of cargo preference and \nviolates our international obligation under GATT and GATT's standstill \nagreement and the OECD code. The reply to that is that the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative formally advised the committee that the U.S.-flag \nrequirement did not violate our internal obligations. In adopting the \nUnited States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, Congress specifically \nrequired the use of so-called Jones Act vessels to carry Alaska oil \nexports to Canada. No foreign government currently complained at that \ntime.\n  There has been some concern that the U.S.-flag requirement violates \nthe Treaty of Friendship. That is the FCN, commerce and navigation with \nmany nations. The reply to that is that just this past week the \nadministration testified again that the U.S.-flag requirement does not \nviolate any of our international obligations. The FCN treaties permit \nmeasures in furtherance of our national security such as preserving a \nmilitarily useful tanker fleet.\n  California offshore production. There has been an argument that \nexports will encourage or increase pressure for California offshore \nproduction. I reply to that that the Department of Energy concluded \nthat the California offshore production will not increase because State \nmoratoriums are effectively in place. They simply block any further \ndevelopment. At the committee's March 1 hearing the witnesses \nrepresenting the State of California especially rejected the argument \nsaying [[Page S6664]] that the moratoriums in effect ban further \noffshore development.\n  Mr. President, let me enter into the Record at this time a letter \nfrom our U.S. Trade Representative, Mr. Kantor, to Senator Bennett \nJohnston, dated March 9, 1955.\n\n       Dear Senator Johnston: This replies to your letter of March \n     2, 1995, requesting information on the implications of cargo \n     preference provisions of Senate bill 395 on our obligations \n     under the World Trade Organization and the Organization of \n     Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD.\n       Specifically, you asked if the legislation violates any \n     trade agreements, the potential legal and practical affects \n     of a challenge as well as its effect on the ongoing \n     negotiations on maritime in Geneva.\n       As to WTO violation, I can state categorically that Senate \n     bill 395, as currently drafted, does not present a legal \n     problem.\n       Further, we do not believe that the legislation will \n     violate our obligations under the OECD's code of \n     liberalization of current invisible operations or its \n     companion common principles of shipping policy. However, the \n     OECD does not have a mechanism for the settlement of disputes \n     and its associations and the rights of retaliation.\n       While parties to the OECD are obligated to defend practices \n     that are not consistent with the codes, the OECD process does \n     not contain a dispute mechanism with possible retaliation \n     rights. The OECD shipbuilding agreement, by contrast, does \n     contain specific dispute settlement mechanisms although the \n     agreement does not address flag or crew issues.\n       Your letter requests guidance on the implications of Senate \n     bill 395 on the GATT's ministerial decision on negotiations \n     of maritime transport service . . . which is the document \n     that guides the current negotiations on maritime and the WTO. \n     The maritime decision contains a political commitment by each \n     participant not to adopt restrictive measures that would \n     improve its ``negotiating position'' during the negotiations \n     which expire in 1996.\n       This political commitment is generally referred to as a \n     ``peace clause.'' Actions inconsistent with the ``peace \n     clause'' or any other aspect of the maritime decision cannot \n     give rise to a dispute under the WTO since such decisions are \n     not legally binding obligations.\n       There are, of course, potential implications for violating \n     the ``peace clause'' by adopting new restrictive measures \n     during the course of the negotiations. These implications \n     could include changes in the willingness of other parties to \n     negotiate seriously to remove maritime restrictions that \n     might lead to certain parties simply abandoning the \n     negotiating table. But the maritime decision does not provide \n     the opportunity for retaliation.\n       Our view is that the U.S.-flag preference provisions of \n     Senate bill 395 do not measurably increase the level of \n     preference for U.S.-flag carriers and actually present \n     opportunities for foreign flag vessels to carry more oil to \n     the United States in light of the potentially new market \n     opportunities resulting from enactment of S. 395. Thus, it \n     would be very difficult for foreign parties to make a \n     credible case that the U.S. has ``improved its negotiating \n     position'' as a result of S. 395.\n       For reasons I have explained, we are certain that the U.S.-\n     flag preference does not present legal problems for us under \n     the WTO. However, in the event any U.S. measure were found to \n     violate our obligations, WTO does not have authority to \n     require alterations to affect statutes. That remains the \n     sovereign decision of the country affected by an adverse \n     panel ruling.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n\n                Committee Amendment on Page 17, Line 10\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now before the Senate is the \nsecond committee amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have had an extended discussion on \nthe matter of the sale of the Alaska Power Marketing Association, as \nwell as the proposal to allow the export of surplus oil on the west \ncoast of the United States.\n  During the course of the day, the Senate came in at 9:30 a.m. and a \nproposal was to take up the bill. There was an objection to moving to \nthe bill from my friend from the State of Washington. As a consequence, \nfrom approximately 9:30 a.m. until noon, the Senator from Washington \nhad a quorum call in effect, and I had hoped that we could hear the \nparticular position of the Senator from the State of Washington.\n  Unfortunately, that was not the case. There was an agreement to move \nto the bill at 12 o'clock, and it is now 3 o'clock. The amendment that \nwe just tabled is significant and I think was an expression of the \nattitude of the Senate towards this. Mr. President, furthermore, the \nmajority leader tried to accommodate Members.\n  Mr. President, in view of some of the changes----\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I address a question to the manager and \nsponsor of this legislation? The Banking Committee's Subcommittee on \nInternational Finance has jurisdiction which looks remarkably as though \nit may be appropriate to this measure.\n  While I am in general support of the position of my distinguished \nfriend from Alaska, I would like to have an explanation for this body \nas to the jurisdiction and what he feels is the appropriate committee \nreferral. Might I ask that question of the Senator from Alaska?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond. It is my \nunderstanding the Senator from Missouri [[Page S6665]] is a \nsubcommittee chairman of the Banking Committee. The question of \njurisdiction has been addressed by him in the subcommittee context, and \nI wonder, for the Record, if he could give us some background with \nregard to the manner in which they have studied that.\n  Is it not, indeed, the fact that that particular jurisdiction under \nthe Banking Committee, as well as other prohibitions on the export of \nAlaska oil, such as the Mineral Leasing Act, the Export Administration \nAct, and others, were presented in such a way, once the proposal was \nmade with the substantiation falling to include the sale of the two \ngenerating plants in Alaska, that the Chair ruled that it was \nappropriate that it be under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and it is my understanding that ruling of the \nChair still stands.\n  I ask the Chair if there is any reference to anything to the contrary \nto that?\n  I am sorry; I guess the Chair was preoccupied. But the issue that we \nhave before us is the jurisdiction potentially of the Banking \nCommittee, and the Alaska oil export ban is not in the jurisdiction of \nthe Senate Banking Committee because the Alaska oil export originated \nin the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, the bill that is \nstrictly within the jurisdiction of the Energy Committee.\n  The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which is EPCA, includes a \nprovision that generally restricts crude oil exports. This bill is also \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Energy Committee. The bill was \nintroduced but did not reference the Export Administration Act.\n  Furthermore, the Export Administration Act expired, so it no longer \ngoverns the export of Alaskan crude oil. And that is the understanding \nof the Senator from Alaska with regard to the jurisdiction of this \nmatter before the Senate being referred to the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Alaska. We \nwill have further discussions on that. I appreciate the discussion he \nhas conducted and the ruling of the Chair. I think we are going to do \nsome further investigation of that matter. At this point, I appreciate \nvery much his stating his views. We will continue to review that and \nwork at the staff level to assure there is no problem.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Alaska \nwill yield for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is happy to yield for a question from the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I want to commend the two Senators from Alaska for \ntheir work on this measure. I also want to thank them for seeking my \nsupport. Early on in the discussions, because of concerns, I took the \ntime to discuss this with virtually all of the parties involved. In a \nmeeting in my office in September of last year, one of those parties \nwas British Petroleum. British Petroleum would be a major supplier or \npurveyor of Alaskan crude.\n  One of the concerns that I had was that we not create jobs somewhere \nelse and take jobs from our people, specifically the merchant marine. \nThe two authors have been good enough to see to it that the legislation \nreflects that the oil must be transported on American-flag and \nAmerican-crewed vessels and has secured that as a part of the \nlegislation. There is another part to this, and that is American-built \nvessels. But because of a GATT problem, it is not possible to put this \nin the legislation.\n  In September, I received a letter and I would like to quickly read \nthis letter and ask the Senator directly the question. The letter is \naddressed to me and it says:\n\n       Further to discussions with you held September 30, 1994, if \n     the ban on Alaska exports is lifted, BP will commit now and \n     in the future to use only U.S.-built, U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed \n     ships for such exports. We will supplement or replace ships \n     required to transport Alaskan crude oil with the U.S.-built \n     ships as existing ships are phased out under the provisions \n     in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\n       I hope that this commitment satisfies your request that \n     Alaska oil exports be carried on U.S.-built, U.S.-flag ships, \n     manned by U.S. crews.\n           Yours, sincerely,\n\n                                                  Steven Benz,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                     BP Oil Shipping Company, USA.\n\n  My question to the Senator from Alaska is: Is this agreement still in \neffect?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In response to the Senator from California, it is my \nunderstanding, Mr. President, that indeed it is still in effect. I \nshould point out, however, as I know the Senator from California is \naware, British Petroleum, being a foreign corporation, cannot own U.S.-\nflag, U.S.-documented vessels. So British Petroleum contracts with \nprivate U.S. owners that own the U.S. vessels. It is my understanding \nthat since they basically--in the sense of having a long-term charter \nagreement--have dictated this position that they will move BP's oil \nand, for that matter, all the other oil that would flow between Alaska \nand any other American port in a U.S.-flag vessel. But BP itself is \nprecluded by our maritime laws from owning the vessel outright.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate that, Mr. President. It is very \nimportant to me that this U.S.-flag and crewed and, to the extent we \ncan, built ships be used. I take this commitment from BP, however they \nare going to do it, that the oil that they transport will be in U.S.-\nflagged, crewed, and built vessels. I thank them for that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                                 BP Oil, Inc.,\n\n                                Cleveland, OH, September 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Further to discussions with you \n     held September 30, 1994, if the ban on Alaska exports is \n     lifted, BP will commit now and in the future to use only \n     U.S.-built, U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed ships for such exports. We \n     will supplement or replace ships required to transport \n     Alaskan crude oil with U.S.-built ships as existing ships are \n     phased out under the provisions in the Oil Pollution Act of \n     1990.\n       I hope that this commitment satisfies your request that \n     Alaska oil exports be carried on U.S.-built, U.S.-flag ships, \n     manned by U.S. crews.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                                  Steven Benz,\n\n                                        President, BP Oil Shipping\n                                                         Co., USA.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Alaska another \nquestion. It is essentially about jobs. After looking at this very \ncarefully and talking with independent oil producers and the Department \nof Energy, I believe that this legislation will, as the Senators from \nAlaska have stated on the floor earlier, be helpful in producing jobs \nin the State of California.\n  The Department of Energy has some very generous estimates in their \nreport. I am not sure I believe the totality of this, but suffice it to \nsay that they predict 5,000 to 15,000 new jobs very quickly and as many \nas 10,000 to 25,000 jobs by the decade end, most of which they identify \nas taking place in Kern County, CA.\n  I ask the Senator from Alaska if he concurs with this energy \nobservation and would he agree that this would be job-producing for the \nState of California?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in reply to the Senator, it is my \nunderstanding that the Department of Energy has done an exhaustive \nanalysis and agrees that significant job creation would be initiated \nprimarily as a consequence of small, independent stripper producers \nthat currently are having a difficult time maintaining production \nbecause of the excess oil on the west coast that would be removed if \nindeed this legislation becomes law, and that would stimulate \nproduction, investment and, of course, initiate numerous new jobs. And \nthe proximity of that oil to the California refiners is such that it \nwould reduce transportation costs as opposed to bringing the oil down--\nI am not suggesting that California production would increase to the \npoint where it would replace Alaska oil, but it would stimulate that \nmargin of production and cannot compete with the excess oil that is on \nthe west coast today.\n  I am very pleased that my friend from California recognizes that the \nmix of utilization of oil in the California refineries is both Alaskan \nas well as Californian, as well as some imported oil. But there is no \nquestion about the merits of the job creation and margin and operations \ncoming back on line. I think that is why this legislation was so \nunanimously supported by the California independent [[Page S6666]] oil \nproducers, who have worked very hard on this legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I have one last question, and I \nwould like to place a statement in the Record. One of the refineries is \nlocated right in my area and, of course, that is Tosco in the San \nFrancisco Bay area. Among the parties that I discussed this with, Tosco \nwas one of them. It is clear that they had some reservations about the \nlegislation. I did discuss this with the Senator from Alaska, and I \nknow he mentioned this earlier on the floor. I would like him, if he \nwould, to repeat it. It is my understanding that Tosco has been assured \nreasonable supplies of oil even with this agreement in place. I would \nvery much welcome the Senator's response to this in the affirmative or \nnegative, whichever it may be.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, responding to my colleague from \nCalifornia, with regard to Tosco, I am referring to the 1993 PADD IV \nrefinery slate, which is the latest one I have indicating the origin of \noil from the Tosco refinery at Martinez, CA, which is, I think, the \nquestion posed by the Senator from California.\n  The capacity of that refinery is 148,000 barrels a day. That 148,000 \ncomes from the following origins: 56,000 barrels a day comes down from \nmy State of Alaska; 75,000 barrels a day of that refinery's capacity \ncomes from California, that is produced locally in California; 18,000 \nbarrels a day of that refinery's utilization is imported oil.\n  So a little more, 75,000 California, 56,000 from Alaska, 18,000 are \nimported, and there is another Tosco refinery, Ferndale, which is, I \nthink, of interest to the Senator from Washington. The Ferndale \nrefinery capacity is about 89,000, currently operating at 71,000; \n64,000 come down from Alaska, 7,000 are imported--none comes from \nCalifornia, which I am sure is not a surprise.\n  The point of the question of my friends from California, Washington \nand California, are certainly the natural markets for ANS crude. \nWashington and California ports are closest to Alaska as the origin of \ncrude oil, and the ANS will continue to supply those refineries simply \nbecause of the proximity and the lower transportation costs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  It is also my understanding, Senator, that this bill specifies that \nthe President shall determine on an annual basis whether independent \nrefiners in the Western United States are able to secure adequate \nsupplies of crude, and if not, he can so indicate and make further \nrecommendations to the Congress; is this not correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. \nThat is in the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the second committee \namendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to adopt the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The committee amendment on page 13, line 10 was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1078\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1078.\n\n   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike the text of title II and insert the following text:\n\n                                TITLE II\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Title may be cited as ``Trans-Alaska Pipeline \n     Amendment Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. TAPS ACT AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Section 203 of the Act entitled the ``Trans-Alaska Pipeline \n     Authorization Act,'' as amended (43 U.S.C. 1652), is amended \n     by inserting the following new subsection (f):\n       (f) Exports of Alaskan North Slope Oil.--\n       (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6), of this \n     subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     (including any regulation), any oil transported by pipeline \n     over right-of-way granted pursuant to this section may be \n     exported after October 31, 1995 unless the President finds \n     that exportation of this oil is not in the national interest. \n     In evaluating whether the proposed exportation is in the \n     national interest, the President--\n       (A) shall determine whether the proposed exportation would \n     diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum available \n     to the United States; and\n       (B) shall conduct and complete an appropriate environmental \n     review of the proposed exportation, including consideration \n     of appropriate measures to mitigate any potential adverse \n     effect on the environment, within four months after the date \n     of enactment of this subsection.\n\n     The President shall make his national interest determination \n     within five months after the date of enactment of this \n     subsection or 30 days after completion of the environmental \n     review, whichever is earlier. The President may make his \n     determination subject to such terms and conditions (other \n     than a volume limitation) as are necessary or appropriate to \n     ensure that the exportation is consistent with the national \n     interest.\n       (2) Except in the case of oil exported to a country \n     pursuant to a bilateral international oil supply agreement \n     entered into by the United States with the country before \n     June 25, 1979, or to a country pursuant to the International \n     Emergency Oil Sharing Plan of the International Energy \n     Agency, any oil transported by pipeline over right-of-way \n     granted pursuant to this section, shall, when exported, be \n     transported by a vessel documented under the laws of the \n     United States and owned by a citizen of the United States (as \n     determined in accordance with section 2 of the Shipping Act, \n     1916 (46 U.S.C. App. 802)).\n       (3) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the authority \n     of the President under the Constitution, the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), or \n     the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to \n     prohibit exportation of the oil.\n       (4) The Secretary of Commerce shall issue any rules \n     necessary for implementation of the President's national \n     interest determination within 30 days of the date of such \n     determination by the President. The Secretary of Commerce \n     shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in administering \n     the provisions of this subsection.\n       (5) If the Secretary of Commerce finds that anticompetitive \n     activity by a person exporting crude oil under authority of \n     this subsection has caused sustained material crude oil \n     supply shortages or sustained crude oil prices significantly \n     above world market levels and further finds that these supply \n     shortages or price increases have caused sustained material \n     adverse employment effects in the United States, the \n     Secretary of Commerce may recommend to the President \n     appropriate action against such person, which may include \n     modification of the authorization to export crude oil.\n       (6) Administrative action with respect to an authorization \n     under this subsection is not subject to sections 551 and 553 \n     through 559 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 203. ANNUAL REPORT.\n\n       Section 103(f) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6212(f)) is amended by adding at the end thereof \n     the following:\n       ``in the first quarter report for each new calendar year, \n     the President shall indicate whether independent refiners in \n     Petroleum Administration for Defense District V have been \n     unable to secure adequate supplies of crude oil as a result \n     of exports of Alaskan North Slope crude oil in the prior \n     calendar year and shall make such recommendations to the \n     Congress as may be appropriate.''.\n\n     SEC. 204. GAO REPORT.\n\n       The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct \n     a review of energy production in California and Alaska and \n     the effects of Alaskan North Slope crude oil exports, if any, \n     on consumers, independent refiners, and shipbuilding and ship \n     repair yards on the West Coast. The Comptroller General shall \n     commence this review four years after the date of enactment \n     of this Act and, within one year after commencing the review, \n     shall provide a report to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources in the Senate and the Committee on Resources in the \n     House of Representatives. The report shall contain a \n     statement of the principal findings of the review and such \n     recommendations for consideration by the Congress as may be \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 205. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Title and the amendments made by it shall take effect \n     on the date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is an act entitled Trans-Alaska \nPipeline Authorization Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1652), is amended \nwith the new subsection, ``Exports of Alaskan North Slope Oil.''\n  I believe the Chair has the amendment.\n  What we have attempted to do here by this amendment, as reported by \nthe committee, S. 395 would immediately authorize ANS exports carried \nin U.S.-flagged vessels.\n  When the administration testified in support of lifting the Alaska \nNorth [[Page S6667]] Slope crude oil export ban, they indicated the \nbill should be amended, one, to provide appropriate environmental \nreview; and second, to allow the Secretary of Commerce to recommend \naction against anticompetitive behavior by exporters, and to establish \na licensing system.\n  Mr. President, if no one seeks recognition, I propose the question be \nput to the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not believe a quorum call is in order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I asked for a quorum call.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska had the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, will the Presiding Officer \nplease tell me what the pending business is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I call for the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I cannot hear the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Alaska calls for the question.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The parliamentary situation is the amendment \nof the Senator from Alaska is on the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is pending and open for debate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to try to reach a \nconclusion, as I know my colleagues would, relative to this matter. We \nhave had an opportunity coming in at 9:30 this morning whereby we were \nin a quorum call until 12 noon, and the Senator from Washington had \nasked that we be placed in that quorum until such time and she was \ngraciously kind to advise me that we could go on the bill at 12 noon.\n  Since the quorum call was placed by the Senator from Washington, I \nanticipated she would have an opportunity to speak at that time on the \nmerits of the bill or the motion to proceed. I did not attempt to call \noff the quorum and she did not choose to speak.\n  In all fairness, since that time I have held the floor, along with my \nsenior Senator, Senator Stevens. In order to try and resolve this, I \nhad hoped we could get a vote on the question--get the vote today and \nresolve this matter. It is of great interest to my State, and I know it \nis of great interest to the State of Alaska, to my colleague, Senator \nJohnston, as well as Senator Stevens, because we anticipate attaching \nas part of this Senator Johnston's interest in deep water drilling.\n  Last week, the majority tried to accommodate Members by offering to \nbring this bill up at 1 p.m. today, but it is my understanding, and I \nwould be happy to be corrected, that there was an objection from the \nSenator from Washington. So we had to come in at 9:30 a.m. to work out \na motion to proceed.\n  As I indicated initially, the Senator from Washington would not allow \nany agreement on getting to the bill. Then the Senator from Washington \nagreed to letting the bill come up at 12 noon. Then again at noon, \nunfortunately, the Senator from Washington objected to the first \ncommittee amendment being adopted. The Senator also let it be known \nthat if we put in a quorum call she would object to dispensing with it, \nand as a consequence, she did.\n And that, I believe, was when Senator Grams wished to make a statement \nas if in morning business.\n\n  We were then forced to hold the floor--I was somewhat reluctant, and \nI am sure somewhat repetitious in doing so--so we could get a vote at \n2:30. Now we still have objections and it is my understanding now that \nthe objection has been dropped on the second committee amendment.\n  I would like to--perhaps we would find it expedient--without losing \nmy right to the floor, to ask the Chair whether the Senator from \nWashington would inform the Senate what her intentions might be on the \nlegislation that is pending? Specifically, I ask, does the Senator plan \nto offer any amendments? If so, could she inform us what those \namendments might be so we can review them?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond to the \nquestions of the Senator from Alaska. I did come to the floor this \nmorning at 9:30 and did object to the motion to proceed. We then did \nwork out an agreement that the bill would begin to be debated at noon.\n  At that time, I was here on the floor and ready to debate and was not \nable to say anything until the 2:30 rollcall vote. Since that time, \nobviously, there has been an exchange among several Senators.\n  I do have a statement I want to make. I do have a great deal of \ninformation I want to submit for the Record, and I want to be able to \nbring my side out on this argument. I know there are a number of other \nSenators who also wish to present their points of view on this. The \nSenator from California, Senator Boxer, does, and I know the Senator \nfrom Oregon, Senator Hatfield, has a statement. Several other Senators \nhave indicated to me that they would like the opportunity to debate \nthis bill.\n  I also have been told there are a number of amendments that people \nwish to bring forward on this bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond? I am quite aware there are at least \ntwo Senators who are on the floor now. I am most willing and anxious to \nhear from them, as well as to hear from the Senator from Washington.\n  So the Senator is not indicating one way or another whether there are \namendments which she may be offering that we could review during the \ntime under which she and others may speak.\n  I wondered if she has amendments, if the Senator from Washington has \namendments?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, point of information.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Sure.\n  Mr. FORD. Parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska yield for that \npurpose?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FORD. Does the Senator from Washington retain her own right to \nmake her own statement and to offer all amendments without trying to \nreveal that in advance, and not being able to get the floor?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond?\n  Mr. FORD. I asked the Chair a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators may make any statement when they have \nthe floor.\n  Mr. FORD. So it is not a requirement, then, that she reveal what \namendments she would like to have entered? She may have a dozen and \nreduce it to six?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A Senator may make any statements when that \nSenator has the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Kentucky. My purpose in making \nthe inquiry was simply to try to determine whether the Senator from \nWashington would require the Senator to invoke cloture on the measure.\n  Mr. FORD. That is your prerogative. That is your prerogative.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Does the Senator care to indicate that? It would be \nappreciated, simply from the standpoint of expediting the process.\n  If not, that is certainly the right of the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Is the Senator from Alaska asking me that question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska yield to the \nSenator from Washington?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No. I respectfully ask my friend from Washington if it \nis anticipated that the Senator from Washington would require the \nSenate to invoke cloture on this measure. Might that be her intention?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me just respond. Again, I was here at 9:30 this \nmorning to object to proceeding to the bill because of the \njurisdictional questions I had about whether the bill should have gone \nto Banking, which I sit on, which does oversee the Export \nAdministration Act. It did not go through that committee, and that is \nwhy I voiced those objections. [[Page S6668]] \n  I then later agreed to go at noon. But I have not had an opportunity \nto speak to the bill. I intend to do that. I know other Senators do.\n  I also know there are amendments out there. I cannot give a specific \nnumber, or any time, and it will be up to the Senator from Alaska what \nhe determines to do in terms of cloture.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Evidently, it is understood--I certainly anticipated \nthe Senator from Washington, inasmuch as she initiated the quorum call \nthis morning, I assumed she would speak during that time until noon. \nBut that is her right and I respect that right.\n  I look forward to hearing her statement and that of my other \ncolleagues at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator yields the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I do know Senator \nHatfield from Oregon is going to return to the floor and wants to make \na statement, and I will speak until he does get here.\n  Mr. President, I do rise today to oppose S. 395, which is a bill \nthat, in part, allows the export of Alaskan North Slope crude oil. This \nissue, at first glance, may appear very simple. Lifting the ban on \nNorth Slope oil exports would increase sales and enhance revenues for \nmany Alaskans. However, that additional income for a few of our \ncitizens must be weighed against the concerns of the rest of the \nNation.\n  Job loss, price increases, dependence on foreign oil, and increased \nenvironmental risks are all issues that Congress must review--must \nreview--before placing the needs of one State above the concerns of \nmany.\n  When Congress agreed to develop Alaska's North Slope--ANS--crude oil \nresources 20 years ago, it prohibited exports of this oil unless the \nPresident and Congress find that exports serve national economic and \nenergy security, and other interests. Those conditions were a direct \nresponse to the economic chaos and long gas lines created by the Arab \noil embargoes of the 1970's.\n  Since then, our reliance on foreign oil has not diminished. The \narguments for retaining the restrictions remain strong. Over the years, \nAlaska North Slope crude oil has fueled the west coast. Mr. President, \n90 percent--90 percent--of Washington State's crude oil comes from the \nNorth Slope, and our refineries are operating at 90 percent capacity. \nThe existence of export restrictions has created an extensive \ntransportation, refining, and shipyard infrastructure in our region.\n  The North Slope has given us a reliable oil supply, carried aboard \nU.S.-flag vessels. Ships employ Washingtonians in crew and support \npositions, as well as in ports and ship repair yards.\n  Today, this secure supply of oil faces a very serious threat. The \nState of Alaska and British Petroleum, the principal producer of ANS \ncrude, are mounting a major effort to permit ANS exports. They want to \nremove the statutory restrictions. Removal of these restrictions will \nenrich both the State of Alaska's coffers and BP's pockets. But it \nwould seriously hurt consumers, jobs, and the environment in this \nregion.\n  The tankers that transport Alaska oil are repaired on the west coast. \nIf export restrictions are lifted, this work will go overseas. We could \nlose 5,000 jobs within our own region, and $160 million in annual \nemployment income. This is more than half of the marine industry's \ntotal west coast employment.\n  For shipyards, Alaska's crude oil exports would result in the loss of \n$270 million a year. More than 2,000 jobs at refineries in my State \nwould be lost.\n  In addition, the Pacific Northwest would forego most of the $93 \nmillion in annual Federal, State, and local tax payments made by these \nworks and facilities. Mr. President, 90 percent of Alaskan oil is \nconsumed by west coast refineries owned by Atlantic Richfield, Texaco, \nand Shell, plus independents such as Tosco and U.S. Oil.\n  Six of these refineries are in my home State of Washington. Competing \nagainst foreign buyers willing to pay premium prices, industry experts \npredict our refineries either will shut down or be forced to pay a \npremium price to keep their Alaskan supply, or to purchase substitute \nforeign crude.\n  Major oil companies may be able to absorb much of the price increase. \nBut the independents, that own 25 percent of the processing capacity in \nthe Pacific Northwest, will not. They cannot compete with the majors by \nselling their petroleum products at higher prices. As many as 2,500 \npeople could lose their jobs along with the losses of $100 million\n in annual payroll income and $500 million in annual tax payments.\n\n  My concern for our environment makes the case for export restrictions \neven more compelling. Congress opened Alaska's North Slope for \ndevelopment only after it imposed strict conditions to protect that \nregion's fragile environment. Moreover, Washington State and other west \ncoast States also enacted laws and regulations to assure the \ntransportation and processing of this oil is done in a manner that will \nnot injure our environment.\n  With 99 percent of Alaska crude coming through Puget Sound and 94 \npercent of this carried on U.S. tankers, foreign replacement oil would \nnot only be more costly but would be carried on more environmentally \nrisky tankers. The U.S. Coast Guard rates as high-risk one-half of the \ncurrent foreign tanker fleet that carries crude through Puget Sound.\n  Our coastal waters would face an added threat: Increased pollution \nrisks from offshore transfers of crude oil from large foreign tankers \nto smaller ships that can actually deliver the oil to our six \nrefineries.\n  Exporting ANS crude on less expensive foreign vessels would lower \ntransportation costs for British Petroleum and raise their profits. It \nwould also raise revenue for the State of Alaska because the State's \nANS royalty payment is based on the wellhead price, minus \ntransportation costs. BP would also save money by having its tankers \nbuilt and repaired in foreign countries. In short, North Slope's oil \nexports would benefit British Petroleum and increase the Treasury of \nthe State of Alaska, but they are clearly not in the interest of the \npeople I represent.\n  Moreover, I do not believe exports would meet the statutory tests \ndesigned to protect broader national interests. When I weigh the \nbenefits to Alaska and BP against these very serious risks, exports \nmake little sense to me. For the sake of our workers and their \nfamilies, our environment and our energy security, I urge my colleagues \nto listen and oppose this bill and any other efforts to lift the export \nrestrictions.\n  Mr. President, I want to read into the Record some of the editorials \nthat have been written in the last several months regarding this bill \nand the lifting of the Alaska oil ban. The first one comes in the \nSeattle Times, and it is dated March 3 of this year, 1995.\n                          Keep Alaska Oil Ban\n\n       The export ban on Alaskan crude oil has served this country \n     well as a domestic source of valuable petroleum. Contrary to \n     the Clinton administration's desires, this is not the time to \n     overturn the ban, nor the time to imply that over-dependence \n     on foreign oil supplies is over.\n       Oil from the North Slope of Alaska was drilled, pumped and \n     shipped south as part of a massive enterprise intended to tap \n     into a huge domestic reserve. The 800-mile Alyeska pipeline \n     delivers oil to the port of Valdez, Alaska, but it came at \n     enormous cost and large environmental and cultural questions. \n     The most immediate beneficiaries are the residents of Alaska, \n     who receive yearly Permanent Fund checks for the treasure \n     they are sharing with the rest of the country.\n       Alaska's representatives are all in favor of ending the \n     ban--probably because higher prices could give their state \n     $1.6 billion more in royalties in just four more years. But \n     while Alaskans rightly share in the profits from oil, those \n     North Slope holes have since the beginning been considered a \n     national resource.\n       Although nothing in the Alaskan oil equation has changed, \n     the political requirements of Southern California have \n     apparently been heard in the Clinton White House.\n       California refineries are full of Alaskan oil; exporting \n     the oil to its likely buyer, Japan, would stimulate \n     California's own oil fields. Although Department of Energy \n     officials testified motorists would see very little price \n     change at the pump, the very premise of stimulating one \n     region's fields by exporting oil from another region has \n     inherent price risks.\n       There is something smelly about a plan that sends Alaskan \n     oil abroad when the resource should be carefully used at \n     home. The only reason the U.S. imports foreign oil is to meet \n     domestic consumption. Depleting our own resources because \n     some refineries have too much oil goes against the original \n     argument for opening the fields. [[Page S6669]] \n       Shipping Alaska's oil abroad carries a new set of \n     environmental questions for the Pacific Northwest as new \n     maritime routes would be opened. That's not the most serious \n     question about dropping the oil ban, but simply another in \n     the long list of unnecessary actions that would result from a \n     misguided White House political strategy.\n\n  In addition, the Portland Oregonian, on February 26, 1995, printed \nthis editorial:\n\n              [From the Portland Oregonian, Feb. 26, 1995]\n\n Keep Alaska's Oil Here--Lifting Ban on Oil Exports Would Raise Prices \n Here, Hurt Port's Ship Business, Increase U.S. Dependency on Foreign \n                                  Oil\n\n       Congress should sink a bill to remove the 21-year-old ban \n     on exporting Alaskan North Slope crude oil.\n       Instead of lifting the ban, Congress should support \n     legislation introduced by Northwest Sons, Patty Murray, D-\n     Wash., and Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., to extend the export \n     restrictions in the Export Administration Act.\n       Removing the restrictions that limit the sale of Alaska's \n     oil to domestic markets is being promoted with wildly \n     optimistic promises. Proponents include BP America, Alaska's \n     largest oil producer, independent West Coast oil producers, \n     five maritime unions, the U.S. Department of Energy and the \n     states of Alaska and California.\n       They say lifting the ban on Alaskan oil exports would \n     stimulate production of at least 100,000 barrels of oil per \n     day and create up to 25,000 jobs, primarily in Alaska and \n     California, while not causing an increase in the cost of \n     motor fuel prices on the West Coast.\n       Those projections are very questionable. An Energy \n     Department study completed last summer suggested that lifting \n     the ban would create 11,000 to 16,000 jobs (not 25,000). That \n     study also ignored potential job losses in the West Coast \n     ship-supply industry. And it didn't address the potential \n     threat to the economic vitality of the nation's domestic \n     tanker fleet.\n       Here's a more realistic appraisal of the likely outcome of \n     lifting the ban on exports of Alaskan oil:\n       West coast gasoline prices would rise. The ban has \n     depressed West Coast crude oil prices by an estimated $2 a \n     barrel because Alaska oil is forced onto a surplus market \n     here.\n       West Coast oil refiners have enjoyed the world's largest \n     gross margins because of the Alaskan crude's low price. If \n     that oil is withdrawn and exported, don't expect the refiners \n     to swallow their increased costs for\n      replacement crude. They'll surely pass it on to motorists. \n     If the total cost were passed through, it could result in \n     a 7-cent-a-gallon increase at the pump.\n       Ship repair and maintenance work at the Port of Portland \n     will all but disappear. Proponents of lifting the oil-export \n     ban say it would stimulate shipyard work on the West Coast. \n     Not so, say Port of Portland officials. They say their \n     contractors believe the lifting the ban would kill the \n     shipyard business. Alaska tankers account for about 70 \n     percent of the work now, but Port of Portland officials \n     believe that tanker operators would do most of their \n     maintenance work in Japan and Korea once the ban was lifted.\n       U.S. dependency on foreign oil would increase markedly, \n     because replacement of much of the Alaskan North Slope crude \n     oil would come from overseas producers.\n       This comes at a time when U.S. dependency on foreign \n     sources of oil is at an all-time high. About half of the U.S. \n     daily consumption of 17.7 million barrels of oil comes from \n     foreign sources. That's substantially greater dependency than \n     this nation endured before the 1973 oil embargo or during the \n     Persian Gulf War. And government officials predict that \n     imports will represent 59 percent of consumption by 2010.\n        Lifting the ban on exporting Alaskan crude would add to \n     this dependency and make the nation even more vulnerable to \n     international disruptions.\n       The gain in maritime jobs is not worth the cost to this \n     nation's security and the adverse effect that foreign-oil \n     dependency has had on foreign policy.\n       Hatfield and Murray need other Northwest members of \n     Congress to rally behind their leadership on Alaskan oil \n     policy.\n\n  Finally, I will read an editorial from The Bellingham Herald called: \n``Our View.''\n\n              [From the Bellingham Herald, Mar. 19, 1995]\n\n              Our View--Don't Export North Slope Crude Oil\n\n       Energy: Using the domestic oil ourselves reduces dependency \n     on foreign supplies, protects jobs.\n       U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, has introduced a bill \n     to lift the export ban on crude oil from Alaska's North Slope \n     oil fields, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash, has introduced a rival \n     bill that would continue the ban.\n       Murray's bill better protects the best interests, not only \n     of Whatcom County and other regions on the Pacific Northwest \n     where North Slope oil creates thousands of jobs, but of the \n     nation.\n       It makes little sense to propose exporting more domestic \n     oil when we already depend so heavily on imported oil to meet \n     needs and demands at home.\n       Murkowski maintains that lifting the ban would net Alaska \n     an additional $700 million from increased oil sales and \n     create as many as 25,000 new jobs there by 2000.\n       Murray claims that it would cost about 2,000 refinery and \n     ship-repair jobs in Washington, Oregon and California.\n       Competing regional interests aside, Congress should look at \n     what's in the nation's best interest.\n       If the export ban were lifted, foreign vessels could be \n     used to transport the crude oil to other nations. That might \n     pose additional environmental risks as well as eliminate \n     American jobs.\n       Nations such as China are developing industrial and \n     technological-based economies and need more oil. The pressure \n     to cash in on supplying it is intense. Just last week, the \n     Clinton administration had to pressure Conoco to abandon a \n     plan to help Iran develop two large offshore oil fields.\n       Best that we stay focused on what's in our nation's best \n     interest regarding North Slope crude oil and use it \n     ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, I think all three of those editorials very clearly \npoint out that it is in the Nation's best interests to defeat the \nproposal that is before the Senate now. It is in the Nation's best \ninterest to do so.\n  I am going to respond to some of the points that were made by my \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, earlier particularly because he mentioned \nsome with which I have to disagree.\n  He mentioned that the unions support the bill as he has presented it.\n  I would like to read for the Senate who opposes the bill the Senator \nfrom Alaska has presented to us:\n  Communication Workers of America; Industrial Union Department, AFL-\nCIO; Inland Boatmen's International Union; Longshoremen's and \nWarehousemen's Union, International; National Farmers \nOrganization; National Farmers Union; Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers; \nSteelworkers of America, United; Sailors' Union of the Pacific; United \nAuto Workers; Citizen Action; Consumer Energy Council of America; \nAmerican Independent Refiners Association; Huntway Refining Co.; Indian \nPowerine LP; Kern Oil & Refining; Pacific Refining Co.; Tosco Refining \nCo.; U.S. Oil & Refining; Western Independent Refiners Association; \nWITCO Refining Corp.; Atlantic Marine; CBI Industries, Inc., Celeron \nCorp.; COSCOL Marine Co.; Pacific-Texas Pipeline Co.; Penn-Attransco.\n  The list goes on opposing this bill: Avondale Industries; Dillingham \nShip Repair; National Steel & Shipbuilding Co.; Northville Industries; \nPort of Astoria, OR; Port of Portland, OR; Shipbuilders Council of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few of the people, including labor \nunions, who stand strong in opposition to lifting the ban on Alaskan \noil. I think some of the unions that have written to me have very \nclearly defined why they oppose this bill. I again do this because I \nheard my colleague from Alaska say that unions support this \nlegislation.\n  Let me read one from the International Association of Machinists and \nAerospace Workers written to Mr. Robert Georgine, president of AFL-CIO.\n\n       Dear Mr. Georgine: I understand that an amendment may be \n     offered * * * to the maritime reform bill that would \n     eliminate restrictions on the export of Alaska oil. We are \n     told Senator Stevens is planning to offer the change when the \n     Senate Commerce Committee takes up the measure.\n       Our organization strongly opposes this amendment. Exporting \n     Alaska crude oil across the Pacific would place 500 to 800 \n     jobs at the Portland Ship Yard at extreme risk because the \n     ships used to export the oil would be repaired in foreign \n     ship yards, rather than here at home as they are today. The \n     jobs of more local subcontractors also would be threatened as \n     well as several thousand refinery jobs on the West Coast.\n       The proponents of exporting Alaskan oil are the State of \n     Alaska, which stands to gain increased severance tax revenues \n     from these exports, and British Petroleum, the major producer \n     of Alaskan North Slope oil. The losers in this proposal are \n     U.S. workers, U.S. energy security, and U.S. business.\n       As you know, the restrictions on the export of this oil \n     have enjoyed strong bipartisan support over the past 20 \n     years. The last time an effort was made to remove the export \n     ban, the effort lost on a 70 to 20 vote.\n       We strongly oppose this amendment and urge you to do \n     whatever you can to assure that it is not added to the \n     maritime reform bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I have a number of letters from other unions: Sailors \nUnion of the Pacific, Boydoco Oil & Atomic Workers, Metal Trade Union, \nand their message is one and the same, that union members stand \nstrongly in opposition to the legislation that is in front of us.\n  Another point that my colleague from Alaska made was that the \nDepartment of Energy study supported his language in this bill. I want \nall of my [[Page S6670]] colleagues to understand that the Department \nof Energy study addressed the concerns of Alaska and California.\n  I, too, read that report in its entirety, and it does not address the \nissues that are important to Washington State, to Oregon, and indeed to \nthe rest of the Nation. It is written in perspective as to what will be \ngood for Alaska and California. I think it is very important to point \nout that the Clinton administration is not in support as was earlier \nindicated by my colleague from Alaska. The Clinton administration is \nnot in support as the language stands in front of us right now. They \nbelieve that several important concerns need to be addressed, including \njob protection and environmental issues, before they are willing to \nendorse it, despite the DOE study. So I remind my colleagues this is \nnot supported by the Clinton administration at this time. They have \nsaid that they have very serious concerns and are not supporting it as \nit is presently drafted.\n  I also would like to point out the environmental concerns because I \ncan speak for the jobs in my State, and certainly the Senator from \nOregon, Senator Hatfield, will speak in terms of jobs from Portland. \nBut the issue that has not been spoken to here is the issue of \nenvironmental concern.\n  I heard my colleague from Alaska say earlier this morning that this \nbill in front of us is the first step in increasing domestic oil \nproduction. I fear, and I feel many of my colleagues fear, that the \nsecond step will be lifting the ban on oil drilling off the coast of \nAlaska, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ANWR has been a debate \non this floor for many years. Allowing oil drilling there has been \ndebated and defeated many times. Many of us fear that this is, as my \ncolleague from Alaska said, the first step, and the second step will be \ndrilling off the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And I know most of my \ncolleagues do not want to see that occur. I think that is a real \nconcern particularly since the budget that was passed out of the Budget \nCommittee last week has an assumption in it that in order to get to the \nbalanced budget one of the things we are going to do is allow oil \ndrilling off Alaska. That is how we are going to balance the budget.\n  So it is a very real concern. We do not need to pass the first step \nhere in this legislation and pass the second step in the Budget \nCommittee, and I will oppose that as adamantly as I oppose the bill in \nfront of us.\n  I do want to read to this body a letter from the Wilderness Society, \nSierra Club, Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, \nAlaska Wilderness League, and the American Oceans Campaign, because I \nthink it very clearly states for all of us what our environmental \nconcerns should be.\n  This was written last year, June 23, 1994.\n\n       Dear Senator: The Senate will soon be asked to consider an \n     amendment to the Export Administration Act to end the ban on \n     the export of North Slope Alaskan crude oil. We urge you to \n     oppose lifting the export ban for the following environmental \n     reasons:\n       Ending the oil export ban would increase development \n     pressure for sensitive areas like the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge. It is also likely to increase pressure for \n     oil development in fragile areas off the shores of Alaska and \n     California. The expanded development pressure would result \n     from expanded markets, increases in the wellhead price of oil \n     per barrel, and faster depletion of North Slope fields. It is \n     a serious concern that lifting the ban could give nations \n     like Japan a vested interest in our natural resource \n     decisions in Alaska. As long as sensitive areas like the \n     Arctic Refuge and sensitive areas offshore California and \n     Alaska are still not permanently protected from oil and gas \n     development, lifting the export ban is a dangerous idea.\n       Ending the ban is nonsense energy policy. It would be a \n     dramatic reversal of a national policy we thought Congress \n     had long ago resolved. Lifting the oil export ban is \n     inconsistent with any attempt at conservation of domestic oil \n     for domestic use.\n       No environmental analysis has been done on ending the ban. \n     Lifting the ban would open the door to tankers nearly twice \n     as large. More traffic in Prince William Sound would pose \n     greater risks from spills. Changed tanker routes would make \n     Kodiak Island and the fisheries of the Bering Sea more \n     vulnerable to chronic and disastrous spills.\n       Ending the oil export ban could increase the flow through \n     the aging and poorly-maintained Trans-Alaska Pipeline. A \n     major audit recently conducted by the Bureau of Land \n     Management said that the pipeline system poses imminent \n     threats to public and worker safety and the environment. \n     Until the government ensures that the more than 10,000 safety \n     problems with the pipeline are repaired, and that the ballast \n     water treatment and air pollution problems at the Valdez \n     marine terminal are resolved, the Congress should not take \n     actions that could increase the environmental and safety \n     risks.\n       Lifting the oil export ban would increase oil imports into \n     the United States. Because refineries aren't set up to refine \n     the heavier oil produced in California, the Alaska shortfall \n     would be made up by imports which more closely match the \n     Alaska oil density. This means that more foreign-flagged \n     tankers, with less stringent manning standards than U.S. \n     flagged tankers, would be calling on West Coast ports. \n     Because increased imports would be necessary to replace the \n     oil that could now be exported to the Far East, our trade \n     balance would not improve and at the same time we would have \n     less control over our U.S. domestic oil supplies.\n       Ending the oil export ban breaks the promise Congress made \n     to the American People over 20 years ago. At that time, \n     Congress sacrificed Arctic wilderness and put Prince William \n     Sound at risk of tanker spills, but said that the North Slope \n     oil was only to go to U.S. markets. In 1973, Vice President \n     Spiro Agnew went to the Senate floor to cast the tie-breaking \n     vote which ended the intense debate over approval of the \n     Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil export ban was a crucial part \n     of the deal Congress brokered. Congress chose to override \n     pending legal challenges to the pipeline, proclaiming the \n     environmental impact statement to be adequate even though the \n     major issue of risks to the marine environment from tankers \n     was poorly considered.\n       If Congress breaks the deal now and lifts the oil export \n     ban, foreign oil companies like British Petroleum would reap \n     the largest benefits, and the American consumers would be the \n     biggest losers. It would be ironic for Congress to unravel \n     this deal at the same time as Alaskan jurors found Exxon \n     reckless and as 10,000 fishermen and Native residents finally \n     have their day in court.\n       We urge you to oppose lifting the ban on exports of North \n     Slope crude oil.\n\n  Again, that is signed by the Wilderness Society, National Resources \nDefense Council, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club, Alaska Wilderness \nLeague, and American Oceans Campaign.\n  I think this letter very clearly points out to all of us that this is \na major step and can put a lot of us at risk and our environment at \nrisk that many of us care about.\n  It is not a step that should be taken willy-nilly on a Monday, when \npeople are not prepared to think about the long-term, serious \nconsequences. That is why I came to the floor this morning at 9:30 to \nprotest moving to this bill, because it has not gone through the \nBanking Committee where the Export Administration Act has had \njurisdiction over this for a long time.\n  I do believe we have to look much more carefully at all of the \nconditions that are put forth in this and all of the consequences that \nmany of us will have to suffer for a long time to come if the Senate, \nin its haste to get legislation passed, does so without considering the \nconsequences to many of us.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to read into the Record a statement \nby the Wilderness Society and the Alaska Wilderness League that I think \npoints to what the environmental impacts of ending the ban on Alaska \nNorth Slope crude oil exports will cause.\n  ``The Department of Energy's claims about environmental impacts are \nmisleading,'' which refers back to the DOE study.\n\n       DOE hastily included 2 pages of ``environmental \n     implications'' in its report on the economics of ending the \n     oil export ban which were not supported by any analysis or \n     factual substantiation. The Administration has failed to \n     carry out comprehensive environmental analysis required by \n     the National Environmental Policy Act.\n       Ending the oil export ban would increase development \n     pressure for sensitive areas like the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge. It is also likely to increase pressure for \n     oil development in fragile areas off the shores of Alaska and \n     California. If the 20-year export ban is lifted, its effects \n     will be long lasting. Expanded development pressure as \n     projected by DOE would result in faster depletion of domestic \n     oil resources. It is naive at best to believe that the oil \n     industry won't battle to gain access to these ``off-limits'' \n     areas when economic and political factors are right. As long \n     as these sensitive areas are still not permanently protected \n     from oil and gas development, lifting the export ban is a \n     dangerous idea.\n       Environmental and safety problems plaguing the Trans-Alaska \n     Pipeline System (TAPS) should be fixed before considering \n     lifting the ban. It is true that the same old TAPS \n     infrastructure will continue to be used for exported oil, and \n     increased flow due to the new markets would increase the \n     risks. According to a major audit recently done for the \n     Bureau of Land Management, ``the pipeline system poses \n     imminent threats to public and worker safety and the \n     environment.'' More than 10,000 problems were identified, \n     [[Page S6671]] including ``massive violations of the National \n     Electrical Code.'' The ballast water treatment plant at the \n     Valdez terminal is currently inadequate to handle large \n     volumes of the ballast water which must be removed from cargo \n     tanks before they are filled with oil, and bigger tankers may \n     call at the port if the ban is lifted.\n       The oil industry should not be rewarded with higher profits \n     from shipping North Slope oil at the same time it is \n     requesting exemptions from environmental laws. Alyeska, which \n     runs the pipeline for British Petroleum and the other oil \n     company owners, has for years avoided limiting air pollution \n     caused by fumes that are released during tanker loading and \n     recently requested a 12-year delay in meeting air pollution \n     standards for the nation's largest tanker terminal at Valdez. \n     Already, air emissions account annually for over 45,000 tons \n     of pollutants such as cancer-causing benzene, and the \n     terminal is the largest source of volatile organic compounds \n     in the nation.\n       Exports will expose new areas of U.S. coastlines in Alaska \n     to increased risk of oil spills. Changed tanker routes would \n     put Kodiak Island, the Aleutian chain, and the rich fisheries \n     of the Bering Sea at greatly increased risk of chronic and \n     disastrous oil spills. Tankers would still travel through \n     Prince William Sound, placing it at high risk from new spills \n     even as this area still suffers from the effects of the Exxon \n     Valdez. Dumping of the segregated ballast water picked up \n     from foreign ports could introduce exotic organisms that have \n     serious environmental consequences. Lifting the ban would \n     open the door to tankers twice as large.\n       Serious risks to California's coastal environment have been \n     ignored. Increased imports to California replacing North \n     Slope crude shipments would involve much larger foreign \n     tankers. Because of port and draft restrictions at the \n     refineries, there would be increased risks of oil spills \n     because there would need to be lightering, the transfer of \n     oil from the larger tankers to smaller vessels which bring it \n     into port, and therefore an increased number of times cargo \n     is offloaded. The lightering would be conducted by foreign \n     vessels which are less fully exposed to liability claims \n     under OPA-90 than U.S. companies. Increased refining of \n     California heavy crude would result in increased foreign \n     tanker traffic in California waters to export the byproducts \n     such as residual oil which would be produced in excess of \n     California demand.\n       Lifting the ban will not help the U.S. meet its commitments \n     to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions. DOE states thermal \n     enhanced oil recovery in California would increase such \n     emissions, but dismisses the amounts as trivial. However, DOE \n     energy policy should be to achieve further reductions, not to \n     justify increases, in order to fulfill U.S. obligations under \n     the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and to \n     achieve President Clinton's goals in the Climate Action Plan \n     to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.\n\n  Mr. President, these are just some of the environmental concerns that \nwe have before us, but they seriously point out the questions that all \nof us should be asking and have answers to before this ban on oil is \nlifted from Alaska's North Slope.\n  Certainly I heard my colleague from Alaska speak this morning about a \nDOE report and referred to it a number of times as what the basis \nshould be that we vote on, the current amendment before us.\n  As I indicated earlier, the administration is not supportive of the \nlanguage as we currently see it before us on the floor because they do \nhave concerns still about jobs and environmental impact. But I want to \nread to this body a letter from someone who agrees with me on the DOE \nreport. He happens to be a former adviser to the Governor of Alaska. So \nhe is from that region; he is a former adviser to the Governor.\n  His name is Richard Fineberg, and he lives in Alaska. He says:\n\n     Re Exporting Alaska North Slope Crude Oil.\n       Dear Secretary O'Leary: I read with great interest and \n     disappointment your department's report, ``Exporting Alaska \n     North Slope Crude Oil.'' As a former advisor to the Governor \n     of Alaska on oil and gas issues who subsequently prepared \n     several reports for the Alaska State Legislature on North \n     Slope economic issues, I had hoped that your report would \n     answer many important questions about Alaskan oil \n     development. I was disappointed because the report's \n     conclusions appear to be critically dependent on buried, \n     dubious or false assumptions that undercut the validity of \n     the report's conclusions.\n\n  Again, I remind the body I am reading from a letter of Richard \nFineberg, who is former adviser to the Governor of Alaska. These are \nhis words, not mine:\n\n       . . . dubious or false assumptions that undercut the \n     validity of the report's conclusions. For example:\n       The report asserts that Alaska would gain $700 million to \n     $1.6 billion in revenues between 1994 and 2000 if the ban \n     were lifted, and that under low-price scenarios most of that \n     gain would come in 1994-96. Having prepared numerous reports \n     on North Slope profits, production prospects and Alaska \n     revenues since leaving my position in the governor's office \n     in 1989, I must say that these poorly explained estimates \n     appear to be highly implausible. Moreover, 1994 is nearly \n     two-thirds over and if the ban were lifted, ANS sellers and \n     refiners would then require some time to revise contracts, \n     arrange shipments and reconfigure their refinery outputs. \n     With most of 1994 gone, how much of this theoretical amount \n     remains to be captured and how much is already lost to \n     history? I cannot make that calculation because I read the \n     report from cover to cover but could never discover the bases \n     for the $700 to $1.6 billion estimate.\n\n  Again, this is someone who is an expert on Alaskan export of oil.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Although there is a known, fixed relationship between \n     federal income taxes and state revenues on ANS production at \n     the DOE study prices, the DOE report inexplicably estimates \n     federal gains to be well outside that predictable range, at \n     $99 to $188 million. This leads me to believe the DOE report \n     either omitted federal income taxes or did not account for \n     them correctly. In either event, it would appear that \n     producer gains (and, consequently, jobs) may have been over-\n     stated because federal tax effects were not considered, and \n     that federal gains may have been understated. This is \n     precisely the kind of ambiguity that would lead a careful \n     reader to view with great skepticism the conclusions of the \n     DOE report.\n       Regarding incremental North Slope production that might \n     result from lifting the ban, your authors note that ``If \n     exports of ANS crude oil raise crude oil prices or save on \n     costs of shipping and handling, the resulting revenues may be \n     invested in oil production-related projects in the \n     geographical areas where the new profits are made. This is \n     particularly true for small companies, but less so for the \n     major integrated companies.'' (Report, page E-1.) In a \n     footnote, the report states that ``The large ANS producers \n     made it clear in our interviews that they . . . would not \n     necessarily reinvest in Alaska the incremental revenues made \n     as a result of exporting ANS oil.'' The same section presents \n     increased production rates resulting from the ``reasonable'' \n     assumption ``that all incremental revenues for the remaining \n     producers' share is invested in ANS crude production \n     activities that add to reserves'' (major producers Arco and \n     Exxon--45% of ANS production--are\n      factored out because their oil is transferred rather than \n     sold, leaving BP as the remaining major producer). Because \n     major producer BP owns 91% of the remaining production, by \n     its own terms the report's key assumption on reinvestment \n     is clearly not reasonable.\n       The report notes that data ``imply that reserve additions \n     in the range of 200 to 400 million barrels could be produced \n     by the investment resulting from exports of . . . ANS crude. \n     Buy comparison, [c]urrent reserves at Endicott and Point \n     McIntyre, major secondary fields on the North Slope, are 262 \n     and 356 million barrels respectively.'' (Report, at p. 12 and \n     p. 50). For some reason, the report makes no reference to the \n     largest major secondary field on the North Slope, Kuparuk, \n     whose remaining reserves are three times that of the two \n     fields named in the report. Is there a reason for this? The \n     report's second Kuparuk omission referred the reader again to \n     Appendix E--the same place at which the dubious assumptions \n     noted above are supposed to be demonstrated; nothing in that \n     appendix told me whether Kuparuk was included or excluded \n     from your analysis, or why it was omitted from the text.\n       I am limiting myself here to clearly demonstrable examples \n     because time is short; some in your department seem to be \n     rushing toward a decision on BP's behalf. I write, therefore, \n     to make sure that you are aware that the DOE report released \n     June 30 appears to be laced with significant technical \n     defects. These shortcomings make it difficult for me to \n     accept the conclusions one must adopt to assume the economic \n     benefits your report claims the United States will realize \n     from lifting the ban. The reader is asked to believe that \n     California refinery acquisition costs can go up without \n     affecting consumer gasoline prices, and that ANS will realize \n     a premium in Japan because its product slate matches Japan's \n     needs. While I am not prepared to state that such heroic \n     assumptions are invalid, it is my opinion that this report \n     fails to demonstrate them. These assumptions are contradicted \n     by the Coalition to Keep Alaska Oil's June 1994 report, \n     ``Consequences of Exporting Alaska North Slope Crude Oil.'' I \n     do not presume to know who is correct. But I must tell you \n     that the latter report is strikingly accurate in those areas \n     with which I am familiar. More important, the challenging \n     report is much less dependent on the kind of Herculean and \n     undocumented assumptions required to reach the conclusions in \n     the DOE report.\n\n  I will continue reading and remind my colleagues that I am reading \nfrom a letter directly about the DOE's study that has been referenced \nthroughout speech of the Senator from Alaska and kept referring to it. \nI wanted someone who is an expert from Alaska to respond to that. I \nwill read the last of this letter:\n\n       The latter report also sets up the background of raising \n     environmental concerns [[Page S6672]] that are casually \n     dismissed by the DOE report: In particular, California supply \n     ports, pipelines, refinery storage facilities and refinery \n     operations appear to be at risk. And, as my colleague Dr. \n     Riki Ott of Cordova, Alaska, has previously advised you, the \n     DOE report also dismisses serious environmental concerns in \n     Alaska concerning the integrity of the Alaska pipeline and \n     marine transportation delivery system. As a long-time \n     Alaskan, I share Dr. Ott's interests in the environmental \n     issues the DOE report fails to address. But it is the \n     manifest shortcomings in the DOE economic analysis that lead \n     me to ask you to base your decision on better data than the \n     report you released June 30.\n       In sum, I do not believe your department's report provides \n     sound bases for its fundamental conclusions and \n     recommendations. In view of the undiscussed problems \n     associated with lifting the export ban and the absence of \n     convincing support for taking this action, I oppose lifting \n     the ban at this time and request that you address the \n     implications of the DOE report's serious defects before \n     making your decision.\n\n  It is signed Richard Fineberg.\n  Again, I would like my colleagues to know that the arguments in favor \nof lifting the ban have referenced a report from DOE that I have just \nread a letter from, an expert from Alaska who says that a lot of the \nassumptions are incorrect. In addition, the Clinton administration \nitself does not support the language that is in front of us because it \nstill does not address many of their environmental and job issues.\n  I also heard my colleague from Alaska speak about the jobs that would \nbe brought if this legislation is passed. I believe he referenced the \nnumber 25,000. From the perspective of the State of Washington, we have \nmany people employed in our independent refineries. I know Senator \nHatfield from Oregon will be out here in a few minutes to talk about \njobs in his State of Oregon. But while he is on his way, I want to \nshare with my colleagues an article called ``Alaskan Oil Exports Will \nEliminate U.S. Shipyard Jobs.''\n  There has been some question on whether or not jobs would be \neliminated in the United States if this oil ban is lifted. I want to \nread this study to you by the Portland shipyard Port of Portland:\n\n       The recommendation of the Department of Energy study on \n     Alaskan--to lift the twenty-year-old restriction on the \n     exports of that would a eliminate hundreds of shipyard jobs. \n     First, it will cause a severe reduction in the U.S. flag \n     tanker fleet. DOE--\n\n  This refers back to the report.\n\n     assumes that exported oil will be carried on Jones Act ships, \n     but Senators proposing that the ban be lifted would only \n     require that the oil be carried on U.S. flagships, not on \n     Jones Act ships. This means they need not be repaired in U.S. \n     yards. This means lost of jobs in our shipyards here in the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of my colleague, Senator Hatfield, \non the floor. He is a cosponsor of legislation I introduced earlier. I \nwill yield the floor at this time for him to make his remarks.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington \nState, Senator Murray.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to say we have collaborated on \nthis as between Washington State and Oregon, on the basis of the impact \nit has on the Northwest, outside of Alaska. I am happy to say, too, \nthat we have been working with Senator Murkowski's staff and we are \nhoping that we can resolve the problem we have as it impacts upon the \nPort of Portland. I will address that at a later moment.\n  First of all, I would like to distinguish between title I of this \nbill and title II. Title I of this bill provides for the sale of the \nAlaska Power Administration. I support the sale of the Alaska Power \nAdministration, but I do have strong objections to provisions in this \nbill which seek to alter, in a fundamental way, a longstanding \nagreement relating to the Alaskan North Slope crude oil.\n  Mr. President, for over 20 years, Congress has maintained a ban on \nthe export of crude oil from the North Slope of Alaska transported via \nthe Trans-Alaska Pipeline. This agreement, which is based primarily on \nnational energy security, has given rise to many investments and \nbusiness expectations. The legislation now before the Senate, sponsored \nby my good friend from Alaska, the distinguished chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, would lift this export limitation, \nthus allowing unlimited export of oil from Alaska.\n  While I understand and respect the motives of the Senator from \nAlaska, I must oppose his efforts in this case. I believe it is \nindisputably in the national interest to maintain our precious \nremaining supplies of crude oil for domestic use only. To export our \nAlaska reserves, which account for a quarter of current U.S. \nconsumption, at a time when our reliance on unstable supplies of \nforeign oil is again in excess of 50 percent, would be damaging to the \nalready fragile energy security situation of the United States.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that over 50 percent of our consumption is \ndependent upon foreign imports, and from a very fragile part of the \nworld, geopolitically speaking--the Mideast.\n  I have long supported the restricting of Alaska North Slope \nproduction for domestic use only. Beginning in 1979, I sponsored \nlegislation in several sessions of Congress to extend these \nrestrictions. Each time this issue has come before Congress, these \nrestrictions have been extended with strong bipartisan support. In \nfact, each time Congress has strengthened the restrictions with respect \nto Alaska and has added similar restrictions to the export of oil \nproduced in any part of the United States, including offshore oil and \noil contained in the strategic petroleum reserve.\n  I am also aware that sectors of the refining and maritime industries \nhave made substantial investments based on the assurances of Congress \nthat this ban would remain in effect. It would be manifestly unfair to \nupset these reasonable expectations at this stage.\n  I should also point out, in order to complete the legislative \npicture, that Senate bill 414, which I have sponsored with Senator \nMurray, is currently pending before the Banking Committee. Our bill \nwould extend the current export restrictions and is therefore directly \ncontrary to the provisions in the bill presently before the Senate. The \nSenator from Alaska also has a bill, Senate bill 70, which would also \nlift the export restriction, and it is also pending before the Banking \nCommittee. I am troubled that the Senator from New York, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, is not present to \nexpress his views on these matters before his committee.\n  In 1973, shortly after the beginning of the Arab-Israeli war and the \nfirst oil embargo, Congress adopted the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nAuthorization Act. And this legislation authorized a construction of a \npipeline to move oil from lands belonging to the State of Alaska on the \nNorth Slope to a Port at Valdez. The act also amended the Mineral \nLeasing Act to put in place an export restriction on all oil carried \nover Federal rights-of-way. Under this provision, exports were only if \nthe President determined exports would be in the national interest, \nwould not diminish the total quantity or quality of oil in the United \nStates and would be done under the licensing provisions of the Export \nAdministration Act of 1969.\n  A second major oil shock took place in 1979. At that time, in section \n7(d) of the Export Administration Act, Congress effectively banned oil \nexports from the Alaskan North Slope. Congress further tightened \nsection 7(d) in 1985. No rollcall votes have taken place in the Senate \nsince 1984, when this body tabled an amendment offered by my friend \nfrom Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, which would have allowed a limited amount \nof exports at 200,000 barrels per day on U.S. vessels, and the \namendment was tabled on a vote of 70-20.\n  Since the first Alaska oil export restrictions were enacted in 1973, \nthey have provided enduring benefits for our Nation. I speak as someone \nwho has been in the Senate since this ban was put in place and has \nwatched it function. As a result of this policy, we now have an \nefficient transportation infrastructure to move crude oil from Alaska \nto the lower 48 States and Hawaii. In addition, these restrictions have \nhelped limit our reliance on OPEC and unstable Persian Gulf oil \nsupplies. They have also allowed us to enhance our domestic merchant \nmarine that continues to help supply the essential oil requirements of \nour domestic economy and our military.\n  I have also been in this body long enough to learn quite a few \nhistory lessons. And it troubles me that despite two major oil crises \nand the Persian Gulf war, we continue to senselessly rely on foreign \noil as a major energy [[Page S6673]] source. U.S. oil imports now \nexceed half of our daily oil requirement. Government and private \nestimates now predict that by the year 2010, foreign oil imports will \nexceed 60 percent. I consider these levels to be worthy of serious \nconcern. The Clinton administration appears to be aware of the gravity \nof the situation, but I have not been impressed with the \nadministration's proposals designed to address this growing problem.\n  It is my belief that permitting the export of any Alaskan North Slope \ncrude would only exacerbate our already serious problem of reliance on \nforeign oil. By allowing the export of Alaskan oil to Japan and other \nPacific rim countries, we would further increase our dependency on \nMiddle Eastern oil, something I strongly believe--and history supports \nmy belief--puts the lives of United States troops at risk. Exporting \nthis oil could have the effect of increasing consumer petroleum costs \non the west cost and threatening the vitality of our domestic tanker \nfleet. Moreover, Alaskan oil exports would cause job losses in the \nmaritime and related ship-supply industries on the west coast. I see no \nsound policy reason for the Nation to accept these costs.\n  Our ability to withstand future energy crises will certainly be \ntested if we fail to take the appropriate steps now to protect our own \nenergy resources. Keeping this important domestic energy source for \ndomestic use only will affirm the policy of\n keeping this country on the right path toward energy security.\n\n  During the 1973 trans-Alaska pipeline authorization debate, and \nduring the numerous debates on exports since the ban was originally put \nin place, a fundamental issue for me and a majority of Senators has \nbeen this Nation's energy security. The Senate spent weeks debating the \nmerits of allowing the construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline and \none of the primary concerns and points of debate was how this precious \ndomestic supply was to be used to improve the energy security of the \nUnited States..\n  Remarks at the time by Senator Taft give a sense of the direction of \nthe debate.\n\n       It has been stated several times that oil from the Alaskan \n     North Slope will not be shipped to the Midwest. It has also \n     been stated--and feared by many--that a surplus of crude oil \n     on our west coast will result in the export of this fuel to \n     other countries. It is understandable that Americans would \n     question this action when we are so desperately in need of \n     oil in this country. It is also essential that we not be \n     forced to rely too heavily upon oil from Middle Eastern \n     nations who have stated their intentions to play politics \n     with oil to influence foreign politics.\n\n  Recall that in 1973, we were in the midst of an oil embargo and our \nheavy reliance on foreign oil turned very quickly into an economic \ncrisis and a national security emergency. So I think it is fair to say \nthat the Members of the Senate at that time were very much aware of the \ndangers of\n too great a reliance on foreign sources of oil. The Members of the \nSenate at that time knew, better than probably any other class of \nSenators since the attack on Pearl Harbor, that oil is an important \nnational, as well as natural, resource. Because of its ability to \ninfluence the events of nations, oil differs fundamentally from more \nbenign, local commodities.\n\n  In 1973, the Senate was very much divided over whether to allow the \nconstruction of the trans-Alaska pipeline, and I recall Vice President \nAgnew casting the tie-breaking vote on final passage. However, the \nSenate was very clear about one thing: If approval was to be given for \nthe pipeline, any oil transported through that pipeline was to be for \ndomestic consumption only. The oil was not to be sold to foreign \ncountries. The oil was to enhance the energy security of this Nation by \nreducing our reliance on foreign imports.\n  It is clear that we have yet to learn our lesson. This fact is \nillustrated well by the national oil consumption and supply figures \nreleased each year by the American Petroleum Institute. API's reports \nover the past decade show that domestic oil production has continued to \ndecline, while domestic oil demand has continued to increase by \nthousands of barrels of oil a day.\n  In 1970, U.S. crude oil production hit its all time peak of 9.6 \nmillion barrels per day. By 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo, \nUnited States production had fallen to 9.2 million barrels per day. \nToday, the United States produces about 6.6 million barrels per day, a \n28-percent decline since 1973 and a 31-percent decline since 1970. Less \ncrude oil\n is produced by the United States today than was produced 40 years ago \nin 1955.\n\n  According to projections by DOE's Energy Information Administration, \nU.S. crude production will continue to decline over the next decade, to \n5.4 million barrels per day by the year 2000, 5.2 million barrels per \nday by the year 2005. The Department of Energy reports that the United \nStates produced 5.2 million barrels per day in 1950. To add some \nperspective to that number, in 1950, there were 40 million cars on \nAmerica's highways; today there are 143 million.\n  This widening gap between domestic production and demand is being \nfilled by an increasing stream of foreign oil imports. In fact, in \n1991, the same year this Nation sent its young men and women to war in \nthe Persian Gulf to protect an unstable supply of foreign oil, imports \naccounted to approximately 45.6 percent of America's domestic oil \nconsumption. That event should have shaken this Nation into a renewed \ncommitment to energy conservation and convinced us to reduce our \ndangerous reliance on foreign oil. However, our reliance on foreign oil \nimports has increased from 45.6 percent at the time of the Persian Gulf \nwar to approximately 54 percent today. Experts predict a steady \nincrease, approaching 60 percent, in the coming years.\n  This significant reliance on foreign sources of oil merits our \nserious concern and our most thoughtful judgment. Shipping domestic \nsupplies to foreign markets in order to stimulate otherwise marginal \nU.S. production is not, in my view, a prudent way for us to address the \nlong-term energy security of this Nation. Promoters of the\n trans-Alaska pipeline disavowed any desire to ever export oil from the \npipeline, and if my memory serves me correctly, the senior Senator from \nAlaska sponsored an amendment to outlaw exports.\n\n  In 1973, those arguing that we should export our domestic oil \nsupplies did not prevail because exporting our domestic supplies was \nnot in the national interest. Those arguing for exports are no more \npersuasive today. Exporting our finite domestic oil supplies is not a \nprudent method of decreasing our reliance on foreign oil. It was not \nprudent in 1973. It is not prudent today. It is reverse logic of a very \ndangerous sort.\n  By the passage of the 1992 National Energy Act, we now have many of \nthe tools necessary to establish a sound national energy policy. But \nmake no mistake: We have a long way to go to achieve energy \nindependence and energy security in this country. We must commit \nourselves to partnership, to consensus and to cooperation if we are to \nmove our Nation into the role of world leader on numerous energy \nfronts, including in reducing fossil fuel use and increasing renewable \nenergy technology.\n  Maintaining the current requirement that Alaskan North Slope crude \noil is to be used for domestic purposes only is a vital part a rational \nenergy policy for this country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have tried to outline my position in a \ngeneral sense and then, in the historic context, the development of \nthis legislation.\n  I would like to turn now from the general to the specific. The \nSenator from California, a while ago on the floor, was raising the \nquestions about the impact upon jobs and upon the local economy--in \nCalifornia and other west coast cities. I would like to further that \ndiscourse by referring to my own State of Oregon, and its relationship \nto Washington State, because the Port of Portland serves both sides of \nthe Columbia River and the employees of the Port of Portland, many of \nthem, traverse the bridge between the two States and their full-time \nemployment [[Page S6674]] is in the State of Oregon. We have a lot of \nexchange between Vancouver, WA, and Oregon, the city of Portland.\n  Based upon the export restriction policy established by Congress in \n1973, an infrastructure has been developed to transport, refine, and \ndeliver massive amounts of domestic crude oil to American consumers. In \nthe State of Washington, refineries were built by integrated oil \ncompanies and independent refiners to process Alaskan crude. The \ninfrastructure required to receive this type of crude oil and deliver \nit to marketers was also developed. In my own State of Oregon, \nfacilities were built or expanded to repair the dozens of Jones Act \ntankers that carry this oil. In the State of California, refineries \nwere built or expanded, a new pipeline from Long Beach to Texas was \nbuilt, and shipyards were expanded to build and repair tankers in the \nAlaskan trade. A pipeline was built across Panama to provide for the \nmore efficient transportation to gulf coast ports of Alaskan crude that \ncould not be consumed on the west coast. Jones Act oil tankers were \nbuilt to transport the oil to end-use markets. Each of these \ninfrastructure investments was encouraged by Congress as part of its \ncentral policy objective: increased energy security through the \ndomestic use of this important oil supply.\n  This relates to another point that I mentioned earlier in my remarks, \nand upon which I shall now expand. This point is less related to energy \npolicy and more related to fairness.\n  In direct reliance on this act of Congress that put the export \nrestriction in place, and on the enthusiastic encouragement of the \nFederal Government, the citizens of Portland, OR, undertook a major \ninvestment. They voted to tax themselves $84 million to fund a major \nexpansion of the Portland Ship Repair Yard. This expansion program \nincluded acquisition of the largest floating dry dock on the west \ncoast. This dry dock is specially designed for the large oil tankers \nthat haul oil from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. These vessels are known \nas the Alaskan North Slope very large crude carriers [VLCC's].\n  Of the $84 million initially borrowed to complete the facility, $50 \nmillion remains to be paid. It is very likely that this facility, which \naccounts for 500 to 800 family wage jobs, will not continue to be \nviable if the bill currently before the Senate passes and the export \nban is lifted. Exports will provide ship owners with a greater economic \nincentive to have ships repaired in the low-cost East Asian shipyards.\n  Mr. President, $84 million is a great deal of money to taxpayers in \nPortland. This was not an investment based on a Federal handout, but \nrather, it was a city of moderate means putting up its own credit and \ningenuity on the line to invest in a facility of integral importance to \na stated Federal objective. It took a great deal of courage for \nPortlanders to make that investment. But it was not a blind venture. It \nwas based on a great deal of encouragement by Federal officials that \nsuch a facility was a necessary part of the long-term plan for the \nAlaska Pipeline trade.\n  Let me share some of the rhetoric of the time. I believe it is \nhelpful in understanding why the citizens of Portland made this \nsignificant investment and why it would be highly unfair to abruptly \nchange the rules at this point.\n  After it became apparent that the oil would be used for domestic \npurposes only, proponents of constructing the pipeline made a very \nstrong case for the benefits such a pipeline would have for the U.S. \nmaritime industry, and in particular their expectation that the various \ncomponents of the maritime industry would play a vital role in \naccomplishing the broad national objectives that construction of a \ntrans-Alaska pipeline was designed to achieve.\n  Commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans was in the forefront of Nixon \nadministration officials in advocating approval of the pipeline. In \naddressing the Seafarers International Union of North\n America in June 1973, Secretary Stans said the pipeline would help \nrevive U.S. maritime strength. A trans-Canada pipeline was an option \nbeing seriously considered at that time, and Secretary Stans argued to \nthe group that a pipeline across Canada would ``eliminate all the great \nmaritime opportunities that the Alaska line would provide.'' The \nSeafarers agreed and approved resolutions endorsing the trans-Alaska \nroute and another resolution re-endorsing the Jones Act.\n\n  Andrew Gibson, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Maritime Affairs, \nvisited Portland, OR, in May 1973, and made the following remarks to \nthe Propeller Club, a group of maritime interests:\n\n       We have estimated that with the completion of the Alaska \n     Pipeline, a fleet of approximately 30 new U.S. tankers would \n     be added to the American merchant marine to transport the oil \n     from southern Alaska to the West Coast. The construction of \n     these vessels at an estimated cost of $1 billion would give \n     an added stimulus to our shipbuilding industry and would \n     provide approximately 48,000 man-years of work in the U.S. \n     shipyards and allied industries. Manning and maintaining \n     these vessels would create many additional permanent maritime \n     jobs, while the estimated annual operating and maintenance \n     cost of $30 million would provide added employment in the \n     related service industries.\n\n  The debates in Congress added further substance to the understanding \nthat the maritime industry was being called upon to play an important \nrole in the success of the trans-Alaska pipeline. The assumption that \nthis supply was for domestic use only is pervasive. Congressman Young \nmade the case in the House:\n\n       In the maritime industry, 35 tankers will be employed in \n     the fleet required for transporting the oil to the west coast \n     ports. Twenty-seven of these ships remain to be constructed. \n     It has been estimated by the Maritime Administration that the \n     construction of these ships will create 73,500 man-years of \n     labor in shipyards and supporting industries. Maintenance of \n     the fleet will generate 770 permanent jobs in the Nation's \n     shipyards.\n\n  In the Senate, Senator Stevens made a similar statement:\n\n       The trans-Alaska pipeline will particularly aid several \n     vital American industries which are currently depressed. For \n     example, the American maritime and shipbuilding industry will \n     be helped greatly. Alaskan oil must be carried in American-\n     bottom ships under the Jones Act. At least 27 new tankers \n     must be constructed; 73,480 man-years of shipyard employment \n     will be created; 3,800 permanent jobs will be created to run \n     and maintain this new, modern tanker fleet. This will result \n     in more than $1.0 billion for America's shipbuilding \n     industry. This is an industry that has, for some time, been \n     at a competitive disadvantage because of lower costs from \n     foreign competition.\n\n  As I read these statements, I can well understand why the citizens of \nPortland believed they were being given assurances that there would be \ncontinuity if they stepped forward to participate in this new venture \nof national importance. To now lift the export restriction and ask the \ntaxpayers of Portland to take a $50 million loss on a shipyard that is \nnow of questionable utility is imposing a great unfairness. This is an \nunfairness that I cannot allow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I inquire of the chair and also the floor \nmanagers. What is the pending business of the Senate? I would like to \nmake some comments on bill S. 395.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Murkowski \namendment 1078 to S. 395.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, is it in order for me to engage in debate \non the pending legislation at the present time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, with that understanding, I would like to \nmake some comments on S. 395.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the provision included in S. 395 \nwhich would lift the ban on the export of the Alaskan North Slope crude \noil so long as such oil is carried on U.S.-flag vessels.\n  This amendment would reduce our trade imbalance and raise $99 to $180 \nmillion in revenues for the U.S. Treasury. It would also create an \nadditional 10,000 to 25,000 new jobs and would certainly spur domestic \nenergy production.\n  In 1973, Mr. President, shortly after the first Arab oil boycott, \nCongress adopted this ban, and since then the domestic and world energy \nmarkets have dramatically and significantly changed. Today, the export \nban diminishes our energy security because it artificially depresses \nwellhead prices on [[Page S6675]] the west coast, making it uneconomic \nfor domestic oil producers to invest in marginal operations.\n  Mr. President, a Department of Energy study confirms that lifting the \nban on Alaskan crude oil would improve domestic energy security by \nencouraging domestic exploration activities. DOE estimates that \ndomestic production will increase between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels a \nday if the ban is lifted.\n  In addition to increasing domestic production, this bill will also \nhelp to stabilize the decline in the size and vitality of the domestic \nmerchant marine.\n  By authorizing the exports of Alaskan oil on U.S.-flag vessels, we \ncan help preserve a vital element of our domestic merchant marine, and \nwe can do so without subsidies from the American taxpayer and without \nmeasurably increasing any risk to the environment.\n  Mr. President, in 1990, Congress overwhelmingly supported enactment \nof the Oil Pollution Act. That legislation ultimately will require all \noceangoing tankers plying our waters to be built or rebuilt with a \ndouble hull. It already ensures that American flag and foreign flag \ntankers will continue to be subject to the same strict safety \nrequirements. And since December 28 of last year, it has imposed \nsubstantial financial responsibility requirements for all tankers \nentering U.S. waters.\n  Last year, the Department of Energy conducted an extensive study of \nthe likely effects, including likely environmental implications, of \nchanging the current law. The Department, and I quote:\n\n       Found no plausible evidence of any direct negative \n     environmental impact from lifting the ANS export ban.\n\n  By and large, Mr. President, the same U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and \nU.S.-crewed vessels that carry Alaskan oil to market today will \ncontinue to carry the crude to market tomorrow with a change in policy. \nThe same skilled merchant mariners will continue to man the vessels. \nCurrent Department of Defense and Department of Transportation \nprojections indicate that we are facing a critical shortage of trained \nmariners capable of manning the ready reserve force. This bill will \nhelp ensure that we will continue to have a reservoir of capably \ntrained mariners sufficient to man our reserve fleet in time of \nnational emergency. And our Nation will continue to have access to a \nfleet of environmentally safe and militarily useful vessels that \notherwise are destined to be converted into razor blades.\n  By enacting this bipartisan legislation, we can help ensure the \ncontinued existence of the largest segment of our domestic merchant \nmarine. Let us demonstrate again that we can work together to help \npromote our energy security, our national security, and at the same \ntime preserve jobs.\n  Mr. President and my colleagues, I will just add a couple of remarks \nand point out that again this ban was enacted at a time when this \ncountry literally was on its knees from the standpoint of energy \nrequirements. The Middle Eastern oil nations had banded together to \nform cartels which restricted amounts of oil being exported to the \nUnited States in particular.\n  We all remember the long lines that occurred in the 1970's when \npeople had to wait in line to buy gasoline for their automobiles and \nvehicles. Everyone in America wanted Congress to do something about it. \nOne of the things that we did was to say, all right, we are not going \nto allow any of the Alaska North Slope oil exported to other countries. \nWe are going to keep it right here.\n  Mr. President, I think we probably acted with some degree of haste in \ntaking that action and in thinking that by doing so we were somehow \ngoing to increase the domestic production. I think in reality we should \nall understand that oil is a commodity which can be traded all over the \nworld; that, indeed, many ships that are plying the oceans filled with \noil are sent to different ports in the middle of a voyage depending on \nthe need because the price is better in one area or the need is greater \nin another area or for whatever economic determination that is made.\n  So the point is that oil is traded on the world market according to \nneed and price. If we can, indeed, take some of the crude oil in Alaska \nand sell it at a better price in overseas markets, we should be allowed \nto do that. The price return will allow greater domestic production in \nareas of the United States where that production can occur.\n  I am a Senator from the State of Louisiana. I have nothing to do with \noil, of course, that is produced in Alaska. But I think this is good \npolicy for my State, for the State of Alaska, and indeed for all of the \nStates in the United States. I think it will increase production, and \nit will not do damage to any part of our Nation. It is good economic \nenergy policy for the future of our country.\n  Mr. President and my colleagues, I hope we would move on this. It \nshould be relatively noncontroversial. I know some Members have \nlegitimate concerns, and they will be heard, but I think we should move \nforward, debate the issue, vote on this legislation, and ultimately we \nshould adopt it as good energy policy.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, seeing no one else seeking \nrecognition at the moment, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent to proceed \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6650-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6675-S6676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MORE POLICE ON THE STREETS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to continue my \ndiscussion of the crime bill that I intend to introduce this Wednesday.\n  As I previously pointed out, there are really two basic questions \nthat we need to address in the area of crime whenever we try to \ndetermine whether a crime bill is good or whether it is not good, \nwhether it does the job or whether it does not do the job.\n  The first question is: What is the proper role of the Federal \nGovernment in fighting crime in this country? The second is: What \nreally works in law enforcement? What matters? What does not matter?\n  Last Wednesday, I discussed these issues with specific reference to \ncrimefighting technology. The conclusion I reached was that we have an \noutstanding technology base in this country that does a great deal and \nwill continue to do a great deal to help us catch criminals.\n  Technology, Mr. President, does in fact matter. But we need the \nFederal Government to be more proactive, more proactive in getting the \nStates on line with this technology. Having a terrific national \ncriminal record system or a huge DNA database or an automated \nfingerprint system or huge DNA database for convicted sex offenders in \nWashington, DC, is great; it is nice. But it will not do much good if \nthe police officer in Hamilton, OH, or Middletown, OH, or Cleveland, \nOH, cannot tap into it, cannot put the information in, and cannot get \nthe information back out.\n  My legislation would bring these local police departments on line. It \nwould help them to contribute to and benefit from the emerging \nnationwide crimefighting database.\n  On this past Thursday, I discussed what we have to do to get armed \ncareer criminals off the streets, those who terrorize us, terrorize \ntheir fellow citizens with a gun. I talked about a program called \nProject Triggerlock that targeted gun criminals for Federal \nprosecution. My legislation would bring back Project Triggerlock and \ntoughen the laws on gun crimes in many other significant ways. We have \nto get these armed criminals off the streets.\n  On Friday, I talked about the long neglected needs of crime victims. \nIn too many ways, our legal system treats criminals like victims and \nvictims like criminals. We have to stop that. My legislation contains a \nnumber of provisions that would make the system much more receptive to \nthe rights and the needs of crime victims.\n  Today, I would like to turn to another item. I would like to talk \nabout [[Page S6676]] what we can do to put more police officers on the \nstreet, and to put more police officers into our highest crime areas. \nMake no mistake, the evidence is clear, putting a police officer on a \nstreet corner in a dangerous neighborhood will reduce crime. We are \nlooking for what really works, and putting police officers on the \nstreets is a proven strategy that works. It is a plain fact, if you put \na police officer on the street, crime will go down.\n  The President is right in this respect, and he is to be commended for \nunderstanding that there is, in fact, a direct or actually inverse \nrelationship between the number of law enforcement officers who are \ndeployed correctly in the neighborhood and the amount of crime that \nexists in that neighborhood.\n  That is why the President last year asked for $8.8 billion in Federal \nfunding for police officers. We do need more police; he is correct. \nPolice officers deployed correctly matter. They do make a difference.\n  But, Mr. President, I believe that we can improve on President \nClinton's plan, and there are three major shortcomings I believe that \nexist in the President's plan that we ought to address in the Senate. \nLet me list them:\n  First, the administration's plan spreads the $8.8 billion far too \nthin. It does not target the funding for police officers to the most \ncrime-ridden areas where the funding is most needed. Instead, it spends \nmoney on extra police officers even--even--in extremely low-crime \nareas. That just does not make sense.\n  Second, the administration is not paying for the full cost of the \nextra police officers. The Clinton proposal pays for only 75 percent of \nthe police officers and asks local communities to come up with the \nremaining 25 percent.\n  Third, the Clinton plan provides the money for only--only, Mr. \nPresident--3 years.\n  I think that these problems I have just listed with the Clinton \nadministration proposal can be fixed fairly easily. As part of the \ncomprehensive crime legislation I intend to introduce on Wednesday, I \nwill be including my proposals on how we should fix these problems, and \nhere is what I propose:\n  First, I propose to pay for the police officers and to pay for them \nin full, 100 percent. Under my proposal, we will send $5 billion over a \nperiod of time to the local communities for new police officers. Those \npolice officers will be fully funded 100 percent, not just 75 percent, \nas envisioned in the Clinton plan.\n  Second, we will fund these police officers for 5 years; 5 years, not \n3 years, as envisioned by the Clinton proposal.\n  Third, and probably most significant, my proposal will target these \nfunds where they are needed the most. Under the Clinton plan, really \ncrime-threatened communities are deprived of the full contingent of \npolice officers they really need. For example, under the administration \nproposal, a high-crime community, such as Chicago, has received 300 \npolice officers so far, and those 300 are not even fully funded. They \nare funded at 75 percent. My legislation would put 2,100 new police \nofficers on the streets of Chicago and would pay for them in full.\n  I can cite example after example. Let me just give one from my home \nState. Youngstown, OH, is another city with a very serious crime \nproblem. Under the Clinton plan, it has received a total of 10 new \npolice officers. I think, however, to make a real difference in a crime \narea, we need to do better than that. Under the formula that is \ncontained in the bill that I will introduce on Wednesday, there would \nbe a total of 58 new police officers on the streets of Youngstown. We \nwould go from 10 under the Clinton plan to 58 under my plan, and the \nway we are able to do that is because we are targeting the money to go \nto the areas where the crime is the worst. It only makes sense that \nwhen we are dealing with scarce Federal dollars, those Federal dollars \nshould be targeted specifically to the areas where our citizens are \nmost in danger.\n  My proposal would put the dollars for police officers where police \nofficers are needed the most. We are targeting the 250 most crime-\ninfested cities in America. We will succeed in getting those police \nofficers on the street. In a community brutalized by rampant crime, the \npolice officer is truly an ambassador of law and order. The police \nofficer is a living, breathing confirmation of America's resolve to \ndefend civilization from those who want to turn our country into a \nwasteland of stealing, raping, and killing.\n  The police officer is a soldier of justice, and like any other \nsoldier, the police officer, to be most effective, needs to be sent \nwhere the enemy is. The enemy is anyone who does a drive-by shooting or \nrapes someone or commits any other kind of brutal act.\n  Mr. President, anyone who watches TV or reads the papers knows where \nthe enemy really is. My bill would make sure that the police officers \nare deployed where they are needed the most. My bill would pay for them \nin full.\n  This is what it will take. This is what it will take if we are \nserious about taking back our streets.\n  The American people are, quite frankly, losing patience with violent \ncrime. They are losing patience with the syndrome that my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from New York, calls defining deviancy \ndown.\n  There is a consensus out here, Mr. President, that we will not allow \nour country to become a place where violent crime is considered normal. \nI think that putting these police officers on the street--and paying \nfor them in full--will be a major symbol of our national resolve.\n  My legislation, Mr. President, would spend $5 billion on these police \nofficers, target them where they are needed the most, and pay for these \npolice officers in full.\n  The Clinton administration plan included $8.8 billion as partial \npayment for police officers, with their deployment of police officers \nbeing spread throughout the country and spread among many, many areas \nwhere crime is not that serious.\n  Tomorrow, Mr. President, I will discuss what we can do with this \nextra $3.8 billion, and specifically how we can use block grants to \ngive local communities the flexibility they need to use that $3.8 \nbillion as effectively as possible. And then on Wednesday of this week, \nMr. President, I will be introducing my comprehensive crime bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6675-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6676-S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              TERMINATION OF THE HELIUM AND OTHER PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to praise \nboth the House and Senate Budget Committees for including in their \nbudget assumptions termination of a relatively small program, the \nhelium reserve program. The Budget Committee materials assume a $27 \nmillion savings over 5 years from termination of the helium reserve \nprogram.\n  As the budget debate unfolds in the House and Senate in the coming \nweek, there will certainly be considerable debate over programs of \nenormous magnitude--programs with budget outlays in the billions, not \nmillions. Although the Budget Committee materials assume a $27 million \nsavings from termination of the helium reserve program, the actual \nsavings will be significantly higher as the Federal Government sells \noff the existing helium reserve over a period of time that will not \ndisrupt the private helium market, as well as terminates the program \nitself. The Federal Government is currently stockpiling enough helium \nto meet its needs for the next 80 to 100 years. In order to make sure \nthat the taxpayers get a fair price for this helium, the reserve needs \nto be sold over a period of time to make sure that we do not \ninadvertently cause the entire market price for helium to fall \nneedlessly. CBO has estimated that we can, at current market prices, \neventually recover between $1 and $1.6 billion by this sale.\n  It is not just the current $27 million in savings but a long-term \nsavings by in effect privatizing this area of our Government.\n  I introduced legislation, S. 45, to terminate this program on the \nfirst day of the 104th Congress. I am pleased to report that this \nlegislation has gained bipartisan support and that it has been \ncosponsored by the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], the Senator from New \nJersey [Mr. Lautenberg], the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], the \nSenator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], the Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], the \nSenator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], the [[Page S6677]] Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Campbell], and the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. \nDaschle]. On May 1, 1995, the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas], \nintroduced similar legislation to terminate the program, joined by the \nSenator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], \nthe Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Warner], and the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski]. Thus, 15 \nMembers of the Senate, 8 Republicans and 7 Democrats have sponsored \nlegislation to terminate the program. Moreover, President Clinton on \nJanuary 24, highlighted termination of the helium program in his State \nof the Union Address as an example of the kind of Federal spending that \ncould no longer be justified.\n  Mr. President, I have previously spoken on the Senate floor about why \ntermination\n of the helium reserve program is particularly appropriate today in \nlight of the growth of a private helium industry which can more than \nadequately supply the needs of the Federal Government for this product.\n\n  The helium reserve program, like many programs which are the target \nof today's deficit reduction efforts, began decades ago when there was \na reason for the Federal Government to become involved in this area. In \nthe case of helium, the program dates back to the time of President \nWoodrow Wilson. The Helium Act of 1925 was enacted at a time when \nobservation balloons were thought to have strategic merit. It was \nexpanded under the Eisenhower administration when blimps were being \nused to spot enemy submarines in the Atlantic and to meet the needs of \nthe fledgling space program. Since that time, however, a private \ndomestic helium industry has developed and as of 1995, 90 percent of \nthe helium produced in this country does come from private operations.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is time to terminate the Federal helium \nprogram. With the kind of bipartisan support that is now behind this \neffort, this would seem like a relatively easy task to accomplish \nduring this budget cycle.\n  I hope it will be, but I am not overly confident, given the history \nof this program and similar programs. Even with the endorsement of both \nBudget Committees, bipartisan support in Congress, and the backing of \nthe administration, terminating any Federal program, large or small, is \nnever easy.\n  The helium reserve program was targeted for termination by the Reagan \nadministration, by the Bush administration, and now the Clinton \nadministration. Nonetheless, it survived. The Washington Post, in an \narticle published February 7, 1995, entitled ``Odorless, Colorless--and \nHard To Kill'' outlined the history of efforts to terminate the helium \nprogram and describe it as a ``tale of yet another federal government \nprogram that has had more than nine lives.'' Perhaps 1995 will be the \nyear that these efforts succeed. I certainly intend to work to see that \nhappens.\n  But I think we need to look at the survival of these kinds of \nprograms in a broader context.\n  In the last Congress, we terminated another program, the wool and \nmohair subsidy program, that was started in 1954 when wool was \nconsidered to be a strategic material. The program lived on and on long \nafter the original purpose had ended.\n  Unfortunately, even though this was a relatively small but important \npiece in the President's overall $500 billion deficit reduction plan, I \nhave just learned that there may be yet another attempt to try and \nrevive this program now that we finally finished it off. I certainly \nhope that does not happen.\n  I have 2,000-3,000 sheep growers in Wisconsin who did not like it \nwhen I introduced legislation in the last Congress to terminate this \nprogram, but I also know that many of them recognized that it was \ndifficult to continue that subsidy in light of our deficit problems. I \nalso worked with this industry to get legislation enacted during the \n103d Congress to enable them, working together, to set up a producer-\nfunded promotion board to help increase sales in the marketplace for \ntheir product. I believe that it is very important as we terminate \nFederal spending programs that we do it in a way that is sensitive to \nthe needs of the communities and individuals who have been dependent to \nsome degree on continuation of these programs.\n  So that process appeared to have worked. We cut the subsidy, but we \nworked together to find a way to, through producer supported programs, \npromote the product. They made them less dependent on the Federal \nGovernment and yet we were able to move forward for their product. But \nwe have to end many of these programs if we are going to make \nmeaningful progress in reducing the deficit and achieving a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, as one former President once said, ``Not all spending \ninitiatives were designed to be immortal.'' At least I hope they were \nnot. Yet, we have all learned in one way or another how difficult it is \nto terminate a Federal spending program.\n  I recall during the last Congress a debate over whether a NASA \nprogram originally entitled SETI--Search for Extraterrestrial \nIntelligence--which had been terminated had been revived under a new \nname. That is another demonstration of how difficult it is to actually \nend any Federal program. I recently had an interesting experience in \nattempting to terminate a program in my own State--Project ELF, a cold \nwar relic that I believe no longer serves any significant strategic \npurpose.\n  The Senate recently voted unanimously to terminate Project ELF as \npart of the DOD rescission bill. The program survived, somehow, in \nconference, however, on the grounds that some new purpose justified its \ncontinuation. I am not satisfied that there is a meaningful reason for \ncontinuing to spend millions of dollars each year--in this case, about \n$16 million each year--on this program.\n  I am just going to have to continue my efforts to try to eliminate \nthat, although I thought we finally had it in the Senate.\n  During the debate over the balanced budget amendment, I discovered \nthat another program that is high on many deficit-reduction lists, the \nTennessee Valley Authority, was going to receive special protection.\n  The Senate committee report on the balanced budget amendment created \nwhat could be called constitutional pork by singling out TVA as a \nprogram that would somehow not be affected by the proposed amendment, \nwhile everything else would be. I add that the House Budget Committee \nhas assumed termination of TVA as part of its budget resolution.\n  I believe this is the direction we should be headed with regard to \nthe program which has a long and significant history, going back to \n1933 when it was first created. Mr. President, 60 years later we have \nto question whether the Federal Government should continue to operate \nand fund this particular program.\n  In this regard, I have introduced legislation, S. 43, to phase out \nfunding for TVA and thereby reduce the deficit by about $600 million \nover 5 years. I know that this legislation and termination of Federal \nfunding for TVA will again be strongly opposed by those who benefit \nfrom the program, and this, too, will be a hard fight.\n  Mr. President, I mention these various programs that in total amount \ncome to millions--not billions--each year because I think they \nillustrate one of the problems that confronts Congress as we attempt to \nreduce the Federal deficit. The cumulative total spending on so many of \nthese smaller programs does add up to significant budget cost. Each one \nstanding alone may not be an overwhelming burden on the taxpayers, but \ntaken together, they are a major part of the problem.\n  Yet, Mr. President, my experience in the past 2 years has indicated \nthat it takes almost as much effort to rein in spending on these \nrelatively small programs as it does to tackle the big-ticket programs. \nThe advocates for the smaller programs work just as hard to preserve \nthem, and they are often quite effective in those efforts.\n  Mr. President, I think we all know that reducing the Federal deficit \nand achieving a balanced budget will take a great deal of discipline \nand hard work. I am delighted that both of the Budget Committees have \nidentified the Helium Reserve Program as being appropriate for \ntermination in this budget cycle, and I am prepared to work with other \nMembers of the Senate again on a bipartisan basis to enact legislation \nthat closes down this outdated program in a manner that will help \nreduce the Federal deficit. [[Page S6678]] \n  Mr. President, I realize there is a lot of partisan rhetoric that \ngoes with any budget resolution. This one is no exception. I want to \nagain take this opportunity, as I did Friday with regard to appropriate \nMedicare cuts, to signal my desire to work with the majority party to \nfind the cuts that will actually lead to that balanced budget by the \nyear 2002 and to make sure as we do it that we look at both the small \nand the big programs so we balance the budget not only for the year \n2002, but that we can achieve a virtually permanent practice that is \nnot existent here, which is to have a permanent commitment to have a \nbalanced Federal budget into the future. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and women \nwho gave their lives so that we may be protected.\n  Aware of the dangers that face them everyday, law enforcement \nofficers carry out their duties to protect the lives of others. Too \noften, their own lives are lost. Unfortunately, this year, 298 \nadditional names will be carved into the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial, here in Washington, DC. It is only fitting that on \nthis day I pay tribute to several New York law enforcement officers who \ndied in the line of duty.\n  On March 15, 1994, Officer Sean McDonald was brutally slain while on \nduty in the 44th Precinct in New York. His murder occurred as he \nattempted to save two people from a robbery attempt. In a few short \nmoments, while a series of gunshots, these ruthless cowards stole the \nlife of a dedicated police officer, husband and father.\n  In a similar incident on May 20 of 1994, a perpetrator fatally shot \nInvestigator Ricky J. Parisian, a devoted officer in Oneonta, NY. \nInvestigator Parisian's life was abruptly ended when the robber he was \nstruggling with shot him. He was 34 years old.\n  Several other names will also be added to the memorial. The names to \nbe added include law enforcement officers who were also killed in the \nline of duty in 1994. These officers include: Police Officer Nicholas \nDeMutis of the New York City Police Department who was killed on \nJanuary 25th, Police Officer Jose Perez of the New York City Police \nDepartment who was killed on April 27, Police Officer John J. Venus of \nthe Suffolk County Police Department who was killed on November 20, and \nPolice Officer Raymond R. Cannon, Jr., of the New York City Police \nDepartment who was killed in December 1994.\n  The memorial will also hold the names of officers who died in the \nline of duty before 1994 but were not listed until this year, \nincluding: Police Officer John Cahill of the Haverstraw Village Police \nDepartment, Police Officer Francis J. Donato, Jr., of the New York \nState Park Police, Police Officer John Bauer of the Cheektowaga Police \nDepartment, and Sgt. David C. Pettigrew of the Freeport Police \nDepartment.\n  On this day of remembrance, I would like to recognize the heroic \nservice of officers across the United States who risk their lives each \nand every day, in every city, county, and State in this country, so \nthat we may live in safety.\n  The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial was dedicated in 1991 \nand presently holds 1,293 names. This memorial is a way to express our \nNation's appreciation of law enforcement officers and their efforts to \nfight crime and protect our families.\n  This year's memorial observation is also an opportunity for this \nCongress to renew our pledge to make our communities safer. By passing \nlegislation that will require tougher sentences for convicted \ncriminals, this Congress can do its part. If law enforcement officers \ncan patrol our streets, risking their lives, then the least we can do \nis make sure that these criminals are not back on the streets before \nthey have fully served their time.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6678-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               HONORING DANIEL S. MOHAN, HERO OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a Missourian who \nhas distinguished himself through his bravery beyond the call of duty \nand earned the National Association of Letter Carriers' Central Region \nHero of the Year Award. Daniel S. Mohan is a letter carrier from St. \nClaire, MO, who took actions well beyond trudging through rain, sleet, \nsnow, and dark of night to complete his appointed rounds.\n  Daniel Mohan was driving on his postal route in St. Claire when he \nheard shots. Soon after, a woman ran screaming from her house and fell \nwounded on her driveway, the victim of three gunshot wounds, including \none to the face. Mr. Mohan raced from his truck and pulled the victim \nto safety behind his postal vehicle located across the street as her \nassailant was coming out of the house in pursuit. Daniel's presence at \nthe scene discouraged the gunman who returned to the house and \nsurrendered to authorities soon after. The victim of the shooting was \nlater treated at a local hospital's intensive care unit, and continues \nto undergo reconstructive surgery. But as Tom Yoder, Police Chief of \nSaint Claire acknowledged, this women would not be alive if not for the \nvaliant efforts of Daniel Mohan.\n  For his efforts, Daniel Mohan has been honored by the National \nAssociation of Letter Carriers as its Central Region Hero of the Year. \nIn a time when we hear of events of violence going on in public view \nwithout a single person acting to stop egregious actions, Daniel \nMohan's bravery and self-sacrifice is truly a model to be followed.\n  Edmund Burke said, ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil \nis for good men to do nothing.'' Mr. President, it is my hope that the \nheroic actions of this Missourian would become the norm, not the \nexception when we speak of how we as Americans should act toward our \nneighbors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6678-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, on March 16, 1995, the Defense Base Closure \nand Realignment Commission conducted a hearing to explore the Federal \nGovernment's response to the economic trauma of military base closings. \nThis hearing on so-called post-closure matters was extremely useful in \nassessing the challenges facing communities that will lose a base this \nyear, and I applaud the Commission's able Chairman, former U.S. Senator \nAlan Dixon, for his leadership in this regard.\n  At the request of Chairman Dixon, I am submitting into the \nCongressional Record various documents outlining the positions of \nseveral community organizations concerning recommended improvements to \nthe process of closing and redeveloping military bases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that information supplied by \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Installation \nDevelopers, the National Association of Counties, and others, along \nwith a copy of my statement at the March 16 hearing, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n Statement of Senator David Pryor Before the Defense Base Closure and \n                 Realignment Commission, March 16, 1995\n\n       Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of this Commission, \n     I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the 1995 Base \n     Closure Commission on the important subject of redeveloping \n     closed military installations.\n       First, I applaud this Commission and its Chairman for \n     having the vision and courage to address an issue that \n     previous Commissions declined to confront; the issue of \n     helping local communities rebound from the economic trauma of \n     losing a military base.\n       By also focusing on so-called post-closure matters, some \n     may feel that this Commission is straying too far from its \n     nest. I, however, disagree with this notion. This Commission \n     can fulfill its base closure responsibilities while at the \n     same time, fulfilling its moral responsibilities by \n     recommending ways to assist those who will be devastated by \n     your actions and findings.\n       Distinguished Commissioners, we are about to complete our \n     fourth and final base closure round. We have learned many \n     lessons from the first three. The most obvious lesson is that \n     base closings hurt.\n       Mr. Chairman, like yourself, I am personally aware of the \n     pain caused by base closure announcements. The 1991 \n     Commission closed Eaker Air Force Base, a B-52 SAC base \n     located in Mississippi County, Arkansas. They also took away \n     a majority of the work at Ft. Chaffee near Ft. Smith, \n     Arkansas. Now this Commission must determine whether to close \n     Ft. Chaffee, as the Army has recommended, and whether to \n     close Red River Army Depot, located in the town of Texarkana \n     on the Arkansas-Texas border.\n       For many cities where military bases are located, the \n     military is the largest employer and the loss of a base can \n     cause an economic tailspin. Such would be the case at Red \n     River Army Depot, which accounts for 10 percent of the local \n     economy in Texarkana.\n       To be certain, base closings are painful.\n       The first three base closure rounds have also taught us \n     that the task of replacing lost military jobs through the \n     civilian redevelopment of closing bases is difficult, costly, \n     and often slow in producing good results.\n       However, finding a new use for an old base is a worthwhile \n     endeavor, and like it or not, it is an effort that involves \n     the federal government.\n       Since we began closing obsolete military installations in \n     1988, we have struggled over the appropriate role of the \n     federal government in the closure, cleanup, and redevelopment \n     of these bases.\n       I must admit that our original approach to post-closure \n     matters failed miserably. In the 1988 and 1991 base closure \n     rounds, the federal government, including this very \n     commission, took a ``hands-off'' approach. The results were \n     disastrous.\n       Job creation was virtually non-existent. Closure costs \n     skyrocketed. Communities threw up their hands in frustration \n     over the government's refusal to provide help when help was \n     needed. When this process began in the late 1980's, the \n     federal government was the primary obstacle to a quick \n     recovery, due to our hands-off approach.\n       I believe that instead of standing in the way of progress, \n     government should form partnerships with local communities \n     and work together with shared resources and know-how to \n     replace lost military jobs.\n       We should not turn a cold shoulder to the people who helped \n     us win the Cold War. Base closure communities deserve much \n     more than a simple ``thank you''.\n       Fortunately, on July 2, 1993, President Clinton announced \n     that the federal government would reverse its policy and \n     begin pursuing partnerships with communities.\n       The President's five-point plan for helping communities \n     included giving them greater access to base property, fast-\n     track environmental cleanup, transition coordinators at every \n     base to help cut through the red tape, larger federal grants \n     for economic development, and bolder job retraining and \n     transition services for those who lose their jobs.\n       After the five-point plan was offered, it became clear that \n     several changes in law would be necessary to fulfill the \n     President's vision. As a result, the Senate Democratic Task \n     Force on Defense Reinvestment, which I chaired, developed the \n     necessary legislation during the summer of 1993.\n       The resulting legislation, commonly referred to as the \n     Pryor Amendment, was accepted as an amendment to H.R. 2401, \n     the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Defense Authorization Act, \n     and signed into\n      law by the President later that year.\n       The Pryor Amendment ratified the President's five-point \n     plan by making major changes to the base closure laws that \n     would provide communities with desperately needed assistance. \n     A summary of this legislation will be submitted for the \n     record with my prepared remarks.\n       The primary contribution of the Pryor Amendment is its \n     recognition that the land and property on closing bases can \n     be a catalyst for future development and economic growth. Our \n     legislation gives the Secretary of Defense authority to \n     transfer or lease base properties to communities below fair \n     market value or, in some cases, for free.\n       Communities nationwide are currently using this legislation \n     to enhance their chances for economic revival. Just last \n     week, the U.S. Air Force recently conveyed 600 acres of land \n     at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California at a \n     reduced price. This land transfer will create 1,000 jobs \n     immediately due to expansions in local manufacturing. I am \n     also aware that the government of Taiwan wants to open a \n     foreign trade center at Norton, creating almost 4,000 new \n     American jobs.\n       I am pleased that communities like Norton are taking \n     advantage of the government's renewed willingness to help \n     beat swords into plowshares.\n       In 1994, our Senate task force was successful in passing \n     legislation in Congress to exempt closed military bases from \n     the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.\n       The task force had been notified that some homeless \n     assistance groups were trying to acquire base property \n     through the McKinney Act even though local communities had \n     already agreed to using the property for other purposes.\n       This disruption was truly counterproductive and an \n     unintended consequence of the McKinney Act.\n       Due primarily to the leadership of Senator Nunn and Senator \n     Feinstein, we formed a consensus for passing legislation to \n     exempt closed bases from the McKinney Act. Our bill, the Base \n     Closure Community Redevelopment and Homelessness Assistance \n     Act of 1994, established a new process for addressing local \n     homeless needs in a way that is supportive of local \n     redevelopment efforts.\n       I am proud to say that this legislation was supported by \n     base closure community groups and homeless assistance groups, \n     Democrats and Republicans. It was signed into law by the \n     President late last year.\n       Each of these initiatives--the President's five-point plan \n     for increased federal funds and assistance, the Pryor \n     Amendment, and the McKinney Act exemption--represent a \n     decisive shift in the government's response to base closings.\n       The good news for communities that will lose bases in this \n     round is that the federal government is now ready and willing \n     to help you beat swords into plowshares. We are much better \n     prepared now to meet these challenges than we were in 1988 \n     when the base closure process began. I applaud the Clinton \n     Administration for its vision in this regard.\n       At the request of this commission, I have devised a few \n     brief recommendations for communities that lose a base in \n     this round.\n       First, begin planning early for the future. Communities \n     that have found the most success are those that embarked on \n     an early, aggressive effort to find civilian uses for their \n     base.\n       For example, when England Air Force Base in Alexandria, \n     Louisiana was recommended for closure in 1991, the community \n     formed two committees. One led the fight to keep the base \n     open, the other committee, which operated largely in secret, \n     was laying the foundation for bringing in new business.\n       To date, England has created almost 1,000 new jobs on base, \n     due mostly to the J.B. Hunt trucking company's decision to \n     train truck drivers on the old runways.\n       I encourage local communities to follow England's example. \n     If any of the towns with bases on the 1995 list chose to \n     begin planning early, Congress has given the Department of \n     Defense the authority to provide grants for such purposes. \n     Also, last year Congress passed legislation prohibiting this \n     commission from penalizing towns that chose to begin planning \n     for redevelopment even as they are fighting to keep their \n     bases open.\n       I also encourage communities to speak with one voice. Each \n     of the federal programs I have outlined are designed to help \n     communities help themselves, but it is difficult to help \n     communities that are not unified.\n       For example, George Air Force Base in Southern California \n     was closed in 1988 and immediately thereafter two nearby \n     cities engaged in a power struggle over who was entitled to \n     federal aid and future\n      revenue from the base. A legal battle ensued and the matter \n     was fought in the courts for almost five years. Businesses \n     interested in locating on base went elsewhere. Today there \n     is little to show for their efforts at George except \n     missed opportunities and lost hope. [[Page S6680]] \n       The government can do little to help communities unless \n     they speak with one voice.\n       I have also been asked to make recommendations to this \n     Commission on ways to improve the government's response to \n     base closings.\n       First, the federal government should continue vigorously \n     pursuing partnerships with local communities.\n       Every government employee, top to bottom, must be fully \n     committed to forming successful partnerships.\n       While I am convinced that the top levels of government are \n     committed, I question whether this cooperative spirit is \n     alive at the working level.\n       Although we have made substantial improvements, local \n     communities are still frustrated by the service they often \n     receive.\n       Every day, government officials and community leaders must \n     choose between working together hand-in-hand or engaging in \n     hand-to-hand combat. I believe this Commission could explore \n     ways to improve the cooperative spirit. Let me suggest a few.\n       First, find ways to remove the ``government knows best'' \n     mentality. In most cases, government attorneys and government \n     bureaucrats are making key decisions on private sector \n     development issues with little or no consultation with local \n     experts who know their region best. We must remember that \n     communities are in the best position to inform us of \n     responsible ways for government to contribute.\n       Second, the Commission could explore ways to make \n     government more nimble, capable of making decisions quicker \n     and delivering services more rapidly.\n       The interim leasing process exemplifies the dangers of \n     moving too slowly. Currently, the military services are \n     taking about 6 months to complete a lease agreement. This is \n     entirely too long. Without a lease, businesses interested in \n     locating on base go elsewhere. We should explore ways to \n     speed up the leasing process and the delivery of other \n     important services.\n       One suggestion for making government more nimble is to \n     empower the workers in the field. Give them more flexibility \n     and greater authority to make decisions on the spot.\n       The commission could explore this and other ways for \n     speeding up decisions and results.\n       Finally, we must not undo the tremendous progress we have \n     worked so hard to achieve. Specifically, I urge this \n     Commission to caution Congress against cutting funds for base \n     closure assistance programs, especially environmental \n     cleanup, planning grants, and EDA grants for infrastructure \n     improvements.\n       Although Congress has provided the necessary funds in \n     recent years, this year these monies are at risk.\n       If Congress cuts base closure assistance funds, communities \n     would experience paralysis. Economic development would suffer \n     and the cost of closing bases would skyrocket. Such funding \n     cuts would be counterproductive, and I hope this commission \n     will see the merits of fully funding these base closure \n     assistance programs.\n       Again, I applaud Chairman Dixon and this commission for \n     accepting its moral responsibility and exploring ways to help \n     communities rebound from the economic pain of base closures. \n     I thank the commission for the opportunity to give testimony \n     at today's hearing.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                The U.S. Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: With the pending BRAC 1995 process, \n     meeting the challenge of defense conversion is a high \n     priority for the nation. While we recognize the \n     administration's need to downsize the Department of Defense's \n     base structure, arming cities with the tools they need to \n     combat the negative impact of this downsizing is equally \n     important.\n       In 1993, you announced a five-point plan to ease the impact \n     of military base closings on local communities. Following \n     your announcement, the United States Conference of Mayors \n     began a series of steps to assist communities responding to \n     the challenges of a military base closures. These steps \n     included appointing a Mayors' Task Force on Military Base \n     Closings and Economic Adjustments, and holding two national \n     meetings to help solicit ideas to improve the process and \n     ease the difficult transition following a military base \n     closing.\n       Copies of our recommendations are being delivered today to \n     the BRAC Commission, to all members of your Cabinet, and to \n     the leadership in both the House and Senate. These \n     recommendations are being released today to coincide with the \n     list of base closings which is expected to be released \n     tomorrow.\n       As co-chairs of the Mayors' Military Base Closing and \n     Economic Adjustments Task Force, which represents mayors of \n     cities that are currently trying to convert former defense \n     facilities to private uses, we would like to demonstrate that \n     defense conversion can happen. However, in the absence of the \n     reforms we have proposed, we are concerned that successful \n     conversion will never truly be achieved. It is our hope that \n     you will actively support these recommendations, which are \n     necessary to ensure that ``defense conversion'' is no longer \n     a buzz word, but a reality.\n           Respectfully,\n     Susan Golding,\n       Mayor, San Diego, Task Force Co-chair.\n     Edward Rendell,\n       Mayor, Philadelphia, Task Force Co-chair.\n                                                                    ____\n\n            A National Action Plan on Military Base Closings\n\n\n recommendations from the Mayors' Task Force on Military Base Closings \nand Economic Adjustments to the President of the United States and the \n                             104th Congress\n\n     Foreword\n       At the U.S. Conference of Mayors Annual Meetings in \n     Portland, Oregon, June 11, 1995, the Conference adopted two \n     resolutions regarding military base closings. Following our \n     Annual Meeting, Conference of Mayors President, Knoxville \n     Mayor Victor Ashe, appointed a Task Force for Military Base \n     Closings and Economic Adjustments. Mayors Susan Golding of \n     San Diego and Edward Rendell of Philadelphia were appointed \n     co-chairs of this Task Force.\n       With the help of a grant from the Economic Development \n     Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the \n     Conference of Mayors held two meetings to assist mayors in \n     preparing for the next round of base closings scheduled to be \n     announced in February 1995. Approximately 150 communities \n     were represented at the two meetings. The first was held in \n     San Diego on December 8-9, 1994 and the second was held in \n     Washington on January 24, 1995 in conjunction with the \n     conference of Mayors Winter Meeting.\n       The attached recommendations are an outgrowth of those \n     meetings, as are the quotes that appear in the margins.\n       On behalf of our officers, members, and staff; we think \n     those mayors and city representatives who attended the two \n     meetings, and especially appreciate the tremendous assistance \n     given to us by the Economic Development Administration and \n     the Office of Economic Adjustment at the U.S. Department of \n     Defense. Without their help, this historic Conference \n     initiative would not have gone forward.\n       In addition, I would like to thank our co-chairs, Mayors \n     Golding and Rendell, for their outstanding leadership on the \n     Task Force.\n       We also recognize Mayor Jerry Abramson of Louisville, past \n     president of the Conference of Mayors, for making this issue \n     of base closing a priority for the mayors last year, as well \n     as current President Victor Ashe who recognized the \n     importance of this issue and kept military base closings a \n     top priority for the mayors, even though he had no military \n     bases in his community.\n       Michael Kaiser, our Conference Staff Director, deserves \n     special thanks for his determination and hard work in \n     following through to make our first past-Cold War initiative \n     on base closings and economic adjustments a success for our \n     members as we confront the challenges of economic conversion \n     in the year ahead.\n                                                J. Thomas Cochran,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                      Resolution on Base Closings\n\n       Whereas, the United States Conference of Mayors has formed \n     a military base closing and economic adjustment task force, \n     and\n       Whereas, this task force has held two meetings in San \n     Diego, California and Washington, DC to help mayors \n     effectively deal with the consequences of military base \n     closings, and\n       Whereas, mayors attended these two task force meetings in \n     San Diego December 8-9, 1994 and in Washington January 24, \n     1995 in conjunction with the Conference of Mayors Winter \n     Meeting, Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, mayors call for several actions necessary to ease \n     the impact of base closings on various communities to return \n     the land to economically productive civilian use, including:\n       Providing and continuing federal funding for communities \n     affected by defense downsizing, including,but not limited to, \n     the support of the Economic Development Administration (EDA) \n     and the Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA);\n       Streamlining the process for transfer and clean-up of \n     military facilities scheduled for closure; and\n       Securing local control of decision-making relating to \n     infrastructure and resources; be it further\n       Resolved, The United States Conference of Mayors will issue \n     a formal report to the White House and Congress prior to the \n     next round of base closings scheduled to begin March 1st to \n     address these actions.\n Recommendations From the Mayors' Task Force on Military Base Closings \n                        and Economic Adjustments\n\n\n  Recommendation 1: Speed and Improve Funding for Affected Communities\n\n       Mayors ask that the federal government respond to a base \n     closing as the would to any natural disaster. Mayors call for \n     federal agencies to respond as quickly as FEMA (Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency) to assist communities affected \n     by base closings. Financial and technical support should be \n     given immediately upon designation of a base closing. This \n     impact aid should be awarded without excessive paperwork or \n     time delays.\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\n Recommendation 2: Eliminate HUD Approval of Local Compliance with the \n   McKinney Act (i.e., the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and \n                    Homeless Assistance Act of 1994)\n\n       Under the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless \n     Assistance Act, cities must work with homeless assistance \n     providers and local redevelopment authorities to develop a \n     local reuse plan for surplus federal properties. The \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) must then \n     approve the plan, and the Development of Defense (DOD) then \n     acts in accordance with HUD approval. Mayors believe that the \n     requirements of this statute, particularly the requirement of \n     HUD approval, essentially represents another unfunded federal \n     mandate. How facilities are reused should be entirely a local \n     decision.\n\n\n  Recommendation 3: Streamline the Process for Transferring Title and \n         Control of Military Base Property to Local Governments\n\n       As a result of the President's five-point plan and emphasis \n     on community input, there have been tremendous improvements \n     in the property transfer process. However, much more needs to \n     be done.\n       Because existing efforts have not been effective, mayors \n     call for the President to appoint an official Ombudsman at \n     the National Economic Council in the White House, who can \n     respond in a timely fashion, impose coordination and \n     communications between federal agencies, and cut the red tape \n     to facilitate property transfer and economic development of \n     military bases.\n       Additionally, mayors call for a revision clause for \n     properties considered for public benefit. In many cases, the \n     property was given freely by the local community to the \n     federal government when the bases were first built. This \n     property therefore should be given back to the local \n     community, not sold back.\n\n\n       recommendation 4: define what constitutes a ``reuse plan''\n\n       There are different points of view among federal agencies \n     about what constitutes a reuse plan. For example, current law \n     requires that a reuse plan be completed within nine months. \n     But this time is not sufficient if the definition of a reuse \n     plan includes environmental impact studies and related \n     documentation.\n       The law should recognize the variety and differences among \n     military bases. A standard nine month period may be \n     appropriate for smaller bases, but it is not enough time for \n     larger bases where multiple jurisdictions are involved or \n     where environmental contaminants are more difficult to \n     identify. A range therefore (e.g., 6-12 months) should be \n     considered rather than a standard nine months for all bases.\n\n\nrecommendation 5: qualify military bases for automatic consideration as \n                            enterprise zones\n\n       If bases were automatically designated as ``Enterprise \n     Zones,'' it would give cities many advantages to undertake \n     economic development projects. For example, special \n     enterprise zone designation for military bases would allow \n     communities to use tax credits for hiring out-of-work federal \n     employees.\n    recommendation 6: eliminate the requirement that military base \n  conversions comply with duplicative state and federal environmental \n                              regulations\n\n       Mayors call for better coordination between state and \n     federal governments to eliminate the needless duplication of \n     efforts required for environmental compliance. The cost and \n     time involved in trying to comply with both federal and state \n     regulations are enormous. Many of these regulations are \n     duplicative. The federal government should agree to find \n     compliance with state regulations that are substantially \n     equivalent, provided that the state agrees to meet federal \n     timetables and provide a single point of contact.\n\n\n recommendation 7: clarify native american participation in the reuse \n                                  plan\n\n       The law remains unclear regarding which entities of the \n     federal government have the authority to make claims on \n     behalf of Native American Tribes. Some communities have spent \n     months on reuse plans, only to have them stopped at the last \n     minute by claims from the Department of Interior. Mayors call \n     for better coordination among the armed services and the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the Department of \n     Interior to clarify the rights of Native Americans with \n     regard to military bases.\nRecommendation 8: Exemption/Extension of Military Base Conversion from \n   Uniform Building Codes, Uniform Fire Codes and the Americans With \n                      Disabilities Act Compliance\n\n       Although all mayors feel compliance with federal and local \n     laws is important, immediate compliance with many federal \n     building codes is simply impossible. Most military properties \n     are not up to code. Unless the federal government is willing \n     pay to bring these properties up to code, mayors ask that the \n     time for compliance be lengthened, or that compliance be left \n     to the discretion of the local governments which are \n     responsible for enforcing these codes.\n\n\nRecommendation 9: Clarify Ownership Rights to Air Emission Credits Upon \n                       Closure of a Military Base\n\n       All air emission credits should be classified as a local \n     asset under the law, especially in those cities where strict \n     air emission limits exist. The federal government should \n     provide for prompt transfer of any credits formerly used by \n     the military in connection with base property.\n\n\n   Recommendation 10: Require the Federal Government to Pay for the \n   Removal of Functionally and Economically Obsolete Structures and \n                   Fixtures on Closed Military Bases\n\n       As noted in Recommendation #8, many buildings on military \n     bases do not meet building codes. In many cases it would cost \n     more to fix us these buildings than it would to tear them \n     down. Mayors ask that the federal government provide the \n     funding to remove all obsolete structures and fixtures from \n     closed military bases. Further, that these anticipated costs \n     be considered among the criteria used by the Base Realignment \n     and Closure Commission (BRAC) to determine whether or not a \n     particular base should be closed.\n    recommendation 11: enact legislation to permit dual use of bases\n\n       Although the law makes reference to dual use capability \n     (i.e., military and civilian use of base properties \n     simultaneously), the reality is that dual use is largely left \n     to the discretion of the local base commander. Mayors call \n     for clarification and consistency from the Department of \n     Defense to permit dual use activities on all military bases \n     and that a prescribed method be established for communities \n     to actively present a dual use plan for those facilities \n     considered to be surplus by the military.\n\n\n   recommendation 12: educate bond raters and insurers regarding the \n         actual impact of closed military bases on bond ratings\n\n       There is a deep lack of understanding among bond raters and \n     insurers with regard to the impact of base closings on local \n     communities. Although this is not a federal concern, the \n     mayors would like the federal government to be aware that \n     they plan to send a delegation to Wall Street to meet with \n     bond raters and insurers to help reduce the misunderstandings \n     that result in lower bond ratings and difficulties for cities \n     to obtain the necessary insurance coverage following a base \n     closing.\n\n\n         recommendation 13: open the federal appraisal process\n\n       Many communities have had the experience of not knowing how \n     the federal appraisal of base properties was made, and have \n     had no chance to react to it, challenge it, or offer an \n     appraisal of their own. Since the property appraisal process \n     has a tremendous impact on the local community, this process \n     needs to include more local involvement. More importantly, \n     this process needs to emphasize the exchange of properties \n     for local conversion to promote private sector participation \n     (i.e., in cases where the local government retains ownership \n     and then leases these properties to the private sector).\n    Recommendation 14: Preserve Financial and Technical Support for \n Communities Affected by Previous Base Closure Processes (1988, 1991, \n                                 1993)\n\n       Mayors unanimously support the involvement of the Economic \n     Development Administration (EDA) at the U.S. Department of \n     Commerce and the Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) at the \n     U.S. Department of Defense in assisting those communities \n     affected by military base closings and defense industry \n     downsizing. The majors call for the continued support of \n     these agencies and for increased funding, commensurate with \n     the impact of the 1995 BRAC round, and any subsequent rounds.\n       Additionally, mayors call for special consideration to be \n     given to those communities hard hit by previous BRAC rounds \n     and ask that the 1995 BRAC decisions take into account the \n     cummulative economic impact on these communities. Whenever \n     possible, the federal government should consider relocating \n     other federal agencies/programs to these affected \n     communities.\n\n\n  Recommendation 15: Clarification of the Definition of Military Bases\n\n       Military bases should be clearly defined under the law \n     (i.e., what constitutes a military reservation for the \n     purposes of BRAC). In addition, mayors ask that GOCO \n     (Government Owned Contract Operated), munitions and other \n     defense related facilities be considered for inclusion under \n     the BRAC law, should the BRAC law be extended beyond 1995. \n     (Note: Currently these properties are evaluated under GSA and \n     other federal rules and regulations.)\n     Recommendation 16: Make Further Revisions/Review of the Pryor \n                               Amendments\n\n       The local reuse authority should have the right to \n     reserve--prior to any non-Department of Defense screening--\n     all or part of a base for an economic development conveyance \n     application. This application could occur prior to or during \n     the planning process, but should not have to wait until the \n     plan is completed.\n\n\n      Recommendation 17: Address Hazardous Waste Cleanup of Bases\n\n       There is no question that the federal government is \n     responsible and liable for cleanup of military bases. \n     However, it is clear that the federal government greatly \n     underestimated the cost of cleanup. Since communities cannot \n     develop sites until they are cleaned up, it is recommended \n     that the Federal government either allocate more money for \n     cleanup or change the regulations for [[Page S6682]] military \n     bases. The federal government must adhere to a timetable for \n     clean up, just as it imposes timetables on local governments \n     and private contractors. Furthermore, communities in all \n     states should be allowed to separate clean parcels of land \n     from dirty parcels to allow economic development plans to \n     move forward.\n\n\n      Recommendation 18: Give Consideration to Local Job Creation\n\n       Many of the jobs created by a base closure are in the area \n     of environmental cleanup, base security, utility \n     improvements, and the demolition of buildings. Priority \n     should be given to local residents for these jobs/contracts. \n     Also, special job training should be made available locally \n     to ensure that federal employees who served the nation so \n     well for so many years receive every possible opportunity we \n     can give them, especially since many of these people are just \n     a few years away from receiving retirement benefits.\n        recommendation 19: priority for public benefit transfer\n\n       Every piece of property should be considered for Public \n     Benefit Transfer/Economic Development Conveyance (EDC) before \n     the federal government begins selling to the highest bidder. \n     As soon as a piece of property is identified for an EDC, a \n     community should be allowed to approach local financial \n     lending institutions to give interested parties quick access \n     to these properties.\n\n\n    recommendation 20: provide title insurance for federal property\n\n       Mayors recommend that the federal government provide title \n     insurance for all federal properties. Given the hazards and \n     unknowns about federal properties, particularly from an \n     environmental point of view, it is not going to do a city any \n     good to have title to these properties, and then attempt to \n     turn around and convey them--whether that be to a non-profit \n     or private outfit--only to find out that they cannot get the \n     title insured.\n                                                                    ____\n\n The American County Platform and Resolutions 1994-1995--Community and \n                          Economic Development\n\n            (From the NACO National Association of Counties)\n\n\n            2.5 challenges and local impacts of base closure\n       The adverse economic impacts of military base closures are \n     devastating for small or rural communities and metropolitan \n     areas. Base activities of ten play a dominant role in local \n     and regional economies. Many communities have witnessed the \n     departure of ten to 30 percent of their population as a \n     result of a base closure. Economic downturns and slow \n     economic growth over the past several years have hurt the \n     ability of large and small communities to adjust to base \n     closures, particularly when they must grapple with the \n     cumulative effects of cuts in other federal programs. For an \n     impacted community of any size, the transition of a closing \n     military base to civilian use is a long, difficult and costly \n     process.\n       Job Loss. The most immediate impact felt by a base closure \n     community is the loss of both military and civilian jobs at \n     the base, followed by secondary jobs, particularly retail and \n     service positions in the surrounding community. These job \n     losses then lead to population loss as people leave the area \n     in search of new jobs. The Department of Defense (DoD) often \n     does not allow local businesses to provide environmental \n     testing and cleanup services that would create jobs in \n     communities in which bases are closed.\n       Eroding Tax Base. Local sales and income tax revenues \n     decline as population and incomes drop, and the decline in \n     real estate values reduces property tax revenues. This \n     erosion of the tax base reduces the ability of local \n     governments to provide needed services--job training, job \n     search assistance, health services, substance abuse \n     counseling, domestic violence prevention, and possibly \n     welfare assistance--just as the need for them increases.\n       Increased Local Government Costs. Local governments can \n     incur substantial long-term costs as a result of a base \n     closure within their jurisdiction. These costs include \n     maintenance of roads, buildings and other infrastructure and \n     provisions for police and fire protection on the base. These \n     services may be provided by a caretaker force until the base \n     property is transferred, but the local government will have \n     to provide services to the area after transfer. It\n      is important for local governments/reuse entities to have \n     the opportunity to provide caretaker services which would \n     provide continuity and enhance transition to reuse. Large \n     portions of base property are often available for public \n     benefit transfer for aviation, education, health care, \n     public recreation and historic preservation. Organizations \n     that receive base property for these purposes are \n     typically tax-exempt and pay no property taxes to offset \n     the costs of local government services.\n       Substandard Buildings and Infrastructure. Many buildings \n     and much of the physical infrastructure, such as streets and \n     utility lines, on military bases do not meet the requirements \n     of the uniform building, electrical and other codes that set \n     the national standard for what is required for civilian use. \n     Unless the federal government assures that transferred \n     facilities are in good working order and comply with \n     applicable federal, state and local codes, including the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act, local governments will face \n     burdensome maintenance and renovation costs as they assume \n     jurisdiction over closed bases.\n       Declining Real Estate Values. In response to the loss of \n     job opportunities and the drop in population, real estate \n     values decline, particularly in residential real estate. \n     There often is a sudden surplus of housing and a deficit of \n     people who want to live in the area. This decline in real \n     estate values can be exacerbated by the presence of vacant \n     military housing on the base which is perceived as adding to \n     the supply of housing. The value of commercial and industrial \n     real estate also declines. Building space on the base may \n     represent more than a ten year supply for the local \n     community. Owners have less incentive to invest in their \n     property as real estate values decrease. As a result, local \n     governments will likely encounter new hazards throughout \n     their community from under maintained and abandoned property.\n       Adverse Impact on Local Banks. Often large numbers of small \n     multi-family units exist around military bases. When the \n     military withdraws, the units are empty, and owners cannot \n     pay their mortgages. Local banks have indicated a willingness \n     to restructure loans. However, examiners from the Comptroller \n     of the Currency will reclassify these loans as non-\n     performing. Regulatory relief is needed during the \n     transitional period to allow an orderly restructuring of \n     these loans.\n       Strong, proactive support from the President is vitally \n     needed to assist in conversion and reuse efforts. Active \n     leadership on the part of the Secretary of Defense and the \n     service secretaries is critical. The administration needs to \n     look for ways to expedite reuse, reduce delays, and cut costs \n     to closure communities.\n       2.5.1 Federal Oversight of Base Closures--Efficient \n     conversion of closed bases to productive civilian uses will \n     require the coordinated efforts of several departments of the \n     federal government. Conflicting missions within DoD and among \n     other federal departments and agencies have slowed the base \n     reuse process and added to the difficulties reuse communities \n     face. Congress and DoD have made unrealistic estimates of the \n     profits that the federal government will receive from reuse \n     of closed installations. As a result, the conversion process \n     is delayed, because base commanders are often forced to make \n     economically unrealistic demands in the sale or lease of base \n     facilities.\n       An Assistant Secretary of Defense should be appointed in \n     DoD whose primary responsibilities are to ensure rapid \n     conversion of facilities and economic development which \n     enhance local economies and the nation's development as a \n     whole. This senior official must have the authority and \n     responsibility to administer base closure activities for the \n     three branches of the military and coordinate actions taken \n     by federal departments and agencies which impact conversions. \n     It is critical that this person have the confidence and \n     support of the president. This official should foster an \n     intergovernmental partnership through continuing dialogue \n     with the affected communities.\n       A new working group should be formed or modification made \n     in the membership of the Economic Adjustment Commission to \n     meet with the Office of Economic Adjustment. Counties, \n     redevelopment districts, states and cities should have \n     representatives on this working group, and pertinent federal \n     departments and agencies should participate. These include \n     Labor, Commerce, Treasury, Health and Human Service, the \n     Office of Management and Budget, Housing and Urban \n     Development, the Environmental Protection Agency and Small \n     Business Administration.\n       The base closure commission should have greater geographic \n     representation and representatives from local government.\n       The Secretary of Defense should provide clear orders to all \n     commanders on installations designated for closure that their \n     primary mission shall be\n      facilitating swift civilian reuse of the installation while \n     minimizing adverse impacts on the community in which the \n     facility is located.\n       2.5.2 Economic Adjustment Assistance--To maximize the \n     fiscal benefit of base closure, the federal government must \n     assist in the rehabilitation of substandard base facilities \n     and provide creative financing terms to purchasers or \n     developers of closed bases. In addition, DoD must recognize \n     that many facilities, such as airfields, will lose \n     substantial value if they are used and unmaintained or if key \n     equipment is taken from the facility for use elsewhere.\n       Economic adjustment assistance, from the Officer of \n     Economic Adjustment or the President's Economic Adjustment \n     Committee, is absolutely necessary. Such funding should not \n     be limited to reuse planning, but should also be available \n     for special projects on a discretionary basis and for \n     preparing strategic marketing plans, including development, \n     printing and distribution of marketing materials. Funds \n     currently available for planning are inadequate. The cost of \n     preparing general and specific land use plans, while \n     different throughout the United States, exceeds, in every \n     instance, the amount of funds available for reuse planning \n     from the Office of Economic Adjustment.\n       ``Bridge funding'' to enable communities to assume \n     responsibility for large airfields and other military \n     facilities with civilian uses should continue for several \n     years after closure, until the facilities can begin to \n     generate revenue. To preserve taxpayers' investment in these \n     assets, facilities should be maintained, and equipment that \n     is essential for their functioning should remain intact \n     [[Page S6683]] for long-term economic development following \n     conversion.\n       To assist with economic stimulus, the federal government \n     (and state governments) should enter into joint marketing \n     agreements with local governments to promote development of \n     these properties.\n       Continued support for projects related to base closure \n     through the Economic Development Administration remains \n     important. Affected local governments should be eligible for \n     federal dollars which can be used for local priorities, \n     including making loans or grants to businesses that utilize \n     former bases. Any loan repayments should go into a revolving \n     loan fund for use by local governments in financing \n     additional conversion activities.\n       DoD must explore alternative methods to finance the \n     transfer of bases out of federal ownership and the \n     development of new, productive uses on the property. \n     Financing often can be provided without expense to the \n     federal government merely by extending the time period during \n     which an installment purchase of a facility must be paid. \n     Coordinating the disposition and reuse plans with funding \n     available through other federal departments, such as Labor \n     and Transportation, will allow the federal government to \n     obtain a greater overall, long term value for closed bases \n     while mitigating adverse local impacts.\n       Legislation is needed to allow economic development \n     activities to qualify as a public benefit transfer. The cost \n     of appraisals should qualify for these funds.\n       The federal statute which prohibits those who acquire \n     federal property from disposing of it at a profit should be \n     modified, possibly with the federal government sharing a \n     portion of the profit.\n       Allow local reuse authorities to issue tax-exempt \n     industrial development bonds, to serve as business incentives \n     and provide financial support to local closure authorities \n     during the conversion phase.\n       Closing military bases should be made foreign trade zones \n     and federal enterprise zones with the associated tax \n     advantages and investment credits to enable them to attract \n     private investment. Distressed base closure communities \n     should not have to compete for zone designation with other \n     distressed communities. If authorizing legislation limits the \n     number of zones, then base closure sites should be designated \n     in addition to designations for other areas.\n       Any national infrastructure financing programs should set \n     aside funds for infrastructure improvements on former \n     military installations. Bases slated for closure often have \n     substandard and poorly maintained streets, sewers and other \n     utility systems. Infrastructure improvement costs can create \n     insurmountable obstacles to reuse of bases. Conversely, \n     without infrastructure improvements, the federal government \n     will face increasingly costly maintenance costs after base \n     closure.\n       Local contractors should have preference in providing \n     environmental remediation. Local government/reuse entities \n     should have preference in providing interim management and \n     caretaker services.\n       2.5.3 Property Transfer--It is imperative to design and \n     implement a review and transfer process that is consistent \n     among the operating branches within\n      DoD. This needs to be responsive to community reuse \n     objectives and provide prompt transfer of property to \n     accomplish early economic recovery.\n       There has been only one transfer of a major base property \n     pursuant to the 1988 or 1991 base closure laws, out of 200 \n     eligible properties. Only interim leases have been approved, \n     most of which have been limited to one year, and all of which \n     can be canceled with a 30 day notice. This has been one of \n     the greatest obstacles to local planning and development. It \n     is difficult to recruit private businesses to locate on a \n     base when the local governing entity can only offer a one \n     year lease.\n       The pace at which leases are approved is too slow. There \n     have been instances where lease applications have been \n     delayed for more than nine months. DoD should process interim \n     lease applications within 60 days as required by law.\n       DoD should act swiftly to implement PL. 102-426. This bill \n     requires prompt identification and transfer of uncontaminated \n     parcels of base property. ``Parcelization'' of bases with \n     contamination on them has been held up by the Superfund law \n     which forbids the transfer of federal property on the \n     Superfund list until the contamination has been remediated. \n     The law clarifies that uncontaminated parcels of bases on the \n     Superfund list may be transferred before cleanup of \n     contaminated parcels has been completed.\n       Negotiated sales of base property should require \n     congressional review only if valued at $1 million or more. \n     Current law requires congressional review for sales worth \n     $100,000 or more.\n       The McKinney Homeless Assistance Act requires that all \n     federal property, including closing bases, be made available \n     to providers for the homeless. The enormous number and size \n     of public properties on bases were not envisioned when this \n     act was drafted. In order to eliminate any possibility of \n     delay to reuse efforts which result from the ongoing nature \n     of making federal property available to the homeless, \n     legislation should be introduced which limits the screening \n     period for McKinney Act uses on closed bases to the same \n     screening period as federal agencies.\n       Key ``person property'' items such as machinery, equipment, \n     and rolling stock should also be made available to assist in \n     local economic recovery.\n       DoD should reexamine the policy which precludes the \n     demolition of buildings prior to transferring bases. Many \n     buildings are unusable because, for example, they contain \n     asbestos, or do not comply with the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act and state and local building codes.\n       Interim agreements should give local governments preference \n     in exercising police powers and rendering caretaker services. \n     The federal government should reimburse local governments for \n     maintenance costs.\n       2.5.4. Indemification--The threat of catastrophic liability \n     for environmental contamination has seriously dampened \n     efforts to attract private businesses to locate on closed \n     military bases, and directly threatens local governments with \n     potential liability. Reuse of facilities will often require \n     public and private financing for infrastructure, buildings \n     and business operations. Local governments and businesses \n     will not find lenders willing to invest in construction of \n     new facilities on closed bases unless lenders are assured \n     that the federal government will be responsible for damages \n     arising from toxic contamination caused by DoD. \n     Indemnification is a waiver of sovereign immunity that places \n     the federal government in the same position as any other \n     owner of contaminated property. By waiving its sovereign \n     immunity rights, the federal government will enhance the \n     value of its property by making new investment possible.\n       DoD should expeditiously develop policy or regulations to \n     permit interim leasing without demanding waiver of rights to \n     indemnification against environmental liability.\n       2.5.5. Environmental Cleanup--Environmental contamination \n     on bases must be cleaned to a standard that not only protects \n     human health, but also permit reuse of the facility in \n     accordance with locally generated, legally defensible land \n     use plans without the local agencies or private sector having \n     to incur additional cleanup costs in order to reuse the \n     facility. Local jurisdictions must have the opportunity to be \n     active participants in all phases of environmental cleanup, \n     including evaluation of site conditions and selection and \n     implementation of remediation programs. The timetable for \n     environmental impact statements, parcelization, and \n     prioritization should be coordinated with civilian reuse \n     plans.\n       Federal cleanup programs should provide training and \n     employment of local residents to help mitigate the loss of \n     jobs caused by base closure. Use of local contractors should \n     improve compliance with local and state as well as federal \n     standards. Funding for environmental cleanup at closing bases \n     should continue at levels that support timely transfer and \n     conversion.\n       2.5.6 Fair Market Value--Legislation is needed to enable \n     DoD to transfer closing base property to local interests at \n     no cost, reduced cost, or through flexible payment methods \n     according to local conditions. Congress and DoD have made \n     unrealistic estimates for profits the federal government will \n     receive from reuse of closed installations. As a result, the \n     conversion process is delayed, because base commanders are \n     often forced to make economically unrealistic demands in the \n     sale or lease of base facilities.\n       Currently, leases and sales of base property are required \n     to be at ``fair market value'' even in cases where the \n     purchasing community provided the original land to the \n     military at no cost. This requirement hurts the ability of \n     communities to attract new private sector jobs and \n     investments and increases the financial burden on the base \n     closure community.\n       The time period over which local governments must amortize \n     loans to purchase these facilities is too short. Flexible \n     payment methods could include installation sales with payment \n     commencing after reuse operations have begun to show a \n     positive cash flow. Alternatively, a Federal Finance Bank \n     could be authorized to purchase federally guaranteed bonds to \n     be issued by communities for local acquisition of closing \n     base facilities with minimal down payments and at low \n     interest rates.\n       The basis of market value is reuse. Highest and best reuse \n     must be physically possible, appropriately supported, \n     financially feasible, produce the highest monetary return or \n     serve a public or institutional purpose. The appraisal of \n     military bases is complex and challenging. The above \n     definition of highest and best use allows considerable \n     flexibility. A preappraisal agreement between the parties of \n     negotiation would bridge a communication gap in the appraisal \n     process. Areas of agreement may be (1) reuse assumptions, (2) \n     existing physical conditions (including infrastructure), (3) \n     community building code standards required for reuse, and (4) \n     conversion funding resources. Properly communicated, \n     realistic professional differences of opinion can bring about \n     positive insight and assist in identifying the best \n     alternatives and resolving issues. On the other hand, values \n     based on limited knowledge, unrealistic assumptions, or \n     simply widely different reuse considerations can cause \n     communication gaps and negotiation roadblocks. A professional \n     appraisal report that appropriately and realistically \n     addresses existing physical, functional and market conditions \n     and recognizes the gap (costs) between these existing \n     [[Page S6684]] conditions and the ultimate reuse is a \n     valuable resource to assist in disposition/acquisition \n     negotiations. To understand an appraiser's opinion of value, \n     all premises, assumptions, and projections that directed the \n     appraiser should be stated.\n       The appraisal process tends to inflate the value of sites \n     by failing to consider certain factors. For example, the fair \n     market value of an interim lease will go down after the base \n     closes and the available supply of building space skyrockets. \n     The federal government, however, uses the pre closure figure \n     for the value. The government also should consider the cost \n     of holding and maintaining real estate when evaluating the \n     present value of base property. For example, if a base could \n     be sold today for $1.5 million, or four years from now for \n     $10 million, which is the better deal for the federal \n     government if the annual caretaker cost of the property is \n     $2.5 million? A discounted cash flow analysis should be used.\n       Local entities and the military should do joint appraisals. \n     At a minimum the federal government should share appraisal \n     instructions with localities so there is a common basis in \n     assigning value to the cost of such things as asbestos \n     removal and correcting building code violations. Appraisers \n     should be instructed to value land based on uses that are \n     consistent with locally developed land use plans even if the \n     appraiser concludes that such use is not technically ``higher \n     and best use''. As background, the ``higher and best use'' \n     standard is appropriate in circumstances in which land use \n     plans have not been modified for a long time and the \n     appraiser concludes that there is a realistic chance of \n     obtaining local government approval of more intensive uses of \n     the site. Local government will be involved in the reuse \n     plans of any closed base and they will rezone the base in the \n     context of an overall strategy to mitigate the adverse impact \n     of the closure. It is inappropriate, in that context, for an \n     appraiser to step in and suggest that the community or a \n     business cooperating with the community pay a higher price \n     because the appraiser believes that there are other uses to \n     which the land could be put.\n       2.5.7 Job Retraining--The Economic Dislocation and Worker \n     Adjustment Act (EDWAA) administered under Title III of the \n     Job Training Partnership Act currently serves displaced \n     workers including those displaced due to defense downsizing. \n     JTPA programs should continue to be utilized as the framework \n     of any new comprehensive retraining program for dislocated \n     workers.\n       The current EDWAA program would be greatly enhanced by \n     making several changes at the state and federal level:\n       The administration should continue to target discretionary \n     job training funds to those areas in which military bases \n     have been closed or are in the process of closure.\n       The current application process for receiving these funds \n     should be streamlined. Eliminating the lengthy delays in this \n     process would increase the ability of local service providers \n     to administer this program to dislocated military and \n     civilian personnel on a timely basis.\n       Local entities should be given increased flexibility in the \n     types of retraining programs they deem appropriate to operate \n     and be able to bypass the current maze of approvals necessary \n     at the state and federal level.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  [From the National Commission for Economic Conversion & Disarmament]\n\nCommission Calls for More Base Closures and Advance Planning in Current \n                                 Round\n\n\n                        a smaller fourth round?\n\n       On January 24, Defense Secretary William Perry announced \n     that the next and fourth round of base closings ``will not be \n     as large as the last one.'' This represents a sharp change \n     from previous plans to make the next round larger than the \n     previous three combined.\n       Secretary Perry claims the closure process is being slowed \n     by the rising costs of base closure and the current shortage \n     of funds. Yet ``postponing closures only means the likelihood \n     of greater closure costs in the future,'' said ECD Executive \n     Director Greg Bischak, Ph.D., ``and the delay of savings that \n     could be realized from these closures.''\n       Driving the base closure process is the goal of saving \n     money while bringing the base structure in line with the \n     Administration's force structure plans. These intentions have \n     come up against the political pressures provided by the '96 \n     elections as well as short-term budgetary pressures--because \n     it takes money to make money through the base closure \n     process. Yet ``closing fewer bases now will only exacerbate \n     the current mismatch between an extravagant base structure \n     and a smaller force structure,'' said Dr. Bischak. ``The far-\n     flung base structure of the Armed Services is still not \n     scaled to the reduced threats of the post-Cold War world. The \n     taxpayer still pays too much and more downsizing needs to be \n     done.''\n\n\n         force structure reductions should shape current round\n\n       In the last three rounds of base closures, over 70 major \n     bases were selected for closure. The majority of the 20 bases \n     targeted for closure in 1988 in the first round were Army \n     bases. During the 1990 round the Air Force closed 13 and the \n     Navy nine major installations. In the 1993 round the Navy was \n     targeted for the bulk of the closures.\n       Planned reductions in the 1995 round will likely focus on \n     downsizing bases home to heavy armor, bomber wings, Air \n     National Guard tactical air wings and Navy air maintenance \n     depots and ship repair facilities. A number of DoD \n     laboratories sited on bases may be affected by the base \n     closure round.\n       ``Additional force structure reductions are also possible \n     without compromising this nation's security,'' said Dr. \n     Bischak. This would permit additional base closures, for \n     additional savings. According to Commission estimates, over \n     $3.5 billion could be saved from the defense budget on an \n     annual basis by closing unneeded additional bases.\n\n\n                       advance planning is needed\n\n       Efforts to keep bases off the final list constitute the \n     predominant strategy of communities facing possible closure. \n     According to Bischak, ``In past base closure rounds, a `Save \n     the Base' impulse led communities across the nation to spend \n     millions of dollars to save bases while not spending a dime \n     on promoting conversion.'' In the last round of closures, \n     Charleston, South Carolina spent over a million dollars to \n     protect five installations, but managed to save only the \n     local Navy hospital. California mounted a full-court press\n      costing the state millions of dollars. Already this year San \n     Antonio has commitments worth $250,000 to save Brooks Air \n     Force Lab, Kelly Air Force Base and other local \n     facilities. Oklahoma has raised $200,000 to save Tinker \n     Air Force Base and Utah has already spent $300,000 to \n     protect Hill Air Force Base and plans to spend another \n     $300,000 before the final decision is made.\n       A Commission report by Catherine Hill with James Raffel, \n     ``Military Base Closures in the 1990s: Lessons for \n     Redevelopment,'' concludes from a review of past base closure \n     experiences that communities doing the most advance planning \n     reap the greatest returns in jobs and economic opportunity. \n     Those communities on the hit list in this round of closures \n     should take advantage of protection offered by the FY95 \n     Defense Authorization Act which allows communities to do \n     advance planning without prejudicing them for closure in the \n     decision-making process.\n\n                BASE CLOSURE CONVERSION-RELATED PROGRAMS                \n                          [Dollars in millions]                         \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        Fiscal year--                   \n                                     ------------------                 \n             Department                 1995     1996    Change  Percent\n                                       appro.  request                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense Department:                                                     \n  Military Personnel Assistance.....     $985   $1,146     $161       16\n  Community Assistance (OEA)\\1\\.....       39       59       20       51\n  Base Closure Implementation.......    2,809    3,897    1,088       39\n  Environmental Restoration.........    2,298    2,087     -211       -9\nCommerce Department:                                                    \n  EDA Defense Conversion............      120      120  .......  .......\nLabor Department:                                                       \n  Dislocated Defense Worker                                             \n   Assistance\\2\\....................      178      178  .......  .......\n    Grand total.....................    6,429    7,487    1,058       16\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\Does not include JROTC or National Guard youth programs.             \n\\2\\Numbers based on White House, National Economic Council estimates of \n  dollars going to defense workers from general dislocated workers      \n  assistance funds (Title III, JTPA; FY95 appropriation for this program\n  was $1.3 billion; FY96 request is $1.4 billion).                      \n\n                base closure conversion-related funding\n\n       In addition to legal protection for advance planning, funds \n     are available for communities affected by proposed base \n     closures that wish to pursue planning for economic \n     development, worker retraining, and facility conversion. DoD \n     was appropriated $2.8 billion for base closure implementation \n     for FY95. The $2.3 billion appropriated for environmental \n     restoration of Defense Department facilities may be the most \n     important investment, because toxic contamination remains the \n     greatest obstacle to base redevelopment. According to \n     Bischak, ``Up-front investments are required to enable rapid \n     and environmentally responsible economic development.''\n       In addition, the assistance provided by the Defense \n     Department's Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) is \n     invaluable in providing technical assistance and grants to \n     communities seeking to do advance planning. The \n     implementation of communities' conversion planning is made \n     possible by grants from the Economic Development \n     Administration within the Commerce Department. These grants \n     provide substantial funds for a range of services including: \n     infrastructure development, technology initiatives, revolving \n     loan funds and other economic development strategies. These \n     funds are of vital importance because they leverage private \n     sector and local public sector dollars for targeted \n     investments to alleviate the sudden economic dislocation \n     caused by base closures.\n       Funds from the Labor Department's Dislocated Worker Program \n     and the Defense Department's Military Personnel Transition \n     Assistance Program round out the palette of available \n     assistance for communities and workers facing base closures. \n     Both defense industry workers and employees of closed bases \n     are eligible for assistance under the $178 million going to \n     dislocated defense worker retraining, and active duty \n     personnel and civilian base employees are eligible for \n     military transition assistance.\n\n\n                      Successful Conversion Models\n\n       Communities at risk should look to successful models of \n     conversion for instruction and encouragement. Both past and \n     current bases possess assets of considerable potential use to \n     the surrounding communities. Reuse is largely conditioned by \n     the nature of the facilities on the base. Such facilities may \n     include airfields, hospitals, or clinics, child care \n     facilities, stores, theaters, recreational facilities and \n     housing. Successful base reuse usually results from a \n     community's ability to identify the comparative advantages of \n     its regional economy and connect its base redevelopment \n     effort to them. [[Page S6685]] \n       Urban base reuse is generally easier than rural base reuse \n     given a city's economic diversification and demand for the \n     real estate and services that a redeveloped base might \n     provide. As an example, the transformation of McCoy Air Force \n     Base in Orlando into an air cargo transport hub brought about \n     the employment of 6,000 people, easily compensating for the \n     loss of 395 jobs.\n       Rural base reuse can also be successful given the proper \n     planning. Presque Isle, closed in 1961, was located in an \n     isolated rural location. However, the local leadership was \n     able to transform the base into an economically diverse \n     center by planning strategically, inviting outside companies \n     to the site and prorating rent to the number of new jobs \n     created. 1,302 jobs were created with new industrial tenants \n     including Indian Head Plywood, Arrostook Shoe Company, \n     International Paper, Converse Rubber Company, Northeast \n     Publishing and a vocational training school.\n       Industrial parks are a popular option for base reuse. \n     However, communities should be conscious of the wide variety \n     of other possible projects. Air Force bases and naval air \n     stations remain clear candidates for new municipal or \n     regional airports and air cargo hubs. Redevelopment of former \n     bases as schools has been a successful model with 47 bases \n     closed in the 1960s and 1970s now having schools on them. And \n     while using bases for low-income and homeless housing does \n     not raise money through sale, it does achieve other important \n     national objectives while allowing local governments to \n     acquire the property at little or no cost. Other government \n     uses are also possible, including administrative facilities, \n     hospitals, postal distributions centers and offices, \n     rehabilitation centers and prisons. Often, bases are large \n     enough to accommodate public services and private \n     developments under a ``mixed-use'' strategy.\n               ingredients of successful base conversion\n\n       (1) Advance Planning; Communities should take full \n     advantage of the protection provided by the law as well as \n     the assistance provided by the Office of Economic Adjustment \n     in the Defense Department to plan for base reuse before a \n     closure occurs. They must evaluate the comparative advantages \n     of alternative civilian purposes and the means of linking \n     these economic development strategies with retraining \n     options.\n       (2) The programs responsible for funding advance planning, \n     economic development and retraining must all be funded \n     sufficiently to provide adequate resources to support the \n     base closure process.\n       (3) These programs, spread out over the Departments of \n     Defense, Commerce and Labor, must be coordinated so that they \n     can deliver comprehensive services efficiently.\n       (4) Cleanup funding should come from the DoD budget to \n     discourage further pollution. The Federal Facilities \n     Compliance Act and the federal agreements signed by the DoD, \n     the EPA and State governments give State officials authority \n     to enforce hazardous waste laws by levying fines and exacting \n     other penalties on the Federal Government for lack of \n     compliance with environmental regulations. Governor Pete \n     Wilson of California recognized this right in a recent letter \n     to Defense Secretary Perry stating, ``California expects DOD \n     to comply with the federal/state cleanup agreements it has \n     signed at California military bases. DOD is contractually \n     obligated to seek sufficient funding to permit environmental \n     work to proceed according to the schedule contained in those \n     agreements. California will not hesitate to assert its right \n     under those agreements to seek fines, penalties and judicial \n     orders compelling DOD to conduct required environmental \n     work.''\n       (5) There are many stakeholders in base reuse development. \n     Local, state and federal government officials, private \n     developers, universities, and local citizens and citizens \n     groups all have a valuable role to play. No single party \n     should be excluded or allowed to dominate the process. An \n     active government role is essential to ensure that in \n     instances where reuse is feasible, conversion plans carefully \n     weigh the interests of private developers and the community's \n     social and economic needs.\n       Since the bases are government property, the opportunity to \n     use these former bases for public purposes should not be \n     overlooked. A concreted planning effort, informed by an \n     understanding of the differences among bases, is essential. \n     With federal leadership and local activism, the downsizing of \n     the military base structure could produce a host of assets to \n     spur new economic development in communities across the \n     nation.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6679-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6685-S6687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       IS AMERICA GOING TO LEAD?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is an important question hanging over \nus like Damocles' sword today. It will loom over us as we consider the \nbudget. It will confront us directly as we debate the reorganization of \nour foreign affairs agencies. The question is, Is America going to \nlead?\n  This is not a question that keeps people awake at night anymore. \nAfter all, people ask, we won the cold war, did we not? There is no \nlonger any real threat to America's security, is there?\n  Mr. President, there have been few times in history when the United \nStates can less afford to be complacent. The world today is anything \nbut a predictable, peaceful place. While we are fortunate that the \nmilitary threat to our security has receded, it is more true today than \never that American prosperity is linked to conditions in the rest of \nthe world.\n  Millions of American jobs depend upon persuading other countries to \nopen their borders of U.S. exports, and helping them raise their \nincomes so they can afford to buy our exports. Ensuring that we have \nclean air and clean water depends upon international action to protect \nthe environment. Keeping Americans healthy depends on joint action to \nfight the spread of infectious diseases in other countries. Imagine if \nwe are unable to contain the recent outbreak of a deadly virus in \nZaire--very quickly you would see Senators clamoring for more aid to \nstop it from reaching our shores.\n  Stemming the flow of illegal immigrants and refugees to the United \nStates depends on promoting democracy and economic development in the \ncountries from which the refugees are fleeing. These are just a few \nexamples of why we continue to have an enormous stake in what happens \nin the rest of the world.\n  Fortunately, the United States, the only remaining superpower with \nthe largest economy and the most powerful military, can influence what \nhappens in the rest of the world.\n  But influence is not automatic. It requires effort. And it costs \nmoney.\n  Perhaps most important, the United States needs to maintain its \nleadership in and its financial contributions to the international \norganizations that make critical contributions to promoting peace, \ntrade, and economic development. Organizations like the United Nations, \nthe World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the \nWorld Bank, to name a few. These\n organizations are the glue that holds our international system \ntogether. They may not always act in precisely the way we would like, \nbut they are dedicated to spreading the values that Americans hold \ndear--freedom, democracy, free enterprise, and competition.\n\n  The American people also want to help alleviate the suffering of \npeople facing starvation or other calamities, like refugees fleeing \ngenocide in Rwanda, or the hundreds of thousands of victims of \nlandmines.\n  Finally Mr. President, the polls show that most Americans believe we \nshould help developing countries and countries making the transition \nfrom communism to democracy and market economies. It is through this \naid that we fight poverty, that we stabilize population growth, that we \neducate people who have never known anything except tyranny in the \nbasics of representative government, and that we encourage countries to \nopen their economies to trade and competition.\n  We do these things because it is in our national interest. Yet, in \nthe rush to reduce Federal spending some are dismissing spending on \ninternational affairs as a luxury we cannot afford, or even a waste.\n  The United States cannot pay these costs alone, but no one is asking \nus to. The United States now ranks 21st among donors in the percentage \nof national income that it devotes to development assistance. Twenty-\nfirst. Right behind Ireland. We aren't even the largest donor in terms \nof dollar amount anymore. Japan, which has a keen sense of what is in \nits national interest, has passed us.\n  Six years ago, when I became chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, the foreign operations budget was $14.6 billion. We cut \nthat budget by 6.5 percent, not even taking into account inflation--\nwhile the remainder of the discretionary spending in the Federal budget \nincreased by 4.8 percent. Those cuts were a calculated response to the \nend of the cold war. Foreign aid today is substantially less than it \nwas during the Reagan and Bush administrations. Our entire foreign aid \nprogram, including funding for the Exim Bank and foreign military \nfinancing and other activities that have as much to do with promoting \nU.S. exports as with helping other countries, today accounts for less \nthan 1 percent of the total Federal budget.\n  We must recognize that there is a limit to how far we can cut our \nbudget for international affairs, and still maintain our leadership \nposition in the world. Just when many people thought \n[[Page S6686]] U.S. influence was reaching new heights, we are seeing \nthe ability of the United States to influence world events eroding.\n  This budget proposal amounts to a classic example of penny-wise and \npound-foolish. Our allies are scratching their heads, wondering why the \nUnited States, with the opportunity to exercise influence in the world \nmore cheaply than ever before, is turning its back and walking away. We \nare inviting whoever else wants to--friend or foe--to step into the \nvacuum and pursue their interests at our expense.\n  Mr. President, the United States stands as a beacon of liberty and \nhope for people throughout the world. But we should be more than a \nbeacon. A beacon is passive. We should be proactive, reaching out to \ndefend our interests, and to help our less-fortunate neighbors. We \nshould continue to invest in the world. We should continue to lead.\n  Mr. President, I want to say a few words about Republican proposals \nto reform the U.S. foreign affairs agencies. Senator Helms, the \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has launched a \nbroad proposal to reform foreign policymaking in the Federal \nGovernment. This proposal includes provisions for completely \nrestructuring the way we administer our foreign aid programs. Senator \nHelms asserts that U.S. foreign policymaking has become so \ndecentralized that it no longer serves the national interest. He \nproposes to merge most foreign affairs functions into the Department of \nState.\n  As the former chairman and now ranking Democrat on the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, I have had some opportunity to be involved in \nthe U.S. Government's conduct of foreign policy, and I have some \nthoughts about Senator Helms' proposal.\n  While I have long advocated better coordination among the executive \nbranch agencies in foreign policymaking, I believe Senator Helms' \nproposal would result in U.S. national interests being less well, not \nbetter, served.\n  Why is the Foreign Agricultural Service administered by the \nDepartment of Agriculture and not by the State Department? Because \nfarmers know they can count on USDA to represent their interests better \nthan the Department of State and all experiences have proven that.\n  Why, 15 years ago, did we take the commercial function away from the \nState Department and create a Foreign Commercial Service in the \nDepartment of Commerce? It was because State had for years neglected \nexport promotion, sacrificed export interests to its foreign policy \npriorities, and treated its commercial officers as second-class \nemployees. It was because the American business community was clamoring \nfor something better.\n  The reason we have separate foreign service bureaucracies is that \nmany of our foreign\n policy interests are actually domestic policy interests that are best \npursued abroad by technical experts from domestic policy agencies, not \nby foreign policy generalists from the State Department. I do not know \nabout North Carolina farmers, but I can tell you that Vermont farmers \nare not at all anxious to see the State Department expand its influence \nover U.S. foreign agricultural policy. They fear that shifting power \nfrom domestic agencies to the State Department will not strengthen \nrepresentation of United States interests in United States policy but \nrather will strengthen representation of French interests and Argentine \ninterests and Russian interests.\n\n  Let me focus on the specific question of restructuring America's \nforeign assistance program. I have been advocating reform of our \nforeign aid program ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall, so I \nwelcome this opportunity for discussion of this issue.\n  Senator Helms says that our foreign aid program should further our \nnational interests. I absolutely agree.\n  But I do not agree with his definition of the problem. The problem is \nnot that the Agency for International Development is ignoring America's \nnational interests. The problem is that since 1961 when the Foreign \nAssistance Act was enacted, much of our foreign aid was allocated to \nwinning allies in the fight against communism. Billions went to right-\nwing dictatorships with little or no commitment to democracy or \nimproving the living conditions of their people, or even allowing \nbusiness competition. Much of that aid failed by the standards we apply \ntoday. But it is unfair and disingenuous to judge AID's effectiveness \ntoday against the failures of the past, when our goals were \nfundamentally different.\n  AID needs a new legislative mandate. We need to get rid of cold war \npriorities and replace them with priorities for the 21st century.\n  The Secretary of State has full authority under statute to give \npolicy direction to AID, and the State Department influences AID's \nactivities every day. If AID's projects deviate from State Department \npolicy, it is not because AID is out of control, it is because the \npeople at State are not paying enough attention to what AID is \nproposing to do.\n  Senator Helms also does not give sufficient credit to the Clinton \nadministration for its efforts to improve AID performance. Over the the \npast 2 years, we have seen dramatic progress at the Agency for \nInternational Development and the Treasury and State Departments in \nredefining our foreign aid priorities and focusing resources where they \ncan achieve the most in advancing U.S. interests abroad, in spite of \nthe constraints of an obsolete Foreign Assistance Act.\n   AID Administrator Brian Atwood has made extensive changes at AID. He \ninitiated an agency-wide streamlining effort that has resulted in the \nclosure of 27 missions and a reduction of 1,200 staff. He is installing \nstate-of-the-art data processing systems that link headquarters in \nWashington with project officers in the field in real time. This will \nensure that information available at one end of the management pipeline \nis also available at the other, increasing efficiency and improving \ndecisionmaking.\n  Mr. Atwood has decentralized decisionmaking so that people closest to \nproblems have a full opportunity to design solutions. AID is improving \nits performance because, for the first time since the mid-1980's, it \nhas hands-on leadership that is committed to making our foreign aid \nprograms effective.\n  Can AID improve its management performance further? Yes. But would \nthe State Department do better? I doubt it. I believe that abolishing \nAID and asking regional Assistant Secretaries at the State Department \nto manage its functions would be a serious mistake. These Assistant \nSecretaries are chosen for their expertise in broad foreign policy. \nMany do not have experience managing money and programs. And they are \noverworked now trying to deal with the daily emergencies and \ncomplexities of our political relationships with countries in their \nregions.\n  Even former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, a Republican, \nexpressed doubt about this proposal in his testimony before the Foreign \nRelations Committee on March 23. ``The State Department is not well \nsuited, either by historical experience or current bureaucratic \nculture, to assume many of these new responsibilities,'' Secretary \nEagleburger said. And he was trying to be supportive of the Helms \nproposal.\n  I would put the matter a little less delicately: The State \nDepartment's specialty is making policy; it has never and probably \nnever will manage programs well. Secretary Eagleburger offered the hope \nthat, with very careful selection of Under Secretaries, it might do \nbetter. I am reluctant to trade a bureaucracy that is doing reasonably \nwell and getting better at delivering foreign aid for one that has no \ncompetence on the outside chance that it might get better. If we \ndisperse responsibility for foreign aid among Assistant Secretaries of \nState, I bet that we will start hearing more stories about misguided \nand failed projects, not fewer, and more questions about why we have \nforeign aid, not fewer.\n  AID today is performing a wide array of tasks that enjoy overwhelming \nsupport among the American people.\n  Every year, AID manages programs worth $1 billion aimed at protecting \nthe Earth's environment. Does protecting the Earth's forests, oceans, \nand atmosphere matter to us? Does it further our foreign policy \ninterests? A century from now we are not going to have any foreign \npolicy if we do not join with [[Page S6687]] other countries today to \nprotect the environment.\n  Every year, AID manages hundreds of millions of dollars in \ninternational health programs. Is this money wasted? We might as well \nask whether AIDS and tuberculosis are infectious.\n  Every year, AID commits a large part of its budget to promoting free \nmarkets and democratic development in countries where the United States \nhas important interests. This is not diplomacy. It is hands-on \nassistance that requires people with special expertise on the ground \nwho can get the job done. Working with foreign governments and private \norganizations on the nuts and bolts of solving real problems. That is \nwhat AID does.\n  Mr. President, we have a strong need to rewrite the Foreign \nAssistance Act to redefine the framework for foreign aid. AID can \ncontinue to downsize and improve its efficiency. But we should not \nabolish an agency that is aggressively adapting itself to the changed \nworld we live in and to the shrinking foreign aid budget.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6685-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      OREGON RECIPIENTS OF OUTSTANDING COMMUNITY INVESTMENT AWARDS\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as Congress begins the difficult task of \nconfronting our Federal deficit and addressing the needs of our less-\ndeveloped communities, we must focus on innovative ideas to meet these \nneeds. Bureaucracy has often failed to provide successful solutions, \nmaking the formation of public-private partnerships necessary to \njointly aid neighborhoods. Successful community development must be \nlocally specialized. Attempts by Congress to write a Federal \nprescription for our Nation's underdeveloped communities will not \nsucceed unless these strategies are sensitive to the diverse needs of \nthose localities.\n  One organization is making a difference in developing communities by \nproviding localized, market-guided assistance. The Social Compact is a \ncoalition of hundreds of leaders from the financial services and \ncommunity development industries who have combined their forces to \nstrengthen America's at-risk neighborhoods, both urban and rural. \nFirmly grounded in John Locke's thesis of a covenant between members of \nsociety and the community from which one has prospered, emphasizing \ncommonalities rather than accentuating differences, the Social Compact \nadvocates a voluntary call to action, mobilizing institutions to invest \ntheir unique capabilities in neighborhood self-empowerment \npartnerships.\n  The Social Compact each year recognizes participating partnerships \nfor their achievements in community development. I am pleased to \nannounce that two partnerships in Oregon, the Portland Community \nReinvestment Initiatives partnered with the U.S. Bank of Oregon, and \nthe Northeast Community Development Corp. partnered with First \nInterstate Bank of Oregon, each received the Social Compact's 1995 \nOutstanding Community Investment Award.\n  Portland Community Reinvestment Initiatives and U.S. Bank of Oregon \nwere recognized for their efforts in reclaiming 350 properties located \nin some of Portland's most vulnerable areas. This pioneering response \nto an unprecedented affordable housing crisis in northeast Portland has \ngiven residents the opportunity to become homeowners and improve the \nsupply of quality, affordable rental properties as a permanent \ncommunity asset. Portland Community Reinvestment Initiatives was \ncreated by the city of Portland in an effort to provide a long-term \nremedy for large scale foreclosures facing northeast Portland. U.S. \nBank of Oregon stepped forward with a pioneering financing solution. \nThe outcome of this teamwork resulted in one-third of the homes being \npurchased by lower-income families and the remaining units are being \nrehabilitated into affordable rentals.\n  The Northeast Community Development Corp. and First Interstate Bank \nof Oregon were recognized for developing a comprehensive program to \nprovide the opportunity for homeownership for 250 Portland families, \nreclaiming 4 vulnerable inner northeast Portland neighborhoods. \nInitially funded by a Federal Nehemiah Housing Opportunity grant, the \nNortheast Community Development Corp. original aim was to construct and \nrenovate 250 single-family homes that would later provide first-time \nhome ownership opportunities for lower and moderate-income families.\n  First Interstate took the lead in the project by providing \nconstruction financing, grant funding, and a line of credit for the \ndevelopment of the first five demonstration homes. First Interstate \nprovided additional assistance by organizing a consortium of six local \nleaders to commit $1.9 million in construction financing and first-time \nhomebuyer programs for potential borrowers.

A bill to provide for hearing care services by audiologists \nto Federal civilian employees; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n               the hearing care for federal employees act\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ninclude audiology services in the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nProgram [FEHBP].\n  This bill would amend the statute governing the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program by requiring FEHBP insurance carriers to \nguarantee direct access to, and reimbursement for, audiologist-provided \nhearing care services when hearing care is covered under a FEHBP plan.\n  The statute governing FEHBP, title 5, United States Code, section \n8902(k)(1), allows direct access to services provided by optometrists, \nclinical psychologists and nurse midwives, yet fails to allow direct \naccess to services provided by audiologists in FEHBP plans covering \nhearing care services.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would remedy this situation by \npermitting direct access to audiology services in FEHBP plans covering \nhearing care services. This measure will not increase health care costs \nsince it would not mandate any new insurance benefits. On the contrary, \nthe bill should reduce costs of hearing care by facilitating direct \naccess to health care providers who are uniquely qualified to diagnose \nthe extent and causes of hearing impairment.\n  I hope my colleagues will carefully consider this legislation and \njoin me in support of its enactment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 802. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation and coastwise trade endorsement for the \nvessel Royal Affaire; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                     trading privileges legislation\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \ndirect the vessel Royal Affaire, official No. 649292, to be accorded \ncoastwise trading privileges and to be issued a certificate of \ndocumentation under section 12103 of title 46, United States Code.\n  The Royal Affaire was constructed in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1980. \nThe vessel, a sailboat, is 76.3 feet in length, 20.3 feet in breadth, \nand 8.8 feet in depth and is self-propelled.\n  The vessel was purchased by Homer C. Burrous of Charleston, SC, in \n1989 for approximately $900,000, with the intention of chartering the \nvessel for cruises in and out of St. Thomas and other foreign ports in \nthe Caribbean. Since purchasing the vessel in 1989, the owner has had \nthe vessel refitted in a U.S. shipyard at a cost of over $800,000. Mr. \nBurrous would like to utilize the vessel to conduct coastal cruises. \nHowever, because the vessel was built in New Zealand, it does not meet \nthe requirements for a coastwise license endorsement in the United \nStates.\n  The owner of the Royal Affaire is seeking a waiver of the existing \nlaw because he wishes to use the vessel for coastal cruises. His \ndesired intentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the \ncoastwise trade in U.S. waters. If he is granted this waiver, it is his \nintention to comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety \nrequirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to \nallow the Royal Affaire to engage in the coastwise trade and fisheries \nof the United States.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 803. A bill to amend the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act \nof 1990 in order to revise the process for disposal of property located \nat installations closed under that act pursuant to the 1995 base \nclosure round; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                  the base transition acceleration act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat will finally ensure that fairness and discipline are exercised \nduring the conveyance and land transfer portion of the 1995 BRAC round. \nThe Base Transition Acceleration Act will do three things: eliminate \nthe ability of special interests, under the existing process, to impose \nendless delays and reap unfair benefits; appropriately place control of \nthe redevelopment process in the hands of the communities affected by \nthe BRAC; and speed the economic recovery of those communities \nadversely impacted by the closing of a military installation in their \nmidst.\n  Mr. President, the end of the cold war provided a unique opportunity \nfor this Nation to safely down-size our Armed Forces. Doing so required \nthe execution of a two-phase plan; first, reduce the numbers of \nmilitary personnel; and then, slash infrastructure to a level \nappropriate for the new size of the force. Toward that end, since 1986 \nwe have reduced our military force structure by nearly 40 percent. \nInfrastructure, however, has been trimmed by only about 15 percent.\n  We asked the services to reduce their numbers, they succeeded. We \nattempted to create an apolitical mechanism through which excess \ninfrastructure might be designated for closure; we failed, failed for \ntwo reasons--Government redtape and interference from special interest \ngroups.\n  Since 1988, a new Federal bureaucracy has grown up around the base \nclosure process. Interagency squabbles and turf battles among DOD, EPA, \nInterior, HHS, GSA, and many other entities have caused excessive \ndelays in Federal screening, issuance of conflicting and unhelpful \nregulations, and inordinately intrusive review of redevelopment \nproposals. The result has been increased costs to the Federal \nGovernment and communities alike--including costs to DOD to maintain \nidle military facilities in caretaker status.\n  The Base Transition Acceleration Act legislation eliminates this \nexcessive Federal regulation. The legislation strictly limits the \ntimeframe for Federal property screening and empowers a single agency, \nDOD, to quickly and effectively manage the process. At the same time, \nit removes the Federal Government from the process of formulating \nredevelopment plans and places that responsibility within the purview \nof the communities themselves.\n  Unfortunately, the problems associated with the BRAC process are not \nlimited to those created between the Federal agencies.\n Each additional hand that enters the process brings further \ncomplication and added time. With every new round of the BRAC, more new \nhands enter the process. A cottage industry of consultants has evolved \nand flourished since 1988 when the first round of base closures were \nordered. Special interests are inserting themselves with increasing \nfrequency into the military property disposal process.\n\n  Each of these competing interests has sought the assistance of their \nelected representatives or their sponsor agency, and in most cases \nreceived it. The result should come as a surprise to on one; this \nostensibly apolitical process has become excessively politicized. This \nproposed legislation takes great strides to correct this problem and to \nrestore fairness to the community redevelopment process.\n  Over the past year or so, I, along with most other Members of the \nSenate, have talked extensively with constituents who are deeply \ntroubled by the current round of base closing deliberations. Their \nanxiety is certainly not difficult to understand. The reasons for their \nconcern are, however, dramatically different from those expressed in \nearlier rounds.\n  During the first three rounds, community concerns tended to center \naround the simple question of whether a base in their community would \nbe ordered closed. This time, the issues are far more complex. Not only \ndo our constituents ask whether the base will close, they now ask \nother, more difficult questions. They want to know how to avoid a \nprolonged transition period. They want to know whether to hire \nconsultants. They want to know how to handle special interest groups. \nThey want to know how to deal with the bloated base closure \nbureaucracy. Most of all, they want to know when [[Page S6689]] they \nwill be able to get their lives back on track.\n  These questions represent valid concerns--concerns based in horrific \nexample after horrific example of costly and lengthy legal and \npolitical battles among Federal, State, and local governments, special \ninterest groups, and community members.\n  Mr. President, the simple fact remains--until a reuse decision is \nmade and property is conveyed to the new owners for redevelopment, the \naffected community suffers economically and emotionally.\n  This legislation is simple and straightforward. It will significantly \nreduce the need for communities to employ expensive consulting firms \nbecause it will eliminate the redtape of excessive regulations for \nclosing military bases. It will allow DOD to quickly realize the \nsavings from relinquishing excess military infrastructure. And most \nimportantly, it will relieve the economic stress on local communities \nand allow them to quickly redevelop these former bases in the manner \nbest suited to the community's needs.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY:\n  S. 804. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe excise taxes and tobacco products, and to use a portion of the \nresulting revenues to fund a trust fund for tobacco diversification, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  THE TOBACCO CONSUMPTION REDUCTION AND HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I came to the floor this afternoon to \nsubmit a revised version of my bill to increase the Federal excise tax \non tobacco products. My original bill would take the current tax level \nfor all types of tobacco products and multiply it by 5.167. This would \nraise the tax on a pack of cigarettes from 24 cents a pack to $1.24 a \npack. My revised bill goes one step further to help Americans--\nparticularly children and teenagers--achieve a tobacco-free future.\n  Mr. President, I have been on this floor many times talking about the \ndangers of tobacco use. I have repeatedly stated that tobacco use kills \nwell over 400,000 Americans every year--more than alcohol, heroin, \ncrack, automobile and airplane accidents, homicides, suicides, and AIDS \ncombined. And I have sought to bring attention to the fact that each \nyear a growing number of teenagers start smoking, despite the fact that \nselling cigarettes to minors is illegal. Virtually all new users of \ntobacco are teenagers or younger, and every 30 seconds a child in the \nUnited States smokes for the first time.\n  Yet there is another aspect of the tobacco story which has not \nreceived much attention on the floor of this body. Generally, when \npeople think about the dangers of tobacco use, they think about \ncigarettes. They think about the lung cancer, the emphysema, and the \nheart disease which cigarettes cause in those who use them. And they \nrealize that these health impacts are not limited to those who actually \nsmoke the cigarettes. Rather, environmental tobacco smoke--smoke from \nother people's cigarettes--causes tens of thousands of deaths each \nyear.\n  But as grave as the impacts of cigarette smoking are, they are only \npart of the story of the death and destruction which tobacco products \nwreak on our society. There is another, less well-known yet still \ndevastating side to the tobacco story. And that is the tale of \nsmokeless tobacco products.\n  The use of smokeless tobacco--namely snuff and chew--is skyrocketing \nin the United States. Between 1986 and 1990, sales of snuff grew by \nclose to 50 percent. This increase follows several decades of decline \nin sales and use. Part of this increase can be attributed to increased \nsocial pressures placed on smokers, due largely to concerns about \nsecond-hand smoke. And part of it has been fueled by perception that \nsmokeless products are a safe alternative to smoking.\n  But the belief that snuff and chew are safe is absolutely false. Let \nme state this very clearly: smokeless tobacco can kill you. It kills in \ndifferent ways than cigarettes do, but it kills nonetheless. Smokeless \ntobacco causes mouth cancer. It causes gum cancer. It causes throat \ncancer. These are just a few of the oral problems smokeless tobacco can \ncause. And the threat of developing these diseases, and of dying of \nthem, is very real. Long-term snuff users are 50 times more likely to \ndevelop gum cancer and four times more likely to develop mouth cancer \nthan nonusers. Nearly 30,000 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed \neach year in the United States. Half of those people are dead within 5 \nyears.\n  Smokeless tobacco products are also highly addictive. A typical dose \nof snuff contains two to three times as much nicotine, the addictive \nsubstance in tobacco, as a single cigarette. Because of these health \nrisks, snuff is banned in a growing number of countries, including the \nUnited Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Denmark, \nAustralia, and New Zealand.\n  Despite these health risks, the use of smokeless tobacco is \nskyrocketing in the United States. So who are these new smokeless \nusers--those individuals who are heading down a path of addiction, \ncancer, and death? For the most part, they are children. The average \nage of new smokeless users is 9\\1/2\\ years old. Two-thirds of smokeless \nusers start their habit before they are even 12 years old. It is now \nestimated that 3 million Americans under age 21 use smokeless tobacco, \nincluding 1 out of every 5 high school males.\n  Why is this happening? A large part of the explanation lies in the \ntobacco companies' aggressive marketing toward youth. But another part \nof the explanation is the cost of smokeless tobacco relative to \ncigarettes. Despite its dangers, smokeless tobacco is taxed at only \nabout one-tenth the rate of cigarettes, making it a cheap alternative \nto cigarettes. And since kids are the most price-sensitive of all \ntobacco users, it is not surprising that they are turning to smokeless \ntobacco in ever growing numbers.\n  My bill proposes to remove this price incentive for kids and adults \nto use smokeless tobacco. It does this by setting the Federal excise \ntax on tins of snuff and pouches of chew at the exact same dollar \namount as on a pack of cigarettes. This means that the Federal taxes on \nthese smokeless products will increase from their current level of less \nthan 3 cents per container to $1.24 per container. In the previous \nversion of my bill, I would have increased the tax on smokeless \nproducts by a factor of 5. While this is a significant increase, it is \nnot enough to eliminate the incentive for cigarette smokers to switch \nrather than quit, or to discourage kids from ever starting the tobacco \nhabit.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken earlier this session about the many \nbenefits which would be achieved by increasing the Federal tobacco tax. \nIt will save billions of dollars in health care costs, not only for the \nFederal Government but for private insurers and citizens across the \ncountry. It will save countless lives. It will decrease unnecessary \nsuffering. And it will discourage millions of children and teenagers \nfrom ever becoming addicted to tobacco.\n  These changes to my earlier bill will make these benefits even more \npronounced. Smokeless tobacco must no longer be seen as a safe and \ncheap alternative to cigarettes. Raising the excise tax will discourage \nchildren and teenagers from ever starting to use smokeless tobacco, and \nit will discourage adults from considering smokeless as a safe \nalternative to quitting tobacco use entirely.\n  Mr. President, my tobacco tax bill, and the changes I am adding to \nit, are good health policy. They are good economic policy. And they are \nkey to helping our children and teenagers achieve a tobacco-free \nfuture.

A bill to improve the rural electrification programs under \nthe Rural Electrification Act of 1936, to improve Federal rural \ndevelopment programs administered by the Department of Agriculture, to \nprovide for exclusive State jurisdiction over retail electric service \nareas, to prohibit certain practices in the restraint of trade, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                       rural electric legislation\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill improve the Nation's Rural Electric Program by putting some common \nsense back into the way we use taxpayers' money to fund rural electric \nand rural development loans. The Rural Electrification and Rural \nEconomic Development Improvement Act of 1995 would amend a law that \nclearly has not evolved in step with the industry.\n  The fact is, the growth of our Nation's population has greatly \nchanged--and continues to change--the nature of electric service areas. \nPeople are moving into previously underpopulated areas and our current \nstatutes do not address that growth. There was once a widespread need \nfor Government incentives in order to provide ``affordable'' electric \nservice to consumers in many areas, but that need too, has changed.\n  Many areas of our country which are no longer rural are still being \nserved by Government-subsidized utilities, even though commercial \nutilities are willing to provide the service. The result is a current \npolicy which puts the U.S. Government right into the fray. We end up \nwith a policy that subsidizes one competitor over another and we charge \nthe bill to the taxpayers. That terrible market distortion is the \nproduct of an outdated rural electric policy that must be changed.\n  Since I arrived in the Senate in 1978, I have watched the current REA \nsystem transfer billions of dollars in interest subsidies from \ntaxpayers to rural electric borrowers. Today, many of those borrowers \nare perfectly capable of competing in the open-market without \nGovernment subsidies.\n  Certainly not all of the borrowers can compete. There are, indeed, \nmany troubled cooperatives that need assistance. That is why the \nobjective of this bill is to pare down the bloated system so that we \ncan continue to fund hardship loans. Nobody wants to pass legislation \nthat will push electric rates through the roof. I certainly do not, and \nthat will not happen with this bill.\n  My aim is to get the healthy borrowers ``off the dole'' so we can \nfocus scarce funds on the hardship cases. That should be very clear \nfrom the beginning. I do not propose eliminating the Rural Utilities \nService [RUS] or the subsidized loan program. But we should target \nassistance to the co-ops that really are incapable of providing \naffordable electric service in an open market. And we should offer \nhealthy borrowers a nonpunitive road to the free market. Indeed, that \nis something many of them need.\n  There are a great number of co-ops out there--both distributors and \npower suppliers--that are locked in to high cost Government loans. On \ntop of that, many of those distributors are stuck with expensive power \nsupply contracts. The co-ops cannot shop around because they are loaded \ndown with Government-financed debt they cannot afford to privatize. So \nthey must continue on--unable to openly compete--forced to purchase \nmore expensive power and to offset it with Government interest \nsubsidies, while their neighbors, the profit-driven corporations, \nbecome more efficient and more competitive.\n  I trust my colleagues will agree that we should make every effort to \nget the ``biggest bang for our buck.'' That has been one of the catch \nphrases of this Congress. And it applies to every Government program, \nnot just the Rural Utilities Service. This week, members of the Budget \nCommittee are confronting the difficult choices essential to balancing \nthe budget by 2002. This means they must identify over $30 billion in \ncuts each year, for 7 years, more than 10 times the painful cuts we \njust passed in the\n rescissions bill. Everyone had best be prepared to take their lumps as \nwe debate reductions in agricultural research, the arts, education, \ntransportation and a host of other important areas--this electric \nprogram should not be exempted.\n\n  The overall size of the program is staggering. Current outstanding \nloans exceed $20 billion for distribution cooperatives--they call them \n``discos''--they danced through $20 billion and over $40 billion for \npower supply co-ops--the generation and transmission facilities, or \nG's. This is a behemoth of a Government business. The legislation I \nam introducing would save taxpayers millions of dollars on interest \nsubsidies alone without repealing the program.\n  As I say often; borrowers that really need loans should like this \nbill. Under current law, some of them must wait years to get loans \nbecause available funds are allocated on a ``first-come, first-served'' \nbasis and there is not enough to go around. According to the latest \nrural electric survey there is a $405 million loan backlog this year. \nThat will increase to more than $500 million next year and we still do \nnot allow the RUS to prioritize the money, if you are in the back of \nthe line, you just have to wait.\n  And please hear this. The system is clogged because any entity that \nhas ever received an REA-approved loan remains eligible for rural \nelectric loans--forever. Hear that. It is a deal. It is ``once a \nborrower always a borrower'' and there is no end in sight. Even if a \nco-op is fully able to obtain market-rate credit elsewhere, it can keep \ncoming right back to suckle at the teat of the Federal treasury's low-\ninterest loan program again and again, even sometimes when they have \nnot paid up on the previous one. That is not appropriate and it is not \nfair and it is not just. My bill would subject RUS borrowers to the \nvery same ``credit elsewhere'' test that all other agricultural \nborrowers must face.\n  For example, under current law, the Farmer's Home Administration can \nonly give a loan to a farmer who is unable to obtain ``reasonable \ncredit elsewhere.'' Farmer's Home is ``the lender of last resort.'' But \nRUS is instead a ``lender of first resort.'' If Congress is serious \nabout privatizing unnecessary Government lending, then we must put a \nrealistic means-test on RUS loans.\n  Some of the co-ops will tell you they already have a means-test, but \nlet me tell you what that is. In 1992, we limited cheap Government \nfinancing for the really wealthy co-ops to 70 percent of their total \ndebt-load. That is not a means-test. There is a big difference between \n70 percent and a ``credit elsewhere'' test.\n  I believe we should retain the current three-tiered financing system \nthat includes hardship loans, direct loans and guaranteed loans. I \nbelieve that applicants should only receive such assistance when they \ncannot get ``credit elsewhere.'' Then, they can come to the Government \neither for low-interest hardship loans, ``at-cost'' direct loans or a \nGovernment guarantee of up to 90 percent.\n  Under my legislation, the RUS would review the borrower's books every \n2 [[Page S6692]] years. If a borrower's circumstances have improved \nthey would then be allowed to prepay their Government loans, without \npenalty, in order to move into the commercial credit market.\n  The budget savings in the legislation would come from a reduction in \ninterest subsidies and administrative costs. In fiscal year 1995, the 5 \npercent hardship loan subsidy cost the taxpayers $10 million, but \n``municipal rate'' direct loans cost over $46 million. On top of that, \nwe spent $30 million on administration. Those interest subsidies \nprovided $74 million in hardship loans and $536 million in direct loans \nfrom the revolving fund.\n  My proposal would save over $60 million by using the treasury \ninterest rate for non-hardship direct loans. With direct loans at \ntreasury rate interest, we would save over $60 million next year. Some \nof that money would go to increasing the appropriation for hardship \nloans to $25 million, which should more than double the availability of \ntruly necessary loans.\n  The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association--the NRECA--will \nsurely mobilize to fight this bill. Oh, you bet they will. Its \nrepresentatives will come to the hill saying that this legislation is \ngoing to destroy their industry, it will be a tragic portrait right \nstraight out of ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' But I say that this bill will \nnot cause rural America to wither up and die. Those images are an \nabsolute fiction.\n  The reality is that the REA has accomplished its mission in many \nareas of our country. Proof of that lies in the simple fact that \ncompetition exists for electric service in many co-op territories. I \nwould ask again, why should the Government continue to subsidize \nelectric loans when private industry is ready and willing to provide \nreasonable service?\n  The NRECA will also say that their competitors are trying to gobble \nup their choice customers. I have heard that one. To that, I would \nsuggest that healthy co-ops should take advantage of this bill and\n privatize their debt. Investors are out there who want to put money \ninto the co-ops because many of them have rapidly growing residential \nservice areas that are a great investment. Those co-ops should be going \nhead-to-head with their competitors on an even playing field.\n\n  On the issue of annexation and territorial predation, I believe the \nleading role should be played by the State public service commissions. \nWhen there are difficult--perhaps even ancestral--disputes over \nterritorial rights, State regulatory commissions are far better suited \nto make appropriate determinations than is the Federal Government. \nLocal decisions should be made at the local level.\n  The NRECA will also point a finger at tax incentives that are enjoyed \nby their profit-driven competitors. They will call that an unfair \nadvantage. But these electric co-ops do not pay any Federal income \ntaxes. They claim they do, indirectly, and that is true. When a \ncooperative distributes dividends to its members, the members must pay \ntax on that income. But any ``Joe Citizen'' who owns stock in a power \ncompany must also pay income tax on the dividends.\n  The argument that investor-owned utilities have an unfair tax \nadvantage is senseless. If the co-ops really want the same tax \nincentives, then we would have to start taxing them. I do not think \nthey want that.\n  Another very important part of the bill would improve the delivery of \nrural development funds, specifically low-interest ``water and waste \ndisposal'' loans. We want to ensure that priority here is being given \nto nonprofit organizations whose projects are included in a local, \nregional, or statewide development plan. This would assist in the \ncoordination of rural development efforts and it is consistent with the \ndesire to eliminate duplicative spending.\n  Another item that needs correction is a provision that--since 1987--\nhas allowed electric borrowers to invest up to 15 percent of their \ntotal plant value in rural development projects without RUS approval--\nand without regard to their Federal debt status.\n  The problem with this is that a co-op which is receiving interest \nsubsidies on its Federal debt could actually invest any excess \ncapital--up to 15 percent of its plant value--in ``rural development \nprojects.'' In theory, the taxpayers subsidize the RUS loans so that \nborrowers can plug low-interest funds into rural development. But a \n1992 USDA inspector general's report uncovered a different picture. Of \nthe more than $8 billion that had been invested by electric borrowers, \nless than 1 percent actually went to rural development investments.\n  The inspector general found a disturbing trend in which borrowers \ntook their Government interest subsidies right to ``market-rate Wall \nStreet'' and invested hundreds of millions of dollars not in rural \ndevelopment, but in mutual funds. My bill would reduce that limitation \nto 3 percent. I believe excess capital should be used to pay off \ntaxpayer-subsidized debt before it is used to enrich the cooperatives.\n  Mr. President, I come from a State that has been magnificently served \nby the REA over the years. One of the first national directors of REA \nwas one J.C. ``Kid'' Nichols, a Wyoming businessman who was a dear and \nlifelong friend of mine. He was there when the agency first embarked \nupon its mission in this country, a mission to bring electricity and \nlights to rural America. It was a stunning thing to see.\n  But if we are to better the lot of rural Americans--and we all know \nthat rural America can use some real help--we need to be honest about \nhow far we have come to where we are and how we can change where we are \ngoing. And change we must--with responsibility and with courage. The \ntask we face is great because we have to deal with a massive national \ndebt, an ever-dwindling Federal trough, and the wants of voracious \nvoters.\n  The rural electric program is a microcosm of everything that is \nright--and wrong--with our country. On the one hand, the REA wired our \nhomes for sound and light. It surely did that for the folks near my \nhometown of Cody, WY. And it changed the lives of rural people forever. \nOn the other hand, we have allowed the program to grow so big and so \nfar-reaching that we have lost sight of why it was created in the first \nplace: it was to give rural Americans what the rest of the country \nhad--electric power. Mr. President, that mission has been accomplished \nand the country has changed. Why does this program plod along--year \nafter year--untouched by all sensibility and reason?\n  I have often said you show me where we need power lines in rural \nAmerica today, and I will be right here to appropriate and assist in \ngetting the money to do that in every way, discussing density, \ndiscussing all the geographical aspects, all the rest. But I have been \nwatching this issue like a hawk for a lot of years.\n  I am pleased to offer this bill. I believe that it will save the \nintegrity of the program. I will say it again. Congress must take its \ndeficit cutting task seriously, and this legislation would be an \nimportant part of that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Electrification and \n     Rural Economic Development Improvement Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Rural Electrification Administration was created to \n     facilitate the electrification of rural America by providing \n     low-interest loans to electric cooperative associations and \n     other entities for the purpose of constructing and improving \n     rural electric systems;\n       (2) more than 99 percent of the residents in rural areas of \n     the United States now have affordable and reliable electric \n     service;\n       (3) a large volume of loans, at subsidized interest rates, \n     continue to be made under the Rural Electrification Act of \n     1936 to electric cooperative borrowers who could obtain \n     financing at reasonable rates and terms from a source other \n     than the Federal Government and these borrowers have become \n     significant and successful participants in an increasingly \n     competitive electric utility industry;\n       (4) the Federal Government should make electric loans only \n     to entities that cannot otherwise obtain funding at \n     reasonable rates and terms;\n       (5) the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 authorizes low-\n     interest and zero-interest loans and grants to be made to \n     borrowers under the Act for the purpose of rural economic \n     development; [[Page S6693]] \n       (6) these rural economic development programs do not \n     provide benefits to most rural Americans since the majority \n     of these residents receive electric utility service from \n     entities that do not receive financing under the Rural \n     Electrification Act of 1963;\n       (7) borrowers under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 \n     are directly eligible for some rural development programs \n     under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of \n     1972;\n       (8) the limited funds made available each year for all \n     rural economic development programs should not favor these \n     individuals who reside in rural areas that are served by \n     borrowers under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936; and\n       (9) borrowers under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 \n     should not have a competitive advantage in serving customers \n     in rural areas of the United States.\n\n    TITLE I--IMPROVEMENTS TO THE RURAL ELECTRIFICATION LOAN PROGRAMS\n\n     SEC. 101. REFERENCES TO THE RURAL ELECTRIFICATION ACT OF \n                   1936.\n\n       As used in this title, the term ``the Act'' shall mean \n     ``the Rural Electrification Act of 1936'' (7 U.S.C. 901 et \n     seq.).\n\n     SEC. 102.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an \ninterview that appeared in the New York Times, on Sunday, May 14, 1995, \nentitled, ``Iran Says It Plans 10 Nuclear Plants But No Atom Arms.''\n  I must say that the interview is quite candid in as much as we have \nthe Director of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Reza Amrollahi, \nstating that his nation intends to build as many as 10 nuclear reactors \nthroughout the country. What we have is an Iranian official publicly \nstating the number of reactors Iran wants to build, as well as \nconfirming that Iran is buying two more Chinese reactors, in addition \nto the Russian reactors they intend to purchase. This is remarkable and \nscary.\n  Mr. President, this interview only confirms what I have been saying \nall along. The terrorist regime in Iran is bent on aggression and will \nnot stop. It is bad enough that they are abusing the human rights of \nthe Iranian people and hijacking their rich history, but they are \nsacrificing the Iranian people's welfare in return for a headlong drive \nfor nuclear armament. This is all very unfortunate for the abused \nIranian people and dangerous for the world. I hope that Iranians \nremember what their corrupt government did to them.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the above-mentioned article be \nprinted in the Record.\n                [From the New York Times, May 14, 1995]\n\n         Iran Says it Plans 10 Nuclear Plants But No Atom Arms\n\n                          (By Elaine Sciolino)\n\n       Teheran, Iran, May 13--Iran's top nuclear official said \n     today that his country intended to build about 10 nuclear \n     power plants in the next two decades, but denied charges by \n     the United States that Iran is trying to develop nuclear \n     weapons.\n       The official, Reza Amrollahi, also said that last year he \n     signed a formal contract with China for two nuclear power \n     reactors and that Chinese experts had completed a feasibility \n     study and had begun to draw up blueprints and engineering \n     reports for a site in southern Iran.\n       Iran has already made a ``down payment'' for the project, \n     which will cost $800 million to $900 million and involve \n     training by Chinese experts, said Mr. Amrollahi, director of \n     Iran's Atomic Energy Organization.\n       Although the United States has doubted that China is \n     capable of building the reactors on its own because the \n     original model included parts from Germany and Japan, Mr. \n     Amrollahi said the Chinese now believed that they had \n     successfully duplicated the technology.\n       The United States has led a global campaign to prevent Iran \n     from receiving any nuclear technology because of its \n     suspected weapons program. Mr. Amrollahi's statements suggest \n     that the agreement with China is much further along than was \n     previously known, and that Iran is planning a vast long-range \n     nuclear energy program. They seem certain to strengthen the \n     conviction both within the Clinton Administration and \n     Congress that Iran is determined to become a nuclear power.\n       In addition to its oil reserves Iran has the second largest \n     natural gas reserves in the world, and natural gas is much \n     cheaper to develop than nuclear energy. That makes American \n     officials suspicious that Iran wants nuclear power as part of \n     a weapons program.\n       In a clear attempt to answer charges that Iran is \n     developing nuclear weapons, Mr. Amrollahi made his remarks in \n     a two-and-a-half-hour interview at his agency's new six-story \n     building. It is part of a sprawling complex in central \n     Teheran that includes a small nuclear research reactor built \n     for Iran by the United States in the late 1960's, when the \n     monarchy was in power and the relationship with Washington \n     was close. Officials offered a brief tour of the complex, \n     including a visit to two radio isotope laboratories for \n     medical research, although they did not allow a tour of the \n     reactor.\n       ``In case we get enough money, in case we have enough \n     trained people, we have a plan to take 20 years to get 20 \n     percent of our energy from nuclear,'' Mr. Amrollahi said. \n     Asked whether that could mean about 10 reactors, he said, \n     ``Something like that.''\n       If Russia completes two reactor projects in Iran, and China \n     builds two, it would mean that the Iranian Government intends \n     to build six more throughout the country.\n       At the summit meeting in Moscow this week, President \n     Clinton tried without success to persuade President Boris N. \n     Yeltsin to abandon an ambitious nuclear energy project with \n     Iran, arguing that its Islamic Government had embarked on a \n     crash nuclear weapons program and that even peaceful nuclear \n     cooperation was dangerous. Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher was similarly rebuffed when he made the same \n     point to China's Foreign Minister, Qian Quichen, in New York \n     last month.\n       Mr. Amrollahi reiterated that Iran had already invested $6 \n     billion in the project--which is subject to international \n     inspection and safeguards--and wanted to finish it. He said \n     the contract with Moscow consists of a $780 million deal in \n     which Russia will complete one of two reactors that a German \n     firm was building at the southern port city of Bushehr before \n     the project was halted after the 1979 revolution. If that \n     project goes well, Russia will finish the second reactor.\n       The United States opposes the project in part because it \n     will give Iran access to expertise, technology and training \n     it would not otherwise have.\n       Mr. Amrollahi said that 150 Russian nuclear experts were \n     already working at the site and that 500 would eventually be \n     based there; a much smaller number of Iranians will be \n     trained in Russia on how to operate the plant, he added. \n     ``Training people is part of that nuclear power plan,'' he \n     said. ``I don't know why they make such a hot fudge of it.''\n       Mr. Amrollahi denied reports that Iran had negotiated--or \n     even discussed--a plan to buy a gas centrifuge from Russia \n     that could have rapidly enriched uranium to bomb-grade \n     quality. ``This was a diplomatically made cake,'' he said of \n     reports from Washington about the existence of a separate, \n     albeit tentative agreement with Russia.\n       Russia has agreed to supply the enriched uranium needed to \n     operate the plant it will finish, he said. Asked whether Iran \n     was pursuing a program to enrich uranium, at first he said, \n     ``Not now,'' but added quickly: ``No. Not forever. Not. No. \n     Not at all.''\n       Asked why Iran simply doesn't use natural gas for fuel, Mr. \n     Amrollahi said, ``natural gas is one of the best fuels, and \n     many countries at the moment need it. So we think it is \n     better to sell it.'' Like many of Iran's nuclear specialists, \n     Mr. Amrollahi has been educated and trained in the West. He \n     holds a master's degree in electrical engineering from the \n     [[Page S6698]] University of Texas and a doctorate in physics \n     from the University of Paris.\n       He briefly worked for the Belgian Government in nuclear \n     safety in the 1970's. He has headed Iran's nuclear program \n     for 15 years, and spoke with precision when discussing Iran's \n     official nuclear reactor and research sites in Iran. But the \n     United States and Germany have amassed substantial evidence \n     that Iran is secretly buying components and technology from \n     abroad that they claim are not necessary for nuclear energy \n     development or research and can only be useful in a \n     determined weapons program.\n       American and German intelligence officials believe that Mr. \n     Amrollahi controls only part of Iran's nuclear program and \n     that Iran has created a parallel program through the military \n     that is largely responsible for purchases of nuclear related \n     items. According to this view, the Defense Ministry \n     Organization inside the Defense Ministry uses front \n     organizations like the Sharif University of Technology in \n     Teheran to help buy nuclear-related equipment.\n       On the basis of reports by Germany's foreign intelligence \n     agency in 1992 and 1993 that Sharif was involved in secret \n     nuclear activities, Germany began to reject all requests for \n     equipment by the university. Early last year, the German \n     agency said that the university's physics research center was \n     involved in buying technology that could be used in making \n     weapons, including nuclear-related materials.\n       Mr. Amrollahi strongly denied the claim that he was not \n     fully in charge. ``I am responsible for the atomic energy of \n     Iran,'' he said, ``Believe it, we don't have any other \n     institutions or departments that pay attention to nuclear \n     issues.''\n       Mr. Amrollahi also denied reports that Iran secretly has \n     been buying nuclear technology and equipment from abroad, \n     noting that the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is \n     responsible for monitoring nuclear programs around the world, \n     turned up nothing suspicious during a visit to Sharif \n     University.\n       But the nuclear chief was unfamiliar with intelligence \n     reports about Iran's nuclear-related overtures abroad and \n     asked for copies of news clippings describing the details.\n       Asked, for example, about a report that Iran tried \n     unsuccessfully to buy cylinders of fluorine for Sharif \n     University in 1991, Mr. Amrollahi said, ``Wrong. I deny it \n     totally.'' Asked about a report that Sharif University \n     approached the German firm Thyssen in 1991 for specialized \n     magnets he replied, ``No, we never did.''\n       Asked whether Sharif University tried to buy balancing \n     machines from another German firm in 1991, he replied, ``You \n     can go and ask Sharif University.''\n       Asked about a seizure by Italian authorities of high \n     technology ultrasonic equipment that could be used in nuclear \n     reactor testing in the Italian port of Bari last January, he \n     replied, ``Believe it, that's wrong, totally.''\n       Asked about an earlier seizure by Italian customs of eight \n     steam condensers destined for Iran in 1993, he said, ``I \n     don't know really. I don't know. It's totally wrong.''\n       Mr. Amrollahi also denied a recent charge by Mr. \n     Christopher, based on American intelligence reports, that \n     Iran tried to buy enriched uranium from Kazakhstan in 1992. \n     Other senior American officials in Washington said that Iran \n     sent a purchasing team to Kazakhstan three years ago, but \n     that it came home empty-handed.\n       The visit contributed to a decision by the Pentagon last \n     year to secretly airlift 500 kilograms of bomb-grade uranium \n     from Kazakhstan's nuclear fabrication plant for safe storage \n     in the United States.\n       ``We didn't send any team,'' Mr. Amrollahi said. \n     ``Definitely not. What is the use of enriched uranium for? \n     The Russians do have many, many nuclear weapons but they \n     couldn't use them. I think the bomb age is over. We don't \n     think we need a nuclear weapon.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6697-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DON COLLINS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I note \nthe death of Donald L. Collins after a brief but fierce battle with \ncancer. At the time of his death last February, Mr. Collins was Deputy \nFederal Insurance Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency [FEMA] in Washington, DC. That position of leadership capped a \nremarkable career in Federal service of more than 20 years. It is a \ngenuine honor to commend to my colleagues in the Senate the life and \nservice of Don Collins.\n  Don had many remarkable achievements in his Federal career that I \nwould like to touch on briefly. But perhaps, for anyone who ever met \nhim, Don Collins' most memorable qualities were his deep, unabashed \nlove for his Catholic faith, his genuine compassion for others, and his \nquick sense of humor that could disarm and charm any opponent. For Don, \nthere were never any strangers, never any enemies--even after the most \nheated debate. He was available to everyone, at any time. While Don \nalways assumed the lion's share of the work for every project, he still \nalways had time for everyone on his staff. There was never a closed \ndoor to his employees at the Federal Insurance Administration [FIA] or \nto the public he served. His love and caring were contagious. Don had, \nin the words of his brother, long arms--always ready to draw people to \nhimself, no matter how different their point of view.\n  Don loved and respected the law as well--which he demonstrated by \nalways molding policy interpretations for the National Flood Insurance \nProgram [NFIP] to comply with the intentions of Congress for that \nprogram. His regard and respect for law were developed early as he \nworked his way through undergraduate school at Fordham University in \nNew York City and law school at night. He completed his juris doctor at \nSaint John's University, also in New York. He was admitted to practice \nin the following courts: the courts of the State of New York, District \nof Columbia Court of Appeals; U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Second \nCircuit; U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of New York; U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York; and U.S. Court of \nMilitary Appeals (DC).\n  Marking another dimension of this charming, approachable, funny man \nwere the awards he received to commemorate a textbook Federal career. \nIn 1991, Don Collins received the Presidential Rank Award-Meritorious \nExecutive, Senior Executive Service. That award recognized in part his \nlasting contributions and service to the Federal Insurance \nAdministration, especially for his efforts to shape and implement the \nNFIP program. In that connection, Mr. Collins played a major role in \nframing the public policy debate about how to reduce the public's \nlosses from floods, which resulted in the enactment of the Flood \nDisaster Protection Act of 1973. That legislation redirected the Nation \ntoward a more prudent course in flood loss reduction. From 1990 to \n1994, he worked closely with the White House and congressional leaders \nto shape the NFIP Reform Act of 1994 which strengthens the NFIP and \nprovides lenders with the tools needed to comply with legal \nrequirements for flood insurance.\n  Over the years, Don Collins also helped foster a close working \nrelationship with the insurance industry. His integrity and disarming \npersonality were largely responsible for the good will enjoyed by the \nprogram with its industry partners. He developed and administered the \nentire claims and underwriting systems in support of the NFIP and \ndeveloped all NFIP policy forms and the agents' manuals. Similarly, he \ndeveloped all flood insurance regulations and was central to the \ndevelopment of all significant policies governing the NFIP.\n  In sum, Don Collins was a model Federal executive. More than that, \nDon Collins was an exemplary person. He was a man of deep faith, a \nloving husband and father, a person dedicated to his community, and a \nmanager who set the standard for excellence at the Federal Insurance \nAdministration and the National Flood Insurance Program. When my staff \nand I worked with Don on NFIP legislation over the course of 2 years, \nhis knowledge, diligence, good humor, grace, and personal warmth were \nalways present, and prevented a series of difficult negotiations from \nbecoming unpleasant and onerous. None who worked with him will forget \nhim. Indeed, he will be appreciated and fondly remembered by \nall.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6698-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6698-S6699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 THE COLUMBIA GORGE INTERPRETIVE CENTER\n\n Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I am extremely concerned that in the \nrush to shrink the size of the Federal Government, Congress may \neliminate or severely limit the services provided by many important \nprograms. One such program, which gives low-income individuals a \nfighting chance, is the Legal Services Corporation [LSC]. Established \nby an act of Congress in 1974, the LSC provides grants to local \nagencies that in turn offer legal services to the poor. In its 20 plus \nyears in existence, the LSC has provided funding for legal services to \ntens of thousands of low-income Americans in areas ranging from inner-\ncities to native American reservations.\n  The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois \nrecently issued a resolution supporting the continued funding of the \nLSC. This resolution is significant because it comes from those who \nadminister justice in our courts, and who have first-hand knowledge of \nthe benefits of legal services. The resolution asserts that the LSC is \nessential to providing equal opportunities for justice for all \nAmericans.\n  I applaud the action taken by the justices in the Northern District \nof Illinois, and ask that the text of the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       This court, the United States District Court for the \n     Northern District of Illinois, understands that there are \n     proposals before Congress to restrict or eliminate funding \n     for the Legal Services Corporation and to transfer to the \n     states the responsibility for providing legal assistance to \n     low-income persons and families. In Illinois, at least, the \n     likelihood that such assistance would be provided by the \n     state, given its present and prospective fiscal difficulties, \n     is remote, and the restriction or elimination of federal \n     funding would, in all probability, lead to a corresponding \n     restriction or to the elimination of legal assistance. We \n     believe such a decision would have a major adverse impact \n     upon the administration of equal justice.\n       This court is aware that many low-income persons and \n     families in Illinois have no means to obtain redress except \n     through the five federally-supported legal services programs \n     in this state. The Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago \n     alone represented over 38,000 low-income persons and families \n     in 1994, primarily by counseling or by working the matter out \n     with other parties without resort to governmental agencies or \n     to the courts. These matters included resolution of landlord-\n     tenant disputes, the provision of public benefits, providing \n     representation in marriage dissolution matters including \n     assisting in obtaining adequate child support, obtaining \n     orders of protection for victims of domestic violence, \n     enforcing consumer protection laws, assisting in employment \n     and housing discrimination matters, assisting working low-\n     income people in obtaining unemployment insurance benefits, \n     and assisting migrant workers, the disabled and crime \n     victims. In many instances LAFC enlists the aid of private \n     attorneys, who provide services at minimal compensation. Many \n     of these matters involve enforcement of federal law, either \n     constitutional rights or, more commonly, statutes duly \n     enacted by Congress. Their enforcement requires adequate \n     representation, and that representation will not be available \n     without federally supported legal assistance.\n       Also of particular concern to this court is the Federal \n     Court Prison Litigation Project, through which LAFC provides \n     necessary training and support. Private counsel, through the \n     district's trial bar, accept appointment as counsel in \n     prisoner cases without expectation of compensation. Having \n     counsel is of great benefit not only to the plaintiffs but \n     also to the defendants and the court, as that representation \n     is helpful in separating meritorious claims from non-\n     meritorious claims at an earlier stage and in facilitating \n     orderly progression of the litigation. LAFC provides \n     training, consultation, research assistance and a data and \n     materials bank. We believe that few private counsel would be \n     willing to participate in that program if those services were \n     not available.\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the United States \n     District Court for the Northern District of Illinois supports \n     the continuation of the federally funded legal services \n     program as essential to the administration of equal \n     justice.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6699-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         HONORING MORTON GOULD\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to express my sincere \ncongratulations today to a great artist and a great man, Morton Gould. \nConsidering Mr. Gould's numerous lifetime achievements in music, he is \nwell deserving of the high honor that has been presented to him, the \n1994 Pulitzer Prize for music composition.\n  Born in Richmond Hill, NY, on December 10, 1913, Mr. Gould's music \ncareer began at age 6 with his first published piece, a waltz, \nappropriately titled ``Just Six.'' At age 8, Mr. Gould entered the \nInstitute of Musical Arts in New York City on scholarship and continued \nstudying and playing music until his teens. After having to leave \nschool for financial reasons and working for a while as a pianist for \nvaudeville acts, he landed a job as a pianist for the Radio City Music \nHall. By the time he was 21, Mr. Gould was introducing his work through \nconducting and arranging a weekly series of orchestra radio programs \nfor the Mutual Radio Network.\n  Mr. Gould's unique blend of music, resonating of jazz, folk, hymns, \nspirituals, gospel, and Latin-American, reflects the lyrical cross-\nsection of America that makes his work so well loved. Some of his more \npopular works include: ``Latin-American Symphonette''; \n``Spirituals for Orchestra''; ``Tap Dance Concerto''; ``Jekyll and Hyde \nVariations''; ``American Salute and Derivations for Clarinet and Band'' \nwritten for the late Benny Goodman. ``Pavanne,'' from Gould's ``Second \nSymphonette'' has become one of the most widely performed instrumental \nstandards.\n  During his distinguished career he has composed works for Broadway \nmusicals, dance, ballet, film, and television. His work has been \ncommissioned by symphony orchestras, the Library of Congress, the \nChamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the New York City Ballet, and \nthe American Ballet Theatre. His compositions have been performed \naround the world by many great conductors of today as well as those of \nthe past, including the great talents of Arturo Toscanini, Leopold \nStokowski, Artur Rodzinski, Dimitri Mitopoulos, and Fritz Reiner.\n  While Mr. Gould's work has spanned the greater part of this century, \nhe has always managed to remain contemporary. Beginning with LP's, his \nmultitude of works have made their way into each new recording medium, \nincluding the new digital recording technology which he was one of the \nfirst to use as early as 1978.\n  As an artist himself, Mr. Gould has long fought to protect the rights \nof all musical creators. Since 1935, he has been a member of the \nAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the oldest \nperforming rights organizations in the world. He has also served on the \norganization's board of directors since 1959 and from 1986-94, he was \nits president.\n  His many awards include a Grammy and a number of Grammy nominations; \nthe 1983 Gold Baton Award, presented by the American Symphony Orchestra \nLeague; the 1985 Medal of Honor for Music from the National Arts Club; \n1986 election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters; and the \nNational Music Council's Golden Eagle Award. And in December 1994, Mr. \nGould was presented with a lifetime achievement award by the Kennedy \nCenter.\n  Last March 10, 11, and 12, Mstislav Rostropovich conducted the \nNational Symphony Orchestra of Washington, DC, in the world premier of \nMr. Gould's ``Stringmusic,'' for which he received the Pulitzer Prize. \nThis extraordinary piece was commissioned by the Hechinger Foundation \nin honor of Mr. Rostropovich's last season as musical director of the \nNational Symphony Orchestra and to honor Mr. Gould's 80th birthday.\n  As a fellow New Yorker and fellow American, I salute Mr. Gould's \naccomplishments and contributions through his music which have given so \nmuch to us all and forever enriched our lives.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6699-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\n   COMMEMORATING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PADOVANO COLLECTION AT THE \n                        UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \nlifetime achievements of my constituent, Dr. Anthony T. Padovano, who \nhas bequeathed his personal papers to the archives of the Theodore \nHesburgh Memorial Library at the University of Notre Dame.\n  A leader in the post-Vatican-II Catholic reform movement and chairman \nof the literature program at Ramapo College of New Jersey, Dr. Padovano \nhas dedicated over 30 years to the study and advancement of the \nCatholic Church. Ordained a Catholic priest in 1959, Dr. Padovano was \nclosely associated with the Vatican II Ecumenical Council which met \nfrom 1962 to 1965. During this time, he emerged as an advocate for the \nordination of married men and women, more democratic and participatory \nchurch discussion, significant church involvement in issues of social \njustice, and greater interreligious harmony.\n  Throughout the 1960's and early 1970's, Dr. Padovano authored key \nletters for the National Council of Catholic Bishops and taught \nsystematic theology at Gregorian University's Seminary until he married \nin 1974. Unable to remain at the seminary, but still able to follow his \nreligious calling, Dr. Padovano became involved in the founding of \nRamapo College and its mission of interdisciplinary learning as a \nprofessor of American literature and religious studies.\n  A professor, award-winning author, and reform leader, Dr. Padovano \ncontinues his study of morality and ethics in our society. As founder \nand president of CORPUS, National Association for a Married Priesthood, \nand vice president of the International Federation of Married Catholic \nPriests, Dr. Padovano continues to address the most controversial \nissues confronting the Catholic Church.\n  The Padavano collection carries with it 30 years of scholarship, \nauthorship, and independent thought which will guide students of \ntheology, the Catholic Church and its reform movement in their quest \nfor greater understanding. I am honored to pay tribute, on behalf of \nNew Jersey and the Nation, to Dr. Padovano, his scholarship and his \ngenerous gift to the University of Notre Dame.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6700-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    HONORING DR. JAN MOOR-JANKOWSKI\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, at this time I would like to pay \ntribute to an outstanding professor at New York University by the name \nof Jan Moor-Jankowski. Dr. Moor-Jankowski, a world renowned research \nphysician and trailblazer on scientific first amendment rights, has \nbeen unanimously elected to the late Dr. Linus Pauling's chair at the \nFrench National Academy of Medicine, Division of Biologic Sciences.\n  The origins of the French Academy of Medicine extend to the Royal \nAcademies of the 18th century. The Academy provides a forum for medical \ndebates and advises the French Government on health-related matters. \nLouis Pasteur was one of its notable members. A limited number of \ndistinguished non-French scientists are elected to provide \nrepresentation of the world-wide scientific community. An election is \nfor lifetime and only occurs when a chair is vacated.\n  Election to the Academy is one of France's highest and rarest honors, \nreserved for the most respected scientist in the world. At the time of \nhis election, Nobel Prize winner Dr. Pauling was virtually a household \nname thanks to his groundbreaking theories on the effects of vitamins \non cancer and other diseases. Like Dr. Pauling, Dr. Moor-Jankowski was \nchosen from a list of highly regarded candidates as the sole U.S. \ncitizen to be honored with membership on the biological sciences board \nof the Academy.\n  For example, this latest award is only the last in a string of \nscientific honors bestowed on Dr. Moor-Jankowski. In 1994, he was given \nthe William J. Brennan, Jr. Defense of Freedom Award by the Libel \nDefense Resource Center. In addition, in 1984, Dr. Moor-Jankowski was \nmade a Knight of the French Order ``Ordre National de Merite'' for \nWorld War II resistance and scientific achievements. Other medals and \nawards from Israel, the U.S.S.R., Italy, and Switzerland have \npunctuated his career.\n  Dr. Moor-Jankowski is an alumnus of the Swiss universities of \nFribourg and Berne. He began his career at the University of Geneva \nwhere his research interests in the study of polymorphic phenotypic \nexpressions of the genetic substrate of man led to his discovery of \nclinically silent hemophilia B, and of the significant genetic drift of \nblood group frequencies in the inhabitants of the highest Alpine \nvillages. During subsequent research at Cambridge University, Dr. Moor-\nJankowski discovered the polymorphism of allotypes of serum proteins in \nmice and monkeys.\n  For the past 30 years, Dr. Moor-Jankowski's laboratory, LEMSIP, has \nbeen participating in international collaborative studies leading to \nthe development of the first tests for and vaccines against various \nforms of infectious hepatitis, and since 1987, in collaboration with \nInstitute Pasteur, Paris, in the development of the first vaccines \nagainst AIDS.\n  He also serves as Director of the World Health Organization \nCollaborating Center for Hematology of Primate Animals, and is editor-\nin-chief of the Journal of Medical Primatology.\n  Again I would like to take this time to honor an outstanding New York \nresident who has devoted his life to enhancing the quality of life in \nthis country and toward solving world health problems. We wish him \ncontinued success in all future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6700-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETE BARBUTTI\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Pete \nBarbutti, whose talent, warmth, and generosity is deeply admired and \nappreciated throughout Las Vegas. I rise to pay tribute to Pete, a \nclassic entertainer who helped make Las Vegas the entertainment capital \nof the world.\n  Born in Scranton, PA, Pete Barbutti began his entertainment career at \nthe young age of 11. At once, his musical genius on the accordion and \npercussion was apparent. By high school, it was no wonder he was voted \n``Most Popular Boy'' and ``Class Clown'' for Pete was truly liked by \nall.\n  After serving as assistant conductor in the Army Reserves, Pete \nbrought his musician-comic flair to Las Vegas, where he formed his own \ngroup, a music-vocal-comedy quartet called the Millionaires. The group \nquickly became the favorite of many Las Vegas strip celebrities.\n  Pete has worked with the best in entertainment including Steve Allen, \nNat King Cole, Henry Mancini, and Frank Sinatra. Today, he maintains \nhigh visibility by working clubs, conventions, and fairs throughout the \nUnited States and Canada, and is famous for his hundreds of appearances \non television talk shows. He has received countless awards including \nLas Vegas Entertainer of the Year and the Artistic Achievement Award \nfrom the American Federation of Musicians.\n  Aside from his performing brilliance, Pete should be recognized for \nhis philanthropic contributions. He played a key role in the success of \nthe Take a Senior to Lunch program and has donated numerous hours \nhelping seniors of the Las Vegas community.\n  I extend my deepest appreciation to Pete Barbutti for graciously \nsharing his talent at the 1995 Senior Fair, and for the many smiles he \nhas brought to Nevadans.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6700-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want to join today with President Clinton \nand with all of America in honoring the 157 law enforcement officers \nwho were killed last year in the line of duty. These brave men and \nwomen paid the ultimate sacrifice so that all Americans may continue to \nlive in freedom and peace Today, and every day, our thoughts and \nprayers are with the victims and their families.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton could not resist the temptation to \nscore some political points when he chose today's memorial ceremony to \ncriticize congressional efforts to enact meaningful antiterrorism \nlegislation. In his remarks, the President claimed he sees ``disturbing \nsigns of the old politics of diversion and delay.'' And just yesterday, \nthe White House Chief of Staff made the untenable statement that \nantiterrorism legislation is not moving in Congress ``because there is \nthis diversion going on to try to create attention on the Waco \nincident.'' Mr. Panetta even went so far as to describe as \n``despicable'' the idea that congressional oversight should be brought \nto bear on the Waco tragedy.\n  I know there has been a lot of talk recently about paranoia. But, \njudging by these remarks, it appears that the paranoia bug has infected \nthe White House. Contrary to what President Clinton may believe, there \nis no hidden conspiracy on the Hill to divert or delay consideration of \nantiterrorism legislation. And Mr. Panetta may be disappointed to learn \nthat\n we have not concocted a secret plot to focus attention on Waco as a \nmeans of diverting attention from the administration's own \nantiterrorism plan.\n\n  Just look at the record: We have had 3 days of hearings, including \nhearings on the administration's controversial proposal to amend the \nPosse Comitatus Act. We have introduced comprehensive legislation that \nincorporates many of the administration's own antiterrorism \nproposals. And we continue to press ahead. In fact, my staff has been \nmeeting regularly, even today, with White House and Justice Department \nofficials to review--and perhaps improve--all of the various \nantiterrorism proposals that are now on the table.\n  So, as we move ahead on an ambitious legislative agenda here in the \nSenate, including an historic plan to balance the Federal budget by the \nyear 2002, I hope the President and his Chief of Staff would show some \nrestraint and patience.\n  Yes, we will give the administration's proposal every consideration. \nYes, we will pass tough antiterrorism legislation. But our resolve to \nconfront the terrorist threat must also be tempered with wisdom and \nrestraint. What we do this year must withstand the test of time. After \nall, nothing less than our constitutional liberties are at stake.\n  One would think and hope that the President of the United States \nwould understand this simple, but immensely important, point.\n  Mr. President, we have indicated to the President we would try to \nhave a bill on his desk by the end of this month. That is still our \nhope. There have been a lot of delays, but we believe we can meet that \nchallenge.\n  But I must say, we want to be very careful and not do something based \non the emotion of the moment. We want to take a look at this \nlegislation a year from now, 2 years from now, 5 years from now, to \nmake certain we have not trampled on someone's constitutional rights, \nsome group or some individual, down the road.\n  I think it is very important that we move prudently and we will do \nthat, as we indicated and promised the American people.\n  I hoped the President would be working with us, instead of taking \nshots at us based on misinformation. I assume somebody gave him bad \ninformation; otherwise, I am certain he would not make a statement like \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/15/senate-section/article/S6701-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
