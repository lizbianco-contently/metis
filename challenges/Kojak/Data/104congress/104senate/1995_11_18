Mr. President, yesterday morning there was an article \nin the Washington Post. It dealt with some of the debate that is now \ntaking place about the budget and veterans. We can agree to disagree, \nbut there was one piece in this article that really captured my \nattention, as a Senator from Minnesota. This was:\n\n       The conferees sent what they called a ``strong message'' of \n     displeasure to Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, in the \n     form of sharp cuts in his office's staff and travel budget.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit about Jesse Brown, \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs. Jesse Brown is one of our Nation's most \nable and outspoken veterans advocates. He is a man who is a Marine \ncombat veteran, a Marine combat hero who served our country with honor \nand distinction. Mr. President, he is a disabled veteran who, long \nbefore he became Secretary of what he calls ``For Veterans Affairs,'' \nwas one of the most important voices and strongest voices for veterans, \nespecially disabled veterans in the United States of America.\n  I would like to make it very clear, as a Senator from Minnesota, that \nI do not believe these kinds of attacks, petty attacks on his personal \noffice travel budget, will silence Jesse Brown. My colleagues are sadly \nmistaken, they are profoundly mistaken, if they believe any form of \nretaliation will silence this Secretary, who is such a powerful \nadvocate for veterans, based upon his own personal life, based upon his \nservice for this country, and based upon his position.\n  Since taking office in 1993, let me just list a few of the impressive \naccomplishments of Secretary Jesse Brown, ``Secretary for Veterans.''\n  Agent orange--in 1993, a VA-sponsored review conducted by the \nNational Academy of Sciences found that certain cancers and illnesses \ncould be caused by agent orange exposure. The VA promptly responded by \npresuming service-connection for these diseases--long overdue.\n  Mr. President, homeless veterans convened the first National Summit \non Homelessness Among Veterans. It is a scandal that such a large \npercentage of our street people and homeless people are veterans. This \nSecretary, Jesse Brown, will not be silenced.\n  Persian Gulf veterans fought hard to make sure Persian Gulf veterans \nwere not forgotten, to compensate certain Persian Gulf veterans with \n\n[[Page S 17422]]\nundiagnosed illnesses. Mr. President, Secretary Jesse Brown will not be \nsilenced.\n  Streamline and make the VA more responsive, a plan to decentralize \nthe VA national health care system, which is now being implemented. Mr. \nPresident, Secretary Jesse Brown will not be silenced.\n  Women veterans: He implemented a series of health care initiatives \nfor women, established eight women veterans Comprehensive Health Care \nCenters. Mr. President, Secretary Jesse Brown will not be silenced.\n  There are many more accomplishments that I could list, but I want to \njust end with one personal story, which I think tells a very large \nstory about Secretary Jesse Brown.\n  Tim Gilmore fought for our country in the Vietnam war. He suffered \nfrom agent orange exposure, and he died of cancer. Toward the end of \nhis life, Tim Gilmore was tormented by one fact. He knew he would not \nhave long to live, but he had not received any compensation. By the \nrules that we operate under, if he did not receive any compensation \nbefore he passed away, there was a very real question whether his \nfamily would ever receive any compensation. He was tormented by this.\n  When Secretary Jesse Brown came to my State, this family made a \npersonal appeal to him, the veterans community made a personal appeal \nto him to somehow, please, cut through the bureaucracy and please have \nsome compassion and please be an advocate for Tim Gilmore and his \nfamily.\n  Mr. President, I made the same appeal. Time went by, Tim Gilmore \nbecame weaker, and it was very clear he was going to pass away soon. A \nvery short period of time before Tim Gilmore passed away, Secretary \nJesse Brown made sure that he received compensation, made sure that his \nfamily would receive that compensation.\n  That family has never forgotten that. To Tim Gilmore, a Vietnam vet \nwho died from agent orange exposure, that was one of the most important \nthings before he passed away. I will be indebted, as a Senator from \nMinnesota, to Secretary Jesse Brown forever, for his compassion and his \nstrength and commitment to people.\n  I will say to my colleagues, you can do whatever you want to his \ntravel budget or personal budget, but you are not going to silence him. \nHe is going to continue to talk about this budget and how it affects \nveterans.\n  I will mention one point I have been focused on, as a U.S. Senator, \nand I will be pleased to debate this with anyone. I think what we are \ndoing here in the health care field puts way too many veterans in very \nserious jeopardy for the following reason: Our veterans population is \nalso becoming an aging population. We all know that.\n  If you have reductions in Medicare--and we continue to go through \nthis debate about whether it is lessening the rate of increase or a \ncut. I do not even want to get into the semantics. I want to tell you, \nthere is only one way you look at it. Look at the year 2002; ask how \nmany people are going to be 65 years of age or over, how many of them \nare going to be 85 years of age or over; you ask what kind of services \nthey are going to require, and you ask whether or not you are investing \nthe resources to make sure they get them. We are not.\n  If you have those reductions in Medicare and reductions in medical \nassistance, you are going to have more of the elderly people coming to \nthe veterans health care system for health care. Then, if you have the \nreduction in the VA health care system as well, it becomes a triple \nwhammy.\n  Secretary Jesse Brown is going to continue to be a strong advocate \nfor veterans. I will say to my colleagues, he is going to continue to \nchallenge your budget and he is going to continue to say, ``Why don't \nyou ask the oil companies to sacrifice a little bit, or the coal \ncompanies, or the tobacco companies, or the pharmaceutical companies? \nAnd how come you give all this money to military contractors, above and \nbeyond what the Pentagon asked for? And how come you have all these \nrapid depreciation allowances and cuts in capital gains?''\n  I listened to my colleague from Mississippi speak with considerable \nintelligence the other day about this. He is a very able Senator. But \nthis Secretary of Veterans Affairs is going to continue to challenge \nthese priorities. He should.\n  We do not need any hate, I think all of us agree. But we will have \nthe debate. It will be an important debate for this country. I believe \nSecretary Jesse Brown will be a very powerful voice in that debate. I \ncome to the floor of the Senate to speak in his behalf today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17421-6", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17422-S17423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. First, I want to thank all my colleagues for what has been \nhappening over the past several months as far as putting together the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995 is concerned. It was a massive undertaking. \nPeople said we could never do it, never make the hard decisions, but we \ndid. We kept our word with the American people. And we have, I think, a \nproduct we can be proud of.\n  It may not be perfect--probably there are some things we can change, \ncorrect, modify--but it is a fundamental change in the direction this \ncountry has been headed for the past, at least, two or three decades. I \nknow the President has indicated he is going to veto it. And if he \ndoes--as I assume he will--I hope he also will say he is seriously \nconcerned about the problems we raise and try to correct them, that he \nwill sit down with us in serious negotiations and have some budget that \nwe can all hold up and all take credit for that will balance the budget \nin the 7 years, reform welfare as we know it, preserve and strengthen \nMedicare, provide tax cuts for families with children, and also tax \ncuts to stimulate the economy, a capital gains rate reduction, estate \ntax relief. There are hundreds of provisions in this bill.\n  I particularly, again, want to thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, \nfrom New Mexico, and members of the Budget Committee for their \noutstanding work. And I failed to mention Senator Roth, the new \nchairman of the Finance Committee. About 80 percent of this heavy \nlifting was done by the Finance Committee under the chairmanship of \nSenator Bill Roth from Delaware. He did an outstanding job. All the tax \ncuts, the Medicare and Medicaid provisions, all these very \ncontroversial areas were under the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee. Certainly Senator Roth deserves our commendation too.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we hope to continue to negotiate today and \nperhaps have some agreement on a continuing resolution by day's end, \nmaybe not, but we will try. We have just sent the President the Defense \nappropriations bill. If he signs that, about 182,000 people will go \nback to work. That is almost one-quarter of the total.\n  We hope he will look at that carefully, particularly in light of the \nfact that he may be sending American troops to Bosnia. It would seem to \nme he would want to sign the Defense appropriations bill. I hope he \ndoes not send American troops to Bosnia without first coming to \nCongress, but in the event he does, either event, I think the \nappropriations bill is important.\n  I would like to announce, but I am not quite able to, that there will \nbe no votes today. We will check on both sides of the aisle to see if \nwe can reach an agreement on a continuing resolution and if anyone \nwould require a rollcall vote. If not, then we could say no votes \ntoday. So, we will begin that process on both sides of the aisle. As \nsoon as we have word, we will get back and make that announcement. I \nknow some Members probably have other plans for the day.\n  What that would mean, if we had no votes, if we did reach an \nagreement, we could simply pass a continuing resolution by a voice \nvote, vitiate the final action taken on the CR we had a day or two ago, \namend it, send it to the House and ask them to concur with the Senate \namendment. So we could do that by voice vote. \n\n[[Page S 17423]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what is the status of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. Each Senator is \nallowed to talk for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17422-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BILL PASSED BY THE CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last evening the Senate passed what the \nmajority leader described as the most significant bill passed by the \nCongress during his long and distinguished tenure in this body. I \nshould like to express my agreement with the majority leader's \ncharacterization.\n  That Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which will undoubtedly be passed by \nthe House of Representatives today because of the minor changes made in \nthe Senate, represents a degree of responsibility, of fiscal \nresponsibility unmatched by that of any Congress, at least since the \nend of World War II.\n  That degree of fiscal responsibility, of course, has been required by \nthe habit of huge multi-hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits \nover the course of the last several years, and, most particularly, it \nhas been required because of the nature of the budget submissions of \nthis President of the United States who, while he was a candidate for \nthe Presidency, claimed that he could and would balance the budget in 5 \nyears, but who, in January of this year, proposed a budget which would \nnever, ever lead the United States to a budget deficit significantly \nlower than $200 billion.\n  The course of action since 1969, the last year in which there was a \nbalanced budget in this country, has created a debt on our shoulders \nand on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren of almost $5 \ntrillion. That means, Mr. President, that a child born today inherits a \ndebt, or a bill, of some $187,000 during his or her life, simply to pay \ninterest on the national debt. That statistic alone starkly illustrates \nnot just the fiscal and financial necessity, but the moral necessity of \na sharp change in direction.\n  This country can no longer go on providing goods and services for \nwhich it is unwilling to pay and sending the bill to our children and \ngrandchildren. Such a change is significant. Such a change does demand \ndramatic changes in many of our financial priorities. But such a change \ncarries with it great rewards.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tell us that simply by passing this \nbill, the Government of the United States will gain a fiscal dividend \nof $170 billion in more taxes and lower interest payments, a $170 \nbillion dividend matched by a dividend of three or four times that \nsize, more than half a trillion dollars to the people of the United \nStates in the form of better jobs, higher wages, lower interest rates \non their mortgages and on their car loans.\n  That is the tangible dividend for our having passed this bill if, and \nonly if, the President of the United States signs it.\n  At this point, he has said he will not. At this point, he has said he \nwill veto even the continuing resolution passed by this body two \nevenings ago which would allow all of the Government workers to go back \nto work, all of the activities of Government to continue until some \ntime in December, merely in an exchange for a promise on the part of \nthe President that he will agree to a budget that is balanced by the \nyear 2002 by the honest figures and statistics of the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  The President, in spite of his promise in 1993 to use just those \nfigures, has refused, prefers to keep the Government out of operation \nto making that pledge.\n  Now, Mr. President, nothing in that pledge requires him to accept the \nprecise numbers and priorities of our budget. He can insist on more in \nthe way of taxes than we call for and more in the way of spending than \nwe call for, or a different balance of spending. We may or may not \nagree, but that can be negotiated. What we will not negotiate, Mr. \nPresident, is the proposition that the budget will be balanced by the \nend of 7 years, with firm statutes in place that will assure that \nbalance, and that the figures we will use to determine whether or not \nthat balance is reached are honest figures, not figures cooked up in \nthe White House.\n  At this point, we understand the President wants us simply to say we \nwill have the goal of balancing the budget in 2002 and maybe the goal \nof using Congressional Budget Office figures. Well, Mr. President, that \njust does not work. We know, regrettably, that this White House has a \ndifferent goal every day of the week.\n  In fact, this President has talked about a balanced budget in 5 \nyears, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years, and never, and he has used \nat least two different sources of statistics for each of those \npromises. So we have to nail down the proposition that the budget will \nbe balanced in 7 years under honest statistics. That is all we ask for. \nBut we can ask for no less because nothing less will result in the \npeople of the United States having this wonderful fiscal dividend for \nthem in the form of better job opportunities and higher wages and lower \ninterest rates, and we will also say that we have been wrong in the \npast in spending what we would not pay for and sending the bill to \nsomeone else, and that we are not going to do it anymore.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17423-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17423-S17425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             A TURNING POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Washington \nfor his clear statement about the kind of challenge that is before us. \nThis is a turning point--a turning point in the history of our country. \nWill we decide to discontinue using the credit card of the next \ngeneration and then after racking up the charges, sending them the \nbill? That is the fundamental decision. It is a decision we have not \nhad the courage to make for the last 26 years. Over a quarter of a \ncentury has passed since we last operated without sending this enormous \ncredit card bill to our children and grandchildren.\n  This is an issue of freedom. Who will be free to make the decision on \nhow the next generations resources will be spent? Will we be free to \ndecide how their resources are spent? Or will they be free? It is not \nunlike the kind of decision that was made when this country came into \nexistence. The British thought they could tax us and spend our \nresources without listening to us. We referred to it as taxation \nwithout representation. And spending our resources against our wishes \nwas so offensive to us that we drew a proverbial line in the sand. The \nmidnight ride of Paul Revere launched this Nation into a period of \nconflict to establish once and for all that one group does not spend \nthe resources of another group against the other group's wishes and \nwill.\n  I believe that this is a fundamental turning point in America. Who is \ngoing to control the destiny of the next generation? Will they, as free \npeople, have the God-given right to shape the tomorrows in which they \nlive by deploying their resources in ways in which they see fit? Or \nwill they be slaves to the past? Will they be devoting their resources \nto pay for our excesses?\n  I think the Senator from Washington has stated the case rather \nclearly. He has pointed out that we have to live within our means, that \nwe have to fashion a spending plan that is within the limits of the \nmoney that we will have. Now, that is always a little bit difficult to \ndo in government. You have to project how much money you will have. You \ndo not know exactly how much money you will have because you do not \nknow how much will be paid in taxes and you do not know the level of \nbusiness activity. So you have to make estimates. You have to have \nassumptions about the level of economic activity in society. You have \nto have forecasting.\n  Any time you have forecasting, you run into the same trouble that you \nrun into if you are going on a picnic with \n\n[[Page S 17424]]\nyour family. No family that I know of is so devoid of good sense as to \nturn the television or radio on to get the weather forecast and there \nis a 100-percent chance of rain and thunderstorms and then see it maybe \non one or two channels and say, ``There is a series of bad forecasts \nout there; we need to have our picnic. Let us go out on the street and \nfind somebody else who might tell us that there is going to be \nsunshine.''\n  The truth of the matter is that you have to use honest data in a \nforecast. You cannot go to somebody who does not know anything about \nthe weather or somebody who has another agenda, who wants to sell you \nthe hot dogs and say, ``Are we going to have weather good enough for a \npicnic?'' You have to have the right forecast. We have to have the \nright forecast if we really want to balance the budget.\n  That is really what this business is about when we talk about using \nhonest numbers. Are we going to use numbers that are put together by \nnonpartisan individuals who are solely and totally devoted to the \ndevelopment of an honest forecast, or are we going to use figures put \ntogether by people who want to sell the hot dogs and send us on the \npicnic in the hopes that maybe there will be some miracle?\n  Well, that is where we are. We believe that using the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office as the basis for the forecast--using their \nnumbers and their forecast--is trusting the best source of prediction. \nThis source of prediction is so well revered and so well honored as the \nindependent and nonpartisan, accurate source, that the President of the \nUnited States, President Clinton, in 1993, in his State of the Union \nmessage, said we should stop using other groups like the Office of \nManagement and Budget, which is subject to political pressures. This is \ntrue even if the forecasters are not overt or do not mean to develop \ndistorted figures. Sometimes the real desire of people in politics to \ndo what they want to do skews their judgment a little bit. They have \ntoo much of a stake in the fight to be the referee. The President said \nin his State of the Union Message in 1993, ``Do not use other figures, \nuse Congressional Budget Office figures.'' I think there is a real \nreason to use Congressional Budget Office figures, because they are \nbipartisan and they do not have a dog in this fight. They can go either \nway.\n  As a matter of fact, that is what the Congress has been insisting on. \nAt least, that is what those of us on this side of the aisle have \ninsisted on--that we use the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office \nforecasting.\n  I point out that using the Congressional Budget Office forecasting \ndoes not make balancing the budget easy. It makes it tough. It makes it \nhard because it is a realistic forecast. If we were to try to solve \nthis problem by going and getting another forecast, by going to find \nsome other economist that would tell us, ``Do not worry about it, you \nare going to have lots and lots of money, so do not worry about how \nmuch you spend,'' I think we would be sticking our heads in the sand. \nThen we would suffer the consequences of not knowing when the real \nperil emerged to threaten the future of this country.\n  Let me just tell you that I am not totally comfortable with the CBO \nforecast. I am not a professional forecaster, and I am willing to \naccept their perspective. CBO has forecast that for the next 7 years we \nwill have 2.4 percent growth every year.\n\n  I really cannot remember a 7-year period when we could have counted \non that kind of growth before. Almost every time in a 7-year period you \nhave some downturns.\n  Now, there are those folks who say, surely we will have growth of \ngreater than 2.4 percent. I confess, I am willing to bet that we will. \nBut I am terribly fearful of the fact there may be times when we are \nbelow the 2.4-percent growth line.\n  The idea we would leave CBO out of the equation and leave the \nleavening influence, the stabilizing influence, the ballast of this \nnonpartisan organization out of the settlement is an idea which is \nfrightening indeed.\n  CBO, which has made a pretty aggressive estimate that we will have \n2.4 percent growth--and that means overall we will have that kind of \ngrowth as if there is no upturn or downturn, that we will not ever \nslide below it enough to drag the average down, is pretty aggressive.\n  I think as we work with the President toward a balanced budget, and I \nam committed we will work long enough to get a balanced budget, to get \nthe commitment--people have been calling me from home saying, ``Do not \nweaken. Do not sell the future of America. Do not jeopardize our \nchildren and grandchildren one more time.'' We are at a turning point. \nChildren born this year already will have, if we do not do something \nabout the debt, $187,000 to pay in their lifetime in interest on the \ndebt. ``Please do not extend that,'' they are saying. I do not want to.\n  We will work together with the President to get something done here, \nbut make sure we commit ourselves to 7 years and make sure we commit \nourselves to reasonable estimates by nonpartisan professionals. Heavens \nknows, with a 2.4-percent 7-year presumption in the mix, to assume \nthere will not be some downturn there somewhere would be whistling in \nthe dark. It would be planning the picnic in the face of a tornado, but \ngoing to someone who knows nothing about the weather and saying, ``Give \nme a better forecast. I want to go out in spite of the dark clouds that \nmay be on the horizon.''\n  Let me add just one other thing as I talk about these forecasts and \nabout the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan forecasting \nagency of Government. I know the CBO and OMB and all these letters are \nlike alphabet soup, and I am sorry we have to use them.\n  If the President says he wants to balance the budget and he uses one \nset of figures, and the Congress says they want to balance the budget \nand we use another set of figures, the President can argue from one set \nof figures, we argue from the other set of figures, the twain shall \nnever meet. We never really come to grips. We never have an honest \ndebate. We never figure out what we will or will not spend because one \ndebate is on the basis of one projected income and another debate is on \nthe basis of a different amount of money as projected income. It does \nnot provide for rational debate.\n  When the families of America balance the budgets around the kitchen \ntables, the husband does not come in and say we have this much money to \nspend and the wife comes in and says ``no,'' we have this much money to \nspend. The first thing we do is agree on how much money we have to \nspend. Not only does that happen around my kitchen table, but it \nhappens around virtually every kitchen table in America. It happens in \ncorporate America, in businesses, in charitable institutions, in \nchurches, and in civic organizations. The first thing you decide is how \nmuch money you have to spend, and until you agree upon that, you do not \nstart the debate about how to spend.\n  In Government, we sadly had this position where one part of the \nGovernment comes in and says we will have this much to spend and \nanother part of the Government says we will have this much to spend, \nand they all talk about their independent things, never coming \ntogether.\n  It is time for us to follow the suggestion of President Clinton in \nhis 1993 address to the Congress where he said we ought to use the \nCongressional Budget Office figures. He said we ought to use them \nbecause they are most likely to be correct and they are more accurate \nthan other figures.\n  The truth of the matter is we need to use them for another reason, \nand that is so we are all debating the same amount of money rather than \none debating one set of facts and another debating a separate set of \nfacts.\n  I had the privilege of serving as Governor of the State of Missouri \nfor 8 years. We had this insane system of different sets of facts and \ndifferent presumptions when I became Governor. We were able to work \nwith the legislature to arrive at a single budgeting forecast so that \nwe had what we called consensus revenue estimation. We would get \ntogether, figure out with an independent forecaster how much money we \nwould be talking about, and then the debate meant something.\n  The President proposed that in 1993. It is, I believe, time for the \nPresident to agree to it now in 1995. It is his proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes. \n\n[[Page S 17425]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The President's proposal was that we use CBO figures. \nIt was a good idea in 1993. It was a good because they are accurate. It \nis a good idea in 1995 because they are accurate, but it also is a good \nidea because it would give us a common basis for discussion.\n  More than anything else in politics we need to start with as much in \ncommon as we can. We all know that we have ideas and philosophy that \ntends to divide us, but when we start from a common basis of resource, \nwe will at least have an intelligent means for discussing how that \nresource is to be divided, used, allocated, and spent for the benefit \nof the people of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nHouse as in morning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. The Senator can \nproceed for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17423-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17425-S17426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to address a couple of topics. \nFirst, I want to congratulate the Senator from Missouri for his cogent \ncomments on how we get to a balanced budget, how we score the question \nof spending, and how we maintain some semblance of credibility to the \nnumbers here in Congress.\n  I respect his leadership as a former Governor in this area and \nrecognize that he understands, maybe more than many of us, the \nimportance of having honest numbers because, of course, in his State \nthey had to have a balanced budget--something, unfortunately, that we \ndo not have to have at the Federal level. It would be nice if we did. \nWhen you have to live by a balanced budget, as he did as Governor of \nMissouri, the real numbers become very important.\n  It is not a gamesmanship exercise here in obtaining real numbers and \nhis points are well-taken as we move forward to try to resolve this \ncontinuing resolution process issue, that we have to have hard numbers \nthat are real numbers so that there can be true movement toward a \nbalanced budget, not something done by mirrors or smoke.\n  I want to talk a little bit, also, about what the President has been \nsaying about the balanced budget amendment which we passed yesterday, \nthe balanced budget resolution. The President has once again in his \nradio address, as I understand it, misrepresented facts and the \nsituation especially in the area of Medicare.\n  It is now extremely ironic that the administration should continue to \nattack the Republican membership for our bill to balance the budget, \nwhich bill, at the same time, puts the Medicare trust fund into \nsolvency and gives the senior citizens of this country choices which \nthey do not have today, choices which are similar to those that we have \nas Members of Congress.\n  It is ironic that the President and the Vice President and his \nminions should continue to attack us for putting forward a proposal \nlike this, calling our proposals extremist, cuts, slashing of the \nMedicare system, when, in fact, the number agreed to and which was \npassed last night by this Senate and by the House and therefore by the \nCongress and sent down to the President for the rate of growth of \nMedicare which we have agreed to, which the Republicans have put \nforward, actually now exceeds the number that the President of the \nUnited States sent up as his rate of growth that he would like to see \nin the area of Medicare spending in his June budget.\n  To go over it in specifics, in his June budget the President said he \nwanted Medicare to grow at 7.1 percent. Why did he say that? Because \nhis trustees of the trust fund had just come back--Secretary Rubin, \nSecretary Shalala, and Secretary Reich had just come back--and said if \nwe did not slow the rate of growth in Medicare the trust fund would go \nbankrupt in the year 2002, and the rate of growth of the trust fund was \n10 percent. In other words, every year we are spending 10 percent more \non Medicare than we spent the year before. The reason we are doing that \nis because the system is broken.\n\n  So, the President understood this in his June submission and said, \n``We have to slow that rate of growth to 7.1 percent annually, down \nfrom 10 percent.''\n  Then we put forward our proposal and we suggested the rate of growth, \nin our initial proposal, should be 6.4 percent. That is what the debate \nwas about, the difference between 7.1 percent and 6.4 percent, or \napproximately 0.7 percent.\n  Now, after negotiating with the House and making some changes to try \nto address the concerns of some of the seniors in this country and \ntheir groups, we have come forward with a budget which allows Medicare \nto grow at 7.4 percent. That is what the Republican resolution, the \nBalanced Budget Act which we passed last night, has as a number: 7.4 \npercent. I think it is very important the press and the people of this \ncountry take note of that. Because we are now 0.3 percent higher in our \nrate of growth in Medicare than what the President had in his budget \nsubmission in June. So, if he is going to continue to say we are \nslashing, cutting, savaging the Medicare system, then he must have the \nintegrity to say that his proposal exceeded our slashes, exceeded our \ncuts, exceeded our attacks on Medicare, if that is the case.\n  Of course, in fact, it is not the case. Actually what we have done \nis, rather than slash, cut, or in any other way negatively impact the \nMedicare system, we have actually created a new system which is going \nto strengthen the Medicare system. We are going to spend $349 billion \nmore on Medicare over the next 7 years than we are spending if we were \nto just flat-fund it; a $349 billion increase in spending. Every senior \nin this country on Medicare today gets $4,900 in benefits, they are \ngoing to get $6,700 by the year 2002. They will not only get additional \nbenefits in the way of dollars, but they will get additional benefits \nin the way of opportunities. They will be able to go out and try some \nother types of health care delivery systems, many of those systems \nwhich we now as Members of Congress have available to us but seniors do \nnot have available to them. In the same process, we are not going to \nlimit their ability to stay in their present Medicare system. We are \nactually going to let them expand that ability, if they desire to do \nso.\n  So, the President once again is being a bit disingenuous in his \npositions--to be kind. He is misrepresenting, not only his position but \nour position. What for? To pander to an electorate, to try to scare \nthat electorate, to try to run for reelection rather than substantively \naddress the issues which we have to address, which of course is that we \nneed to balance this budget in order to make sure that our children \nhave a chance for a prosperous lifestyle and our seniors have a \nMedicare trust fund that is solvent.\n  So we have put forward this balanced budget which makes a great deal \nof sense, because if we do not pass this balanced budget, we would be \npassing on to our children no opportunity for prosperity because we \nwould be passing on to them a country which would be confronted with \ntrillions of dollars of additional debt which our children will have to \npay. A child born today will have to pay $186,000 in taxes just to pay \nthe interest on the Federal debt. That is not right. It is not fair. \nOur generation is spending our children's future and it is not right.\n\n  So we passed this bill last night and it was a good bill. It had \nchanges in basic programs which will be positive and which will make \nthose programs deliver better services. But, as with all good bills \nthat pass this Congress, when they are large bills sometimes something \nhappens. Some little cadre of folks around here realizes those bills \nhave a certain amount of momentum and they are going to pass because \nthey are good bills and on balance everybody who is thoughtful about \nquality Government is probably going to vote for them and there will be \na majority that will pass them.\n  So they sometimes sneak little provisions into these bills that are \nnot that good. But because you have an up-or-down vote on the whole \nbill and you cannot get those provisions out, you end up with those \nprovisions in. In this instance, that occurred, unfortunately, and I \nwant to talk briefly about that; sort of the dark side of the \nreconciliation bill, if you will, because, unfortunately, there were \nsome dark corners in the reconciliation bill. \n\n[[Page S 17426]]\n\n  The most egregious example of that was what happened with the sugar \nprogram. Let us first understand what the sugar program is in this \ncountry. It is basically a ripoff of the consumers of America to the \ntune of $1.4 billion every year. It is the last vestiges of a Marxist \neconomic system in, probably, the world. Well, maybe they still have it \nin Cuba, a Marxist economic system. But the last real strong vestiges \nof it is right here in the United States in our sugar program.\n  What does the sugar program do? It basically, arbitrarily, without \nany relationship to the market forces of the economy, fixes the price \nof sugar at a price which is 50 percent higher--30 to 50 percent higher \nthan what sugar should cost Americans. In the open market today you can \nbuy sugar at 10 cents. Under our system of farm subsidy and price \ncontrol, we pay 22 cents, 23 cents. This is an outrage, but it is a \ncartel in this country that has a grip on the economics of the issue of \nsugar and, unfortunately, on this Congress, because it uses vehicles \nlike the reconciliation bill to abuse the process.\n  So, in this reconciliation bill there was not a 1-year, not 2-year, \nbut a 7-year extension of this outrage, of this program which is the \nultimate example of the former East European market approach to \neconomics. It was extended because these folks were able to slip this \nin. And the irony of it, of course, is that it was put in by people who \non most days are the greatest supporters of capitalism, and some of the \nstrongest supporters of conservative thought on this floor. They \nslipped it in here,  for whatever reasons I cannot imagine, because \nthey could not justify it, I am sure, under any intellectual basis. But \nit got slipped in here for the purposes of raiding the pocketbooks of \nAmericans, for the purposes of benefiting a very small group of people.\n\n  The GAO did a study of this and 17 farms--17 cane farmers in this \ncountry get 58 percent of the benefit, 58 percent of the benefit. That \nis a huge amount of dollars on a $1.4 billion subsidy. That is a huge \namount of dollars to one small group of individuals in this country who \nhappen to have the capacity to have put their idea into this \nreconciliation.\n  Now, there are many of us on our side--on both sides of the aisle, \nthis is a bipartisan outrage at this--who find this to be an \ninexcusable event, who think the idea that an attempt to balance the \nbudget should have in it a plan which essentially affronts the \nsensibilities of everything that Adam Smith ever stood for, and that \nthe market economy ever stood for, that capitalism ever stood for, that \nour country's basic economic structure stands for--that that program \nshould be in this bill is not only ironic, it is an outrage. However, \ndue to the rules of this Senate, we were not able to remove it from \nthis bill. But we all understand this bill, unfortunately, because it \nhas a huge amount of good in it, unfortunately it will end up vetoed. \nIt will come back to us.\n  I want to put folks on notice. When it comes back, in whatever form \nit comes back, this sugar debate is not going to be allowed to be \nshoved into the back corner. This sugar debate is going to be out \nthere, it is going to be on the front burner. Because the American \npeople can no longer be subject to this outrage of having $1.4 billion \ntransferred out of their pockets into the pockets of a few cane growers \nand a few processors, simply because somebody used the parliamentary \nrules around here to protect a program that is absolutely indefensible \nunder any other circumstances.\n  So, this issue shall be revisited when this bill is revisited and it \nshall be revisited with much more intensity than the last go-around. \nBecause of the fact it was necessary, because of the overriding \nstrength of this bill in the area of getting under control entitlement \nspending generally, on such things as Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare, \nand the overriding desire to address that, we had to unfortunately--we \nended up, unfortunately, being gamed on the issue of sugar.\n  But in the next go-around, I simply put people on notice that game \nwill be joined with much more intensity because the consumers of this \ncountry do not deserve to have to pay $1.4 billion simply because a \nbunch of cane growers want to make money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are having a rather unusual Saturday \nsession today for the very obvious and specific reason that, indeed, \nthe Government of the United States and the United States is in a \ncrisis situation today because of the failure of the legislative and \nexecutive branches--regardless of their political affiliations and \npolitical attitudes--meaning simply that we have to come to some kind \nof an agreement, some kind of an understanding, some kind of a lowering \nof the testing of wills with regard to a compromise that can be reached \nat this time to at least establish the basis or the framework to get on \nwith the more important and more difficult task down the road, and \ncoming to an agreement to balance the budget as quickly as we can. But \nI think we should keep this all in perspective.\n  I would simply say, Mr. President, that heated rhetoric, charges, and \ncountercharges of what this Senator will do or what that Senator will \ndo, the pretense of standing up for what is right above everything \nelse, of what I think is right regardless of what my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthink might be a workable solution, a solution to the crisis that faces \nthe United States today and toning down our rhetoric, toning down our \ndemands, toning down our individual wills, is the only mixture that is \ngoing to provide a measure of success in the future that none of us \nindividually might be totally satisfied with, but one that gets this \nGovernment moving and allows democracy to function as it has \nsuccessfully functioned for many, many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17426-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17426-S17428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SUGAR PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I was absolutely astonished at the remarks \nmade by my colleague from New Hampshire a few moments ago, when, if I \nheard him correctly, he said that the sugar program of the United \nStates was Marxist in nature. I will with some restraint tone down my \nrhetoric on that, except to say that the Senator from New Hampshire is \nwrong.\n  Coming on the floor of the U.S. Senate at a time when very delicate \nnegotiations are going on and assailing one part of the agricultural \nbill--in this instance, the sugar program--I think is not helpful. It \nis not constructive. It is not good Government, especially in that it \nwould further impair the delicate negotiations that are now ongoing.\n\n  Let me speak a little bit about the sugar program. If we would follow \nthe recommendations, as I understand it, that were just made on the \nSenate floor by the Senator from New Hampshire, we would in effect be \neliminating the production of sugar in the United States of America for \nall time to come. The sugar program does not cost the taxpayers \nanything. It is true that it does prop up prices to a very reasonable \nlevel so that we can continue to have such a fundamental ingredient as \nsugar as a part of the American production system.\n  If we would follow the recommendations, as I understand them, from \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, we would, in effect, eliminate the \nsugar program in the United States of America. All of our industries \nthat rely on sugar as a key ingredient of our diet would go down the \ntube, and the United States of America would be totally reliant on \nimported sugar for as far as we can see into the future.\n  I would simply say to my colleague from New Hampshire that maybe we \nshould follow that same program with regard to milk production. I do \nnot know how much sugar production there is in New Hampshire, but there \nis a great deal of milk production. There is both sugar and milk \nproduction in my State of Nebraska. I would simply say that, if we are \ngoing to destroy the sugar program, it would only follow that we would \ndestroy the milk program. If we are to logically follow the \nrecommendations by the Senator from New Hampshire, I do not know what \nthe milk producers in New Hampshire \n\n[[Page S 17427]]\nwould think of that, but I would suspect that they might not be very \nmuch impressed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I will yield at an appropriate time.\n  I simply say to the President, and to the Senate, that if we are \ngoing to try to work things out here, I think it is not proper, and it \nis not accurate, to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate and indicate \nthat the sugar program is Marxist in its concept when it clearly is \nnot.\n  I happen to feel that if we could tone down our rhetoric, if we could \nrecognize and realize that there are differing points of view from \npeople who are basically well-intentioned, then we can come together. I \nhappen to feel that the Republican plan on the farm bill that was \noriginated in the House of Representatives is a total disaster for \nAmerica. Not only is it a disaster for America in our food production \nindustry, but I  think it turns the farm program--good, bad, or \nindifferent --into a welfare program. And few understand that if we \naccept the agricultural program announced and endorsed by the House of \nRepresentatives, we would be turning the farm program into welfare.\n\n  Why do I say that? Mr. President, a key ingredient of the so-called \nRoberts farm plan is to pay farmers even if they do not plant anything. \nCan you imagine anything that smacks of ill-advised welfare, if we \nwould start paying farmers for not doing anything or producing \nanything?\n  That part of the Roberts farm bill that I refer to as farm welfare \npure and simple is so revolting and so illogical that I think it should \nbe rejected out of hand. Yet, that program is alive and well today and \nwas given editorial support this morning in the Washington Post.\n  The Washington Post has been historically against farm programs. That \nis well known, and that is very right. They are an Eastern newspaper \nthat does not understand at all the needs of rural America and have had \nno pretense whatsoever of understanding the problems of rural America. \nI think their editorial writers down there in the Washington Post think \nthat food is something that you go down to the supermarket and buy off \nthe shelf.\n  I simply say in returning that I understood the arguments of the \nSenator from New Hampshire would be that we should junk the sugar \nprogram because it is Marxist. That would be another step down that \nroad that we have gone a long distance in traveling with regard to \nnearly 60 percent of the fuel that we use in the United States today, \noil-based fuels, comes from overseas.\n  We have been down that path before when we recognized that a few \nforeign oil cartels can literally, if they want to, get together and \nset the prices for oil. That is bad enough, and we are not taking \nenough steps, in the view of this Senator, to correct that. But to \nfollow the same road by eliminating sugar production in the United \nStates of America, which would surely come if we would follow the \nrecommendations of the Senator from New Hampshire, we would simply say, \nin addition to being solely dependent in the future for the major part, \nif not all, of oil production, we would be also following down the line \nwhich would be even worse with regard to a basic part of our food \nsupply and distribution system.\n  Mr. President, I simply say that this is a time for all of us to \nmaybe control, rein in our rhetoric at a time when the leadership of \nboth the Democrat and Republican Parties is at this very moment trying \nto institute some kind of a compromise and agreement, if you will, that \nwill eliminate the crisis that we have today and have some kind of a \nframework understanding of what we are going to do in the future, to \ncome to some agreement with regard to the future budget of the United \nStates and how we are reasonably going to balance it.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I certainly yield to my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire for any questions he would like to ask the Senator. \nIf I did misinterpret his remarks, I would appreciate his explanation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 \nminutes so we might have a colloquy between myself and the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. No, the Senator did not misinterpret my remarks. Karl Marx \nwas an economist first. He became affiliated with communism, of course, \nbut his basic theory of economics was that you should essentially, \nthrough controlling the marketplace from the top down, move dollars \nfrom one segment to another as the state determined appropriate. That \nwas the basic theme of Marxism, that the state should use the power of \nthe state to move dollars from one group to another and manage the \nmarketplace both through transfer of wealth through income-related \nactivities and also transfer wealth through pricing activities. That \nwas the basic theme of Marxism.\n  If you look at the sugar program, the open market price for sugar \ntoday is 10 cents a pound. That is what it was quoted at on CNBC just \nyesterday. The price support is set at 18 cents a pound, but the target \nprice that is used, which is outrageous to  begin with, the target \nprice which is used by the Agriculture Department is somewhere around \n21, 22, 23 cents a pound. I am not sure. It is right in that range. The \nbasic reason, of course, being under the structure they do not want \nanybody to end up having to pay back their loan. So they make it \npossible for the price to be so much higher than even the support price \nthat no loans ever end up going into default.\n\n  Maybe there is some other term you use for this that is appropriate, \nbut when there is no market force of any nature involved in pricing the \nproduct, that is certainly not capitalism. It is certainly not an Adam \nSmith approach to managing a commodity. It is a management by the state \nof the price of the commodity to benefit the producers of the \ncommodity, and in this case it happens to be that 42 percent of the \nbenefit runs to sugar growers who represent 1 percent of all the sugar \nfarmers, happening to be the cane growers in this instance, not the \nsugar beet growers, who would happen to be from Nebraska.\n  I happen to think we could restructure this program where your sugar \nbeet growers have a much better opportunity to get some of that 42 \npercent of the benefit and not have the consumers pick up the $1.4 \nbillion subsidy which is incurred as a result of setting the price \narbitrarily at the number which has no relationship and which is almost \n100 percent higher than at what the free market sets the price.\n  So did I use the term Marxist economics to characterize it? Yes, \nbecause it is a state-run, state-dominated, state-controlled price-\nsetting mechanism, which is the classic definition of Marxist \neconomics. If it were a free market or if it were a quasi-free market, \nyou might use some other term. If it were a quasi-free market, I \nsuppose you could characterize it as a farm subsidy program. But it is \neven beyond that. So that is why I used that term. I think it is an \naccurate characterization. I do not deem it pejorative in the sense it \nis inaccurate. It may be pejorative because that form of economics has \nbeen so rejected by the world now. But it is a fact that exists.\n  Now, as to the dairy program, I would be willing to make a deal right \nhere with the Senator that we put all products on the basis of market \neconomics, we have no subsidies underlying any commodities. I will vote \nfor it. If you want to take the dairy program out of any subsidy \nprogram, I will vote for that, if it is part of a package to take \neverything out. In fact, I would probably vote for it if it were not a \npart of a package to take everything out. Dairy is an issue in which I \nam not a great  defender of the price supports either.\n\n  I think the issue here that I raised with sugar is a legitimate issue \nand the characterization is accurate. So I yield to the Senator from \nNebraska for his comment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, for clarification purposes, if I might ask \nmy colleague from New Hampshire whether he would so characterize the \ndairy programs that we have in the United States as Marxist, as he has \nclearly indicated he feels the sugar programs also are?\n  Mr. GREGG. I do not think the dairy program is an egregious example \nof price controls, because the dairy prices are much closer to a \nmarket-driven event than the sugar prices. So I would say we are \nsomewhere in between. It is \n\n[[Page S 17428]]\nclearly not a capitalist system. It is clearly not a market system that \nwe have in dairy, which it should be, and I strongly support moving to \na market system. But it is nowhere near the egregious price-support \nlevels that we have in the sugar system.\n  So, no, I do not think I would say it is a purely state-dominated \nsystem, but it has clearly got too much state domination in it. I wish \nwe would correct it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the last discussion. Clearly \nthe issue of sugar subsidy and maintaining the price that is \nsubstantially above the market price has been detrimental to consumers \nin this country. It is true it has no direct effect or impact on the \nFederal budget. That is simply because we have shifted the entire \nimpact to the consumers of this country.\n  But that is not why I am here to speak. I think that subject has been \nadequately debated between the Senator from New Hampshire and the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17426-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17428-S17429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET IMPASSE\n\n  Mr. COATS.

There clearly are a number of \ncompelling reasons to support a balanced budget: lower interest rates, \nhigher economic growth. These have all been discussed in detail on this \nfloor over the last several days. But I do not believe that economic \nfacts fully explain the urgency of the issue and why the lines have \nbeen drawn so sharply between these two competing philosophies.\n  There is a moral aspect to this debate, a moral imperative that I \nthink is important we understand because those of us who are holding \nfirm for a commitment to a balanced budget in a fixed amount of time \nwith honest numbers are doing so because we are convinced that not only \nare the deficits imposed year after year after year on the American \npublic unwise but they are unprincipled.\n  They are not just a drag on the economy, not just an impact on \ninterest rates, but a burden on our national conscience. It was Thomas \nJefferson who said nearly 200 years ago--in arguing the question of \nwhether one generation has the right to impose on another generation a \ndebt burden which is the obligation of those that are currently \nenacting that burden, currently supporting that spending--Jefferson \nsaid, ``The question of whether one generation has the right to bend \nanother by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as \nto place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should \nconsider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and \nbe morally bound to pay them ourselves.''\n  So what we have been debating are not just the numbers to compromise \nbetween the White House and this Congress, what we have been debating \nis a fundamental principle of Government, and I think a fundamental \nprinciple of society. I doubt that there is anyone on this floor or a \nMember of the Senate that has not at some time in their life sat down \nwith their children and explained the principle of deficit spending, \nand whether it deals with a $1 or $2 allowance or whether it deals with \nsetting aside money necessary to pay expenses while they are away at \ncollege, the principle is the same, and, I think, what we all try to \npass on to the next generation, that is, that we cannot keep spending \nmore than we make.\n  If you spend more money than you earn, you are going to have only one \nof two recourses: You are going to quickly run yourself unto \ninsolvency, or you are going to roll up a debt that will become such a \nburden in terms of payment of interest to maintain that debt that other \nitems of expenditures, necessary expenditures, are going to be \nsqueezed.\n  Many young people have learned the hard way through receipt, as soon \nas they are independent from their family, of a Visa, Master Card, or \nother credit card, how easy and how attempting it is to run to the mall \nand roll up and use that card to purchase items for the moment. And \nthen the bills start rolling in, and they notice that they are paying a \n17, 18 percent interest rate on the mounting debt.\n  What has happened on a national basis is that debt has been mounting \nat a staggering rate. It took more than 200 years to reach the first $1 \ntrillion of debt. Now, in just the space of 15 years, we have \nquintupled that $1 trillion debt to the point where this Nation now \nstands at $4.9 trillion of national debt. It is a staggering burden. It \nis a burden that is imposed, I would suggest, on the next generation. \nAnd therefore, that moral tradition that we have held at the highest \nlevel in this country of sacrificing for the benefit of future \ngenerations so that our children might enjoy at least an equal but \nhopefully a better standard of living, better quality of life than we \nhave been privileged to enjoy, which was transferred to us by the \nprevious generation, this generation has become the first generation to \nviolate that trust.\n\n  Every child born in America today inherits $19,000 in public debt, \nand it is going up at a staggering rate. That is a destructive legacy \nof a government without courage. True, it has caused a budgetary \ncrisis, but it has done more than that. It has betrayed a moral \nresponsibility.\n  Now, this moral imperative clashes with a political imperative. The \npolitical imperative says deficit spending makes sense because it \nallows elected officials and allows Government to please people in the \npresent by placing burdens on the future. Interestingly enough, the \nfuture has no vote in the next election. And so the temptation has \nalways been to fund for the moment, to spend for the moment, because it \nimpacts positively on those who will go to the polls at the next \nelection to perpetuate our existence in this elected body. That is the \nprime reason why I strongly believe in term limits, because term limits \nare the only device that I know of, as imperfect as they are, that \nchanges the dynamic of the way we make decisions.\n  It is human nature to obviously want to keep your job. It is human \nnature to want to be reelected, to be favored by the people. And the \npolitical imperative, particularly over the last 30 or 40 years, has \nbeen to accomplish that purpose essentially by spending money but not \nhaving the courage to go forth and ask taxpayers to pay for that \nexpenditure, but simply to float the debt and pass that payment on to a \nfuture generation, which, by the way, does not go to the polls at the \nnext election.\n  So we see these two imperatives, the political imperative and the \nmoral imperative, clashing against and struggling against each other. I \nbelieve the moment has come that that titanic struggle is at issue and \nneeds to be decided, where the choice is clear before us. On one side, \nunfortunately, we are dealing with a President supported by many, not \nall, members of his party who seem to be pursuing the political \nimperative; and on the other, I believe we are seeing a commitment to \nthe moral imperative.\n  The problem that we face is that we have defined a commitment to the \nprinciple of not imposing additional burdens on future generations \nthrough an act called the Balanced Budget  Act of 1995, accomplished in \na defined time period and accomplished with numbers on which we can \nboth agree. After all, it was the President--it was the President--who \ncalled on us to agree on how these numbers would be determined and \nderived so that we would not be arguing over differing assumptions and \ndiffering sets of numbers.\n\n  Frankly, it was the President who essentially put in play the fixed \nperiod of time with which to reach the goal of a balanced budget. He \ncampaigned on that basis. He said, ``There's a way for me to meet the \nstated objectives, which is a balanced budget in 7 years, with a family \ntax cut * * *'' That is exactly what Republicans have offered the \nPresident: a balanced budget in 7 years with a family tax cut. It is \nwhat the President called for. We responded to that. But now the \nPresident said, ``No, those are not my priorities.''\n  This Republican budget has the courage to confront the political \nimperative because we believe that we have a moral duty to the next \ngeneration.\n  Now, my concern, Mr. President, is that as the Senator from Nebraska \nhas said, we have allowed rhetoric to get ahead of the facts of the \nsituation. I am concerned that the American public is focusing on our \nrhetoric and not the facts. \n\n[[Page S 17429]]\n\n  Coming in this morning to the Senate, I listened to the President's \nweekend address, and the President was obviously putting the best light \non his position on the acts of the Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair and my colleague from Texas.\n  I was deeply concerned that the rhetoric of the President far \nexceeded the reality of the facts that we are dealing with. The \nPresident characterized, on about as many occasions as possible in a 5-\nminute speech, the Republican effort as an extreme effort.\n  Now, somewhere in the process here the President's pollsters, focus \ngroups, so forth, have discovered that the American public has an \nemotional, visceral reaction to the word ``extremism.'' So it seems \neverything Republicans are attempting to do all year, whether it is a \ndefense bill or whether it is welfare reform or whether it is balancing \nthe budget, is labeled as extremist. He used to say it was right-wing \nreligious extremists. Then, they found out people of faith resented \nthat and that did not go down too well, so now we are down just to the \nword ``extremist.''\n  The President and Vice President just incessantly use the word \n``extremist.'' You heard that from the minority leader's speech last \nevening. I think there must be a reward for those who can use the word \nmore times within each minute of statement because it seems like it is \nalmost every other word.\n  Now, I ask the American people and I ask my colleagues to examine the \nrhetoric, and in the light of the reality of the budget, because what \nRepublicans are saying is that with this moral imperative and this \nstaggering debt, we believe it is important to enact the principle of a \nbalanced budget not this year, not next year, not 1999, not by the turn \nof the century, the new millennium, but by the year 2002.\n  Over a 7-year period of time, we believe we should make an orderly \ntransition from where we now are to a position where we will not spend \nmore than we take in. And if we do it over a 7-year period of time, it \nwill allow spending to increase at a rate of 22 percent. It will \nincrease over that period of time in expenditures such as Medicare at a \nrate of 65 percent; that the Medicare increases will go up at a rate of \n7.4 percent annually.\n  One would think, listening to the President and listening to some of \nour colleagues who oppose that--because they use terms such as \n``cutting off at the knees,'' ``throwing children out on the street,'' \n``denying aid to widows,'' ``turning our backs on the disabled,'' \n``gutting the American social compact''--you would think that what \nRepublicans are offering are drastic, drastic cuts in the amount of \nsocial welfare and the amount of expenditures on a whole number of \nprograms.\n  Medicaid increases will go up 43 percent; welfare spending will \nincrease by $100 billion over this time period.\n  Republicans find themselves in an unusual position, because a lot of \npeople back home say, ``Wait a minute, we thought you were going to do \nmore than that. We thought you were going to cut back.'' Well, we are \nslowing the rate of growth, but in no sense can those be characterized \nas cuts from current expenditures. The spending will continue, but it \nwill continue at a slower rate and over a 7-year period of time. As our \neconomy grows and as expenditures decrease from the standpoint of a \nlower rate than before, those two lines will cross, and, as certified \nby the agency that the President asked us to use to certify those \nnumbers, we will reach a balanced budget in 2002.\n  As I said, we do this not just because it makes good economic sense, \nbut we do this because we believe we have a moral imperative to do so. \nThis is a historic piece of legislation. It allows us in the Congress \nto leave some legacy to the future, other than monumental debt--a \nlegacy of moral courage and a legacy of responsibility.\n  We have waited a long time to get to this point. It has been an \nunusual convergence of events that have led us to this moment. I do not \nknow that we will have another opportunity to do this, and so a vote to \nkeep our word and keep our faith with the next generation is a vote \nthat I hope the President will exercise, as we exercised last evening.\n  The President, with one stroke of the pen, can address what I believe \nis the economic imperative but, more importantly, can address the moral \nimperative. The President can address the issue of whether or not we \nwill keep faith with the next  generation. He will address the question \nof whether or not this generation, this selfish generation, this me-\nfirst generation, will finally say, ``We have run the course. It has \nbeen a disaster for the future of America.''\n\n  The economic consequences are untold, and it is time that we drew a \nline and had the courage to do what I think every one of us \ninstinctively knows is right.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my \ncolleague from Indiana. I think he laid out in a lofty and beautiful \nspeech exactly why we are here.\n  I have read the quote from Thomas Jefferson as well. And, in fact, \nThomas Jefferson had said he had really two problems with our \nConstitution, and it was nagging in the back of his mind.\n  One of those nagging concerns of Thomas Jefferson was that we did not \nhave a mechanism that would keep Congress from going into debt, because \nhe felt that public debt was not the right of any Congress to make.\n  The second thing that Thomas Jefferson was concerned about was that \nwe did not have a system to assure rotation in office. Of course, term \nlimitations are still a very powerful issue for us in this Congress \nover 200 years after the Constitution was ratified, and I think his \nnagging concerns were two very important ones that I wish he had been \nable to address.\n  But then when we look at what the founders of our country did in the \nConstitution, they are certainly to be commended for the foresight they \nhad in so many areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17428-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17429-S17430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET IMPASSE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to talk about this budget \nimpasse, because there is no question that we are at a crossroads in \nour country. The impasse is over our President and this Congress and \nour differing views about what course this country should be on. The \nCongress promised the people a balanced budget, and we are producing on \nthat balanced budget.\n  We have sent to the President a balanced budget for the first year of \na 7-year plan. The President promised in his campaign a balanced budget \nin 5 years, actually. But when the time came to sign the dotted line to \nmake the hard choices, the President has chosen instead to demur, to \ntalk about politics instead of coming down to the bottom line and \nworking with Congress on a budget that is balanced. He is holding our \nGovernment hostage.\n  Mr. President, why do we have this impasse? There are two things: The \nbalanced budget which we have sent to the President and the resolution \nthat would continue the operation of Government, which is why people \nare not working in our Government at full staff levels.\n\n  We passed a resolution that would continue Government from September \n30, when the fiscal year ended, until this week. Now we are in the \nsecond resolution. The second resolution has the lower budget figures \nthat are necessary if we are going to balance the budget.\n  So when we talk about this continuing resolution, it is crucial that \nwe have the lower numbers because we are in the fiscal year. We are in \nthe 1996 fiscal year. We must have the lower spending numbers if we are \ngoing to make our 7-year goal, and that is the crucial issue here. The \nPresident does not want the lower spending limits because, in fact, the \nPresident does not want the balanced budget in 7 years.\n  Now, he paid lipservice to a balanced budget in 7 years. He said \npublicly that he would agree to a balanced budget in 7 years, but he \njust will not do what is necessary to get us there, and he has \n\n[[Page S 17430]]\nyet to send us a budget that is balanced at all, not in 10 years, not \nin 9 years, not in 8 years and not in 7 years.\n  So because we have this impasse, the people of this country are \ncertainly concerned. There are people who say, ``Settle it. Pox on both \nyour houses, settle it.''\n  I just ask people who say, ``settle it,'' do they want us to settle \nit at the cost of our future security, our future prosperity?\n  Do they want us to settle it at last year's spending rates so that we \ncannot possibly meet our goal of a 7-year balanced budget? Do they want \nus to settle it regardless of the promise that we made in 1994?\n  Mr. President, I ran on a platform, in 1994, of a balanced budget. I \npromised the people who voted for me, and I promised everyone whether \nthey voted for me or not, that I would come up here to try to balance \nthe budget, to try for a 7-year balanced budget. The President also, in \nhis campaign, in 1992, promised the people that he would work for a \nbalanced budget. The President made the promise, I made the promise. \nThe difference is, I am keeping my promise.\n  I think that is the issue here. The people have been promised for 25 \nyears a balanced budget in this country. But the politicians have \nalways walked away from it. And the reason is, they did not have the \nguts to look at entitlements, and everybody knows entitlements are more \nthan 50 percent of our budget, that they are the toughest of all things \nto work with. This Congress did something different. This Congress kept \nthe promise by tackling entitlements, by saying that welfare is going \non a budget, just like your family budget, just like your small \nbusiness budget. Welfare is going on a budget.\n  So we have produced reform of a very important former entitlement. It \nis an entitlement today, but hopefully if we can do what is right for \nthe long term of this country, it will not be an entitlement. It will \nbe a budget item. And we will have limitations on welfare for able-\nbodied recipients for the first time in this country since we created \nthe welfare system.\n  So it is very important that the people understand that we did reform \nwelfare, that we did take on Medicaid entitlements, that we are going \nto give it to the States so that they can do it without Federal \nstrings, in a more efficient way, that we are going to save the \nMedicare system from bankruptcy, so that it will be there for our \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. President, we are keeping a promise, and it is not an easy one. \nIt would be more comfortable to just cave. Sure, I would like for \neveryone to go back to work in Government. I would like to take the \neasy way out. It would be much more comfortable. But, Mr. President, my \nconstituents did not put their faith in me to take the comfortable, \neasy way out. My constituents elected me because they believed that I \nwould keep my promise.\n  I am not going to mortgage the long-term security of this country for \na short-term comfort rate. I am not going to do it because the people \nelected us to represent them, and they sent a  powerful message in \n1994. They want a balanced budget and they want people who are tough \nenough to do it.\n\n  So I did not get elected to come here and cave to the President, who \nmade the same promise that I did, but is walking away from that \npromise. I am not going to walk away. I am going to stand here for a \nbalanced budget in 7 years. We are doing it in a responsible way. In \nfact, a lot of people think we should do it in 5 years. But we are \nsaying, no, we believe 7 years would keep the economy strong at the \nsame time that we are doing what is right for the long term. So we are \nmaking the right decision for the short term and the right decision for \nthe long term.\n  Mr. President, this is a crossroads for our country. As the great \n``philosopher'' Yogi Berra once said, ``When you come to a fork in the \nroad, take it.'' Well, once again, we have a choice of which road to \ntake. We have the choice. Mr. President, the Congress is going to stay \non the road that will take this country back to prosperity and \nstability. We are going to bring back what made this country strong in \nthe first place. Families, the spirit of entrepreneurship, the small \nbusinesses, a strong national defense built this country. We won the \ncold war because we were strong, not because we were weak. And we are \ngoing to do what is right, Mr. President, in the short term and the \nlong term. We are not going to walk away from our promises, and I wish \nthe President would do the same.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, apparently, the present occupant of the \nchair wanted to make some remarks; is that correct?\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, we have been trying to go back and forth. \nAs I understand it, my colleague from Oklahoma wishes to make some \nremarks. I would agree to that. I hope that the Chair will see fit to \nrecognize the Senator from Nebraska after the Senator from Oklahoma has \ncompleted his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will recognize the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Exon, following the remarks of the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17429-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17430-S17431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENDING TROOPS TO BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me thank both Senators from Nebraska \nwho have been kind enough to allow me to have a little time. I \nappreciate it very much. I will try to return the favor some time.\n  Madam President, I have a feeling that this is a historic moment \nright now, that we may not have any more votes, and we may be leaving \nall of this up here and going back, hopefully, for the Thanksgiving \nholidays, in which case I have a couple of comments I want to make. \nThey are not really exactly on the focus of today, but I will also go \nback and wind up with some thoughts I have on this subject.\n  There have been some rumors--and I always hate to talk about rumors \non the floor of the U.S. Senate--that have come from so many different \nunrelated sources, and I am concerned that during the period of time \nthat we will be in the Thanksgiving recess, there may be some agreement \nreached and our troops may be deployed to Bosnia.\n  This concerns me very much, and this is not a very appropriate time \nto bring it up. But I do think that we need to get on the record and \nremind the President that this Senate passed, just 2 days ago, a strong \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment to the DOD appropriations bill which says \nthat we, Mr. President, want you to come to the Senate and to the House \nof Representatives for authority to send troops into Bosnia.\n  It was a very similar situation that the President of the United \nStates at that time, George Bush, faced back in the early nineties when \nhe wanted to send troops to the Persian Gulf. He did not want to come \nto Congress. He felt it was necessary and that we had vital national \ninterests in the Persian Gulf and we had to go. Yet, he did not want to \ndo that and take a chance of being turned down. So we have a similar \nsituation today.\n  I can remember talking to one of the generals training over at the \n1st Armored Division in Germany. Those are the troops that were going \nto go to the Persian Gulf. Now he is training the troops that would go \nto Bosnia. He related to me an experience of sitting and listening to \nthe radio, hoping, and praying that George Bush would take this to \nCongress to get authority. They did not want to be sending their troops \ninto a hostile area without the American people behind them.\n  I see exactly the parallel situation here. I certainly hope that the \nPresident will come to Congress and not use an opportunity when we \nmight be on recess to deploy troops to Bosnia. Not too long ago, before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, we had Secretary Christopher, \nSecretary Perry, and General Shalikashvili. I asked them the question, \nafter they defined the mission the United States has in Bosnia. The \nmission was twofold: First, to contain a civil war to the former \nYugoslavia, and second, to protect our position in NATO and the \nintegrity of NATO. I felt--and I think several other people who have \nspoken on this floor feel the same way--that those two missions are not \nworth the loss of one life.\n  Shortly before, General Rose--Michael Rose, who is the commanding \n\n[[Page S 17431]]\n  general of the U.N. forces in Bosnia--had made a statement that if \nAmerica gets involved and sends troops over to Bosnia, we will lose \nmore lives than we lost in the Persian Gulf war, which was 390. I asked \nthe question to all three of these top officials representing the \nPresident of the United States. I said, ``Is that mission worth the \nloss of 400 or more American lives?'' Secretary Perry said, ``Yes.'' \nSecretary Christopher said, ``Yes.'' General Shalikashvili said, \n``Yes.''\n  I think there is the honest difference of opinion, and we need to see \nhow that opinion is shared by the American people and by both Houses of \nCongress.\n  I certainly admonish the President if, during this period of time, if \nthe temptation comes to deploy troops, to think of the troops going \nover there without the American people behind them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17430-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A HISTORIC TIME\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is truly a historic time. Some of us \nhave been working on this idea of balancing the budget for many, many \nyears. When I look over and see the two very distinguished Senators \nfrom Nebraska, I want to remind them of another great Senator from \nNebraska in years past. His name is Carl Curtis.\n  Carl Curtis, back in 1972, came to me as a member of the Oklahoma \nState Senate and he said we want to get a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution passed. He said, of course if that happens we have to \nhave the States ratify it.\n  He had an idea. This came from the genius from the State of Nebraska, \nI say to the two Senators from Nebraska. He said we should preratify a \nbalanced budget amendment. Go to the States and get two-thirds of the \nStates or three-fourths of the States to preratify a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  I introduced a resolution in the Oklahoma State Senate. It passed. We \nbecame the first State to preratify a balanced budget amendment.\n  I remember the argument at that time. At that time the total national \ndebt was $400 billion and there were radio and TV ads and they were \nstacking hundred-dollar bills up--at that time I believe the Empire \nState Building was the tallest building--and they were stacking $100 \nbills up and they said that is the size of the national debt.\n  Of course we know today that was just a drop in the bucket. That is \nhow significant this thing is. That is how long many of us have been \nworking on it. This is truly the opportunity that we have to do it.\n  The Senator from Indiana just a few minutes ago made a statement that \nrang a bell. He said this is a moral issue. I think we should look at \nwhat we are faced with and what the President is faced with, his \ntemptation to veto this Balanced Budget Act of 1995, to look at it as a \nmoral issue.\n  I had occasion to be at the national prayer breakfast where we had \nseveral foreign visitors coming in, and one from Moldavia, a former \nSoviet State, came in very proud. He was smiling. He said: ``Senator \nInhofe, how much in America do you get to keep?''\n  I said, ``I am sorry, I do not understand what you are saying.''\n  He said, ``Well, how much in America do you have to give \nthe Government so you can keep something?''\n\n  Then I knew what he was talking about. He was talking about how much \ndo we pay in taxes. I gave an answer I would be embarrassed to share on \nthe floor because I am not sure how accurate it is, because he said in \nall pride they have a system over there in Moldavia where they work for \nabout 3 months and they have to pay the Government--he said, ``We pay \nthe government 80 percent of what we make,'' and then with the pride \nshowing through in this new-found democracy and free economy he thought \nthey had, he said, ``We get to keep 20 percent.''\n  We look at that in this country, how could they be so proud of being \nable to keep just 20 percent? But the fact remains that someone born \ntoday, such as my three grandchildren, if we do not do something to \nchange this course, then that person is going to have to pay 82 percent \nof their lifetime income just to support Government.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by sharing an exciting experience I \nhad a year ago yesterday, November 17, 1994. I was sworn in as a Member \nof the U.S. Senate. That happened to be my 60th birthday. I thought a \nyear ago, how in the world could I ever top this? What do you do for an \nencore? You are sworn in as a Member of the U.S. Senate on your 60th \nbirthday.\n  I say, what are we going to do for the 61st birthday? Yet, something \nmuch more exciting happened on my 61st birthday yesterday. We passed \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995. This is the act that is going to take \nour kids out of bondage.\n  As difficult as it is, and I heard it demagogued around this Chamber \nthat we will be slashing programs. We know we will not slash programs. \nWe know we will be increasing Medicare, for example, at a greater rate \nof growth than the President himself had suggested before.\n  I think clearly right now the ball is in the court of the President. \nWe have passed it in the House. We have passed it in the Senate. It is \nnow up to the American people, because we know one thing about our \nPresident, he does listen very carefully and watch the polls. If it \nbecomes very evident to him that this is the last opportunity we have \nto commit ourselves in America to a balanced budget, as I believe this \nis our last chance, then, I think he may not be doing as he said, and \nwill sign the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  I thank the Senators from Nebraska for allowing me to move ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his \nhistory lesson on Nebraska politics. My colleague from Nebraska and I \nknow a great deal about the history of politics in the State of \nNebraska.\n\n  I simply say to him one of the great experiences of my lifetime has \nbeen service in the U.S. Senate with Henry Bellmon, two times elected \nGovernor of his State. Some of the lessons that I have learned were at \nthe knee of Henry Bellmon when I came here as a freshman after two \nterms, 8 years as Governor of the State of Nebraska, so I also know \nsomething about the political history of that State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17431-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17431-S17432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been listening with great care to the \nspeeches that have been made here. I noticed on two occasions my \nRepublican colleagues have brought the name of Thomas Jefferson into \nthe discussions.\n  It was somewhat amusing to me. I do not know what position Thomas \nJefferson would take if he were on the floor of the U.S. Senate today, \nbut as the founder of the Democratic Party I suspect that he might not \nappreciate too much the Republicans invoking his name in the support of \nthe proposals that they are making.\n  Facetiously, it kind of reminded me, Mr. President, of my own dad. As \na very young lad, brought up in a very traditional Democratic household \nwith Franklin Roosevelt the new President of the United States, whom my \nmother and father and grandfather thought was an outstanding \nindividual, and I was thoroughly brought up in the Democratic \ntraditions.\n  After going to school one day, I came home and I told my dad we had \nstudied a President by the name of Abraham Lincoln, and I asked my dad \nwhat he thought of Abraham Lincoln. I did not tell dad that I \ndiscovered that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.\n  My dad said, ``Jim, Abraham Lincoln was one of the greatest \nPresidents that this Nation ever had or probably ever will have. He was \na truly outstanding American.''\n  I said, ``Yes, dad, but he was a Republican.''\n  Dad paused for a moment, and he said, ``Well, yes, Jim, but if \nAbraham Lincoln were alive today he would be a Democrat.''\n  Now, maybe that is the reverse of what my Republican colleagues are \narguing today. But at least I loved my dad and my dad said that to me \nin jest.\n  So when we start instituting the names of great leaders, Presidents, \npolitical leaders of the past, sometimes we take license that probably \nwe are not entitled to.\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about balancing the \nbudget here. I hear the Republican cry today and I think they are \ntalking about saving the children and saving the grandchildren. \n\n[[Page S 17432]]\n\n  Mr. President, although there may be some that can top me, I have \nthree children and I have eight grandchildren, and I am just as much \nconcerned about their futures as any other Member in this body. But to \nindicate, by inference at least, that if I do not go along with their \ndraconian budget proposals, that I think are unwise and unfair, I am \nnot concerned about my children and grandchildren, is just a little bit \ntoo much for me to swallow.\n  I was Governor of Nebraska for 8 years. As Governor, I balanced the \nbudget each and every year, as did my colleague, Senator Kerrey, from \nNebraska, who is on the floor, who followed me by a few years. He \nbalanced the budget each and every year. So I simply say, probably, \nfrom the standpoint of history, I was balancing budgets in government \nbefore some people had ever been elected to public office.\n  I follow that up by saying I think the record of this Senator has \nbeen very clear. All the time I have served the public of Nebraska and \nall the time I have had the opportunity to serve the people of Nebraska \nand the people of the Nation as a whole as a U.S. Senator, I have put \nforth many, many efforts, of which the latest was to vote for the \nRepublican-sponsored constitutional amendment to balance the budget in \n7 years. While I agree with that principle, that does not mean, nor \nshould anyone necessarily construe anything, just because I voted for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget that was primarily \nsupported and advanced by the Republicans with the help of nearly \nenough Democrats to pass it. I think my credentials of being a \ndedicated conservative with regard to fiscal policy are well \nestablished.\n  I, too, listened with great interest to the remarks made by the \nPresident of the United States today. I did not, strangely enough, come \naway from listening to those remarks with the same conclusions as my \nfriend and colleague from Indiana. I thought the President of the \nUnited States today laid it on the line. I may concede that possibly he \nmay have gone a little too far in his rhetoric, but compared with some \nof the rhetoric I have heard from the other side of the aisle on the \nSenate floor in the last few days, I would excuse the President for any \noversteps that he had made in that regard.\n  I think it is clear to say, though, that the President of the United \nStates said today that during his term of office he has essentially cut \nthe annual deficit in half. That is more than has been done for a long, \nlong time. So, at least in our criticisms of the present President of \nthe United States, for whatever reason, we should realize and recognize \nthat, under his leadership, we have cut the deficit and not continued \nto raise it.\n\n  I would simply point out, I want to share and be one of the \nworkhorses in cooperation, in full cooperation, when I can, with my \ncolleagues on the Republican side of the aisle to do something about \nthe skyrocketing national debt of the United States of America. I am \nfearful all too few of our citizens fully understand the difference \nbetween the annual deficit and the national debt, the latter being, of \ncourse, with additions each and every year, the shortfall we have been \ngoing through here, unfortunately, for a long, long time with regard to \nspending more than we take in.\n  In that regard, though, a little history might be in order. The last \nDemocratic President of the United States that we had before the \npresent occupant of that high office was former Governor Carter of the \nState of Georgia. I would cite--and I think the record will back me \nup--when President Carter left office the national debt of the United \nStates was under $1 trillion.\n  What happened in the intervening years when we had Republican \nPresidents of the United States? From 1980, when President Carter left \noffice and the debt was under $1 trillion, some 12 years later, when \nPresident Clinton took office, the national debt had skyrocketed \nfivefold, from under $1 trillion to $4.5 trillion.\n  Some would argue during most of that time there was Democratic \ncontrol of both Houses of the Congress, and that is true. But the facts \nof the matter are, had those Republican Presidents in the years 1980 to \n1992 stood up and exercised their veto, as this President has stood up \nstrongly and said he will exercise his veto, the national debt would \nnot have taken the jump and be as troublesome as it is today.\n  The problem we are in today is not all the responsibility of the \nDemocrats or all the responsibility of the Republicans. Certainly, the \nDemocrats, I think, are, by our traditions, by the record that we have \nestablished, as much concerned about the children of America in the \nfuture as anyone else. I happen to think you will see a growing portion \nof both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate--and hopefully in \nthe House of Representatives--anxious to come to some workable \nunderstanding, some framework where we can, indeed, balance the Federal \nbudget in 7 years.\n  I am continuing to work toward that end. Meanwhile, back at the \nranch, I hope once again we can contain our rhetoric just a little bit \nand give the leadership of the House and Senate an opportunity to come \nto some resolution of the crisis which faces us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17431-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17432-S17439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ANWR PROVISION OF THE RECONCILIATION BILL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with the passage of the conference \nreport on the reconciliation bill last night I thought there should be \nan explanation of the provision on the leasing of the coastal plain of \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration and \nproduction. The Senate and the House versions of the budget \nreconciliation had responsible provisions for the leasing of the area. \nHowever, there was a substantial difference in the approach and \nlanguage in the two measures. As chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee I thought it would be important to outline the \nintent of the conferees on the ANWR provision. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a section-by-section analysis which provides a detailed \ndescription of the ANWR provision, and other material, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Anaylsis\n\n     Section 5312. Short Title.\n       This section adopts the chapter from section 5201 of the \n     Senate bill. The purpose of this section is self-explanatory.\n     Section 5322. Definitions.\n       This section adopts the language of section 5203 of the \n     Senate bill with minor modifications. The intent of this \n     section is self-explanatory.\n     Section 5333. Leasing Program for Lands Within the Coastal \n         Plain.\n       Subsection 5333(a). Authorization.\n       Subsection 5333(a) adopts the language in section 5204(a) \n     of the Senate bill with minor modifications. This subsection \n     directs the Secretary and other appropriate Federal officers \n     and agencies to take such actions as are necessary to \n     establish and implement a competitive oil and gas leasing \n     program that will result in an environmentally sound program \n     for the exploration, development, and production of the oil \n     and gas resources of the Coastal Plain. In doing so, the \n     Secretary is to ensure receipt of the fair market value of \n     the mineral resources to be leased. The subsection requires \n     the Secretary to ensure that activities will result in ``no \n     significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their \n     habitat, and the environment.'' Operations on the Coastal \n     Plain must also be conducted using the ``best commercially \n     available technology for oil and gas exploration, development \n     and production.''\n       This ``environmental standard'' is based on the provisions \n     of Title VII of S. 1220, authored by Senator Johnston and \n     reported by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committees on June 5, 1991. This is the strongest standard \n     ever imposed on Federal oil and gas activities. The companion \n     provision of the House bill was based on the 1981 oil and gas \n     leasing authorization for the National Petroleum Reserve-\n     Alaska. Oil and gas leases have been issued under this \n     authorization and standard. It has worked well to protect the \n     environment, land and fish and wildlife on the North Slope.\n       In making its decision to authorize and direct an oil and \n     gas leasing program in the Coastal Plain, the Conferees find \n     that oil and gas activities authorized and conducted on the \n     Coastal Plain pursuant to the chapter so as to result in no \n     significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their \n     habitat, and the environment, are compatible with the major \n     purposes for which the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was \n     established. No further findings, decisions or reviews are \n     required to implement this Congressional authorization. The \n     Conferees specifically find that no further determination of \n     compatibility by the Secretary under the National Wildlife \n     Refuge System Administration Act is necessary to implement \n     this Congressional authorization and direction. The Conferees \n     believe the \n\n[[Page S 17433]]\n     provisions of the conference report in general are very clear on this \n     point. Subsection (c) of this section again reiterates this \n     policy and Congressional intent on this matter.\n       Subsection 5333(b). Repeal\n       Subsection 5333(b) adopts the language in section 5204(b) \n     of the Senate bill and is substantially similar to section \n     9002(f) of the House bill. This subsection repeals the \n     prohibitions and limitations on leasing and development of \n     oil and gas resources on lands within the Coastal Plain set \n     forth in section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act of 1980, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3143.\n       Subsection 5333(c). Compatibility\n       Subsection 5333(c) adopts the language in section 9002(c) \n     of the House bill. This subsection provides that the oil and \n     gas activities authorized by this chapter in the Coastal \n     Plain are compatible with the purposes for which the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge was established, and that no further \n     findings or decisions are required to implement this \n     determination. This subsection recognizes the wealth of study \n     and review that has already occurred pursuant to \n     environmental, natural resources, and other statutes. Based \n     on these reports and on the concrete experience of \n     environmental safety of on-shore development in neighboring \n     Prudhoe Bay and other large, producing oil and gas fields on \n     the North Slope of Alaska, the Conferees find that \n     development of the 1002 area is consistent with the \n     conservation purposes for which the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge was established. This subsection reflects the intent \n     of the Conferees that the activities authorized in this \n     chapter commence as soon as possible, without any intervening \n     delay that might be occasioned by further findings or \n     decisions. This provision is, of course, repetitive of the \n     purposes of this chapter as expressed in other sections.\n       Subsection 5333(d). Sole authority\n       Subsection 5333(d) adopts the language of subsection \n     5204(c) of the Senate bill with modifications. This \n     subsection provides that this chapter and the authorities \n     referenced therein shall be the sole authority for oil and \n     gas leasing on the Coastal Plain. This chapter directs a \n     specific program of environmentally responsible leasing for \n     the Coastal Plain. The Conferees intend that this program be \n     carried forward and implemented in good faith by the \n     Secretary and the Administration. The purposes and directives \n     of this chapter are not to be frustrated or delayed by other \n     provisions of existing law or the provisions of any treaty or \n     international agreement to which the United States is a \n     party. The subsection also explicitly provides that this \n     chapter does not preempt State and local regulatory \n     authority. The State of Alaska and the North Slope Borough \n     (NSB) have a long record of competent and environmentally \n     responsible regulation of oil and gas activities on the North \n     Slope. It is the Conferees clear intent that the State and \n     the NSB shall continue to exercise their existing regulatory \n     responsibilities to ensure good land use planning, \n     environmental protection, proper fish and wildlife \n     management, and continuation of important subsistence \n     activities.\n       Subsection 5333(e). Federal land\n       Subsection 5333(e) adopts the language of subsection \n     5204(d) of the Senate bill. This subsection provides that the \n     Coastal Plain shall be considered ``Federal land'' for \n     purposes of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of \n     1982 (FOGRMA). As provided in section 304 of FOGRMA, 30 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1753, that Act applies only to the extent it is \n     not inconsistent with this chapter. In particular, the \n     penalty provisions of sections 109-112 of the Act, 30 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1719-1722, are incorporated by reference by this \n     subsection and apply to the activities authorized by this \n     chapter.\n       Subsection 5333(f). Special areas\n       Subsection 5333(f) adopts the language of subsection \n     5207(d) of the Senate bill with modifications. This \n     subsection permits the Secretary to close up to 45,000 acres \n     of the Coastal Plain to leasing if, after consulting with the \n     State of Alaska and the North Slope Borough, he determines \n     that the areas to be closed require special management and \n     regulatory protection due to unique character or interest. \n     The Conference Committee contemplates that the Secretary may \n     use this provision to provide any special protection needed \n     for areas such as the Sadlerochit Hot Springs. The House bill \n     authorized 30,000 acres and the Senate 60,000 acres. This \n     provision is a compromise on the acreage. This subsection \n     permits the Secretary to issue oil and gas leases in such \n     Special Areas provided that the protection needed can be \n     attained by limiting surface use and occupancy, but \n     permitting the use of the very significant advances made in \n     recent years in horizontal drilling technology.\n       Subsection 5333(g). Limitation on closed areas\n       Subsection 5333(g) adopts language from subsection \n     9002(g)(3)(B) of the House bill with minor modifications. \n     This subsection provides that the Secretary's sole authority \n     to close lands within the Coastal Plain to oil and gas \n     leasing and to exploration, development, and production is \n     that set forth in this chapter. The language provides, and \n     the Conferees intend, that only the provisions of the chapter \n     may be used by the Secretary to close Coastal Plain lands to \n     the activities authorized by this chapter. No other provision \n     of law or international agreement may be used by the \n     Secretary for this purpose.\n       Subsection 5333(h). Conveyance\n       Subsection 5333(h) adopts language from subsection 9002(j) \n     of the House bill with minor modifications. The subsection \n     directs the Secretary to convey certain surface interests in \n     land to Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation in order to fulfill the \n     corporation's outstanding legal entitlement under section 12 \n     of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). The \n     Secretary must also convey the subsurface interests in these \n     lands to Arctic Slope Regional Corporation in order to \n     fulfill the August 9, 1983 agreement between Arctic Slope \n     Regional Corporation and the United States of America. These \n     lands have been previously identified and the United States \n     has a legal obligation to complete the transfer of chapter in \n     accordance with the provisions of ANCSA and the 1983 \n     Agreement. The conveyance of these lands will remove clouds \n     on title of lands and clarify land ownership patterns within \n     the Coastal Plain, maximizing federal revenues by ensuring \n     the availability of federal lands for leasing.\n     Section 5334. Rules and regulations\n       Subsection 5334(a). Promulgation.\n       Subsection 5334(a) adopts the language of section 5205(a) \n     of the Senate bill. This subsection provides that the \n     Secretary shall prescribe such rules and regulations as may \n     be necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of this \n     chapter, including rules and regulations relating to \n     protection of the environment and resources of the Coastal \n     Plain. Such rules and regulations shall be promulgated within \n     fourteen (14) months after the date of enactment of this \n     chapter.\n       In the formulation and promulgation of rules and \n     regulations under this chapter, the Conferees expect that the \n     Secretary will request and give due consideration to the \n     views of appropriate officials of the State of Alaska, the \n     North Slope Borough, and the Village of Kaktovik, and, where \n     consistent with this chapter and the laws and policy of the \n     United States, the views of others who have legitimate \n     interests in the activities authorized and the manner in \n     which they are carried out.\n       The Conferees also expect that the Secretary shall prepare \n     and promulgate regulations, lease terms, conditions, \n     restrictions, prohibitions, stipulations, and other measures \n     in a manner designed to ensure that the activities undertaken \n     in the Coastal Plain and authorized by the chapter are \n     conducted in a manner consistent with the purposes and the \n     environmental requirements of this chapter. In preparing and \n     promulgating regulations, lease terms, conditions, \n     restrictions, prohibitions, and stipulations under this \n     chapter, the Conferees recommend and expect that the \n     Secretary will consider:\n       (1) the environmental protection standards which governed \n     the initial Coastal Plain seismic exploration program (50 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 37.31-33);\n       (2) the land use stipulations for exploratory drilling on \n     the KIC-ASRC private lands which are set forth in Appendix 2 \n     of the August 9, 1983 Land Exchange Agreement between Arctic \n     Slope Regional Corporation and the United States; and\n       (3) the operational stipulations for Koniag ANWR Interest \n     lands contained in the draft Agreement between Koniag, Inc. \n     and the United States of America on file with the Secretary \n     of the Interior on December 1, 1987.\n       The Conferees further expect that the proposed regulations, \n     lease terms, conditions, restrictions, prohibitions, and \n     stipulations for the leasing program authorized by this \n     chapter will require compliance with applicable provisions of \n     Federal, State and local environmental law and may also \n     require compliance with:\n       (1) the safety and environmental mitigation measures set \n     forth in items 1 through 29 at pages 167 through 169 of the \n     ``Final Legislative Environmental Impact Statement'' (April \n     1987) on the Coastal Plain;\n       (2) seasonal limitations on exploration, development and \n     related activities, where reasonably necessary, to avoid \n     significant adverse effects during periods of concentrated \n     fish and wildlife breeding, denning, nesting, spawning and \n     migration;\n       (3) limitations on exploration activities, except for \n     surface geological studies, to the period between \n     approximately November 1 and May 1, and requirements that \n     exploration activities will be supported by ice roads, winter \n     trails with adequate snow cover, ice pads, ice airstrips, and \n     air transport methods, but that such exploration activities \n     may be permitted at other times if special circumstances \n     exist necessitating that exploration activities be conducted \n     at other times of the year and such exploration will have no \n     significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their \n     habitat, and the environment of the Coastal Plain;\n       (4) appropriate design safety and construction standards \n     for pipelines and any access and service roads to avoid--\n       (A) adverse effects upon the passage of migratory species, \n     including caribou; and\n       (B) adverse effects upon the flow of surface water by \n     requiring the use of culverts, bridges and other structural \n     devices;\n       (5) any reasonable prohibitions on public access and use on \n     pipeline access and service roads;\n       (6) appropriate reclamation and rehabilitation \n     requirements, consistent with the standards set forth in this \n     chapter, requiring the removal from the Coastal Plain of all \n     oil and gas development and production facilities, structures \n     and equipment upon completion of oil and gas production \n     operations, but that the Secretary may exempt from these \n\n[[Page S 17434]]\n     requirements those facilities, structures or equipment which the \n     Secretary determines would assist in the management of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and which are donated to the \n     United States for that purpose;\n       (7) appropriate and reasonable restrictions on access by \n     modes of transportation;\n       (8) appropriate and reasonable restrictions on necessary \n     sand and gravel extraction;\n       (9) consolidation of facility siting;\n       (10) appropriate and reasonable restrictions on use of \n     explosives;\n       (11) the avoidance, to the extent practicable, of springs, \n     streams and river systems; protection of natural surface \n     drainage patterns, wetlands, and riparian habitats; and \n     reasonable regulation of methods or techniques for developing \n     or transporting adequate supplies of water for exploratory \n     drilling;\n       (12) appropriate and reasonable restrictions on air \n     traffic-related activities which might disturb fish and \n     wildlife;\n       (13) accepted industry standards for the treatment and \n     disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes, solid wastes, reserve \n     pit fluids, drilling muds and cuttings, if any, and domestic \n     wastewater, in accordance with applicable Federal and State \n     environmental law;\n       (14) applicable fuel storage and oil spill contingency \n     planning;\n       (15) reasonable research, monitoring and reporting \n     requirements;\n       (16) appropriate field crew environmental briefings;\n       (17) avoidance of any reasonably anticipated significant \n     adverse effects upon subsistence hunting, fishing, and \n     trapping by subsistence users;\n       (18) applicable air and water quality standards;\n       (19) appropriate seasonal and safety zone designations \n     around oil and gas well sites within which subsistence \n     hunting and trapping would be limited;\n       (20) reasonable stipulations for protection of cultural and \n     archeological resources; and\n       (21) other protective environmental stipulations, \n     restrictions, terms, and conditions which are reasonably \n     deemed necessary by the Secretary and based upon prior \n     regulatory requirements.\n       The Conference Committee further expects that the \n     regulations will also provide for appropriate plans to \n     govern, guide, and direct the siting and construction of \n     facilities for the exploration, development, production, and \n     transportation of Coastal Plain oil and gas resources. Any \n     such plans shall have the following objectives:\n       (1) avoiding unnecessary duplication of facilities and \n     activities;\n       (2) encouraging consolidation of common facilities and \n     activities;\n       (3) locating or confining facilities and activities to \n     areas which will minimize impact on fish and wildlife, their \n     habitat, and the environment;\n       (4) utilizing existing facilities wherever practicable; and\n       (5) enhancing compatibility between wildlife values and \n     development activities.\n       Subsection 5334(b). Revision of regulations\n       Subsection 5334(b) adopts the language of subsection \n     5205(b) of the Senate bill. This subsection provides that the \n     Secretary shall periodically review and, where and if \n     appropriate, revise the rules and regulations to reflect new \n     and significant data and information.\n     Section 5335. Adequacy of the Department of the Interior's \n         legislative environmental impact statement\n       Section 5335 adopts language from section 5206 of the \n     Senate bill with modifications. This section provides that \n     the ``Final Legislative Environmental Impact Statement'' \n     (April 1987) on the Coastal Plain, prepared by the Department \n     of the Interior pursuant to section 1002 of the ANILCA and \n     section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of \n     1969 (NEPA), is found by the Congress to be adequate to \n     satisfy the legal and procedural requirements under NEPA with \n     respect to actions authorized to be taken by the Secretary to \n     develop and promulgate the regulations for the establishment \n     of the leasing program, to conduct the first lease sale \n     authorized by the chapter, and, in addition, to grant all \n     rights-of-way and easements to carry out the purposes of this \n     chapter.\n       Except as provided in this section, nothing in this chapter \n     shall be considered or construed as otherwise limiting or \n     affecting in any way the applicability of section 102(2)(C) \n     of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to other \n     phases of exploration, development and production and related \n     activities conducted under or associated with the leasing \n     program authorized by this chapter.\n     Section 5336.

It is the \n     intent of the conferees that the findings of any antitrust \n     review shall not create any immunity or defenses in any \n     private or government antitrust actions.\n       Subsection 5337(e). Definitions\n       Subsection 5337(e) adopts language from subsection 13106(e) \n     of the Senate bill.

Lease terms and conditions\n       Section 5338 adopts language from section 5209 of the \n     Senate bill with modifications based on the House bill. \n     Paragraph (1) provides that lease tracts shall consist of a \n     compact area not to exceed 5,760 acres, or 9 surveyed or \n     protracted sections, whichever is larger.\n       Paragraph (2) provides that oil and gas leases shall be for \n     an initial period of ten years and shall be extended for so \n     long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying \n     quantities from the lease or unit area to which the lease is \n     committed or for so long as drilling or reworking operations, \n     in accordance with law and as approved by the Secretary, are \n     conducted on the lease or unit area.\n       Paragraph (3) provides that leases shall require the \n     payment of royalty of not less than 12\\1/2\\ per centum in \n     amount or value of the production removed or sold from the \n     lease or unit area.\n       Paragraph (4) provides that exploration activities pursuant \n     to any lease issued or maintained under this chapter shall be \n     conducted in accordance with an exploration plan or a \n     revision of such plan approved by the Secretary. Prior to \n     commencing exploration pursuant to any oil and gas lease \n     issued or maintained under this chapter, the holder of the \n     lease will submit an exploration plan to the Secretary for \n     approval. The Secretary shall act expeditiously in reviewing \n     such plans. Such plan may apply to more than one lease held \n     by a lessee in any region of the Coastal Plain, or by a group \n     of \n\n[[Page S 17435]]\n     lessees acting under a unitization, pooling, or drilling agreement, and \n     shall be approved by the Secretary if the Secretary finds \n     that such plan is consistent with the provisions of this \n     chapter and other applicable law.\n       Paragraph (5) requires that all development and production \n     pursuant to a lease issued or maintained pursuant to a lease \n     issued or maintained pursuant to this chapter shall be \n     conducted in accordance with an approved development and \n     production plan. Such plans may apply to more than one lease \n     held by a lessee in any region of the Coastal Plain, or by a \n     group of lessees acting under a unitization, pooling, or \n     drilling agreement, and shall be approved by the Secretary if \n     the Secretary finds that such plan is consistent with the \n     provisions of this chapter and other applicable law.\n       The Conferees further expect that the Secretary, in the \n     regulations promulgated pursuant to the chapter, will require \n     lessees to include in any exploration or development plans \n     submitted, appropriate and relevant information concerning \n     the plan.\n       The Conferees also expect that the Secretary will provide \n     in the regulations for the expeditious consideration of any \n     exploration or development plans submitted. After an \n     exploration or development and production plan is submitted \n     for approval, the regulations should provide that the \n     Secretary shall promptly publish notice of the submission and \n     availability of the text of the proposed plan in the Federal \n     Register and a newspaper of general circulation in the State \n     of Alaska and provide an opportunity for written public \n     comment. The Conferees expect that, within one hundred twenty \n     days after receiving an exploration or development and \n     production plan, the Secretary will determine, after taking \n     into account any comments received, whether the activities \n     proposed in the plan are consistent with this chapter and \n     other applicable provisions of Federal law. The Secretary, as \n     a condition of approving any plan under this section may \n     require modifications to the plan that the Secretary \n     determines necessary to make the plan consistent with this \n     chapter. The Secretary may assess reasonable fees or charges \n     for the reimbursement of all necessary and reasonable costs \n     associated with reviewing the plan and monitoring its \n     implementation. The Secretary may also require such periodic \n     reports regarding the carrying out of the drilling and \n     related activities.\n       Paragraph (6) provides for the posting of bond by lessees \n     as required by section 13108.\n       Paragraph (7) provides that the Secretary may close, on a \n     limited seasonal basis, portions of the Coastal Plain to \n     protect calving during years caribou and other species use \n     such areas.\n       Paragraph (8) provides that an oil and gas lease shall \n     contain such rental and other reasonable fees as the \n     Secretary may prescribe at the time of offering the area for \n     lease.\n       Paragraph (9) provides that the Secretary may direct or \n     assent to the suspension of operations and production under \n     any lease granted under the terms of the chapter in the \n     interest of conservation of the resource or where there is no \n     available system to transport the resource. If such a \n     suspension is directed or assented to by the Secretary, any \n     payment of rental prescribed by such lease shall be suspended \n     during such period of suspension of operations and \n     production, and the term of the lease shall be extended by \n     adding any such suspension period thereto.\n       Paragraph (10) provides that whenever the owner of a \n     nonproducing lease fails to comply with any of the provisions \n     of the chapter, or of any applicable provision of Federal or \n     State environmental law, or of the lease, or of any \n     regulation issued under this chapter, the lease may be \n     canceled by the Secretary if the default continues for a \n     period of more than thirty (30) days after mailing of notice \n     by registered letter to the lease owner at the lease owner's \n     record post office address.\n       Paragraph (11) provides that whenever the owner of any \n     producing lease fails to comply with any of the provisions of \n     the chapter, or of any applicable provision of Federal or \n     State environmental law, or of the lease, or of any \n     regulation issued under this chapter, the lease may be \n     forfeited and canceled by any appropriate proceeding brought \n     by the Secretary in any United States district court having \n     jurisdiction under the provisions of this chapter.\n       Paragraph (12) provides that cancellation of a lease under \n     this chapter shall in no way release the owner of the lease \n     from the obligation to provide for reclamation of the lease \n     site or other area disturbed by the lessees activities.\n       Paragraph (13) provides that the lessee may, at the \n     discretion of the Secretary, be permitted at any time to make \n     written relinquishment of all rights under any lease issued \n     pursuant to this chapter. The Secretary shall accept the \n     relinquishment by the lessee of any lease issued under this \n     chapter where there has not been surface disturbance on the \n     lands covered by the lease.\n       Paragraph (14) provides that, for the purpose of conserving \n     the natural resources of any oil or gas pool, field, or like \n     area, or any part thereof, and in order to avoid the \n     unnecessary duplication of facilities, to protect the \n     environment of the Coastal Plain, and to protect correlative \n     rights, the Secretary shall require, to the greatest extent \n     practicable, that lessee unite with each other in \n     collectively adopting and operating under a cooperative or \n     unit plan of development for operation of such pool, field, \n     or like area, or any part thereof. The Secretary is also \n     authorized and directed to enter into such agreements as are \n     necessary or appropriate for the protection of the United \n     States against drainage.\n       Paragraph (15) requires that the holder of a lease or \n     leases on lands within the Coastal Plain shall be fully \n     responsible and liable for the reclamation of any lands \n     within the Coastal Plain and any other Federal lands \n     adversely affected in connection with exploration, \n     development, or transportation activities on a lease within \n     the Coastal Plain by the holder of a lease or as a result of \n     activities conducted on the lease by any of the leaseholder's \n     subcontractors or agents.\n       Paragraph (16) provides that the holder of a lease may not \n     delegate or convey, by contract or otherwise, this \n     reclamation responsibility and liability to another party \n     without the express written approval of the Secretary.\n       Paragraph (17) provides that the leases issued pursuant to \n     this chapter shall include the standard of reclamation of \n     lands required to be reclaimed under this chapter, to a \n     condition capable of supporting the uses which the lands were \n     capable of supporting prior to any exploration, development, \n     or production activities, or upon application by the lessee, \n     to a higher or better use as approved by the Secretary. In \n     the case of roads, drill pads and other gravel-foundation \n     structures, reclamation and restoration shall be to a \n     condition as closely approximating the original condition of \n     such lands as is feasible using the best commercially \n     available technology. Reclamation of lands shall be conducted \n     in a manner that will not itself impair or cause significant \n     adverse effects on fish or wildlife, their habitat, \n     subsistence uses or the environment.\n       Paragraph (18) requires that the leases issued pursuant to \n     this chapter contain terms and conditions relating to \n     protection of fish and wildlife, their habitat, subsistence \n     uses and the environment to avoid any significant adverse \n     effects.\n       Paragraph (19) provides that the leaseholder, its agents, \n     and its contractors use their best efforts to provide a fair \n     share, as determined by the level of obligation described in \n     the 1974 agreement implementing section 29 of the Federal \n     Agreement and Grant of Right of Way for the Operation of the \n     Trans-Alaska Pipeline, of employment and contracting for \n     Alaska Natives and Alaska Native Corporations from throughout \n     the State.\n       The Conference Committee members are fully aware of the \n     Department of the Interior's failure to monitor and enforce \n     section 29 of the 1974 Right of Way Agreement for TAPS. The \n     Committee intends that the Department as well as lessees use \n     all best efforts to enforce and comply with this statutory \n     provision and directed lease term and condition of leases and \n     other Coastal Plain authorizations.\n       Paragraph (20) provides that the leases issued pursuant to \n     this chapter shall contain such other provisions as the \n     Secretary determines necessary to ensure compliance with the \n     provisions of this chapter and the regulations issued \n     thereunder.\n     Section 5339.

Section 5344 provides that \n     the distribution of new revenues (bonus bids, royalty and \n     rental, but not corporate or other income tax) derived from \n     leasing the oil and gas resources of the Coastal Plain shall \n     be equally divided between the United States Treasury and the \n     State of Alaska. Section 5344 provides that: ``Fifty percent \n     of all revenues . . . shall be paid by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury semiannually to the State of Alaska. . . .'' \n     (Section 5344(a)(2)). There has been some concern expressed \n     about the change in law regarding the distribution of \n     revenues derived from oil and gas leases on Coastal Plain. \n     The following provides information regarding the distribution \n     of the revenues from the leasing of the Coastal Plain.\n       Following the issuance of the 1987 Department of the \n     Interior Report and LEIS pursuant to which the then Secretary \n     recommended opening the Coastal Plain to an environmentally \n     responsible program of oil and gas leasing, some opponents of \n     leasing have alleged that the State might receive 90 percent, \n     rather than 50 percent, of such revenues. This allegation is \n     based upon a provision of the 1958 Alaska Statehood Act which \n     granted Alaska 90 percent of revenues derived from oil and \n     gas resources located on public lands in Alaska. After this \n     contention was first made, Senator Johnston, then Chairman of \n     the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, requested \n     the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior to prepare a \n     legal memorandum and opinion on the legal validity of this \n     contention. The Solicitor's legal opinion, reprinted as \n     Appendix A following this statement, was completed and \n     transmitted to Senator Johnston and the Congress on November \n     4, 1987. The Solicitor's legal memorandum and opinion found \n     that under the Property Clause of the United States \n     Constitution, the Congress has full authority to determine \n     the future distributions of revenues derived from oil and gas \n     leases on public lands generally and on the Coastal Plain in \n     particular.\n       Finally, when this contention was made again in recent \n     weeks during this Congress, Governor Tony Knowle's of Alaska \n     submitted a letter to the Congress in which he volunteered to \n     submit legislation to the State Legislature to amend the \n     Statehood Compact to make clear that the State would agree to \n     accept only 50 percent of Coastal Plain oil and gas lease \n     revenues. Ms. Drue Pearce, President of Alaska State Senate, \n     and Ms. Gail Phillips, Speaker of Alaska Legislature's House \n     of Representatives, supported Governor Knowles position and, \n     again, in letters to the Congress pledged their best efforts \n     to secure the Legislature's enactment of such legislation. \n     Copies of these letters are attached as Appendix B.\n       Subsection 5344(a). Distribution of revenues\n       Paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection 5344(a), similar to \n     paragraph (1) of subsection 9002(I) of the House bill, \n     provide that notwithstanding any other provision of law, all \n     revenues received from competitive bids, sales, bonuses, \n     royalties, rents, fees, or interest derived from the leasing \n     of oil and gas resources on Federal lands within the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska shall be distributed to the \n     U.S. Treasury, with 50 percent of such revenues to be \n     distributed to the State of Alaska on a semiannual basis.\n       Subparagraph (3)(A) generally follows the last clause of \n     subsection 5215(a) of the Senate bill. It requires that the \n     Secretary of the Treasury monitor the total amount of bonus \n     bid revenue deposited into the Treasury from oil and gas \n     leases issued under the authority of this chapter. All monies \n     deposited in the Treasury in excess of $2,600,000,000 shall \n     be distributed as follows: 50 per centum to the State of \n     Alaska and 50 per centum into a special fund established in \n     the Treasury of the United States known as the ``National \n     Park, Refuge and Fish and Wildlife Renewal and Protection \n     Fund'' (``Renewal Fund''). While the terminology for the \n     Renewal Fund comes from subsection 5215(a) of the Senate \n     bill, the Renewal Fund is also intended to incorporate the \n     purposes of the National Endowment for Fish and Wildlife that \n     would have been established under subsection 9002(n), \n     paragraph (1) of the House bill.\n       Subparagraph (3)(B) is similar to subsection 9002(n), \n     subparagraph (2)(B) of the House bill. It caps deposits into \n     the Renewal Fund at $250,000,000. Subparagraph (2)(C) \n     provides that deposits into the Renewal Fund shall remain \n     available until expended and requires the Secretary to \n     develop procedures for the use of the Fund to ensure \n     accountability and demonstrable results.\n       Subsection 5344(b). Use of renewal fund\n       Subsection 5344(b) explains the purposes for which the \n     Renewal Fund shall be used. These purposes are drawn from \n     subsection 5215(b) of the Senate bill as well as subsection \n     9002(n)(4) of the House bill. While subsection 5344(b) would \n     not establish a Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission as \n     provided for under subsection 9002(n)(3) of the House bill, \n     the conferees intend that the Secretary would fulfill \n     essentially the same fish and wildlife conservation purposes \n     of the Commission under subsection 5344(b), as well as other \n     purposes. Specifically, subsection 5344(b) provides for a \n     distribution of Renewal Fund resources as follows: (1) 25 \n     percent for the National Park System, similar to requirements \n     of the Senate language; (2) 25 percent for the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System, similar to requirements of the Senate \n     language; (3) 25 percent for the acquisition of privately \n     held habitat of threatened or endangered species, similar to \n     requirements of the House language; and (4) 25 percent for \n     wetlands projects under the North American Wetlands \n     Conservation Act, similar to the House language.\n       Subsection 5344(c). Community assistance\n       Subsection 5344(c) mostly follows subsection 9002(l) of the \n     House bill. This subsection would establish a Community \n     Assistance Fund for distribution, upon application, of funds \n     to organized boroughs, other municipal subdivisions of the \n     State of Alaska, and recognized Indian Reorganization Act \n     entities which are directly impacted by the exploration and \n     production of oil and gas on the Coastal Plain authorized by \n     this chapter. These organizations, in turn, shall use the \n     funding to provide public and social services. The Secretary \n     shall have at his or her disposal $30,000,000, and $5,000,000 \n     or less may be distributed in grant form in any given year.\n       The Conferees anticipate that the services provided by \n     local and Native organizations would likely bear some \n     relation to the activities authorized by this chapter. \n     However, the Conferees have chosen not to limit the purposes \n     for which a local or Native organization may devote Fund \n     proceeds. Thus, a local or Native organization could provide \n     services such as a transportation shuttle, a job training and \n     placement service, or a conservation program, which would be \n     directly related to the activities authorized by this \n     chapter. Nevertheless, out of deference to local \n     decisionmakers, subsection 5344(c) would not prohibit a local \n     or Native program addressing immunization, education, or \n     another service less directly related to oil and gas leasing \n     on the Coastal Plain.\n       Subsection 5344(c) allows funds to be distributed only to \n     groups ``directly'' impacted by the activities authorized \n     under this chapter. The choice of the word ``directly'' is a \n     deliberate effort to provide funds only to those groups with \n     a direct nexis to Coastal Plain activities. The subsection \n     does not specify a bright-line test of physical proximity, \n     dollar impact, or any other criterion, but any group seeking \n     a grant from the Community Assistance fund must demonstrate \n     an actual, ``direct'' impact. The conferees anticipate that \n     demonstration of a ``direct'' impact would be similar to the \n     demonstration necessary to obtain standing in a federal \n     court--there must be an actual impact, clearly traceable to \n     the activities authorized by this chapter. \n\n[[Page S 17437]]\n\n       The Conferees expect that funds will be distributed to \n     communities and groups representing the Inupiat Eskimo people \n     on Alaska's North Slope who will clearly be impacted by \n     exploration and development activities in the Coastal Plain. \n     The Conferees anticipate that funds may also be made \n     available to communities or organizations representing the \n     Gwich'in Indians in the event that these representatives \n     demonstrate an impact from activities in the Coastal Plain.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Solicitor,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 1987.\n     M-36957.\n     CLC.SO.0001.\n     Memorandum to: Secretary.\n     From: Solicitor.\n     Subject: Division of Receipts from Oil and Gas Development \n         from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       You have asked whether the Alaska Statehood Act (ASA), Pub. \n     L. 85-508, 72 Stat. 339 (1958), in any way limits Congress' \n     ability to enact a revenue distribution scheme for oil and \n     gas revenues from new leases in federal wildlife refuges that \n     is different from the revenue distribution scheme set out in \n     the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA), 30 U.S.C. Sec. 181. \n     Your question refers specifically to the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). The MLA formula provides for the \n     distribution to Alaska (the State) of 90 percent of revenues \n     received by the United States from oil and gas leasing on \n     public lands within the State. For the reasons discussed \n     below, we conclude that the ASA in no way restricts Congress \n     to the distribution scheme set out in the MLA when it enacts \n     legislation to provide for distribution of revenues from new \n     mineral leases in federal wildlife refuges.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       At issue is the authority of Congress to determine the \n     distribution of revenues from oil and gas leases on public \n     lands in Alaska, and, specifically, from lands that are part \n     of the National Wildlife Refuge System. At present, a \n     distinction is made between revenues from acquired lands and \n     those from reserved public domain refuge lands. Federal oil \n     and gas revenues from acquired lands within refuges are \n     distributed according to a schedule set out in the Wildlife \n     Refuge Revenue Sharing Act (WRRSA) \\1\\ which allots 25 \n     percent to the county in which the refuge is located and 75 \n     percent to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, while \n     federal revenues from reserved public domain lands within \n     refuges are distributed in accordance with the Mineral \n     Leasing Act,\\2\\ which allots 50 percent to the states, except \n     Alaska, in which the refuge is located, 40 percent to the \n     Reclamation Fund, and 10 percent to miscellaneous receipts in \n     the U.S. Treasury. Alaska receives 90 percent of MLA lease \n     revenues derived from within the State. The remaining 10 \n     percent goes to miscellaneous receipts in the U.S. \n     Treasury. As the refuge currently at issue, ANWR, is on \n     reserved public domain land, we will focus on the \n     provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act in analyzing the \n     issue presented to us.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The distribution system set out in the Mineral Leasing Act \n     was extended to Alaska in section 28(b) of the Alaska \n     Statehood Act, as follows:\n       (b) Section 35 of the Act entitled ``An Act to promote the \n     mining of coal, phosphate, oil, shale, gas and sodium on the \n     public domain'', approved February 25, 1920, as amended (30 \n     U.S.C. 191), is hereby amended by inserting immediately \n     before the colon preceding the first proviso thereof the \n     following:'', and of those from Alaska 52\\1/2\\ per centum \n     thereof shall be paid to the State of Alaska for disposition \n     by the legislature thereof.''\n       After amendment, section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act read \n     as follows:\n       All money received from sales, bonuses, royalties, and \n     rentals of public lands under the provisions of sections 181-\n     184, 185-188, 189-192, 193, 194, 201, 202-209, 211-214, 223, \n     224-226, 226d-229a, 241, 251, and 261-263 of this title shall \n     be paid into the Treasury of the United States; 37\\1/2\\ per \n     centum thereof shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     as soon as practicable after December 31 and June 30 of each \n     year to the State within the boundaries of which the leased \n     lands or deposits are or were located; said moneys to be used \n     by such State or subdivisions thereof for the construction \n     and maintenance of public roads or for the support of public \n     schools or other public educational institutions, as the \n     legislature of the State may direct; and, excepting those \n     from Alaska, 52\\1/2\\ per centum thereof shall be paid into, \n     reserved and appropriated, as part of the reclamation fund \n     created by sections 372, 373, 381, 383, 391, 392, 411, 416, \n     419, 421, 431, 432, 434, 439, 461, 491, and 498 of Title 43, \n     and of those from Alaska 52\\1/2\\ per centum thereof shall be \n     paid to the State of Alaska for disposition by the \n     legislature thereof: Provided, That all moneys which may \n     accrue to the United States under the provisions of sections \n     181-184, 185-188, 189-192, 193, 194, 201, 202-209, 211-214, \n     223, 224-226, 226d-229a, 241, 251, and 261-263 of this title \n     from lands within the naval petroleum reserves shall be \n     deposited in the Treasury as ``miscellaneous receipts'', as \n     provided by section 524 of Title 34. All moneys received \n     under the provisions of sections 181-184, 185-188, 189-192, \n     193, 194, 201, 202-209, 211-214, 223, 224-226, 226d-229a, \n     241, 251, and 261-263 of this title not otherwise disposed of \n     by this section shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts. \n     (Feb. 25, 1920, ch. 85, Sec. 35, 41 Stat. 450; May 27, 1947, \n     ch. 83, 61 Stat. 119; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. . . . 282; July 7, \n     1958, Pub. L. 85-508, Sec. Sec. 6(k), 28(b), 72 Stat. 343, \n     351.) \\3\\ (Emphasis added.)\n       The United States Senate is presently considering a bill, \n     S. 735, that would change the distribution system as applied \n     to revenues derived from oil and gas leasing within units of \n     the National Wildlife Refuge System. Specifically, the bill \n     provides that 50 percent of such revenues would go to the \n     state, 25 percent to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and \n     25 percent to the federal government. If the bill passes, it \n     will apply to all leases in any wildlife refuge issued after \n     enactment, but it is expected that the refuge most \n     immediately affected will be ANWR.\n       In recent testimony on S. 735 before the Senate Energy and \n     Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands, National \n     Parks and Forests, and in documents submitted to us in \n     connection with our consideration of this issue, \n     representatives of the State of Alaska have argued that \n     Congress cannot legally enact a revenue distribution formula \n     that provides Alaska less than 90 percent of mineral leasing \n     revenues from the leasing of public lands in Alaska without \n     the consent of the State.\\4\\\n\n\n                                analysis\n\n       The enactment of legislation establishing a distribution \n     formula for federal revenues obtained from the leasing of \n     federally owned minerals falls within the power of Congress \n     enumerated in the Property Clause of the Constitution:\n       The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all \n     needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or \n     other Property belonging to the United States. * * *\n\n     U.S. Constitution, art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2.\n       The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 is an example of the use of \n     this power. Once having enacted such a system of mineral \n     leasing, Congress has the authority under the Property Clause \n     to change the distribution schedule set up with regard to the \n     revenues resulting from those leases. As indicated in United \n     States v. Locke, 471 U.S.S. 84, 104 (1985), ``[t]he United \n     States, as owner of the underlying fee title to the public \n     domain, maintains broad powers over the terms and conditions \n     upon which the public lands can be used, leased, and \n     acquired,'' In the Locke case, the Supreme Court was called \n     upon to determine the constitutionality of a legislative \n     provision that subjected holders of unpatented mining claims \n     to forfeiture of those claims if they failed to comply with \n     the annual filing requirements of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1701. In holding the \n     regulation to be constitutional, the Supreme Court indicated \n     that ``[c]laimants thus must take their mineral interests \n     with the knowledge that the Government retains substantial \n     regulatory power over those interests.'' [The Court \n     compared this holding to Energy Resources Group, Inc. v. \n     Kansas Power and Light Co., 459 U.S. 400 (1983), dealing \n     with the impairment of contractual relations.] Id. at \n     105.\\5\\\n       Against this background, Alaska must sustain a heavy burden \n     to show that Congress lacks the authority under the Property \n     Clause to change the distribution system for federal revenues \n     derived from oil and gas leases on federal lands, including \n     wildlife refuges.\n       Alaska's primary \\6\\ argument against Congress' power to \n     enact a distribution formula for receipts from the lease of \n     refugee minerals that is different from the formula set out \n     in the MLA is that the MLA distribution scheme was \n     incorporated into and made a part of the compact of \n     statehood. According to that argument, the MLA was so \n     incorporated by virtue of the inclusion in the Alaska \n     Statehood Act of a section amending the MLA to apply it to \n     Alaska. The State argues that Congress made the distribution \n     formula part of the compact as a vehicle granting Alaska a \n     permanent property interest in mineral revenues from public \n     lands.\\7\\ According to the argument, as a grant made to the \n     State in the compact of statehood, the property interest may \n     not be changed. Thus the State argues that the distribution \n     system comes within the narrow confines of Beecher v. \n     Wetherby, 95 U.S. (5 Otto) 517 (1877), a case holding that a \n     grant made in a statehood act is an ``unalterable condition \n     of the admission [of the State into the Union], binding upon \n     the United States.''\n       We do not dispute that a grant made in a statehood act may \n     be unalterable. However, we believe that in this instance, \n     Alaska paints too broadly the compact of statehood. Rather \n     than being a grant incorporated into that compact, the \n     distribution system applied to Alaska in section 28(b) is \n     nothing more than an exercise of Congress' powers under the \n     Property Clause to dispose of and make needful rules for the \n     public's property.\n       Judicial precedent instructs that not every provision in a \n     statehood act is an irrevocable grant to the state. Thus, we \n     must look carefully at the provisions of the ASA to ascertain \n     what must be included within the terms of its statehood \n     compact with the United States. The Supreme Court has had \n     occasion to consider the different kinds of authority \n     Congress may exercise in passing a statehood act and what \n     provisions of a statehood act may properly be considered part \n     of the compact entered into at statehood. In Coyle v. \n     Oklahoma, 221 U.S. 559 (1911), the Court held \n\n[[Page S 17438]]\n     that certain conditions contained in Oklahoma's statehood act were not \n     part of the compact of statehood. The Supreme Court pointed \n     out that in admitting a new state into the Union, Congress \n     may simultaneously exercise other of its powers, such as the \n     power to regulate commerce or the power ``to make all needful \n     rules and regulations respecting the territory of other \n     property of the United States'' (citing Pollard's Lessee v. \n     Hagan, How. 212 (1845)). The Supreme Court concluded that \n     provisions contained in a statehood act that are enacted \n     under one of these other powers, ``cannot operate as a \n     contract between the parties, but are binding as law.'' \n     Coyle, at 571. The Court then went on to say:\n       It may well happen that Congress should embrace in an \n     enactment introducing a new state into the Union legislation \n     intended as a regulation of commerce among the states, or \n     with Indian tribes situated within the limits of such new \n     state, or regulations touching the sole care and disposition \n     of the public lands or reservations therein, which might be \n     upheld as legislation within the sphere of the plain power of \n     Congress. But in every such case such legislation would \n     derive its force not from any agreement or compact with the \n     proposed new state, nor by reason of its acceptance of such \n     enactment as a term of admission, but solely because the \n     power of Congress extended to the subject.* * *\n\n     Id, at 574.\\8\\\n       Section 28 of the ASA is just such an enactment. It is \n     based on Congress' power under the Property Clause to \n     administer federal property interests. The MLA itself was \n     similarly based, and the amendment to it contained in the ASA \n     cannot be used to alter its origins or elevate it to compact \n     status so that it cannot be amended.\n       Section 28 of the ASA, on its face, does not purport to be \n     either a part of the compact between the United States and to \n     the State of Alaska or a permanent grant of mineral revenues \n     to the State. In fact, section 28 did nothing more than amend \n     a statute that had already been in existence for over 30 \n     years before the ASA was enacted and had long been applied to \n     federal lands in all other states.\\9\\ Further, section 28 is \n     but one of several sections added at the end of the ASA to \n     amend existing law to apply it specifically to Alaska. \n     Section 28(b) in particular was a necessary and timely \n     expedient because Congress wanted to extend to and adapt for \n     Alaska the revenue distribution system already in place in \n     other states.\n       Futher, section 28(b) is very limited in that it is \n     applicable only to lands leased under the MLA, not to other \n     federally owned lands leased under other authority. For \n     example, section 35 of the MLA gave Alaska no share of \n     receipts from the navel petroleum reserves, and Naval \n     Petroleum Reserve No. 4 (now NPR-A), constituting roughly 23 \n     million acres in Alaska, was separately addressed in Section \n     11 of the ASA, This separate treatment indicates that \n     Congress did not intend, as argued by the State, that the MLA \n     be a vehicle for an irrevocable 90 percent interest in \n     revenues from all federal mineral lands.\\10\\ This point is \n     further supported by a 1981Supreme Court decision in which \n     the Court found that a 1964 amendment to the Wildlife Refuge \n     Revenue sharing Act, which included mineral revenues within \n     its 75/25 distribution schedule, was properly applied to oil \n     and gas leasing revenues from wildlife refuges on acquired \n     federal lands in Alaska Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259 \n     (1981).\\11\\\n       Further, section 28 of the ASA did not purport to grant \n     Alaska a 90 percent royalty interest in the minerals \n     themselves. Rather, the section amended an entirely separate \n     statute, the MLA, which itself does not grant the state any \n     interest in minerals, but merely prescribes a formula for the \n     distribution of certain federal oil and gas revenues. We have \n     previously considered the issue of what interest states have \n     in federal oil and gas under the the MLA and concluded that \n     they have no economic interest in the oil in place. As stated \n     in Solicitor's Opinion M-36929, 87 I.D. 661, at 664, 665 \n     (1980):\n       States have no pecuniary or legal interest in federally \n     owned oil until that oil is leased, extracted and the royalty \n     payments are made to the federal government. In sum, sec. 35 \n     simply provides for the disposition of federal royalty \n     revenue; it does not confer on states an economic interest in \n     the oil in place. * * *\n       Therefore, under the amendment of the MLA contained in the \n     ASA, the State receives only a periodic distribution of 90 \n     percent of the revenues produced each year from the leasing \n     and production of minerals under the MLA. Alaska receives no \n     revenues under the MLA unit such revenues are produced, and \n     more importantly, receives its MLA royalty distribution only \n     by virtue of the provisions of the MLA, not by virtue of the \n     ASA.\\12\\\n       Our conclusion must be, then, that Congress was using the \n     amendment to the MLA contained in section 38 not as a vehicle \n     for granting the state a perpetual 90 percent interest in \n     federal minerals in Alaska, but rather as an exercise of its \n     authority under the Property Clause to dispose of and make \n     needful rules for certain federal property, in this case, to \n     set out the distribution scheme applicable to minerals leased \n     under the MLA.\n       Our view that the MLA was not incorporated into the compact \n     between the State and the federal government and that it does \n     not amount to a permanent grant is supported by examples of \n     cases in which Congress has exorcized its Property Clasuse \n     powers to amend the MLA since Alaska gained statehood to the \n     detriment of Alaska's 90 percent interest in revenues from \n     mineral leases. For example, on December 18, 1971, Congress \n     passed the Alaska Native Claims settlement Act (ANCSA), 43 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1601, et seq., amending the royalty distribution \n     ratio of the MLA to reduce the State's share of royalties and \n     pay a portion to Alaska Native corporations. Section 9 of \n     ANCSA, 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1608, provided in part that a royalty \n     of 2 per centum of the gross value of minerals and 2 per \n     centum of all rentals and bonuses would be deducted from the \n     mineral revenues from public lands and paid to the Alaska \n     Native Fund. Prior to ANCSA, the standard royalty on oil and \n     gas leased was 12.5 percent of production. This meant 1.25 \n     percent went to the U.S. Treasury, and 11.25 percent went to \n     the state of Alaska, whereas after ANCSA these percentages \n     were 1.05 and 9.45, respectively.\n       Similarly, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax of 1980, Pub. \n     L. No. 96-223, 94 Stat. 229 (1980), exacts a tax on MLA \n     revenues prior to the application of the revenue sharing \n     formula New Mexico v. U.S. 11 CL. CT. 429 (1986), affirmed --\n     --F.2d----, No. 87-1210 (1987), See also, Solicitor's Opinion \n     M-36929 supra.\n       These examples clearly demonstrate Congress' continuing \n     authority to change the distribution scheme for mineral \n     revenues from federal land whenever it perceives a need to do \n     so.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated, we must conclude that Congress has \n     the authority under the Property Clause of the Constitution \n     to alter the distribution formula set out in the Mineral \n     Leasing Act for oil and gas revenues from the Arctic national \n     Wildlife Refuge. The State of Alaska has not met the heavy \n     burden of persuasion with respect to the argument that those \n     Property Clause powers were terminated by the section in the \n     Statehood Act amending the MLA to include Alaska in the act's \n     revenue distribution formula. We can find no support in the \n     Alaska Statehood Act for the proposition that the MLA was \n     incorporated into the compact between the federal government \n     and the State. In fact, opposite the proposition, we find \n     other instances in which Congress has amended the MLA in a \n     manner which adversely affected the State's interests.\n                                                    Ralph W.

The State and \n     its people further disclaim all right or title in or to any \n     property, including fishing rights, the right or title to \n     which may be held by or for any Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut, or \n     community thereof, as that right or title is defined in the \n     act of admission. The State and its people agree that, unless \n     otherwise provided by Congress, the property, as described in \n     this section, shall remain subject to the absolute \n     disposition of the United States. They further agree that no \n     taxes will be imposed upon any such property, until otherwise \n     provided by the Congress. This tax exemption shall not apply \n     to property held by individuals in fee without restrictions \n     on alienation.'' (Alaska Constitution, art, 12, Sec. 12.)\n     \\6\\ Alaska also argues that a change in the distribution, \n     such as that proposed in S. 735 would result in the State \n     being treated differently than other states. Specifically, \n     Alaska argues that it is the only state that has a refuge \n     producing oil and gas revenues on reserved lands and, \n     therefore, is the only state that will be impacted by a \n     provision changing the distribution formula for reserved \n     wildlife refuges. Although this appears to be primarily a \n     policy issue, Alaska does suggest that the equal footing \n     doctrine may be implicated by such unequal treatment. \n     However, after reviewing this matter, we do not believe that \n     it raises substantial legal questions. Factually, the \n     proposed law would apply to all new leases on all wildlife \n     refuges. As a factual matter, it is not clear that it would \n     have an unequal impact in the long run. As a legal matter, \n     even if there were an unequal impact, this impact would not \n     constitute a violation of the equal footing doctrine. In \n     Nevada v. U.S., 512 F. Supp. 166 (D. Nev. 1981), a case in \n     which the State of Nevada challenged a moratorium on the \n     disposal of public lands under the equal footing doctrine, \n     the court accurately summarized this doctrine as follows:\n     ``Federal regulation which is otherwise valid is not a \n     violation of the `equal footing' doctrine merely because its \n     impact may differ between various states because of \n     geographic or economic reasons. Island Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, \n     363 F.2d 120 (9th Cir. 1966). The doctrine applies only to \n     political rights and sovereignty; it does not cover economic \n     matters, for there never has been equality among the states \n     in that sense, U.S. v. Texasm 339 U.S. 707 (1950). Said case \n     points out that, when they entered the Union, some states \n     contained large tracts of land belonging to the federal \n     government, whereas others has none. ``The requirements of \n     equal footing was designed not to wipe out these diversities \n     but to create parity as respects political standing and \n     sovereignty,' Id., at 716. Accordingly, Congress may cede \n     property to one state without a corresponding cession to all \n     states. * * * the equal footing doctrine \n\n[[Page S 17439]]\n     does not affect Congress' power to dispose of federal property. * * *''\n     \\7\\ In documents submitted to us, the State cites several \n     instances in the legislative history of ASA in which Members \n     of Congress expressed an intent to provide Alaska with \n     sufficient revenues to function as a state, and several other \n     instances in which congressman or reports cited the 90/10 \n     distribution system. However, these expressions of intent do \n     not answer the question of whether the 90/10 distribution was \n     to be a permanent grant of a property interest and whether, \n     by setting out such a formula in 1958, Congress sought to \n     terminate its Property Clause powers with regard to federal \n     mineral revenues from federal lands forever. Our analysis of \n     the statutes and judicial precedent compel a negative answer \n     to both questions that is not changed by the suggestion a \n     general intention to provide the new state with revenue.\n     \\8\\ See also, Nevada v. U.S., 512 F. Supp. at 171-172: \n     ``Regulations dealing with the care and disposition of public \n     lands within the boundaries of a new state may properly be \n     embraced in its act of admission, as within the sphere of the \n     plain power of Congress.'' (Citing, U.S. v. Sandoval, 231 \n     U.S. 28 (1913).\n     \\9\\ All of the contiguous lower 48 states had already been \n     admitted to the Union when the MLA was passed in 1920. The \n     MLA was not ``incorporated'' into the statehood act of any \n     other state.\n     \\10\\ The State's argument implies that 90 percent of MLA \n     revenues goes to all states, not just Alaska. This argument \n     appears to be based on an interpretion of the MLA whereby the \n     40 percent of MLA revenues which is earmarked for the \n     Reclamation Fund ultimately is returned to the states in the \n     form of reclamation projects. This argument has several \n     problems. The assertion that the 40 percent of MLA receipts \n     from states other than Alaska is returned to the generating \n     states if illusory. In fact, any such money that are returned \n     to the states arrive there only through an express \n     appropriation from Congress after competing with other \n     appropriations proposals, and there is absolutely no \n     guarantee that such moneys as are appropriated will be \n     proportionately returned to the states from which they were \n     generated. The 90 percent provided to Alaska, however, is \n     distributed directly to the State, to be disposed of as the \n     state legislature directs. To the extent Alaska argues that \n     it has been treated the same as other states in receiving the \n     90 percent share of MLA revenues, it implicitly admits that \n     equal treatment would allow Congress to change the MLA \n     formula for Alaska, because Congress clearly has the power to \n     amend the MLA to affect the royalty shares of the other \n     states. New Mexico v. U.S., 11 Cl. Ct. 429 (1986); \n     affirmed,--F.2d--, 87-1210 (1987).\n     \\11\\ The case cited in the text focused on section 401 of the \n     Revenue Sharing Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 715s(c), which after the \n     1964 amendment provided that 25 percent of the receipts, \n     including mineral receipts, generated by a refuge would go to \n     the county in which the refuge was located and 75 percent to \n     the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The Kenai Borough (the \n     county in which the Kenai Moose Range is located), and the \n     State of Alaska, each filed suit to challenge the federal \n     interpretation that this formula applied to oil and gas \n     revenues generated from the refuge. The U.S. District Court, \n     District of Alaska, and the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals \n     each found in favor of the state of Alaska, that is, that \n     section 35 of the MLA and not section 401 of the WRRSA, \n     controlled the distribution of receipts from Kenai Moose \n     Range. The Supreme Court held that the 1964 amendment clearly \n     covered oil and gas receipts, but also found that it has not \n     been the intent of Congress to amend section 35 of the MLA. \n     Therefore, the court ruled that the WRRSA applied to oil and \n     gas receipts from acquired lands in wildlife refuges, but not \n     to reserved public lands in wildlife refuges. Watt v. Alaska, \n     U.S. 259 (1981). Even though the Court distinguished between \n     acquired lands in refuges and public domain, this decision \n     supports the proposition that Congress is not bound by the \n     ASA to give Alaska 90 percent of oil and gas leasing revenues \n     from all federally owned land.\n     \\12\\ In contrast for example, the ASA explicitly granted \n     Alaska 103,350,000 acres of land, which * * *.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Department of Justice, Environment and Natural Resources \n           Division\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1991.\n     Re Artic National Wildlife Refuge.\n     Mr. Paul Symth,\n     Acting Associate Solicitor, Energy and Resources, Department \n         of the Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Smyth: I have reviewed Solicitor's Opinion M-36957 \n     concerning the eventual division of oil and gas revenues from \n     the Arctic National Wildlife as you recently requested. I \n     concur in its conclusion that for ANWR Congress may alter the \n     90/10 distribution set out in the Mineral Leasing Act.\n       Although it may be premature to say that we would arrive at \n     our conclusion through the same analysis followed in the \n     Opinion, we are convinced that Congress may authorize the \n     altered distribution and would certainly feel comfortable \n     defending that conclusion in court.\n       Thank you for making us aware of this potential issue in \n     advance of litigation. We would be interested in knowing what \n     Congress ultimately decides.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Myles E.

Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: During my recent visit to \n     Washington, DC, it became clear to me that a central issue in \n     the debate related to oil development in the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is the allocation of the revenue \n     between the State of Alaska and the federal government. \n     Accordingly, I am writing to you to reiterate my position on \n     this issue.\n       By your legislation, and that of Congressman Young, you \n     have concluded that fifty percent of the revenues of ANWR \n     should be used to reduce the Federal budget in order to \n     accomplish Congressional approval.\n       The state is entitled to receive ninety percent of oil and \n     gas revenues generated from federal lands in Alaska. \n     According to your reports, Congressional action is highly \n     unlikely unless Congress sees some direct benefit to the \n     federal budget. In addition to all of the other strong \n     arguments in support of opening ANWR, it has been made clear \n     to us that a fifty-fifty split of the revenue is necessary to \n     attain favorable Congressional action. I support your \n     strategy to split the revenues evenly between the state and \n     federal governments.\n       If there is federal enactment of the fifty-fifty revenue \n     split, it would constitute an amendment of the Alaska \n     Statehood Act. According to the Alaska Department of Law, an \n     amendment to the Statehood Act requires state concurrence. \n     This concurrence must occur through the enactment of a bill \n     by the Alaska Legislature and approval by the Governor.\n       Therefore, I will introduce and pursue legislation to \n     accept such a change if Congress adopts a fifty-fifty revenue \n     split. In this way, Alaska's elected officials in Juneau will \n     have a full opportunity to debate the merits of agreeing to \n     any modification of the ninety-ten revenue formula.\n       I firmly believe any amendment of the ninety-ten revenue \n     split should apply to ANWR only. I will continue to insist, \n     by way of the statehood compact lawsuit, that Alaska receive \n     its full entitlement on the development of other federal \n     lands in Alaska.\n       The State of Alaska stands ready to assist you in attaining \n     Congressional approval of opening ANWR.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Tony Knowles,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n\n                                                              \n\n\n                                     Alaska State Legislature.\n\n                                     Juneau, AK, October 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Gingrich: On behalf of the Alaska State \n     Legislature, we would like to thank you for taking the time \n     to meet with us during our recent visits to Washington, D.C. \n     and for your support of oil and gas leasing in ANWR.\n       As the Republican leaders of the state Senate and House, we \n     would like to state our unqualified support for current \n     congressional plans to allow oil and gas development on the \n     coastal plain of ANWR and to share lease revenues 50-50 \n     between the state and federal governments.\n       We are aware that some House Republicans have expressed \n     concern about this revenue sharing in light of Alaska's right \n     under its statehood compact to receive 90% of revenues from \n     oil and gas leases on federal lands.\n       Governor Tony Knowles announced on September 28th before \n     the National Press Club that he backs the 50-50 state-federal \n     split of ANWR lease revenues as proposed in the budget \n     reconciliation act. He is on record saying he will introduce \n     legislation to change the statehood compact to provide a 50-\n     50 revenue split for ANWR lease revenues.\n       As the U.S. House and Senate works to complete action on \n     the budget reconciliation act, Members of Congress should \n     know that we will do everything in our power to ensure that \n     such a bill passes the Alaska State Legislature and becomes \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Drue Pearce,\n       Senate President.\n     Gail Phillips,\n       House Speaker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17432-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17439-S17440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MONTANA'S CENTER FOR WILDLIFE INFORMATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all recognize general Norman \nSchwarzkopf as a great military leader. But what most Americans \nprobably do not know is that he is also deeply devoted to the cause of \nconserving one of our most precious resources, our wildlife. In \ncooperation with a number of my constituents in Montana, General \nSchwarzkopf have been involved in a remarkable effort to increase \npublic understanding and appreciation of the wildlife that help make \nMontana and America so special. As General Schwarzkopf has said:\n\n       In traveling and living throughout all parts of our world, \n     I have learned that we possess in this country of ours and in \n     neighboring Canada one of the most marvelous arrays of \n     wildlife and wildlands found anywhere.\n\n  Yet, as any Montanan can tell you, each year people are killed or \ninjured and wildlife is lost unnecessarily because of conflicts that \nshould have been avoided. So General Schwarzkopf and Chuck Bartlebaugh \nof Missoula, MT have decided to do something about it. The Center for \nWildlife Information has been established in Missoula. By creating a \nseries of public \n\n[[Page S 17440]]\nservice announcements, seminars, conferences, and other public \neducation activities, they are working successfully to increase public \nrespect and understanding of our wildlife resources.\n  A project recently announced by the Center is particularly exciting. \nWith the support of Plum Creek Timber Co., the Center for Wildlife \nInformation and Columbia Falls Junior High, located close to the \nwestern gateway of Glacier National Park, are working to develop a \nbear-awareness and wildlife stewardship education program. Under the \ndirection of Columbia Falls Junior High's principal Neal Wedum, \nstudents and teachers will write and design educational materials and \nteaching units on black bear and grizzly bear identification, \ntechniques for safe hiking and camping in bear country, and techniques \nfor viewing and photographing wildlife safely and responsibly. Students \nwill also develop an educational unit about partnerships between \ncorporations, communities, and wildlife management agencies in \nMontana's Seeley-Swan Grizzly Bear Corridor.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I commend everyone involved in this \nremarkable effort: Chuck Bartlebaugh, Kris Backes of Plum Creek, and \nPrincipal Wedum, to name just a few. Congratulations and good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17439-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I would like to divert from that just for a \nmoment because, were it not for the overshadowing presence of the \nbudget debate, which is appropriate, I suspect we may be on this floor \ndebating an issue that is of great significance and great importance.\n  As we speak, the United States is leading an effort in Dayton, OH, to \nattempt to reach some kind of peace agreement between the warring \nfactions in Bosnia. That has been an elusive goal, one which different \nparties and different factions have been attempting over nearly a 600-\nyear period of time; in this latest conflict, 4 years of serious \nengagement with disastrous and tragic consequences for hundreds of \nthousands of people, if not millions of people, in that part of the \nworld.\n  But, if we have learned anything, I think, from our recent history in \nterms of the United States involvement in conflicts abroad, it is that \nany kind of involvement, and particularly a long-term involvement, \nanything exceeding just a matter of days, ultimately cannot succeed \nwithout the support of the American people.\n  That support is expressed through their elected representatives. The \nPresident has said and Congress has said that it is appropriate for \nCongress to examine the conditions upon which any U.S. troops will be \nsubject to deployment to a foreign land, particularly one in which \npotential conflict and potential threat to their health and safety and \nlife exist.\n  At this point, hopefully, we are nearing a real peace agreement in \nDayton. I have some very deep concerns about the nature of that \nagreement and whether it can even be accurately described as a peace \nagreement. But, unfortunately, the President of the United States for \nwhatever reason some time ago, and on numerous occasions, has made \ncommitments to deploy troops as soon as this agreement is reached.\n  There have been some recent indications that the President is willing \nto let Congress take a look at, examine, and analyze the peace \nagreement but no commitment that, even if we disagree, the troops will \nnot be sent. In fact, there is pretty good indication that an advance \nparty of up to 2,000 American troops will be sent there to sort of hold \nthe line while the so-called 2-week ``period of examination'' passes. \nThe President hopes for congressional support and authorization. He has \nnot yet received it, nor will he unless he is able to go before the \nAmerican people and go before this Congress and make a compelling case \nfor use of United States troops on the ground in Bosnia. That case, I \nsuggest, has not been made, and has not even been attempted to be \npresented to the American people a cogent, logical, understandable \nreason why 20,000 uniformed troops of the United States Armed Forces \nneed to be inserted into the conflict in Bosnia. The President may \nintend to do that. I do not know. He has waited a dangerously long \ntime.\n  The argument that the administration has made, feeble as it is, is \nthat it is necessary for two reasons: One, to contain the spread of the \nconflict to other areas which involve other NATO allies which \neventually will pull in all of Europe. There is little reason to \nsuspect that will happen. It has not in a 4-year period of time.\n  What we have essentially looked at is a civil war within a confined \nborder of three factions fighting for land which they have fought for \nfor nearly 600 years--avenging tragedies, avenging killings, avenging \nland seizures and private property seizures which have taken place over \na significant period of time. Even if spreading beyond the current \nborders were a real possibility, there are strategies, containment \nstrategies, that NATO could employ which are far different and involve \nfar less risk than inserting 20,000 American troops and 40,000 NATO \ntroops for a total of 60,000 onto the ground in the middle of the \nconflict that currently exists in Bosnia.\n  The second reason the administration postulates is that our \ninvolvement with troops on the ground is necessary to maintain the \nintegrity of NATO. I think that even that is a questionable \nproposition.\n  In a recent article in Time magazine by Charles Krauthammer he talks \nabout that very point, saying, ``Of course, the single most powerful \nargument in favor of deployment invokes NATO: to renege on this promise \nof American relief for our NATO allies already trapped in Bosnia in a \nfruitless `peacekeeping' mission.'' He asserts that it ``would be the \nworst blow Clinton has yet dealt''--I am quoting--``to NATO cohesion.''\n  ``Whatever the strategic policy of having our troops in Bosnia, the \nargument goes, our NATO allies want us to take the lead on the ground, \nand we promised that we would do that.''\n  But, as Krauthammer goes on to explain, our recent history indicates \nthat one of two things are going to probably happen. Either we will \nsuffer a loss of life--either we will suffer a situation which is far \ndifferent than what could be described as peace, and, therefore, \nwithout having gotten the commitment of the Congress, or the commitment \nof the American people, we will call for a withdrawal of those troops \nwhich would be a serious blow to the integrity of NATO--or it may \nresult in a long-term deployment and commitment of those troops which \nwe have not again made the case for, nor do I think we can begin to \nexpect American support for, a long-term commitment to that.\n  Either one of those occurrences, one of which is likely to happen, \ncould do great damage to the NATO alliance and, as Krauthammer argues, \nand I agree, actually do more damage than not providing troops on the \nground.\n  The President has not defined our vital interests in that \ninvolvement. He has not defined what our objective and mission would \nbe. He has not defined how we would exit from the situation other than \nto say we will be out of there within a year. I think what he means by \nthat is that we will be out of there before the next election. It is \npolitically not feasible, and untenable to think the troops would still \nbe there and become an election issue. That in \n\n[[Page S 17441]]\nand of itself is a recipe for disaster given the nature of the warfare. \nAnd anybody who understands the enmity that exists between the parties, \nand the conflict over who owns what land, knows that the American \ntroops being out longer than a year is likely to just promote and \nproduce a situation in which the parties wait out the situation, and \nthen would return to the status quo, which is obviously not something \nthat any of us looks forward to.\n  There are a couple of other concerns that I have. One is the question \nof neutrality. It is one thing to send troops into a situation when \nthose troops are viewed--and that nation sending the troops is viewed--\nas a truly neutral partner in the process. In this case, we have \ndecidedly sided with one faction in this conflict--the Bosnian Moslems. \nWhile we have not seen the final details of the peace agreement, the \nUnited States has indicated that one of our objectives in this \ndeployment will be to arm the Moslems, will be to bring them to ``a \nlevel of parity'' with the other factions. That may be comforting news \nto the Bosnian Moslems. I doubt that is very comforting to the other \nparties in the conflict, and certainly not the Serbs.\n\n  So what our goal should be is a disarming of all parties involved, to \nreduce the level of tension and reduce the level of potential conflict \nrather than build up the capacity of one of the parties but, in doing \nso, even if that were an agreed upon military strategy, I think that is \na terrible political strategy because we will not be viewed as a \nneutral party. The United States, which is already by the very nature \nof its--I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. The United States which is already viewed by a number of \ncountries as not necessarily a neutral entity, and which has become a \ntarget, unfortunately, over the years for terrorists and extremists and \nothers that want to disrupt either the peace talks or simply make a \npoint, I think would clearly be identified as a party which was not \nneutral in this conflict and clearly would be a potential target for \nterrorism.\n  I had the experience nearly a decade ago of traveling to Beirut \nvisiting the marines that were encamped between warring factions, and \nwitnessed the aftereffects of the tragic bombing of the marine barracks \nthat cost the loss of several hundred lives. Those that perpetrated \nthis incident wanted to make a point, and by making that point they \nfelt that they could influence the course of that conflict. And they \ndid. I think the very same something--maybe not the very same but \nsomething similar--happened in Somalia.\n  So we at great risk put our troops between the warring factions.\n  My final point is that I think we need to be very, very careful about \nwhat a peace agreement says and means that might come out of Dayton. \nDayton could very well produce a ``peace''--I put that word in \nquotation marks. Again, I am referring to the Krauthammer piece--a \n``peace'' that is unstable and divisive, and largely unenforceable. It \nmay be a peace imposed rather than a peace sought and agreed to by the \nwarring factions; imposed by outside forces. If that is the case, we \nare likely to have a situation where, as Krauthammer says, this lowest \ncommon denominator peace plan commands three grudging, resentful \nsignatures from unreconciled parties. That is a disaster for American \ntroops on the ground. And particularly, if the President has not sought \nthe support of the American people, the support of their elected \nrepresentatives, and defined for the American people just why it is \nnecessary to utilize American troops on the ground. We need to make \nsure.\n  I ask for one additional minute, and I promise to quit even if I am \nnot finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  We should make sure that we have an ironclad commitment from the \nthree parties involved that they not only are seeking a true peace but \nthey are willing to self-enforce a true peace; that they will do so \nwith a builddown of forces instead of a buildup of forces; that they \nwill do so with wide zones of separation between them; that the peace \nwill be essentially self-enforcing; and that they will be committed to \nbringing about that cessation of hostility and conflict between them.\n  If that is the case, one has to ask themselves the question, why are \n60,000 troops needed to enforce that? If that is not the case, I think \nwe have a very serious question.\n  My time has expired, and I promised to quit, and even though I have \nmore to say, I will say it later.

Mr. President, with additional time, I would love to \ndiscuss this situation with the Senator from Indiana. It is a very \ndifficult situation. I was in the Krajina Valley a couple days after \nthe Croatian Army had driven back the Croatian Serbs and several \nhundred thousand estimated, a couple hundred thousand civilians left \nthat valley, and a day later 120 millimeter rockets came into a market \nin Sarajevo and killed another 40 civilians. And not long after that a \nPresident Clinton-led NATO engaged in airstrikes, and it was not long \nbefore you could fly into Sarajevo.\n  We see the makings of peace in the region. It is an unprecedented \nevent with the United States leading in a diplomatic effort, Ambassador \nHolbrooke going around the clock with unimaginable stamina to try to \nnegotiate a settlement.\n  I listened to the House debate last night on this subject, and I must \nsay I hope our own words do not make it more difficult to get an \nagreement and we do not find ourselves right back in the soup. I think \nit is a long shot to get a peace agreement. No question it is going to \nbe difficult to get, but I think in any evaluation of what has gone on \nin Bosnia in the last 60 days you almost have to begin and end with \npraise for President Clinton's ability to lead NATO and to lead to \nwhere we are today, which is a significant reduction of violence in \nthat part of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17441-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17441-S17444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as to the Deficit Reduction Act, I would \nlike to make a few comments.\n  First, we need to sort of check our own rhetoric and ask ourselves \nwhy. A lot of people come down and say we have unprecedented debt \nmounting on top of record debt. We do not have record debt. Our \npercentage of debt to GDP is going down. A lot of people say we have to \ndo what we did in the cold war. During World War II, we accumulated \nalmost 130 GDP of debt and won the war as a consequence, did the \nMarshall plan after that, rebuilt our own country as a consequence of a \nwillingness to go into debt, no matter how we used that debt. I will \nget to that later.\n  I am very much concerned that a growing portion of our outlays is \ngoing not to investments but going to current consumption. I think it \nis a significant problem. It is not a problem, by the way, caused by \nthe poor. I voted against this proposal for a number of reasons. I do \nnot think it is fair. I do not believe it asks people like myself with \nhigher income to participate in deficit reduction, which I think is \nterribly important. I receive very little in the way of Government \nservices. People with lower incomes do receive more in Government \nservice. I am asking them to shoulder a disproportionate share of \neliminating this deficit.\n\n  Second, not only does it rend the social safety net, but it does not \nstart us on the road to evaluating what kind of safety net do we need. \nI think most of us in this body now believe that we have to have \neconomic growth, that our tax policies, which I do not think encourage \nsavings and investment, need to be written so that we get the kind of \ninvestment and economic growth the country needs; that we have \nregulatory policies that are mindful of the risks that people take when \nthey invest money.\n  Most of us understand that we have to have an economy that is \ngrowing, but if you are going to have a vibrant market economy where \npeople are making business and bottom line decisions, you also have to \nhave some kind of safety net out there. We ought to be \n\n[[Page S 17442]]\nthinking about how do we take the next step of how do we get it \nuniversal rather than moving away as I see this proposal doing.\n  We ought to ask ourselves, as Senator Simpson and I did, how do we \nreform the Federal retirement program so that there is more \nflexibility, individuals get a higher rate of return, they have \nsomething they own and they can acquire wealth during the course of a \nworking life that might not generate much opportunity for savings.\n  We need to be asking ourselves how do we construct the safety net \nthat enables us to have a vibrant market economy instead. As I see it, \nwe rend the social safety net and then we really do not acknowledge \nthat there is an importance and value to having it there in place.\n  Again, perhaps as a result of our own orientation, the higher your \nincome gets, there is a tendency to presume that everybody is living \nlike you are and a presumption that, gee, everything is OK. Everything \nis not OK. You talk to people 50 years of age out there, men or women \nwho tell you what it is like to get a pink slip in a downsizing \noperation after working 30 years on the job. They have a tough time \ngetting health insurance. They have a tough time adjusting to not just \nthe downsizing but the reduction in income that they face.\n  If you want to have a vibrant economy, not only do we need to change \nour tax and our regulatory structure, we also need to change the safety \nnet, and this proposal moves us in the wrong direction.\n  Third, I talked at length about how it really does not solve the \nproblem of growing entitlements at all. It postpones them. It says, \nwell, we can deal with Social Security later. We can deal with Medicare \nlater. Really, the long-term problems, we deal with them later.\n  Mr. President, time is not on our side. Every year you wait you \nreally deepen the cut or increase the possibility that working people \nare going to have to pay more taxes as a consequence of our \nunwillingness to face the problem.\n  The next thing I did yesterday was go through a few things that I as \na Democrat would be willing to support that would enable us, I think, \nto produce the savings needed to have more fairness in the proposal, to \nbegin to consider what kind of safety net should we construct and would \nhave us moving in the direction of controlling entitlements.\n  On my list is I think we should drop the tax cut. I will describe a \nlittle bit later a rather remarkable letter from the Congressional \nBudget Office Director, June O'Neill. We should drop the $245 billion \ntax cut, commit ourselves to set a course so that at the end of 1996 we \ncan enact fundamental tax reform that does encourage savings and \ninvestment; we understand that the current income tax system needs to \nbe adjusted; that working families are having trouble saving money.\n  Let us not do it piecemeal. Let us do it bigger. This tax cut \nproposal should be dropped because it enlarges the deficit in the short \nterm. Again, I will discuss that later. I would be willing to vote to \nreduce the Consumer Price Index by half a point. The adjustment would \nsave hundreds of billions of dollars. I would even go further than half \na point, but half a point seems to be about where we are. I am just \nalerting my Republican colleagues there are ways for us to come up with \nadditional savings that are needed to balance the budget but to do it \nin a fair way and the way that has us holding onto a safety net that we \nneed in the market economy.\n  I would be prepared to vote to phase in an increase in the \neligibility ages both for Social Security and Medicare. It would not \naffect current beneficiaries at all. In fact, it does not have to \naffect beneficiaries over the age of 50. But to phase that in gives \neverybody under 50 time to plan and produces tremendous future savings.\n  I would be prepared to vote for an affluence test on all Federal \nentitlement programs, including farm program payments, if it is fair. \nIt generates tremendous savings in the short term. It seems to me easy \nfor us to sell, and I consider it to be an attractive way again to \npreserve that safety net and keep fairness in this proposal.\n  Mr. President, I would like to just sort of insert one other \nobjection that I have that I failed to note earlier in my discussion.\n  There is a so-called Freedom to Farm Act proposal that is tucked away \nin this reconciliation bill. You can imagine what the American people \nare going to say when they find out that somebody out there with a half \nsection of land that they are not farming now--let us say they use it \nfor pasture and they have a hobby farm going on out there. Maybe they \nraise horses, for all I know. Under this proposal, they are going to be \nencouraged to enroll. They are going to get paid whether they farm or \nnot. They are going to get income whether they are producing any \nagriculture product or not. It converts a market based system to a \nwelfare system I do not think the American taxpayers are going to like \nand I know American farmers are not going to like as well.\n  Mr. President, there is a document I would urge colleagues to read. I \nwill put in the first two pages. I ask unanimous consent that the first \ntwo pages be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed the conference report on H.R. 2491, the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1995, and has projected the deficits that would \n     result if the bill is enacted. These projections use the \n     economic and technical assumptions underlying the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), assume the \n     level of discretionary spending indicated in the budget \n     resolution, and include changes in outlays and revenues \n     estimated to result from the economic impact of balancing the \n     budget by fiscal year 2002 as estimated by CBO in its April \n     1995 report, An Analysis of the President's Budgetary \n     Proposals for Fiscal Year 1996. On that basis, CBO projects \n     that enactment of the reconciliation legislation recommended \n     by the conferees would produce a small budget surplus in \n     2002. The estimated federal spending, revenues and deficits \n     that would occur if the proposal is enacted are shown in \n     Table 1. The resulting differences from CBO's April 1995 \n     baseline are summarized in Table 2, which includes the \n     adjustments to the baseline assumed by the budget resolution. \n     The estimated savings from changes in direct spending and \n     revenues that would result from enactment of each title of \n     the bill are summarized in Table 3 and described in more \n     detail in an attachment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E.

As you can see, Mr. President, it is from June O'Neill, \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO has been cited a \nlot as we go through this continuing resolution debate. This is written \nto Chairman Pete Domenici, November 16, 1995, with copies sent to the \nranking member, Senator Exon of Nebraska, along with the chairman and \nranking member of the House Budget Committee, John Kasich and \nCongressman Sabo.\n  It is a remarkable document, Mr. President, and shows the folly of \nthe tax cut. But it also shows that we really are postponing most of \nthe difficult choices. No American should believe that because if we \nenact this reconciliation bill--let us say by some miracle the \nPresident changes his mind, which I do not believe he is going to do; I \nbelieve he is going to veto it. Let us say we enact this thing. All it \ndoes is commit it for a single year. Next year we come back and vote \nagain.\n  The year after that we have to vote again. I say to Americans, \nexamine the \n\n[[Page S 17443]]\ndocument. For gosh sakes, the deficit this year is $164 billion. It has \nbeen going down every year for the last 4 years. Next year the deficit \ngoes to $178 billion, and the year after that it goes to $189 billion. \nI mean, this proposal increases the deficit next year and increases the \ndeficit the year after that. This does not reduce deficits; it \nincreases deficits.\n  And to exclude Social Security--there is another letter coming from \nJune O'Neill that says that because you include Social Security income, \nyou are actually reducing the size of the deficit by some $60 to $100 \nbillion, depending on the year that you take. So we get an increase in \nthe deficit, Mr. President, and we are postponing most of the difficult \ncuts.\n  In the year 2002 this Congress is going to be expected to cut $70 \nbillion in a single year. Unlikely, Mr. President. If you look at the \nbackdating of the difficult decisions, I think the American people \nbegin to understand why this so-called revolution is a lot less than \nmeets the eye, a lot less, and why they should insist, if they want to \nbalance the budget and they want to do it in a fair way and in a \nfashion that enables us to have some kind of a reasonable safety net \nand vibrant market economy----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. That we need a different reconciliation bill than the one \nthat was passed by this body by 52 votes yesterday.\n  Again, I would urge colleagues to look as well at the growth of \nentitlement programs. These are not programs for the poor. These are \nmiddle-class entitlements and most difficult of all. Almost half of the \ngrowth of all spending in here is Social Security, which is not even on \nthe table in this discussion.\n  So, look at the growth and then ask yourself, if you had $435 billion \nthis year for defense and nondefense appropriations--which is what you \nhave in the year 2002--construct the budget, build a budget with $435 \nbillion, go home and tell your citizens, OK, we are going to use $263 \nbillion for defense, and that gives me $174 billion for all other \nspending, you cannot do it, Mr. President. You are not going to be just \nclosing down odds and ends; you are going to be shutting down NASA and \nshutting down the courts and significant functions of Government.\n  You cannot get there from here, Mr. President, unless we come as \nDemocrats and Republicans and say we are willing to do something, drop \nthe tax cut, adjust the CPI, phase in changes in the eligibility age, \nconsider an affluence test, do something with part B premiums. Those \nkinds of changes, Mr. President, would not only enable us to balance \nthe budget in 7 years, but do it in a fair fashion, do it in a way that \nenables us to build a new safety net and a vibrant market economy, and \nI think restore the confidence of the American people, who rightly have \nconcluded, by the way, even if this is enacted, that we are not going \nto be balancing our budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend from Nebraska leaves the floor, I want to \nstate to him, through the Chair, and to my friend who is the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, that the two Senators from Nebraska are people \nwho have credentials to speak about balanced budgets. The ranking \nmember, Senator Exon from Nebraska, of the Budget Committee, former \nchairman of the Budget Committee, has worked for years on balancing the \nbudget. My friend from Nebraska, the junior Senator from Nebraska, \nchaired the entitlement commission and has spoken out, to his detriment \npolitically, on many occasions of what he sees as the wrongs of what we \nare doing with entitlements.\n\n  So, the reason I mention that while he is here on the floor, the \nchairman of the entitlement commission, a Governor from the State of \nNebraska, people who have credentials to talk about balancing the \nbudget and who have actually done significant things to get us toward \nthat direction, when you have the two Senators from Nebraska speaking \nout against the reconciliation bill that passed, I think the American \npublic should be aware that it is not a good piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, before my friend leaves, I would also like to ask him \na question as a former Governor of the State of Nebraska. Would the \nSenator, based upon his experience and expertise, indicate in his words \nwhy he thinks it is wrong to have the executive bound by numbers given \nto him by the legislative branch?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator asks a question that I think \nis very relevant. I voted against the continuing revolution for \nprecisely that reason. This Congress should not bind the President to \nuse numbers that are developed by the Congress, just like I do not \nthink we should be bound to accept carte blanche the numbers that are \nused by OMB. Indeed, when I came into office in 1983, there was a great \npolitical controversy that occurred as a result of nobody trusted the \nnumbers. We actually created a statute, an independent agency, to \nproduce the numbers that both sides trust. And a lot of the politics \nnow has been taken out of it.\n  I think the Senator raises what I consider to be a fundamental defect \nin the continuing resolution that was passed and the President vetoed. \nThis body should not bind the President to use congressional numbers, \njust as this body should not write into statute that we are always \ngoing to use OMB numbers.\n  Mr. NUNN. If my friend from Nevada would yield on that point, while \nthe Senator from Nebraska is here.\n  Mr. REID. Certainly.\n  Mr. NUNN. I would like to make a few remarks on this very subject. I \nthink the 7-year number for balancing the budget in 7 years is a \nreasonable goal. I would hope that the President would agree with that \ngoal as we proceed to try to find a way to end this Government shutdown \nand pass a continuing resolution.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, though, is it not a fact that the \nPresident has basically agreed to that anyway?\n  Mr. NUNN. It is my understanding that is what is being talked about \nnow. But the Congressional Budget Office [CBO], I happen to believe \nthey have more conservative numbers and should be agreed to as the \nbasis for the overall approach to get a balanced budget, because we \nhave seen time and time again that we end up erring on the side of \noptimism, and we do not end up achieving the savings that were \nprojected.\n  But, having said that, I think no President of the United States is \ngoing to accept the CBO numbers for a 7-year period and have that \ndictated to by Congress in law. It is one thing to agree to 1 year as \nan estimate; it is another thing to have the congressional branch tell \nthe executive branch that it has to abide by those numbers. Congress \npasses those numbers, can use the CBO numbers, but Congress then has to \nsend the bill to the President. The President has a right to veto it \nunder the Constitution.\n  This business of shutting down Government if the President will not \nagree for a 7-year period to the congressional numbers is a way of \ntrying to avoid the constitutional procedures that were set up by our \nFounding Fathers which have worked pretty darn well. Shutting down \nGovernment to prevent the President from using his veto is something \nthat I think is a sad mistake and is going to hurt more and more people \nas time goes on.\n  I say that as one who watched Republican Presidents make virtually \nthe same point. I do not believe President Reagan or President Bush \nwould have accepted a dictate by a Democratic Congress that they use \nCBO numbers during their periods in office. I have talked to the former \nDirectors of OMB under the previous Presidents, and they have confirmed \nthat opinion.\n  I do not believe President Dole or President Gramm or President \nSpecter or President Lugar would allow the Congress to say, ``You are \ngoing to use CBO numbers''--a Democratic Congress particularly, \nreversing the present scenario--``We are going to require you to use \nthese numbers.'' Billions and billions of dollars are at stake, and \nalso a separation of powers is at stake. \n\n[[Page S 17444]]\n\n  So while I favor using the CBO numbers, I do not favor putting into \nlaw and holding the President hostage in terms of a shutdown of \nGovernment if he does not agree to that, because if I were President of \nthe United States I would not agree to it.\n  It does not have much to do with the question of the budget. It has a \nlot to do with the question of separation of powers. We are going to be \nvisiting, as the Senator from Nebraska said, these issues every year, \nwhatever the results of this compromise that I hope will emerge in \nnegotiating a final reconciliation bill.\n  We will have to have a compromise. These are going to be estimates. \nWe are going to make mistakes. The Medicare-Medicaid savings--I applaud \nthe Republicans for taking on these entitlements; I think it is long \noverdue. I think those of us on the Democratic side need to muster up \nsome courage to begin to take on the entitlements also. But I believe \nwe are going to have to go back and have a lot of corrections made to \nthe changes that are being made because all of these are estimates.\n  We do not know how much is going to be saved. That is one of the \nreasons I feel that going forward with a front-end tax cut is a mistake \nnow because we are going to have to have some money to patch up the \nmistakes as we go along and we find out people are really being hurt in \nan unjustified way.\n  So I hope out of all of this, we will reach some compromise very soon \nthat will have the President basically agree to the 7-year target and \ngoal but not have Congress impose by law the CBO numbers. There are \nlots of ways to be able to do that, and I hope we will find a way \nbefore too many more hours go by.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. I did want to comment on that one \npoint.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate my friend's statement. In addition to the two \nSenators from Nebraska, the Senator from Georgia has a record of many, \nmany years of being frugal and always trying to do something about a \nbalanced budget and entitlements. He and the senior Senator from New \nMexico have worked together on this for many years, and when we hear of \nthe Senator from Georgia speaking out about the problems with the \npresent reconciliation bill, it says volumes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 7\\1/2\\ minutes. The \nSenator's request is to speak for a total of how long?\n  Mr. REID. I would like to speak for 10 minutes starting now, since my \nfriends have used part of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17441-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17444-S17445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    GROWING USE OF VIOLENCE TO SHOW DISAGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, like most everyone here who serves in the \nU.S. Senate, I have a home in my home State, Nevada, and a home here. I \nannounce that because my wife, recently one night, presented to me \nsomething she received in the mail from our home here in Washington, \nand I want to refer to it.\n  In March 1993, I was the first Member of this body to come to the \nfloor and renounce the senseless killing of Dr. David Gunn as he left \nhis job at a health clinic in Pensacola, FL. I came to the floor again \nin 1994 and offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution condemning the \nspecific tactic of soliciting signatures on petitions that express \nsupport and justify the use of murderous violence against those who \noppose the pro-life position.\n  I am prompted again today to come to the floor and address this issue \nafter finding in our mailbox this despicable piece of literature. This \nflier is simply abdicating violence. It abdicates clearly an invasion \nof a person's privacy, who happens to be a physician who I do not know \nand do not want to know, as well as the man's family.\n  It is well known that I advocate a pro-life position, and during my \nyears in the House and Senate have voted accordingly. Because of my \naffiliation with this position, I also feel it is my responsibility to \nstand up and condemn tactics such as this flier, which are used by \nfringe elements of the pro-life movement.\n  This is a piece of trash. The people who put this in my mailbox \nviolated Federal law. They have no right to put this in my mailbox.\n  ``Guilty of crimes against humanity.'' I am reading from the \ndocument--``The National Socialist Party in Germany made gassing \ngypsies, Poles and other non-Aryans legal.''\n  They go on to insinuate this man, whose name, work, and home address \nare on this document--with phone numbers for both is a Nazi. They \ndirect me to call this doctor and his spouse, asking them to ``end this \nslaughter, because they say he has no conscience.''\n  They say, ``In reality it is murder.'' This man, whose name I am not \ngoing to disclose, ``should be tried for crimes against humanity.''\n  They quote various pieces of scripture from the Old Testament. They \ngo on to say, ``He so lacks conscience that slave owners would have \nused him to apprehend runaways.''\n  ``He is the equivalent of a slave trader.''\n  ``Don't allow your children to play with his.''\n  ``We will haunt him.'' I am skipping around on this document.\n  ``In the meantime, organize to have his lease canceled,'' and it goes \non and on.\n  Mr. President, this is wrong. This is wrong.\n  Two months ago, I came to the floor to express my outrage over the \nbombing of the family car of a Nevada forest ranger. This car was \nlocated 3 feet away from his family who was in their living room. I am \nconcerned about the growing use of violence as a means of showing \ndisagreement with the Government and with other individuals. It is this \nextremist mentality that is at the foot of devastating acts, such as \nthe assassination of Prime Minister Rabin and, I believe, the Oklahoma \nbombing and, of course, the shooting of Dr. Gunn.\n  Extremists advocate violence as an alternative to meaningful debate \nand meaningful discussions. Individuals who carry out such violence or \nendorse it believe they are above the law.\n  As I have stated earlier, I am personally pro-life, but Roe v. Wade \nis the current law in our country, and I, as a citizen of this country, \nrespect the law of the land. In fact, I personally disagree with the \njudgment rendered by a court, however, I believe in following the law.\n  This does not mean that those who disagree with the Supreme Court's \ndecision cannot work within the legislative process to change the law. \nThe debate over abortion elicits some of the strongest emotions that \npeople feel.\n  However passionate and vigorous debates can be, they should be \nhealthy and they should be speeches, comment, and discourse that are \ncivil in nature, not statements like ``crimes against humanity,'' \n``gassing gypsies,'' ``don't play with their children.''\n  Mr. President, when you arrive at a passionate, vigorous debate, I \nbelieve this represents what our democracy is all about, which is a \nparticipatory and functioning democracy at work. We have a \nresponsibility to decry the violence and the advocacy of violence as a \nlegitimate means to solve our differences. We cannot acquiesce to the \nviolence through our silence, and I am not going to. It is incumbent \nupon this body, this Congress, this country to make it unmistakably \nclear that such tactics are shameful and are to be denounced.\n  Without quick condemnation of such tactics, as this flier in my \nmailbox, violence will continue.\n  I shed tears at the assassination of President Kennedy, at the \nassassination of Prime Minister Rabin, especially when his \ngranddaughter cried pain of love for her grandfather. We cannot stand \nby and allow this to happen.\n  I hope we will all speak out against it and that the people who are \nspewing forth this filth will stop doing it, because it does not help \nthe cause.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. \n\n[[Page S 17445]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last month, I joined my colleagues, Senator \nLieberman and former Secretary William Bennett, who was the former \nSecretary of Education, at a news conference in which they were shining \na spotlight on what I believe is the problem that for too long has been \nignored by television executives, corporate advertisers, the news \nmedia, as well as the American people. The problem is the content of \nsome of our television programming and the corrosive effect this \nprogramming is having on our culture. Nowhere is this cultural erosion \nor ``cultural rot,'' in the words of Secretary Bennett, more evident \nthan in the content of many of today's daytime talk shows.\n  The news media are finally beginning to report on these issues, even \nthough many Americans have been voicing their concern for a long time. \nI know that I have been speaking out on these matters for a number of \nyears, as have a number of my colleagues, and as have Americans from \nall walks of life and all parts of the country. The media has not been \nlistening until recently, but they are listening now, and I think that \nis having a real effect.\n  I would not be speaking out today, or in the past, if I believed \ntelevision was not important. It is very important.\n  According to the World Almanac for 1995, Americans watch \napproximately 16\\1/2\\ hours of television per week; teenagers watch \nabout 12 hours per week. I think the number is higher than that, but \nthat is what this says. Our children watch approximately 13 hours per \nweek. For adults, this amounts to two full 8-hour working days of \ntelevision viewing per week. For children and teenagers, this amounts \nto 2 extra days of ``television school.'' For children, this is far \nmore time than they devote to homework. The second most widely \ncirculated magazine in America is TV Guide, a magazine about \ntelevision. Billions and billions of dollars are spent on television \nadvertising. We all know that market forces would not pour that kind of \nmoney into television if it did not have a powerful impact on the \npeople watching it. All of these statistics point to the fact that \ntelevision has a powerful and profound affect on all of our lives.\n\n  Given the tremendous impact of television on American culture, the \ncontent of our television programming is important. To illustrate this \npoint, I refer my colleagues to the June 1992 edition of the Journal of \nthe American Medical Association, which reported on a study that \nconcluded there was a direct relationship between the level of violence \non television and the growth of violent crime in our society. The \nstudy--headed up by Dr. Brandon Centerwall, a Seattle, WA, \npsychiatrist--concludes: ``The epidemiological evidence indicates that \nif, hypothetically, television technology had never been developed, \nthere would today be 10,000 fewer homicides each year in the United \nStates, 70,000 fewer rapes, and 700,000 fewer injurious assaults.''\n  Neither I, nor Senator Lieberman, nor former Secretary Bennett is \ntalking about turning back our technological clock by 50 years. There \nare many good programs on television. There is much education on \ntelevision in a positive sense. However, violent television programming \nis not a necessary part of television technology, and the logical \nconclusion from Dr. Centerwall's study, and numerous other such studies \nalong this line, is that a reduction in the level of violence in \ntelevision programming will, over the long term, lead to a reduction in \nviolence in our society.\n  Nowhere is the content of television more depraved and more \nsensational, nowhere does television unapologet- ically appeal to \npeople's most prurient interests and worst instincts than on daytime \ntalk shows. These are shows that do not even pretend to excuse \nthemselves under a disclaimer that they present fantasy or fiction. \nThey pump up their ratings by portraying their contents as ``real \nlife.'' As a consequence, they demean and exploit real people. By \nimplication, they tell their audiences that men, women, and children \nwho have serious problems in life are an object of freak-show \nfascination. I doubt that many of the producers or sponsors of these \nshows will tell you that they are proud of what they do. If you asked \nthem why they do it, in private, and if they were honest, I imagine \nthey would confess they do it purely for money.\n  During the Lieberman-Bennett press conference last month, which I \njoined, some clips from these shows were shown to illustrate our point \nthat much of this programming has gone far beyond the pale, and that we \nas citizens, as leaders, and as consumers should let television \nexecutives know and should let companies who advertise know that we \nbelieve it is unacceptable for those shows to continue to cultivate the \nseeds of cultural and moral decline in our Nation.\n  In subsequent responses to these comments we made at the news \nconference, and in an effort to defend this medium, some defenders of \ndaytime talk shows suggested that we were out of line by speaking out \nagainst the content of these shows. They even raised the question of \nthe first amendment. Some suggested that daytime talk shows were the \nvictims of broad generalizations, perhaps suggesting that we found a \nfew sensationalized, anomalous episodes and were holding those up as \nthe standard daytime talk show fare.\n  To follow up on this issue, one member of my staff voluntarily \nconducted an unscientific survey of the topics of daytime talk shows. \nEvery hour or so, he would scan the television on his desk and see what \nthe day's topics were for the daytime talk shows. The results added to \nthe concern that I already had.\n  The first day, one show was called, ``Stop Pretending To Be a Girl'' \nand featured young boys whose parents were upset that their sons \ndressed and acted like a girl. Another show offered a show entitled \n``Boys Who Only Have Sex With Virgins.'' Yet another show featured a \ngirl dumping her boyfriend on national television and asking her new \n``significant other,'' another girl, to commit to her.\n  Mr. President, I thought that surely the next day's shows would pale \nin comparison to these. I was wrong. Subsequent days' reviews of these \nshows found titles such as ``One-night Stand Reunions.'' Another show \nwas entitled ``I'm Ready To Have Sex With You Now.'' And another show \nwas called, ``I Cheat and I'm Proud of It.'' One show featured a woman \nwho chose to tell her fiance on national television that she cheated on \nhim with her sister's boyfriend and that she lied to him about a \nmiscarriage which was actually an abortion. Another show reunited \npornographic stars, strippers, and transvestites with their past \nlovers. Perhaps the most appropriately titled show of all was the one \nentitled ``You Look Like a Freak.''\n  Quoting again from Dr. Centerwall, babies ``are born with an \ninstinctive capacity and desire to imitate adult human behavior.'' \nContinuing the quote, ``It is a most useful instinct, for the \ndeveloping child must learn and master a vast repertoire of behavior in \nshort order.'' The problem is that children do not possess an instinct \nfor gauging a priori whether a behavior ought to be imitated.\n  Therein, Mr. President, lies the problem. We should not hesitate to \nspeak out against things we feel are harmful to our children and to our \nsociety. The people that produce television and radio and newspapers \nhave a first amendment right; no doubt about that. We all hold it \nsacred. But we also have a constitutional guarantee of free speech as \ncitizens. We do not have to be Senators to have that right. Citizens \nhave that right in America. While our guarantee under the first \namendment allows programs such as these to exist, it also allows them \nto be criticized. Further, it allows us to encourage the corporations \nand businesses whose advertising dollars make these broadcasts possible \nto rethink their sponsorship. That is what I have been doing for at \nleast the last 5 years. If they do not rethink their sponsorship of \nthese programs, the first amendment and our marketplace allows us, as \nconsumers, to no longer support the products of the corporations that \nfund programs \n\n[[Page S 17446]]\nthat we find offensive. That is our right as citizens.\n  I believe that corporate executives need to pay attention to what \ntheir dollars are sponsoring, and I believe they need to rethink \nwhether or not they want their firms associated with many of these \nshows. Indeed, the point is not whether such shows can be shown on \ntelevision. They can be. We know that. The question is whether such \nshows should be on television. For too long, this second question has \nbeen ignored.\n  It appears that this question may finally be getting the attention it \ndeserves. In recent days, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington \nTimes, and NBC News have reported that companies, including Procter & \nGamble, the Nation's largest television advertiser, are withdrawing \ntheir advertising support from some daytime talk shows because they do \nnot meet company standards of quality and decency.\n  Mr. President, this is precisely the kind of corporate effort that \ncan have a significant impact on the content of television programming. \nAll of this is run by money, and if the money starts shifting, believe \nme, there will be a response. I applaud Procter & Gamble officials, and \nthose in other companies, who are beginning to realize--too slowly in \nmy view, but finally--that they have an obligation beyond getting \nrating points. They have a responsibility as citizens for the kind of \nAmerica we live in and how we raise our children.\n  As a final note, the heavy sexual content in soap operas, the \nexcessive gratuitous violence, profanity, and sex in prime time shows \nand, most importantly, the lack of parental supervision should not \nescape this debate over television. We all have our responsibilities. \nThese are aspects of television that are just as important as the \ncontent of the daytime talk shows.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken out before against these negative \naspects and I will have more to say in the months ahead.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we are in morning business now and we can \nfor a specific length of time, is that the way we are proceeding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17445-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17446-S17447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair. I want to return to the balanced \nbudget amendment discussions that we have had here previously. I \nlistened to some of the discourse that took place here. I thought there \nwas a lot of common sense here on the floor.\n  The Senator from Georgia spoke, the Senator from Nevada, the two \nSenators from Nebraska and others. I thought what was said here gives \nus ground for arriving at a very reasonable compromise in the days \nahead.\n  Clearly, the President will veto the balanced budget amendment. We \nall accept that. The question is, where do we go from here? Mr. \nPresident, I want to continue on the discussion that took place here \npreviously.\n  First of all, it seems to me to ask for the balanced budget in 7 \nyears is a reasonable request. I think the Republicans and indeed all \nof us have a sound basis for saying, ``Look, 7 years is not too early \nto balance this budget.'' So, I think it is quite proper for the \nRepublicans to hang firm on that particular position. I heard the \nSenator from Georgia say that 7 years is reasonable.\n  What about the other side? I heard discussion on the tax cut. I think \nit is perfectly reasonable for others to say we have to back off that \ntax cut. Now, should we back off to zero tax cut? Perhaps that is going \ntoo far. Perhaps we could settle on something in the neighborhood of \nwhat the President himself has discussed. As I recall, that was \nsomething in the area of $107 billion, if I am not mistaken.\n  I am not in favor of the tax cut, period, never have been. \nNonetheless, there are those, particularly in the other body, who feel \nvery, very strongly about having a tax cut. So, perhaps a suitable \ncompromise would be to back off to the area of the vicinity where the \nPresident himself discussed a tax cut.\n  What about some of the other areas? I certainly hope that those who \nhave discussed Medicare here will recognize that the 31.5 percent \npremium that we are now requiring for part B is a fair requirement, and \nit seems to me those who are talking about going down to 25 percent \nmust recognize that that has to be picked up by the general treasury. \nThat is where the money comes from.\n  All of us have to use some common sense and reasonableness here, but \nI have great difficulty understanding those who would want to take the \npremium, in effect, have it dropped--have those who are receiving the \nbenefits of Medicare, an entitlement that goes right across the board \nto everybody, rich or poor--to say that they are going to pay less for \ntheir part B premium. So I hope that we would agree on the 31.5 \npercent.\n  Now, I have not heard a dissenting voice that we should not go to the \naffluence testing. We can argue about that--whether it should be \n$50,000 for the individual and $100,000 for the married couple and \nphasing out--we can argue over that. Clearly, going to affluence \ntesting makes a lot of sense.\n  Now, the CPI. I hope we will do the recomputation of the CPI. That is \nperfectly fair. If we are paying too much, we ought to recognize it.\n  Another area that I think the Republicans should give ground on is on \nthe Medicaid and the reductions that are provided in that--reductions \nfrom rate of growth, yes; but I have grave concerns over whether in the \nMedicaid we are keeping a suitable safety net for those lower income \nindividuals in our society.\n  Yes, we are protecting children up through the age of 12 at 100 \npercent of poverty or less. But is that enough? As you know, now it \ngoes up every year so that we cover those at the age of 13, 14, and so \nforth up to the age of 18 by the year 2002.\n  I, personally, would hope we would go higher than the current \ncategory, which as I said is up to the age of 13 at 100 percent of \npoverty or less.\n  Mr. President, I think we have the ground here, from the discussions \nI have heard on the floor, for arriving at a reasonable compromise. To \nget any compromise, people have got to go in with a certain amount of \nflexibility.\n  If the Republicans say ``Not a nickel reduction in the tax cut that \nwe have provided,'' or if the Democrats say ``Nothing doing on the year \n2002; nothing doing there,'' if each of us get dug in, we will not get \nanywhere.\n  I think we have the basis here for a reasonable compromise. I hope \nthe administration and the negotiators from the House and the Senate \nwould pay attention to the suggestions made here on the floor today.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am delighted to hear our friend on the other side of the \naisle talk common sense, which seems to have been lacking here in much \nof the dialog over the last days. Many of us over here feel very \nstrongly that the issue of a tax cut in the face of this deficit is a \nmorality question, but I think the Senator from Rhode Island has \nappropriately suggested, we all need some flexibility.\n  I ask the Senator, then, does he not think, if there ought to be some \ntax cut, if that is part of the gospel here, does the Senator not agree \nthat at least that tax cut ought to be targeted toward those Americans \nwho can most benefit from it and also most need it?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. There is no question that that is right.\n  I must say as we start on this, if I could use a word of caution, I \nhope that we would avoid the word ``morality'' here, that one side is \nmoral and the other side is immoral. I do not want to pursue this too \nfar, but I think all of us have to watch our rhetoric--me, us on this \nside, all of us in this Chamber--if we are going to arrive at a \nsatisfactory resolution of these very difficult problems.\n  The answer to the question, have a tax cut to help those who most \nneed it--sure. Of course, we recognize those who most need it are not \npaying much of a tax to start with, so how much a reduction would be of \nassistance to those individuals, I do not know.\n  I think we also have to recognize--as I said before, I am not for the \ntax cut. But there are those who feel very, very deeply about it, \nparticularly in the other body. That does not mean that we cannot back \noff from the size of the tax cut that was proposed.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts has some suggestions on how we \ncould reduce the tax cut and make it directed \n\n[[Page S 17447]]\nmore toward the group he was suggesting, I think that sounds sensible \nto me.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe there was an effort on the floor \nto try to suggest that the tax cut ought to go to people--and I \nunderstand the Senator is absolutely correct, if you are talking about \nthe folks under $30,000 with the earned-income tax credit, you are \nobviously talking about a group of people who also need an additional \namount of money that comes in the form of a check at the lower end of \nthat scale in order to make it meaningful.\n  That is not what we are talking about. There was a suggestion on the \nfloor of the Senate that the tax cut ought to be limited to those \npeople earning $100,000 or less, and that can certainly be framed in a \ncombination of payroll credit-family credit or any combination thereof, \nbut at least in terms of keeping faith with the notion of fairness \nthere is a clear juxtaposition, is there not, between those earning \n$100,000 or less, a broad-based capital gains tax that might go to old \ninvestments versus new investments?\n  Or, for instance, an estate tax break that goes to people only with \n$600,000 or $700,000 of estate value. It seems those are difficult \nfairness issues to try to suggest to the American people that we are \napproaching this seriously.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts that we want \nto look at these. We want to be careful we are not giving tax breaks to \nthe very wealthy when we are trying to balance this budget.\n  One of the suggestions that has come up here as I understand is that \nwe really concentrate more on rewarding those who save. How can we do \nit? Should the interest on savings accounts be tax-exempt? Or reinstate \nthe IRA's for those who previously have been eclipsed because they had \npension plans of some kind?\n  All of those I think are fruitful ideas. All I am saying is, I think \nwe have the basis here for a resolution to this problem. Again, it will \nrequire all of us to back off from entrenched positions.\n  I hope that the Democrats would agree to the 7-year time schedule. I \nthink that is a reasonable request. If we cannot do this by the year \n2002, then we have real problems in this country.\n  We have no war. We are in peacetime. The country is relatively \nprosperous. Clearly, we ought to be able to pay our bills and have \noutgo match income in the year 2002.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from Rhode \nIsland his time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17446-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17447-S17449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, earlier today Bosnia was discussed on the \nfloor here. I wish to make a few remarks in that regard in the time \nallotted in morning business, because I think there is a great deal \nthat is misunderstood about the peace process and our involvement in it \nand what our relationship is to the talks going on in Dayton.\n  When we talk about the House, they had a lot of discussion in the \nHouse, and, of course, they had their vote over there, against any \ninvolvement in this or against going in militarily. But what has to be \nagreed to before we even get involved in any way, what has to be agreed \nto, is a complete peace agreement. It has to be agreed to, and not only \nagreed to but the firing has to have stopped before we move in.\n  There are those who, apparently, assume we are going to have to fight \nour way in to establish peace and establish a peace as Tito did during \nthe only period in modern history where there has been peace in \nYugoslavia. That was a militarily imposed peace on the whole country.\n  That is not the kind of peace we are talking about. There have to be \ntwo conditions met. First, there has to be an agreement. It has to be \nairtight. It has to be extremely detailed. It has to define exactly \nwhat the borders are. It has to define exactly which town is in what \nsector and what they have agreed to and signed up and said will be the \nnew formation of those cities, those newly emerging countries in that \narea. So that agreement they are trying to work out in Dayton right now \nhas to be in that fine a detail. It cannot be just a peace agreement \nthat says we will move in and we hope we can establish peace. ``Yes, \nUnited States and NATO, you come and we know this will all work out.'' \nIt is not that kind of agreement they are working toward. If I thought \nit was that kind of agreement, I would not be supporting this process \nwhatsoever.\n  What they are talking about is a very, very detailed agreement--\nspecific borders. Will this orchard be on this side? Whose territory \nwill it be in? Will the next farm be in somebody else's territory? Will \nthe road junction be in whose territory? That is the kind of detail \nthey are trying to work out on huge maps out there in Dayton. I would \nsay, it will be uphill at best that there will be any agreement coming \nout of that. I am still of the opinion that it is probably 60-40 \nagainst our ever being involved over there, because I doubt the parties \nwill be able to come to that kind of definitive outline on a map as to \nwho has what in their territory. It has to be that way or we should not \nget involved.\n  Second, the firing has to have stopped. The firing has to have \nceased. Obviously, the next question is, then, if they have that kind \nof commitment to peace, which they say they have, and that is the \nreason they are in Dayton talking, and they have come to a definitive \npeace agreement and firing has stopped, why does anybody need to go in?\n  We were over there recently, just 1 month ago this weekend. Four \nweeks ago this weekend I was part of the Senator Stevens' Codel over \nthere. We were briefed by our military leadership and by our people and \nU.N. people in Zagreb and Croatia. We flew into Sarajevo for a period \nof time, along with 21,000 pounds of peas on a C-130, and out again. We \nspent about half a day, which does not make us experts in that area, \nbut it was interesting to see it, anyway. Then we came back through \nBrussels and talked to our Ambassadors there.\n  But, when we were there, what we were so impressed with was there is \na desire for peace. That is what has started this whole thing. The \nparties themselves say they are tired of war. The parties themselves \nsay they want peace but are unable to get it. If we have the agreement \nand we have the cease-fire, why do we need to go? Here are the facts we \nwere told while we were over there.\n  It is estimated that about 20 to 50 percent of the people involved in \nthe fighting there are what they call the irregulars. They are not \npeople who are part of a regular, organized military militia that \naccepts commands from above or from Belgrade or anyplace else. They are \npeople who are the irregulars. They are the farmers who are out cutting \nhay one day. They go up to the lines, up to the next village where \nthere is a battle going on, they take a rifle from someone, they are in \nthe lines for 3 or 4 days while someone else goes back to cut their \nhay. They are the people who, in the 30-some cease-fires that there \nhave been over there so far, they are the ones who have violated the \ncease-fire because they basically do not take orders from anyone in \nparticular. So the firing starts again, it spreads, and we have had 30-\nsome cease-fires that have not worked. The fighting starts again.\n  What is contemplated, and what our role would be over there--if we go \nin, if there is the airtight agreement, if the firing has stopped--then \nthere would be zones set up between the parties along these borders, \nwell-defined borders, where there would be 2- to 4-kilometer width \nareas in this that would be patrolled or would be monitored by the NATO \nforces, of which we would be about one-third of the total NATO force. I \ndo not see that as being bad in that situation.\n  Now, if there is firing by these irregulars or anyone else, we would \nput it down immediately. We would hope, because of the massive show of \nforce we are putting in there, there would be no firing. If there is, \nit would be put down and put down immediately. It would be by NATO \nrules of engagement, not the U.N. rules of engagement. They are more of \na debating society than anything else. But NATO rules of engagement say \nif you are fired on, you can obliterate that source. I asked General \n\n[[Page S 17448]]\nJoulwan, would we be permitted to take out anybody who fired on any of \nthe NATO forces? Absolutely.\n  That is key to the whole thing. Will there be any risk? I suppose \nthere is. We have already had three people killed over there when we \nhad Frasure, Kruzel, and Drew, who were in a vehicle that slid off the \nroad and they were killed in the wreck. That is tragic. Our hearts go \nout to their families on this. I knew one of the gentlemen, Mr. Kruzel, \nin particular. It is a terrible thing that anybody is killed in a \nsituation like this.\n  But will there be any danger of accidents like that, or maybe \nsomebody getting killed? There might be. But I would also point out we \ndo not withdraw the Peace Corps from overseas, and the Peace Corps in \nits history has had 224 people who have died overseas. I was surprised \nit was that high a number. I would have thought it would have been a \nvery, very few, but the Peace Corps lost 224 people so far, to this \ndate, since its inception.\n  Like the old saying in aviation, ``How do you have complete, 100 \npercent aviation safety? You keep all the airplanes in the hangar. You \ndo not risk them.'' Yet we know how much good we have done around the \nworld by being involved to some extent. We have a Christian-Judeo \nheritage of helping people, alleviating suffering around the world. We \nsupply food, we send out AID programs. Of course, we cannot solve all \nthe world's problems, either with peaceful organizations or with the \nmilitary. But I think an American leadership in the world has been such \na force for good, I would hate to see us go back to trying to be an \nisolationist America.\n  I repeat once again, we have to have an agreement, airtight. The \nfiring has to have stopped. Then we go in with minimal risk, with our \nNATO allies, to try to keep that peace that has been eluding them so \nfar, basically because of the irregulars who do not honor these cease-\nfires.\n  Our leadership is important. We restored democracy in Haiti. In the \nprocess of doing that, of leading, we have been involved in bringing \npeace to the Middle East, working on it in Northern Ireland, we see \nRussian nuclear weapons are no longer aimed at our people. We secured \nthe indefinite extension of a Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which \nwas a big step forward. We achieved real progress toward a \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We reached an agreement with \nNorth Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. These are products of \nAmerican leadership, and that is just a little, partial list. We have \nseen democracies growing in South America because of our involvement \nthere.\n  I think the risk over there, in that Bosnian area, if it is done \npursuant to a well-thought-out agreement and a cease-fire, and we go in \nwith a preponderance of force that people understand is going to be \nused if they break the peace and if they fire--to me is well worth the \nrisk.\n  Much has been made out of the fact that we want to provide leadership \nfor NATO. I agree with that. I think our membership in NATO is very \nimportant. But that is not just the reason why we go in. That is \npointed to, sometimes, as the reason we go in, in effect saying, \n``There go our NATO people. We better rush out and lead them, because \nwe are the biggest factor in NATO.''\n  I will not agree with that. NATO has to be right. Let us judge this \non whether it is right to go in, or wrong to go in, and try to get \npeace in that area where peace has not taken root for so long, and \nwhere some of the actions that have happened there in the past have \nliterally been the sparks that set off two world wars. So, if we can \nbring peace to that area, to me it is well worth the risk.\n  NATO leadership, I think, is, important, and NATO has been looked at \nby too many Americans, I believe, as just some sort of a remnant of the \ncold war, and let us forget it and move out of NATO. Is it still \nimportant? I do believe NATO is important. It is important. NATO \nleadership is what is moving us into the organization for security and \ncooperation in Europe working with the European Union. We have a \nPartnership for Peace, which is in its fledgling days but becoming more \nand more important. The North Atlantic Cooperation Council was formed \nin 1991. That is moving ahead, and really is a good force for peace in \nthat part of the world. We are the biggest factor in NATO. I think it \nis important that we retain that. But I do not see our leadership of \nNATO as just being the only reason we should move into that particular \narea.\n  I know my time is up. Do not forget for 1 minute that we have to have \nan airtight agreement. We have to have a cease-fire, and on that basis \nwe move in to try to give peace a chance in that very, very tough area \nof the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are in \nmorning business under a 10-minute rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President I wanted to respond to the Senator from \nRhode Island and some others today. I found his remarks to be \nparticularly interesting and helpful, and, as is often the case, I find \nmyself agreeing with a fair amount of what he says. He is sensible, and \nmoderate, which is probably difficult for many these days. I saw a \ncartoon recently in which someone was pointing at someone else and \nsaying ``There is no room for moderates here.'' The fact is that there \nis a lot of room for moderates. There are moderates in both political \nparties who generally do not view things from the extremes and who want \nto solve problems. I hope we will find a way, using some common sense, \nto engage in an attempt to find solutions to some of the vexing \nproblems we have in this country.\n  The Senator from Georgia was on the floor talking about trash \ntelevision a few moments ago. My sense is that people in this country \nare concerned about two principal areas, and he hit on one of those. \nOne is economic security. The fact is that many Americans are having \nmore trouble finding a job, and many others are finding that their \nwages are declining. Sixty percent of American families are working \nharder for less money and are losing income. This means less economic \nsecurity. I think people are very concerned about that.\n  They are also concerned about the diminution of values--the lowering \nof standards in this country. And part of that relates to trash \ntelevision and violence on television. We can do something about some \nof these things, but not all of them. We must address some of the \nissues in the home and in the community. But some of these problems \nrepresent public policy areas as well.\n  In the area of economic security, one of the things that is often \ndiscussed--and one that I agree with--is that we have to put our fiscal \nhouse in order at some point. We cannot continue to run enormous debts \nyear after year. We cannot spend money we do not have forever.\n  I would not have a problem if next year we spent $400 billion we did \nnot have--and therefore incur a deficit next year of $400 billion--if \nwith that $400 billion we cured cancer just like that. I would say that \nwas a pretty good investment. You amortize that over the next 40, 50, \n70 years, and it would be worth paying off the $400 billion deficit \nincurred to cure cancer.\n  But that is not what these deficits are about. These are systemic \ndeficits in the operating budgets of this country. You cannot continue \nthat. You must address it.\n  That is why I said last evening that I commend the majority party for \na reconciliation bill that contains some things that are good. It \ncontains some awful things as well, and I think some bad priorities. I \nam glad the President is going to veto it. I do not support it. But it \nhas a good number of things that make a lot of sense. There are a good \nnumber of things in that reconciliation bill that both sides would \nagree to. But there are some major elements of the reconciliation bill \nthat must be changed because, as we address the deficit in this \ncountry--and ultimately we must do it together--we must find a \ncompromise. We should not ask the portion of the American people who \nhave the least to bear the biggest burden of all the spending cuts, and \nthen turn to the small portion of those who \n\n[[Page S 17449]]\nhave the most and give them the largest share of the tax cuts. We have \nto try to fix some of those things.\n  With respect to where we are today, the shutdown ought to end. The \nreconciliation bill is passed. The President is going to veto it. \nNegotiations, in my judgment, ought to begin immediately to try to find \na solution to the impasse and a solution to the reconciliation bill. \nThe question ought not be whether we have a reconciliation bill. The \nquestion is not whether we address the budget deficit and lead to a \nbalanced budget. The question is, how do we do that? Not whether, but \nhow?\n  There is no good reason, in my judgment, to have a continued \ngovernment shutdown. There is no juice left in that lemon for anybody--\nnot for any political party, and not for any political leader. This \nshutdown does not make any sense.\n  I probably contribute to some of the concerns about the language that \nhas been used during the shutdown. I read on the floor statements by \nthe Speaker of the House, who in April said, ``We are going to create a \ntitanic standoff and shut down the Government.'' Those are the facts. \nHowever, I am not saying that only one party is at fault here. The fact \nis that there is lots of room for blame. There has been lots of \nlanguage uttered in these past few days that has caused a lot of chaos \nin the political system. But we find ourselves in a circumstance where \nwe have people who say it is either our way or it is no way. If you do \nnot do it our way, we will shut the Government down. The fact is \nGovernment works by consent. This is a democracy. For 200 years we have \nhad impasses over wars, over depressions, over dozens and dozens of \nvexing, troublesome issues. The way those impasses have been solved is \nthat people with good will, with common sense, have come together and \nsaid, ``Let us reason. Let us find a way to meet the goal, to work out \nthis problem together.''\n  I want to mention a couple of things that were in the reconciliation \nbill which causes a lot of problems.\n  Medicare--do we need to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare and \nMedicaid? Yes, we do. Not just in Medicare and Medicaid but in the \nprice of health care generally for families, for businesses, for \ngovernments. The price of health care, the escalation of health care \ncosts year after year somehow has to be addressed. But no one can any \nlonger believe that what is in this reconciliation bill will address \nthe price escalation in Medicare by saying to senior citizens you will \nhave the same quality health care and you will not pay more for it. \nEveryone understands this approach means senior citizens will get less \nand pay more.\n  The tax cut--many of us feel very strongly that the facts show every \ndollar of this tax cut will be borrowed. I would love to have somebody \ncome and explain why that is not true. Regrettably, it is true. Every \ndollar of the proposed $245 billion tax cut will be borrowed and will \nadd to the national debt, which adds to the burden of those children we \nhave been talking about.\n  On the car radio on the way in this morning, I heard a woman who had \ncalled the radio to talk about the shutdown. She said both of her \nparents, regrettably, have to go to a nursing home, one because of \nAlzheimer's and one who had a stroke. They have been there 5 years and \nstarted out with an asset base of $400,000 to $600,000. Now much of \nthat is gone. She called and said, ``My worry is for when their assets \nare gone--and I believe that their assets should be used to pay for \ntheir care--my parents will not have an entitlement to Medicaid.'' When \ntheir assets are gone, under this new proposal, they will not have \nguaranteed coverage under Medicaid. That will be up to the States. \nMaybe the States will decide that nursing home care is an entitlement \nfor her parents. Maybe not. She was worried about that.\n  That is a significant change. That was in this budget reconciliation \nbill. I mentioned last evening the differences in spending priorities \nthat have been talked about and for which the CR was fought over this \nweekend--cuts of 40 percent out of a little program called Star \nSchools; only $25 million is spent on Star Schools and that will be cut \nby 40 percent. The bill the Senate passed the other day, which I voted \nagainst, doubles the amount of money spent on star wars despite the \nfact that is was not requested by the Pentagon.\n  I think these priorities are wrong. I do not say that in a pejorative \nway. I say that in my judgment we can do a lot better for this country \nthan those priorities.\n  I mentioned yesterday that in this thick reconciliation plan, there \nare two little things buried--among dozens and dozens--that I bet \nnobody in the Chamber knew about. One is a provision to repeal the \nalternative minimum tax provisions we put in place in 1986. That little \nthing that nobody knows about means that 2,000 corporations will \nreceive $7 million each in tax cuts.\n  Let me say that again: 2,000 corporations will receive a tax cut of \n$7 million each.\n  Another little provision is labeled 956(A). I bet no one in the \nChamber knows what it is. Well, it deals with the repeal of the \ncircumstance of deferral with respect to income that is deferred for \ntax purposes by foreign subsidiaries of American corporations. They \nhave the money over there. Now, we have certain passive rules that say \nyou have to repatriate the money you pay taxes on. This little nugget \nin here says we are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to \ntell those companies that have moved jobs overseas, moved jobs out of \nthis country: By the way, we are going to reward you even more for it.\n  Those things do not make any sense. We ought not vote for a bill that \nincludes things like that.\n  I bet there is no one in the Senate who knew that provision was in \nthat plan. I am talking about a couple little provisions--there are \ndozen and dozens and dozens of those little nuggets-- that say to big \ninterests, special interests: Guess what? It is time to smile. We are \noffering up to you an enormous reward at a time when we say to kids, we \ndo not have room for you in the Head Start Program; at a time when we \nsay to kids benefiting from the Star Schools Program that we are sorry, \nyou are going to have to cut back.\n  My point is that this debate is about priorities and choices. All of \nus, it seems to me, in the coming days can do better. And I stand here \nas one who says let us balance the budget. Let us do it the right way. \nLet us all engage in debate about choices and agree. Seven years is \njust fine with me. In fact, we could do it within 5 if the Federal \nReserve Board will take the boot off the neck of Americans and allow us \na little economic growth. But let us discuss it together--the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island is absolutely right--use some common sense and do the \nright thing for this country.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17447-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17449-S17451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to pick up, if I may, where \nthe Senator from North Dakota leaves off.\n  He talked about the dozens and dozens of nuggets that are in this \nbill. I know my colleague from Massachusetts is going to talk about \nsome of those specific items. I would like to speak for a moment, if I \nmay, about the word that the Senator from North Dakota kept using about \npriorities.\n  I wish to emphasize, as I think every Democrat wants to emphasize, \nthis debate is not about whether to balance the budget. We keep hearing \nRepublican friends come to the floor, and they keep saying we have to \ndo this because this is the only way to balance the budget. If we do \nnot do this, the Democrats will not balance the budget. They do not \nwant to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, this is not the only way to balance the budget. That \nis what this fight is about. And, indeed, the majority of Democrats \nhave voted to balance the budget, balance it in 7 years--balance the \nbudget. We voted for a 9-year balancing of the budget. The balancing of \nthe budget is not what is at issue before America today. What is at \nissue is what choices will we make as we balance it.\n  Now, it is uncontested--every analysis of our economy shows--that \nthose Americans we keep talking about, the Americans who work every day \nthe hardest, the people who go and punch in a clock or the people who \nare the nitty-gritty of the production of goods in this country, are \nworking harder, and they are making less money for their effort. They \nhave less ability to \n\n[[Page S 17450]]\npurchase, less ability to buy the new car, less ability to send their \nkid to get a decent education. Those are the people we ought to be \nfighting for. That is the majority of Americans. But the majority of \nAmericans do not make out in this bill that was passed as well as \npeople at the upper end of our scale.\n\n  That is just not fair. I am at the upper end of the scale. Most of us \nin the Senate are at the upper end of the scale. The minute you get a \nU.S. Senator's salary, unsupplemented by anything else, you are up to \nthe top tiny digits of wage earners in America. The truth is that we do \nbetter in this bill than the average American, and that is disgraceful. \nThat is not what we were sent here to do. We ought to be able to go \nhome and look people in the eye and say, ``You are going to do as well \nor better.'' We cannot do that.\n  I know all the arguments are made, well, this is going to help people \nin the long term because it is going to reduce their income taxes, \nultimately it is going to lower the interest rates.\n  I agree that it can do all that. Balancing the budget can do all \nthat. But I do not know any American--nobody in Massachusetts has come \nup to me and said, ``Senator, I want to live next to a Superfund site. \nI want to live next to a toxic waste site.'' But for some reason, in \nthis budget the money to clean up those sites is reduced.\n  I do not know anybody who has come to me in any community in \nMassachusetts and said, ``I don't think that people who have a drug \naddiction shouldn't get treatment.'' In fact, for all the rhetoric in \nthe Senate about crime, 70 percent of the people in jail today are \nthere on a drug-related offense or they are on drugs. If you want to \ndeal with drugs in America, you are going to have to have drug \ntreatment. And yet this budget cuts drug treatment.\n  This budget cuts safe schools and drug-free schools money. I do not \nunderstand that. I do not understand how you make those cuts and turn \naround and give somebody with a $5 million asset base over $1 million \nworth of tax break.\n  I used the word ``moral'' earlier. I do not want to offend anybody. \nIt is not only my word. I have heard people like Pete Peterson, whom I \nrespect enormously, former Commerce Secretary, Paul Tsongas, Warren \nRudman of the Concord Coalition, they use that word, because if you \nhave a $245 billion tax break, which you have, you are effectively \nborrowing $300 billion of money from future taxpayers and shifting it \nto current taxpayers.\n  That is the very thing that supposedly this budget is geared to \naddress. The whole purpose of balancing the budget today is to stop \nborrowing, and yet we are going to borrow in order to give this tax \nbreak to the people who least need it.\n\n  This is a question of priorities. How do you explain to people in a \nnursing home, who are senior, that they are now going to have to become \ndestitute and live under a whole new set of standards because in order \nto allow the nursing homes to meet the expectations of being able to \nreduce the cost, we are not going to do it in a sort of sensible, \nhumane way; we are going to do it by changing the standards in nursing \nhomes so that the people who own the nursing homes do not have to live \nup to the same standard of the provision of care so they can reduce the \ncost.\n  This is about priorities. It is about what do we care about.\n  One of the most egregious things that happens in America, has \nhappened in the last 13 years, is that those people at the bottom end \nof the income scale, the bottom 20 percent saw their income go down \nover the last 13 years 17 percent. The next 20 percent of Americans saw \ntheir income go down 4 percent. The middle two percentiles of Americans \nstayed about the same. And the top quintile of Americans went up 105 \npercent in income.\n  In a country that is increasingly competing against a world \nmarketplace where information is power, where skill comes through your \neducation level, where the kind of job you can have and the kind of \nincome you can earn comes through your access to education, to be \nmaking it harder for Americans to get that education is simply \ninexplicable.\n  But that is what this bill does. It is going to make about 1,200 of \nour educational institutions drop out of direct lending. About 1.8 \nmillion students are going to be dropped off of student loans. And many \nof us have been visited--the senior Senator from Massachusetts and I \nhave been visited by our University of Massachusetts folks, who tell us \nthat they are literally going to have kids drop out of school as a \nconsequence of the increase in student loan costs because it is that \nmarginal for them, their ability to be able to go to school in the \nfirst place.\n  So, Mr. President, I share the feeling of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. There is a middle ground here. I absolutely agree with him. We \nmust reduce the rate of growth in entitlements. We cannot have it both \nways. And we cannot talk out of both sides of our mouth. I voted for a \nbill that reduced Medicare and reduced Medicaid, but not three times \nwhat the trustees tell us we need.\n  I hope that my friend from Rhode Island and others on the Republican \nside would agree, look, there are 100 Senators here, you cannot come to \nthe floor of the Senate and have 20 people decide, or 30 people, that \nit is just going to be their way. We have to have some compromise. We \nare prepared on our side, I know, to compromise on things that we do \nnot necessarily agree with completely in the hopes that we will not \nwind up with such a lopsided, unfair, and, frankly, unwise approach to \nthe problems of this country.\n  We need to raise the income of Americans. And we are going to have to \ntrain them and educate them to do that. I know there is nobody on the \nother side of the aisle more committed to doing that than the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. I must say to my friend from Rhode Island, I would \nlove to do it in 7 years. I am prepared to commit to 7 years, if we can \nfind a reasonable agreement on what you base your numbers on. But if \nsomebody comes to me and says, Senator, we could balance this budget in \n8\\1/2\\ years or 8 years, we can balance it fairly, and we can also \nprovide drug treatment to 50 percent more drug addicts and we can also \nsend 2.5 million more kids to college, I will go for that. And I think \na lot of people here would go for that.\n  I will tell you something. Most Americans would go for that. \nAmericans want truth and common sense. They are tired of rigid \nintuition-ordained 7-year goals. They want this place to legislate on \nthe basis of honesty and common sense. And my prayer is that in the \nnext few hours we will get the Government of this country back to work \nand we will sit down like adults and come to an agreement about what \nthe best interests of this Nation are.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                     Order for Recess Until 4 P.M.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. \nChafee], the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota [Mr. Grams], the Senate stand in recess until 4 p.m., \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the remarks of the \nSenator from Massachusetts and appreciate the thoughtfulness of his \napproach to this situation. It seems to me that while each side has to \nexercise some common sense in all of this, I really do think that there \nis an underlying thrust that we must not forget, and that is, that we \nfeel very strongly on this side of the aisle that we have to reach a \nzero deficit situation.\n  We believe in the year 2002. And it seems to me, as I have stated \nbefore, that is a reasonable goal. And I have heard the Democratic \nsenior Senator from Georgia say that is a reasonable goal. And I think \nwe all ought to agree that the year 2002 is something that is \nattainable and that it is fair, that we all concur in that.\n  Now, on the other side of the aisle they feel strongly that there \nshould not be a tax cut at all, or if there is going to be a tax cut, \nit should be of a far lower nature than we have proposed on this side. \nTo me, that is fair for \n\n[[Page S 17451]]\nthem to make that request. And I think we have to back off on this side \non the size of the tax cut that we are seeking.\n  But I would hope this, Mr. President--I know there are going to be \nother speakers, and I know the senior Senator from Massachusetts has \nsome charts prepared, and we are ready for all the evils, to hear about \nall the evils of the deficit reduction bill that we passed last \nevening. All right. We are used to that. But I would hope that whoever \nspeaks on this floor will say how he or she is going to reach a zero \ndeficit. It is all right to criticize what we have done. And I suppose \nyou can come up with 35 items of how what we passed last evening was \nnot correct. All right. That is fair game. But in return, I would hope \nthat the critics come up with how they would do it, and in what year, \nand how and where the savings are going to come from.\n  Is it going to be a CPI adjustment, or is it going to be keeping the \nMedicare part B premium at 31.5 percent, or is it going to be a \nreduction in that, all of which costs money, if you change? How is that \nindividual or those individuals proposing that we reach this zero \ndeficit? I think that is a fair requirement for us to impose on the \ncritics of the plan that we passed last evening.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17449-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17451-S17454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am very hopeful that we can reach a satisfactory \ncompromise today on the legislation needed to end this indefensible \nshutdown of the Federal Government and move on to the real debate over \nwhat this controversy is all about.\n  We all agree on the need to balance the Federal budget. The \nfundamental issue is not whether or when to balance it, but how to \nbalance it fairly.\n  President Clinton is right to take a strong stand against the \nRepublican plan. That plan is based on the same old Republican trickle-\ndown ideology of plums for the rich and crumbs for everyone else. The \nRepublican plan is filled to overflowing with tax breaks for the \nwealthy and give-aways to powerful special interest groups. And to pay \nfor all those give-aways, the Republican plan imposes heavy burdens on \nsenior citizens, students, the needy, the environment, and working \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet.\n  The American people did not vote for priorities like that in 1994, \nand they are not going to vote for priorities like that in 1996.\n  You cannot judge the Republican book by its title. They call it the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995. That soothing title is a fraud. The \nRepublican budget is a scorched-earth scheme that imposes unprecedented \nsacrifices on senior citizens, students, children, and working families \nin order to pay for lavish tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals \nand corporations in America. It is a program to bash Medicare, slash \neducation, and trash the environment, and it eminently deserves the \nveto it is about to get.\n  The Republican budget raids private pension funds, and slams the door \nof colleges and universities on the sons and daughters of working \nfamilies. It dumps over a million more children into poverty in the \nmisguided Republican version of welfare reform.\n  It even raises taxes--yes, raises taxes--on those who can least \nafford it--the lowest income working Americans.\n  I hope all those Florida Republicans who are voting in their straw \npoll today will ask why Senator Dole and Senator Gramm want to raise \ntaxes on working Americans. How very Republican--tax breaks for the \nwealthiest families, and tax increases for working families.\n  And for the wealthiest families of all, the Republicans leave no \nstone unturned. All year, Democrats have tried to close the most \nnotorious tax loophole of all--the billionaire's tax loophole. That \nloophole lets wealthy Americans renounce their American citizenship and \nevade their fair share of taxes on the massive wealth they have \naccumulated in America.\n  It is difficult to imagine a more obscene or less justified loophole. \nEvery time we have challenged it in the Senate, the Senate has voted \nalmost unanimously to close it tight--no ifs, ands, or buts.\n  But once again, behind closed doors, the Republicans have quietly \nsaved it. The billionaire's tax loophole is alive and well in this \nRepublican bill. Shame on the Republicans for catering to billionaires \nand clobbering senior citizens on Medicare.\n  The Republican attack on Medicare is unprincipled and unconscionable. \nNothing in their budget better illustrates the harsh and extreme \napproach the Republicans are taking to the needs of the elderly. Every \nsenior citizen in Florida voting in the straw poll today should vote \nfor ``None of the Above'' if they care about Medicare.\n  Under the Republican budget, Medicare is cut $270 billion over 7 \nyears, three times the amount necessary to protect the Medicare trust \nfund, in order to finance $245 billion in new tax breaks for wealthy \nAmericans.\n  Medicare part B premiums are raised by $52 billion over the next 7 \nyears, compared to what they would be under current law. Premiums will \nrise from $553 this year to $1,068 by the year 2002. Every senior \ncitizen will pay $2,240 more than under current law. Elderly couples \nwill pay $4,480 more.\n  Senior citizens will be coerced into giving up their own doctor. They \nwill be herded into HMO's or forced to join other private insurance \nplans. They will lose the current protection that prevents doctors from \ncharging more than Medicare will pay--that change alone means \nadditional costs to elderly patients of $5 billion a year.\n  The Medicare cuts are so deep that they will ``jeopardize the ability \nof hospitals to deliver quality care, not just to those who rely on \nMedicare and Medicaid, but to all Americans,'' according to a statement \nby organizations representing 5,000 hospitals nationwide. Cuts in \nresearch and medical education will be devastating to the quality of \nhealth care in communities across the Nation.\n  Medicaid will bear a heavy burden too. It will be cut by $160 billion \nover 7 years. By 2002, Medicaid will be cut by a full one-third.\n  And 4.4 million children will lose coverage; 1.4 million disabled \nwill lose coverage; 920,000 seniors will lose coverage. Guarantees of \ncoverage and services will be eliminated.\n  Nursing home standards will be weakened, despite a 98 to 1 Senate \nvote to maintain them. Families will be forced into poverty by high \nnursing home costs. States will be allowed to recover the cost of \nnursing care from adult children with incomes in excess of $36,000 \nannually. States will be allowed to put liens on the homes of nursing \nhome residents, even if spouses or children are living there, despite a \nvote by the Senate to eliminate these provisions.\n  In a shameful giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry, the bipartisan \nMedicaid drug rebate program is weakened, at a cost to taxpayers and \npatients of $1 billion a year, despite a vote by the Senate to preserve \nthis program.\n  Federal clinical lab standards to ensure the accuracy of medical \ntests are eliminated.\n  On education, the Republican budget cuts the Federal investment in \neducation by one third over 7 years. We should be investing more in \neducation, not less, How can every Republican possibly justify an \nassault like that on education.\n  Student loans are cut by $4.9 billion, at a time when student \nfinancial need is greater than ever. College costs are rising faster \nthan family income. Grants make up less than one quarter of Federal \naid. Student debt is skyrocketing. The average student leaves college \nowing $9,000. Many graduate and professional students owe over $100,000 \nbefore they start their first job.\n  The Republican budget is a triumph of special interests over student \ninterests. It is rigged to funnel over $100 billion in new business to \nbanks and money-lenders at the expense of colleges and students.\n  It is hard to find a more vivid or disgraceful example of the \nprostitution of Republican principles. When profits are at stake, \nRepublicans are more than willing to roll over and sell out free-market \ncompetition, and replace it with the heavy hand of a government-\nguaranteed monopoly.\n  Under the Republican bill, beginning next year, only 102 colleges \nwill be allowed to participate in direct lending. \n\n[[Page S 17452]]\n1,250 colleges and 1.8 million students already in the program will be \nforced out of direct lending against their will.\n  In Massachusetts alone, 32 colleges and universities and almost \n100,000 students will be required by law to give up the advantages of \ndirect lending. They will be required to return to the bureaucratic \nmaze of the old guaranteed loan program, where 7,000 lenders and 41 \nguaranty agencies bury students in redtape. Students at Boston \nUniversity, MIT Mount Holyoke, Springfield Technical and Community \nCollege, and many others, will be forced out of direct lending.\n  Colleges and universities across the country are outraged at being \nforced out of one of the most successful reforms in the history of \nFederal aid to education. And 472 colleges and universities across the \ncountry have written urging Congress to reject this arbitrary limit on \ntheir ability to choose the loan program that best serves their \nstudents.\n  Over 100 of the colleges that signed the letter are not in direct \nlending. But they recognize its benefit for their students too. As they \nput it:\n\n       Those of us who represent institutions that are satisfied \n     with the guaranteed student loan program also support the \n     continued availability of the direct loan program to \n     institutions. The competition created by direct lending has \n     induced banks and guarantors to improve the efficiency of \n     their delivery process, and has, for the first time, provided \n     the student loan industry with market-based incentives to \n     provide better service. The guaranteed student loan system \n     has improved more since the phase-in of direct lending two \n     years ago than it did over the more than two decades of \n     existence prior to 1993.\n\n  The colleges in direct lending speak first-hand of its benefits for \ntheir students--simplified applications, the expedited receipt of \nfunds, the disappearance of the endless lines of students waiting to \nendorse their checks at registration time, the welcome drop in the \nnumber of emergency loans issued to students waiting to hear about \ntheir regular loans from their banks, and fewer trips to the financial \naid office to clean up redtape.\n  As these colleges write:\n\n       Direct lending has eliminated redundant paperwork, reduced \n     staff time allocated to dealing with thousands of lenders and \n     dozens of guarantors and other intermediaries, and vastly \n     improved our overall aid delivery processes because it \n     seamlessly integrates with other federal aid programs.\n\n  The issue does not get much clearer. Colleges and universities across \nthe country are unanimous. The student loan system needs more \ncompetition, not less. Banks and guaranty agencies do not deserve this \nprotection. The guaranteed loan program is not a free market program to \nbegin with. The banks and guaranty agencies reap all the profits and \ntake none of the risks, because Uncle Sam is guaranteeing the loans.\n  Direct lending also saves money for the taxpayer if honest accounting \nis used. It is a measure of the special interests' power that they have \neven managed to corrupt the budget scoring process. They persuaded the \nRepublican majority in Congress to include a provision in the budget \nresolution forcing the Congressional Budget Office to score this issue \ndishonestly, and thereby show savings to the Federal budget of $775 \nmillion over 7 years capping direct lending at 10 percent. An honest \naccounting would show that eliminating direct lending costs--costs the \nFederal Government almost $1.5 billion. Not only are the Republicans \ndoing the wrong thing, they are actually increasing the deficit to do \nit. You cannot blame President Clinton for rejecting CBO scoring, when \nRepublicans rig CBO scoring so shamelessly.\n  It is unconscionable for the Republican majority to use their \nmajority power to undermine education and protect the profits of banks \nand guaranty agencies. Few issues in this budget debate more clearly \ndemonstrate whose side Democrats are on, and whose side Republicans are \non. Democrats are proud to stand with families struggling to educate \ntheir children. Republicans are content to cast their lot with the \nwell-connected few, and thumb their nose at colleges and students.\n  On pensions, protections in current law are weakened to allow a raid \nof $20 billion on workers' pension funds by large corporations and \ncorporate raiders. This provision was eliminated from the Senate bill \nby a 94 to 5 vote, but has now been restored behind Republican closed \ndoors.\n  On children, the Republican budget slashes essential safety-net \nprograms for low-income children and families by $82 billion.\n  The Republican budget slashes essential child care funding and \neliminates health and safety protections for children in child care. \nMany more children will be left home alone and countless others will \nfind themselves in danger.\n  The Republican budget slashes $6 billion from school lunch programs. \nIt slashes $9 billion from benefits that allow one million children \nwith disabilities to continue to live at home with their families.\n  In page after page of their legislation, Republicans offer an open \nhand to powerful special interests and the back of their hand to \neveryone else.\n  As people learn more and more about the Republicans' agenda, they \nlike it less and less. They understand why this battle is so important. \nWe are talking about fundamental principles and the kind of country we \nwant to be in the years ahead.\n  It is wrong for the Republicans to slash Medicare in order to pay for \ntax breaks for the wealthy. It is wrong for Republicans to slash \neducation and raid employee pension funds. It's wrong for Republicans \nto dismantle the basic bipartisan environmental protections we've \nenacted to keep the air clean, to keep the water clean, to keep our \nfood safe.\n  The American people did not vote for priorities like that in 1994--\nand they will certainly be voting against priorities like that in 1996.\n  Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to my friend and \ncolleague from Rhode Island talking about the state of the American \neconomy and who is really serious in this Chamber and which political \nparty has been serious about dealing with the budget of the United \nStates. Of course, he understands very well that when the Republicans \ncame into power in 1980 there was $460 billion in deficit, and when the \nRepublicans left power in 1992 it was $4.4 trillion.\n  All during that period of time the moneys which were actually \nappropriated by Democratic Congresses was less than was requested by a \nRepublican President. So, we are very glad that our Republican friends \nwant to get serious about the deficit now. But I think as we are \ntalking about this issue, and as we have listened to a President who \nsays that he is committed to a balanced budget, we are also paying \nattention to a President who initiated a proposal that passed this body \nwithout a single vote from the Republicans that has paid off $600 \nbillion of the deficit, something that has already been done, an \nachievement and accomplishment, not just particular rhetoric. And there \nwas not a single Republican vote that was for it.\n  In the last few days we hear our Republican friends chide the \nPresident and say, ``Well, he really didn't mean it now. And so we're \ngoing to try to take care of it.'' But I have yet to hear one Senator \non that side of the aisle say that we wish that was repealed and how \nthey would make up the $600 billion which has already been paid off on \nthe deficit. They have not talked about that. They have not mentioned \nthat.\n  All they do is continue along to try and reach the legitimate \nconcerns that the American people have in trying to bring the economic \nhouse in order, and very little time is spent, quite frankly, in \nreviewing how they would do that. And that is basically the issue that \nis before this body. The Democrats have, under President Clinton, \nreduced the Federal deficit by $600 billion. The Republicans have \ntalked about it. And now we have a President that is committed, and all \nof us are moving toward the balanced budget.\n  But I want to point out very clearly, Mr. President, that it \ncertainly will not be this way. It certainly will not be this way. It \nwill not be the way of cutting back on the Medicare opportunities for \nour senior citizens, the $270 billion that is going to be required to \nbe paid by our senior citizens, with increased out-of-pocket costs for \nall of our seniors in this country over this period of time, and the \n$245 billion in tax breaks.\n  There is only one tax that has been increased, Mr. President, in this \nwhole proposal, only one tax that has been increased, and it is the \nearned-income tax credit. And who does that apply to? Does that apply \nto the billionaires? Oh, \n\n[[Page S 17453]]\nno. The billionaires were taken care of. We voted in here to eliminate \nthe billionaire's tax loophole. For those who do not understand it, it \nsays, if you have been able to accumulate $3 million or $4 million or \n$5 million or $600 million, or up to even $1 billion, or even more, you \ncan escape your payment into the Federal Treasury by renouncing your \ncitizenship, renouncing your citizenship, escape payment, become a \nBenedict Arnold, escape payment and, what happened? This body went on \nrecord by over 92 or 93 Senators that said we ought to close that \nloophole, no ifs, ands, or buts. We had statements and comments by the \nmembers of the Finance Committee that it was going to be closed at the \nearliest opportunity. Many of us required a vote to make sure that that \nwas going to be done, and members fell over themselves trying to go on \nrecord and say, ``We are not going to permit that unseemly, \nunconscionable practice to continue.''\n\n  And then what happens? You hardly get the doors closed over there in \nthat conference committee, and what comes out? The billionaire's tax \nloophole; cuts in Medicare for our seniors and the billionaire's tax \nloophole that will take hundreds of millions, billions of dollars out \nof the Federal Treasury to benefit a handful of individuals, and you \nwant us to just go behind the screen--``We're for the balanced budget \nand you're not.''\n  Let us look at what this budget is. You are increasing the taxes on \nthose individuals who are making less than $35,000, and a giveaway to \nthe billionaires. That is in here--charging our senior citizens, \nelderly people who are unsure, wondering whether their health care \ncoverage is really going to be there, wondering about all these \nstatements that are being made about Social Security and seeing their \ncost-of-living adjustment eaten up next year by the premiums that will \nbe advanced under this proposal; cutting back on Social Security, \ncutting back on the Medicare protections, cutting back on veterans' \nprotections, moving many of our senior citizens out of the fee for \nservice where they know their doctors into these plan programs.\n  This is a beauty, Mr. President. This is an absolute beauty. Under \nthe current law, we prohibit double billing. What is double billing? \nDouble billing says if the repayment is going to be a certain number of \ndollars under Medicare, that is what the doctor will take for that \nparticular procedure, paid in full.\n  But you just look, there are a couple of lines in this Republican \nbudget that says, ``That isn't going to be the way it is anymore. That \nisn't the way it is going to be anymore, Mr. Senior Citizen,'' who has \nworked so hard to build this country and make it the great country it \nis. That is not the way it is going to be anymore. Those doctors can \ncharge you in addition--in addition. We have 70 percent of the seniors \nat an income of $15,000 and 83 percent of them are below $25,000, who \nare paying more out of pocket now in terms of health care because we do \nnot cover prescription drugs, we do not cover dental care, we do not \ncover foot care, we do not cover eye care.\n\n  Go into any senior citizen home in any part of the country and ask \nhow many are paying $50 a month for prescription drugs and see half the \nhands in the hall go up. That is what is happening out there, eating \naway at scarce resources. And now those 35 million Americans who \nparticipate in Social Security and Medicare are wondering, ``Look, they \nare squeezing me on Social Security; if I am a veteran, they squeeze \nthose benefits; Medicare, they are squeezing benefits and if I get sick \nand lose all my money and go into a nursing home, they have done \nsomething wonderful as well.'' Instead of the payment in full for the \nnursing home, they say the nursing home can charge you in addition to \nthat, too. First time. That is what is in this bill. That is what is \nbehind this bill. Make no mistake, those are some of the offensive \naspects of this bill. They will raise the funds on senior citizens who \nare poor to qualify for Medicaid and put a lien on their homes, take \ntheir homes away from them.\n  That is what is in this bill. Just a few words change, just a few \nsentences change. That is what is in their bill.\n  No wonder the seniors are frightened. We hear from the other side, \n``Don't frighten our senior citizens.'' They ought to know what is in \nhere. That is the kind of assault on senior citizens that is \nunwarranted and unjustified and you do not have to balance this budget \non the backs of the senior citizens. You do not have to.\n  You are frightening the whole framework of retirement and security of \nour senior citizens. That is what you are doing.\n  After a recognition over a long period of time and after Medicare \nbeing passed in the mid-1960's, a recognition that our elderly people \nearn less in their later years and health care needs go up more in \ntheir later years, that was true then, it is true now. That may be an \nold idea, but I daresay it is still a fundamental value for our \nsociety.\n  I would like to see those who want to offer and have the guts to \noffer an amendment to repeal either the Social Security or Medicare, \neven though we listened to the two leaders talk about their historic \nrole in opposition to the Medicare programs and how they are hopeful \nthat it will ``wither on the vine.'' Then people say, ``Well, you \nshouldn't scare our senior citizens.'' Well, you have had the two \nRepublican leaders that have taken such pride in the achievement of \nthis budget and have made that kind of commitment and statement. Of \ncourse, they ought to know about it.\n\n  Mr. President, there is one other area which I will talk about. You \ntalk about those workers, you talk about the problem that those workers \nare facing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I just have a final 5 minutes? I ask unanimous \nconsent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes, so I know when there are \n30 seconds left.\n  Mr. President, those families working all that period of time now \nfind they are going to have to pay more in taxes. They might have a \nnumber of children that may be getting some kind of health care covered \nunder the Medicaid Program. Eighteen million children in that program; \n4.5 million of them are going to be dropped from any kind of coverage \nunder these Medicaid cuts. That is what we are talking about in this \nRepublican bill: The raising of the Medicare premiums, the indifference \nin dropping children from health care coverage, dropping the \nfundamental commitment for day care for children, cutting even the \nexisting program for day care for children of working families, and \nthen, wonderfully, eliminating the regulations that provide health and \nsafety protection for those children.\n  I was here when Senator Dodd and Senator Hatch worked out that \nprogram, with President Bush. It was so interesting. We had strong \nrequirements for protecting children in the bill that came out of our \nHuman Resources Committee. Those strong requirements that had been \nworked out over a long period of time, in terms of making sure those \nchildren are going to be protected in child care, were watered down but \nstill maintained the essential protections for children. That was \nagreed to in a bipartisan way and passed.\n  Four weeks later, I offered the same bill with the same standards to \nbe applicable to the military, 94 to 6--94 to 6. We did not hear any \nquestion then about too much regulation, too much protection for the \nsons and daughters of those who are in the military. No, we went ahead \nand did it.\n  And now, if any Member of this body goes and visits a child care \ncenter on a military base in this country and compares it outside, they \nare going to find that the ones serving the sons and daughters of our \nservicemen and women are first rate, and those that are outside do not \ncome up to par.\n  What is going to happen with the changes in this legislation is you \nare going to find a deterioration in the protection of children. I \ncannot wait to hear the first speech from some of those who have been \nindifferent to this problem say, ``Look, that whole program that is \nsupported by the Federal Government is a disaster.'' That is what is \ngoing to happen, and then there will be pressure to cut that back and \ngive more tax breaks to the very wealthy. \n\n[[Page S 17454]]\n\n  Mr. President, I can look at the American worker today, as has been \npointed out, and see how their real income has been going down, down, \ndown, over a period of time. What they have done is put something away \nin terms of savings in their pensions, and then out of the Finance \nCommittee came this ability for corporate raiders to raid pension \nfunds, those pension funds paid in by the employees who sacrificed an \nincrease in their wages, their health benefits so that they would have \na secure retirement, and so we brought that up here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate, a bipartisan amendment, Senator Kassebaum and myself, and \nothers--and Senator Moynihan has been a leader in this area--and we \npassed it 94-5, to prohibit the corporate raiders from plundering the \npension funds. They could not even get the door closed over there in \nthat conference, and they came right on back and opened it up again.\n\n  So every worker ought to understand that this is a threat to their \nown security. Why? Because, again, it is the tax breaks, the $240 \nbillion tax breaks. So, Mr. President, these are some of the items that \nare troublesome to many of us. We can work out in a way to try and deal \nwith some corporate welfare and some of the unreasonable increases in \nterms of our defense and in tightening belts on many of the different \nprograms. I have cosponsored those with Senator McCain and others.\n  We can get to a balanced budget, but not when you are going to have \nthat kind of cut and slice on working families, parents and their \nchildren. That is not what the 1994 election was about, and the 1996 \nelection will be about it. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17451-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17454-S17455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PROMISES OF POWER\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, it is funny, I hear a lot of talk this \nmorning on the floor about compromising with the President on our \nbudget. I say it is funny because he has not officially even received \nit yet. He says he is going to veto it. But I say, let us give him the \nopportunity to do that. Let us give him the chance to veto this budget. \nLet him look in that camera and into the eyes of the American people \nand tell them he does not want this balanced budget, he does not think \nAmericans deserve it and, what is more, he does not think they should \nhave a tax cut to go along with it, and that money really belongs to \nWashington to spend.\n  I might just be a lowly freshman from Minnesota in this body, a plebe \nby the standards of some of the more senior Members. But I know why I \nam here: Because I told the people of Minnesota if they would elect me, \nI would come here and I would work to balance the budget, to reduce the \nsize and the scope of this bloated bureaucracy that we call the Federal \nGovernment; and by doing that we would be able to allow them to keep a \nlittle bit more of their own money in the form of a tax cut.\n  I hear my colleagues on the other side saying how people do not have \nthe money to spend anymore in this country. Well, that follows 30 years \nof Democratic programs--but, more importantly, 30 years of Democratic \ntax hikes that have taken that money from our families and sent it to \nWashington.\n  Really, what kind of deal has been talked about on the floor here \nthis morning? What kind of deal are the Democrats and the White House \ntalking about? Let me put some of this in perspective. Our budget plan \ntalks about spending $12 trillion over the next 7 years. The White \nHouse and the liberal leadership of the Democrats in the Senate and \nHouse want to spend about $12.5 trillion, at a minimum. Some are \nwilling to work out any kind of agreement today so that we can go home \nand have a long weekend.\n\n  How are we going to tell our taxpayers that we are willing to spend \nanother $500 billion of their money, collapse on this very important \nissue, so that can have a long weekend? How do we tell the taxpayers \nthat?\n  Our budget increases spending on all these programs. Our spending \ngoes up every year. If you listen to those on the other side of the \naisle, it is like we are gutting everything that this country has stood \nfor, that somehow this country is going to collapse if we save 5 \npercent over the next 7 years. By the way, we are only about 1 percent \napart on the Medicare, compared to the President's proposal and ours. \nIn your own budgets, if you are making a dollar and they say you can \nhave 99 cents, not a dollar, are you going to say, ``I am going to \ncollapse''? We cannot save that 1 percent?\n  Our budget increases spending on Medicare 64 percent, from $174 \nbillion this year to nearly $289 billion in the year 2002--per capita. \nEverybody that will be on Medicare will be going from about $4,800 a \nyear to $6,700 per person a year. That is not a cut. That is not a \ncollapse. That is not solving all the problems or changing the way we \ndo business here in Washington. My colleagues on the other side want to \njust throw more money at it and take more from the taxpayers and let \nWashington spend more. Should we agree to more of the same--programs \nthat have failed--just to give them more money to spend?\n  Where do we get all this money? The Government does not produce any \nrevenues. It only can collect them and dispense them. I am fighting for \nsomething that is fair; I am fighting for the taxpayers.\n  I have been listening to the statements on the floor all morning, and \nalso reading some of the comments in the newspaper following last \nnight's real historic vote on our balanced budget legislation. I found \nmyself then thinking about Abraham Lincoln. This was a man who knew \nsomething about dealing with adversity. He was elected President to \nlead the Nation through some of the darkest hours. The Civil War had \ndivided the country, pitting neighbor against neighbor, brother against \nbrother. Yet, he found a way then to use the power of the Presidency to \ninspire the people--not with the harsh rhetoric of hate, but with a \nvision that something better lay ahead. His words gave people hope to \ncontinue fighting for what they believed so strongly was right.\n  So you know Abraham Lincoln was speaking from the heart, and drawing \non the experiences of his own life, when he said, ``Nearly all men can \nstand adversity * * * but if you want to test a man's character, give \nhim power.''\n  I am not one who is quick to edit the words of a President that I \nadmire very much, but after nearly a year service in this Chamber, and \nespecially after the antics we have been subjected to over the last \nmonth, I think Abraham Lincoln's words would ring equally true if you \nchanged them slightly to read this way: ``Nearly all men can stand \nadversity* * * but if you want to test a man's character, take away his \npower.''\n  Nearly every Republican here knows how tough it is to have that power \ntaken away and be forced to serve in the minority. Many colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle have been in the majority only to be shifted to \nthe minority after the 1986 elections. It is tough, it is an \nadjustment, and it is not a lot of fun. But this year it has led to a \nlot of irresponsible politicking, and it has all been at the expense of \ntruth and substantive debate.\n\n  Mr. President, what would you do if you were walking along and \nstepped into a pool of quicksand, and before you knew it, you were up \nto your waist, sinking quickly? At first, you would begin to do a lot \nof shouting, like we hear from the other side. You probably would not \ncare too much about what you were saying, as long as you said it loudly \nand were attracting a lot of attention. It did not stop the sinking \nsensation, of course, but at least you felt like you were doing \nsomething.\n  Finally, a political consultant happens to come along--how \nconvenient. They are brilliant at putting the right ``spin'' on things. \nMaybe they will figure a way out for you. ``How convincingly can you \nsay `the Republicans are cutting Medicare and putting senior citizens \nat grave risk?' '' asks the consultant. Well, you are willing to try \nanything at this point, since the only attention your shouting has \ngotten you so far were the services of a political consultant.\n  So you shout it--forget that it is not even close to the truth, and \nthat you do not even really believe what you are saying, but you are \nfighting for your life here. Anything goes.\n  I just heard the Senator from Massachusetts say, ``It will all depend \non 1996. This will lead to the election of \n\n[[Page S 17455]]\n1996.'' Republicans have an eye on an election, too, but it was the \n1994 election. We are trying to do what the taxpayers, the American \nvoters, sent us here to do, while the Democrats are looking to 1996 and \ntrying to put up some kind of a hope of regaining this Chamber.\n  Pretty soon, this quicksand reaches up to your chin. ``Any more \nbrilliant ideas?'' you ask the consultant. ``How about shouting louder \nthis time that the Republicans are hurting children and the poor. That \nhas always worked before for me.'' You roll your eyes, but you are \ngetting more desperate, and so you start yelling for all that you are \nworth that the Republicans in Congress are hurting children and hurting \nthe poor.\n  Of course, it is getting harder to shout because the quicksand is \nbrushing up to the corners of your mouth. Still, nobody is paying \nattention.\n  ``All right, the old tricks are not working anymore, so it is time \nfor desperate measures,'' says the consultant.\n  ``I guess I am going to have to throw you this vine, but you have to \nkeep shouting while I get it over to you.''\n  He tosses you the vine, and with your last breath, you scream, ``I \nwant a balanced budget--just not this one.''\n  With a final ``glug,'' you sink out of sight.\n  The political consultant would shake his head and say, ``Gee,'' as he \nheads off searching for his next victim, ``even I could have told you \npeople were not gullible enough to swallow that line.''\n  ``We want a balanced budget, just not this one. We want a balanced \nbudget, but we want to spend more money in order to balance the budget. \nWe want to meet a compromise with our Republican friends, but it has to \nbe our way; we want to spend more.''\n  They are talking about coming to our senses. Ask the taxpayer if \nanother $500 billion in spending is coming to your senses. Mr. \nPresident, the opposition is sinking in the quicksand of public \nopinion. Not even their high-paid consultants and political spin \ndoctors can put a good spin on a bad message.\n  Instead of facing the financial and moral crises that are challenging \nthis Nation, they want to ignore it and point fingers. If you are not \nright, you demagog it to death.\n  If you do not have a plan of your own, you blast the opposition's. If \nyou are not ready to do the people's business, stall them. If your own \nleadership is afraid to lead, you can resort to name calling and \npersonal attacks.\n  Well, Mr. President, the more I hear from my colleagues across the \naisle, the more difficult it is to understand how they can actually \nbelieve their own desperate words.\n  They claim this is a dark poison over this Capitol. Poison? It is far \nfrom it. What I hear in this Chamber and in the other body is the voice \nof the people.\n  After years of darkness, the election finally ushered in some light \nand some tough and that truth is what we are hearing today. If my \ncolleagues are seeing the truth, and it look like poison to them, they \nneed to take a hard look at just who they are representing because they \nare not representing the people who are calling my office.\n  They have lost the power, and it is scaring them silly, and as they \ngrasp for the last vine, look what it's done to them.\n  Mr. President, yesterday we passed what I believe will become the \ndefining piece of legislation of the 104th Congress.\n  For the first time in a quarter century, we have balanced the budget, \nand we are doing it for our children and our future.\n  We are cutting taxes for working class families.\n  Of course the Democrats say, ``Not this balanced budget. We want a \nbalanced budget.'' The President, in a 5-minute speech the other day \nsaid it 16 times, ``We want a balanced budget, but give us more money \nto do it.''\n  We are giving welfare recipients the opportunity to lift themselves \nout of a life of dependency and into society. We are preserving and \nstrengthening the Medicare system for this generation and the next. We \nare doing all of this because we believe we must.\n  As Abraham Lincoln warned, our character has indeed been tested by \nthe power with which this Congress has been entrusted--entrusted to us \nby people like Duane Bonneman who just sent me this fax here this \nmorning, and let me read it quickly.\n  He said in the fax, ``You are in difficult days. Be strong. Be \ncourageous. Never give up. The prevention of the worst economic \ndisaster in world history lies in your hands. Ignore the media. Ignore \nthe polls. Do what you need to do to get it done. But please, don't \ngive up.''\n  Mr. President, I think the Democrats must be getting the same type of \nphone calls we are. I just want to say I am not here to give up.\n  Again, I say I know why I am here in the Senate. It is because the \npeople of Minnesota sent me here to help balance the budget and cut \ntaxes. I am not going to do anything short of that. I am not willing to \ncompromise if it means taking more money from average families so that \nsome bureaucrat in Washington can spend it.\n  I am willing to make sure that we have a fair and equitable budget, \none that meets the needs and responsibilities of this Nation, but not \none that robs our children's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed in morning business for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17454-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17455-S17456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHANGING THE COURSE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have been listening all day, as most of \nus have. I suppose one could say that most everything has been said. \nPerhaps it has not been said by everyone, so it will go on. And it \nshould.\n  We are talking, of course, about a difficult decision. I think the \nSenator who is presiding now said we are trustees here for the American \npeople. That is really what we are--trustees.\n  We are faced with one of the most difficult decisions that has ever \nbeen made here, and that is taking a fundamentally different course \nwith the Federal Government than we have had for the past 30 years.\n  We talk a lot about the cuts. Our friends talk a lot about the cuts. \nLet me share a couple of things with you. Social Security spending will \nincrease each and every year from $336 billion in 1995 to $482 billion \nin 7 years, a 44-percent increase.\n  Mandatory Medicare spending will increase in each and every year from \n$178 to $289 billion, a 62-percent increase in 7 years.\n  Medicaid spending will increase each and every year from $89 to $122 \nbillion, a 37-percent increase.\n  Mr. President, what we are seeking to do is to preserve these kinds \nof programs that we all believe in--health care programs for the \nelderly, health care programs for the poor. In order to preserve them, \nyou have to have some kind of control on expenditures. Medicare \nexpenditures have gone up three times as fast as inflation, twice as \nfast as health care in general.\n  So we can do some things about that and I am pleased, frankly, to \nhear our friends on the other side say that they are interested in \ncooperating in seeking a balanced budget. Frankly, there was not much \nevidence of that interest in balancing the budget prior to today. Most \nof the folks we listen to who decry the balanced budget and now embrace \nit have been here for 20 years. We have not balanced a budget one time \nin 30 years. Hopefully there now is some commitment to it.\n  I understand and I think as we listen to these things we should all \nunderstand that there are different philosophical political points of \nview about how you approach it.\n  There are people who genuinely believe that more Government is \nbetter, more spending is better, that you should, indeed, extract more \nmoney into the public pot so it can be spent that way. I happen not to \nagree with that.\n  I think that is not the majority view. But it is a view and I \nunderstand that.\n  It is also interesting to me, my friend from North Dakota and the \nSenator from Massachusetts get up at least several times daily and talk \nabout how bad things are, therefore, we need to help, but are not \nwilling to change the programs that have made things as bad as they \nare.\n  It seems to me there is a principle there. If you do not like the \nresults of what has been happening, you ought not to continue to do the \nsame thing. \n\n[[Page S 17456]]\n You ought not to continue to do the same thing and expect that the \nresults will be different, because likely they will not.\n  I think, too, it is interesting that we ought to examine for a moment \nwhat it is we are seeking to do in this country. We are trying to \nprovide an economy in a private enterprise system, in a free market \neconomy, in a democracy, so that you and I can have jobs and earn a \nliving for our families. That is the basis of this country.\n  I get a little weary, frankly, of constant talk about greedy business \nmen and women because I do not understand where those folks think jobs \ncome from. Jobs come from people willing to put capital--either theirs \nor someone else's--and risk that capital and create businesses, \ngenerally small businesses, to create jobs. That is what makes this \ncountry work.\n  It is sort of interesting, we are spending a great deal of energy, \nproperly, in helping countries throughout the world change their form \nof government to a democracy, change their form of economy to a free-\nmarket economy, a private-sector economy and we constantly make it more \nand more difficult for us to succeed doing the very same thing.\n\n  It is always popular to talk about the rich and how the rich are \ngetting the breaks. I frankly do not know as much about the rich, I \nsuspect, as the Senator from Massachusetts does or others, but I do \nknow a little bit about small business. I do know that it takes some \nincentive for you to put your money in there at risk.\n  I do know that it is awful easy to be regulated to the extent that \nyou say, why should I fool with it at all? Why should I create jobs, \nbecause I am overregulated. You have to have some incentives to cause \npeople to do that.\n  We ought to take just a little time and review, I suppose, what are \nour own values, what we think has made this country great, keeping in \nmind it is indeed the greatest country in the world.\n  I had a chance, with Senator Glenn, to go to Bosnia a while back and \nsee other countries, a chance to go to the Balkans, a chance to go to \nNicaragua several years ago, and I can tell you, as you know, this is \nthe greatest country in the world. We have more freedom. We have more \nthings than anyone else.\n  We ought to examine what it is that has caused us to be able to have \nthose. It has to do with freedom, with less Government rather than \nmore. It has to do with personal responsibility that each of us must \ntake in a democracy. It has to do with compassion for the helpless and \nthe needy, but to help them get back to help themselves. It has to do \nwith incentives to invest so that we can create jobs.\n  So this ought to be our goal, to preserve those personal freedoms, to \nhelp strengthen the economy so that we can have jobs, to maintain those \nprograms that do help the needy. You cannot keep them going if you do \nnot control the costs, with the possibility we are going to go broke in \nMedicare--we all know that. So we can cheat.\n\n  So I hope, Mr. President, each of us will challenge ourselves to \nperform during these next few months, indeed years, and take the tough \nrole of leadership. It is fairly easy to poll. It is fairly easy to \nhave little groups that you talk to, little focus groups, and sort of \ndecide what is best for your political future. It is much tougher to \ndecide what you think we need to do to be a leader. And it is \nuncomfortable, from time to time. And this is the time when we have the \nopportunity to stand up and express at least our heartfelt beliefs as \nto where to go.\n  Mr. President, I am just excited by the opportunity to do that. I \nthink yesterday's vote was a fundamental change and the most important \nvote that any of us will make for a very long time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17455-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On \nan average day, the Federal Housing Administration processes 2,500 home \npurchases and refinancing applications totaling $200 million with the \nmortgage loans for moderate- and low-income working families.\n  This resolution would do nothing to ensure the resumption of the \nfinancing of small businesses. On an average day, over 260 small \nbusinesses receive the SBA guaranteed financing. Thus far, more than \n$40 million in loans have been delayed or forfeited as a result of the \nshutdown.\n  Another shutdown this resolution does not address--would not affect--\nis the shutdown on exports this country attempts to ship each and every \nday. On an average day over 30 export licenses valued at over $30 \nmillion are approved by the Bureau of Export Administration.\n  The resolution does not address Head Start. Yet, if the shutdown \ncontinues much longer, 60,000 Head Start children will lose services \neach day, and 11,000 Head Start staff will do without funding.\n  This resolution is a holiday for deadbeat dads. Those who are not \nliving up to their responsibilities as fathers do not need to fear \ncollection attempts, for the Federal Parent Locater Services which \naveraged 20,000 new cases a day is closed. The resolution does not \naffect that.\n  The resolution does not address the halt in tourism in and around \nnational parks. Yet, on an average day, 726,000 people visit national \npark service facilities. With parks closed down, the public \ninconvenienced, business is lost in the surrounding communities.\n  The resolution offered today does not address the critical health \ncare needs served by the National Institutes of Health, which provide \nadvice to doctors and patients and the latest treatments available for \nserious illnesses. No new patients are being enrolled in research \nprojects at the NIH Clinical Center. An average of 170 new patients per \nweek were enrolled in these projects up until the time we saw the \nGovernment shut down.\n  The resolution does not allow for the pursuit of new medical fraud \nand abuse cases. On an average day, 100 calls from public sources \nreporting fraud and abuse are normally referred to the Office of \nInspector General for further investigation. That has been completely \nshut down.\n  There has been a shutdown of projects and activities of the FBI, the \nBorder Patrol, and other Federal law enforcement agencies. This \nresolution does not address that.\n  Finally, it does not address the shutdown of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission work. Yet, in an average week, 20,000 toys are taken \noff the shelves because they are dangerous for children.\n  The point, Mr. President, is pretty simple. Obviously, we are \nconcerned about the need to address all agencies of Government, all \nimportant services. We want to ensure that we are not balkanizing \nGovernment. Already, through the House's passage of this resolution and \nthe refusal to pass a clean short-term budget, we are pitting one \nagency against another.\n  I think we have to come to an understanding that Government is \nimportant, and all these important services ought to be funded, not \njust some of them. We have been asked by the House to abandon that \nprinciple and provide funding for Government on a piecemeal basis. \nThere is a regular appropriations process. Today, the President is \ngoing to sign the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, and the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill. The more appropriations bills \nwe can send on to the President, the less we are going to need this \nbalkanized approach to a continuing resolution.\n  Let us pass a straightforward continuing resolution. Let us take the \nriders off. Let us get the job done. Let us ensure that at some time in \nthe not too distant future we can get on with dealing with the \nfundamental issue before this Congress, and that is a reconciliation \nbill: a comprehensive budget that balances the budget and reflects the \ntrue values and priorities of the American people--not the plan to \ndevastate Medicare and Medicaid to pay for tax breaks for people who do \nnot need them. Now that the reconciliation bill has passed, there is \neven less reason for a Government shutdown. The reconciliation bill \nshould be sent to the President for its inevitable veto so we can get \non with the real negotiations. I am hopeful that we can get to those \nessential negotiations and enact such a budget in the not too distant \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute just to review \nthe situation. First of all, there would be no shutdown of Government \nat all if the President had signed the continuing resolution that was \nsent to him last week, one that did include language for a balanced \nbudget in 7 years, and by allowing this continued spending to go \nforward it would have opened the Government.\n  Second, there is another continuing resolution that has passed by a \nwide margin in the House and in the Senate--by 60 votes in the Senate, \nwith some other Senators indicating they really would like to vote for \nit. We have that resolution ready to go to the President, but he said \nno, he will not sign that either.\n  That resolution is very simple, and it did not have any of the riders \nthat had been objected to earlier. It says we will have a balanced \nbudget in 7 years as certified by the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich is what the President had called for in 1993, and it did allow \nfor continuing of the spending at the lower of the House-Senate or \ncurrent level and even the programs that had been zeroed by the \nCongress would be funded at 60 percent--more than a 50-50 split with \nthe President.\n  So that has not been sent to the President yet because he indicated \nhe would not sign it. But perhaps he will think better of it and \nindicate maybe later on today or tomorrow that he would sign it, and we \ncould send that right down, he could sign that tomorrow afternoon or \nMonday morning and get the Government back to work, and we could get on \nto the serious business of the balanced budget that we are committed \nto, that this body voted for just last night and that we have been \nworking on all year.\n  Now, I think also you need to emphasize here what was just objected \nto. This is a short or small continuing resolution that will allow the \nopening of Social Security, veterans and Medicare offices. Who is \nagainst that? The Senator just objected to us getting those very \nimportant offices open and working on Monday morning. Surely----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. There would be no objection to it. Let me continue, if I \ncould, and I will yield.\n  We could get those offices open, and then perhaps there are some \nother areas where we could pass some other \n\n[[Page S 17458]]\ncontinuing resolution that would perhaps address the concerns of the \nDefense Department. Hopefully, that will not be necessary because not \nonly has the President been sent today from the Congress the Department \nof Treasury and Postal Service appropriations bills, which he indicated \nperhaps he will sign, I believe, and the legislative appropriations \nbill, which he indicated maybe he will sign, we also sent him a very \nimportant, very large Department of Defense appropriations bill. If he \nwill sign that bill, then all of the Defense Department, our defense \npeople can go back to work.\n  This is not an indication that this is all we should do or can do or \nwill do. We are just saying that we would like for the Social Security \noffices, the veterans offices and the Medicare offices to be open. I do \nnot think any Senator wants to object to that.\n  So we put it on the calendar, and we will have a chance, I am sure, \nto vote on it at some subsequent point. If I could just make one more \npoint, and then I will yield to the Senator's response, if he feels so \ninclined.\n  What is really at stake here? There is a continuing effort by the \nPresident to get a continuing spending resolution. The President wants \nmore spending available to him. What we are trying to get is a \ncommitment to the balanced budget in 7 years with honest numbers. That \nis all we are trying to accomplish.\n  Now, discussions continue, are underway. There have been \nconversations today across the aisle with both sides of the Congress \nand with the White House. I am hopeful that something could be worked \nout where the President can agree to the 7-year balanced budget as \ncertified by the Congressional Budget Office so we can make sure the \nnumbers are allowed, and maybe that will happen. There are a number of \nways that we can continue to work together and get the Government open. \nCertainly we should get these very important offices open on Monday. \nThe House has already voted that way.\n  I would be glad to yield to the leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my friend for yielding. I would just ask the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, my friend, whether he is aware \nthat the President has already made an announcement that all of those \npeople will be going back to work on Monday, making the resolution as \nhe has proposed it unnecessary?\n  The second question I would ask is, why, even if he thought it was \nnecessary--perhaps he was not aware of the President's announcement--\nwhy would he feel the need to open the offices in Social Security and \nother branches and maintain closure of small business offices around \nthe country, the Federal Housing Administration? Why would he see the \nneed to keep the National Institutes of Health and a number of other \nFederal agencies that I would think he would view as equally important, \nclosed down? What I tried to do in my subsequent unanimous consent \nagreement, to which the Senator objected, was to open those offices, \ntoo. How does the Senator draw the distinction?\n  Mr. LOTT. If the President as a matter of fact has been moving to \nopen these offices, certainly it makes good sense to me that the \nCongress would concur and put that into law. But I might respond to the \nSenator, why did the President stop with these offices? Why did he not \ngo further? Every one of these things cut both ways.\n  I think it is important to note that the other side of the aisle has \nobjected to moving to this targeted continuing resolution. This bill \nwould provide sufficient funding--until the relevant appropriations \nbills are signed into law, or if necessary, for the remainder of FY96--\nto allow HCFA to pay claims filed by Medicare contractors, the Social \nSecurity Administration to meet its administrative expenses, and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to process and disburse veterans \ncompensation, pensions, and dependency and indemnity compensation \npayments. The minority leader points out that the President has sent an \nExecutive order sending many of these workers back to work; however, it \nis important to note that the President's Executive order does not \nprovide funding for these employees. This, I believe, is a very \nimportant distinction.\n  I think what we need to do is quit arguing about what should be open \nand what should not be open, get an agreement to do that, and get a \ncommitment to a 7-year balanced budget with honest numbers. That is \nwhat really is at stake, and we are hopefully very close.\n  The leader, I believe, has had indications by many Members on his \nside they want a 7-year balanced budget. The ranking member on the \nBudget Committee in the House indicated that he supports that. I think \nthere is growing support in the Congress to get that commitment agreed \nto, go with honest numbers and pass a continuing resolution that will \nallow the spending to continue while we get a way to control the budget \nthat has been out of control for 30 years.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me just respond, and I know others seek the floor, \nso I will not belabor this point. This issue is not about a 7-year \nbalanced budget. The Senator from Mississippi knows it. This issue is \nabout whether or not we can make Government function while we debate \nthe critical issues behind the issue of a 7-year balanced budget. I \nthink we could get broad-based support for a 7-year balanced budget if \nwe could also get broad-based support for what that means--what the \nbudgetary values priorities defining that budget are.\n  What does it mean? What so many on the other side seem to be arguing \nis that we have to come to the bottom line before we know what the \ncomponents are. If the Senator will tell me exactly what the tax cut \nfigure will be, exactly what the growth assumptions will be, exactly \nwhat all the cuts in entitlements will be, exactly what we can \nanticipate in terms of freezes on discretionary spending, then we can \nprobably get some better appreciation of whether it is going to take 7 \nyears or 8 years or what. Seven years is fine with most of us, 5 years, \n4 years might work, depending on the assumptions and priorities \nentailed. but that is not the issue. We have to consider all the \ncomponents of the budget as we debate this issue.\n  The real debate will begin almost immediately because the President \nwill be vetoing the reconciliation bill that we passed last night. So \nwe are left now with the realization that if we are serious about doing \nthis the right and responsible way, we need to put the rhetoric aside \nand get down to making some very tough decisions about whether we can \ndo all that everybody says they want to do in 7 years. We better start \nnegotiating for real on that reconciliation bill. That is the issue. \nThe continuing resolution debate ought to be behind us because that \nreally should not going be the issue any longer.\n  The issue is, can we seriously debate our goals in reconciliation. If \nwe can do that, if we can sit down in a bipartisan way, then I believe \nwe can accomplish our task. But the longer we debate this continuing \nresolution, the longer we decide we have yet another iteration, another \nalternative, another way to play political games with a document that \nought to fund Government for whatever length of time it is going to \ntake to get the real job done, the less the real job is a real \npossibility.\n  So I hope that we could both agree to that. I will agree with what \nthe Senator said about the ongoing effort to try to resolve this \nmatter.\n  I must really commend him and Senator Domenici, the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, the chair of the Budget Committee, and others \nwho have been working diligently all day long in an effort to find some \nresolution. I think we are very close on our side. I wish I could say \nthe same for those on the other side. But I do commend them for their \nwork and their effort. I know it is still ongoing. And I hope, even \nthough the odds seem to be diminishing, I hope at some point, even yet \ntoday, we could find some resolution. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17457-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17458-S17459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE BALANCED BUDGET ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes today to \naddress a few specifics of the Balanced Budget Act passed yesterday by \nthis Chamber. With the time available today, I wanted to offer a few \nspecific thoughts on the agriculture provisions contained in the \nconference report.\n  As I have said on previous occasions during this debate, the balanced \nbudget \n\n[[Page S 17459]]\nmeasure we approved yesterday is a historic moment. I feel strongly \nthat this is among the most important votes that I will cast here, and \nI am proud that this Congress has the courage and conviction to enact a \nplan to achieve a true balanced budget.\n  This is a good plan, and in my estimation, it is a very fair plan; \nbut it is not entirely a perfect plan. An area, for example, that I \nbelieve that this Congress has abdicated its responsibility is the \nreforms of the peanut program that are contained in this bill.\n  My desire to reform programs such as peanuts and sugar is certainly \nwell known among my colleagues. It is my view that we must curb these \nsubsidies for farmers and investors and bring these programs into line \nwith other, more market oriented agricultural commodities. As a member \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have been fighting for reforms \nin both of these programs. I assure my colleagues that the provisions \nin this bill are not true reform.\n  The peanut industry is in a state of serious decline. Consumption and \nproduction are falling as a direct result of a failed Government policy \nthat excessively inflates the price of U.S. peanuts to almost twice the \nworld price. It is my goal to make the peanut program operate like \nother farm programs so peanut farmers will grow peanuts for the market, \nand not for the Federal Government. Under the current peanut program, \nartificially high-priced peanuts simply end up being forfeited to the \nFederal Government.\n  The peanut provisions contained in the budget reconciliation bill not \nonly fail to reform the peanut quota system, but make a bad program \nworse by forcing the Secretary of Agriculture to further shrink \nnational production to avoid Government forfeitures.\n  This summer I introduced S. 1188, a bill that provides for a \nphasedown of the excessive support price for quota peanuts in order to \nmove the program toward a market orientation. In year 2000, my bill \nwould end the quota system and replace it with a loan program, much \nlike the program we have for soybeans.\n  The Agriculture Committee, however, chose to include the general \ncommodity programs in the budget reconciliation bill rather than have a \nfarm bill fully debated on the Senate floor. At the time of Agriculture \nCommittee deliberations, I agreed not to oppose the package of peanut \nprovision for inclusion in budget reconciliation in return for some \nminor reforms in the program.\n  One of the chief concessions I obtained in the Agriculture Committee \nreported bill, was a new provision for the release of additional \npeanuts when market prices for domestic edible peanuts exceeded 120 \npercent of the quota loan rate. This provision would have placed some \ncap on the price of peanuts when the Government creates an artificial \nshortage.\n  Unfortunately, this provision was ruled out of order under the Byrd \nrule, while other provisions, such as the extension of lease and \ntransfer of quota, were allowed to be part of final legislative package \non peanuts.\n  My other objective today is to point out the inconsistency in terms \nof how the Byrd rule was applied against my provisions to reform the \npeanut program. No one can deny that the Byrd rule was applied \nselectively to eliminate certain provisions, while other items, such as \nlease and transfer provisions were allowed to be attached to the budget \nreconciliation bill. Through procedural maneuvers to protect the peanut \nprogram from a floor vote, the Congress has effectively chosen to \nheavily subsidize a few thousand peanut quota holders at the expense of \nmillions of consumers.\n  The peanut provisions contained in the bill serve to protect the \nstatus quo, while consumers have to pay even more for peanuts because \nthe Secretary of Agriculture will be forced to short the market. In \nfact, it is estimated that the proposed modifications will effectively \nincrease the cost of peanuts by as much as $100 per ton. Budget \nreconciliation provisions that increase the cost of peanut products at \na time when the peanut industry is already losing market share are \nsimply bad public policy.\n  I am disappointed in my colleagues' use of the legislative process to \nhide the peanut program from the light of public scrutiny. Working to \ndeny floor consideration of peanut program reform has extended the life \nof this outrageous program for a while longer. Ultimately, I am afraid \nthat the provisions in this bill do a disservice to supporters of the \nprogram by further pretending that there is no crisis in the peanut \nindustry.\n  In stark contrast, some of the reforms that I have proposed would \nexpand national production by allowing American peanut growers to \nproduce for the market rather than the government. Real reform of the \npeanut program will not only benefit this Nation's consumers, but will \nhelp avoid the loss of manufacturing an jobs in my home State of \nPennsylvania.\n  As a Representative of Pennsylvania, one of the largest states in \nterms of the number of employees related to peanut product \nmanufacturing, I have good reason to be deeply concerned about the loss \nof jobs that will result from further Government imposed reductions in \nU.S. peanut production.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that we have an opportunity to vote for \nreform of the peanut program on the Senate floor. Consideration of the \npeanut program to date has been nothing short of denying public \nscrutiny of an unfair and outdated Government program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17458-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17459-S17460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TED STEVENS: A HEARTFELT BIRTHDAY WISH\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today is an especially happy day for \nAlaskans, as we join in wishing our senior Senator Ted Stevens a happy \n72d birthday, (November 18.) Ted, in his 27th year in the Senate, has \nset an example for how all of us should fight tirelessly for our home \nStates, while still maintaining the wisdom to put the good of the \nNation first.\n  While Ted currently ranks eighth in the Senate in overall seniority, \nthird among Republicans, and is just one of 109 Senators who have \nserved in the body for 24 or more years--out of 1,815 members since \n1789, he still can be found meeting every Alaskan Close-Up student \ngroup or talking with residents about health concerns.\n  His encyclopedic knowledge of Federal-Alaska State relations is \nlegendary in Washington. In the Senate, which has lost much of its \ninstitutional memory, Ted is able to offer insights on everything from \npassage of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act, to the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act, from passage of the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation Act \nto the Alaska Lands Act.\n  His recollection of events is so extraordinary not only because he \nhelped draft the Alaska Statehood Act while serving at the Department \nof Interior during the Eisenhower administration, but because he has \nhad a hand in virtually every Federal issue affecting Alaska over the \npast three decades.\n  While Ted served 8 years as assistant Republican leader, whip, \nhandling key national issues, especially defense matters, he is \nrespected as a fierce defender of Alaska interests. He especially has \nbeen willing to put aside personal ambition for the good of his State.\n  Many forget that Ted sacrificed his seniority on the Commerce \nCommittee to move to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee during \nthe key fight over the Alaska Land Act. He then moved back to Commerce \nto represent Alaska fisherman--prove positive that Ted always puts \nAlaska first. It is only justice that he is today chairman of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs--the panel upon which he has labored \nfor years to the great benefit of Alaskans.\n  Certainly no Alaskan has done more during his career then Ted \nStevens. A Harvard Law School graduate, an Air Force veteran who saw \nservice in China during WW II, the chief counsel to the U.S. Department \nof Interior, a member of the Alaska House of Representatives who served \nas speaker tempore and majority leader, and U.S. Senator. Ted Stevens \nis a model of public service to his State and Nation and an inspiration \nfor all of us.\n  I, join with all Alaskans, to thank him for his skill, drive, and \ndedication during his years in Washington and offer him a heartfelt \ngood wish for many, many more years of service to the State and Nation. \nNancy joins me \n\n[[Page S 17460]]\nin congratulations to both Ted, Catherine, and daughter Lilly. It's \nbeen great fun and a true privilege working with you my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17459-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HAPPY BIRTHDAY SENATOR ROBERT BYRD\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if the Republican leadership is \nsuccessful in negotiating an agreement with the President on a \ncontinuing resolution, it appears that the Senate may not be in session \non Monday, November 20.\n  For that reason, today I would like to take a moment and wish the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Robert Byrd, \nan advance Happy Birthday. On Monday, Senator Byrd will celebrate his \n78th birthday.\n  Mr. President, the public often views the Senate engaging in bitter \npartisan debate. Yes, we Republicans have our differences with the \nDemocrats. But when the debates are over, and the votes have been cast, \nthe public would be surprised to learn that we put aside our party \nlabels and share friendships.\n  And so, the Republican Senator would like to reflect on the brilliant \ncareer of Senator Byrd. He has spent more than half of his life serving \nthe people of West Virginia in the Congress. Six years in the House and \n37 years in the Senate.\n  This year, he cast a record 14,000th vote; and just 3 weeks ago, on \nOctober 27, when the Senate set a 1-day record of 39 votes, it was \nSenator Byrd who offered the 35th amendment that broke the record.\n  But it is not just longevity that will provide Senator Byrd \nhistorical statute in the Senate. It is his record of service. He has \nserved as majority whip as well as majority and minority leader. And he \nhas served as President pro tempore and chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  What is even more remarkable is the Senator's in-depth scholarly \nknowledge of history. Our distinguished Republican leader, Senator \nDole, has often commented that students ought to receive college \nhistory credit simply by listening to the speeches of Senator Byrd.\n  Over a period of several years, Senator Byrd stood on the floor of \nthe Senate and provided an oral history of this institution. These \nspeeches ultimately were printed in two bound volumes and provide the \nbest overview and understanding of the evolution of this 206 year old \ninstitution.\n  In 1993, Senator Byrd went to the floor on 14 separate occasions to \nspeak on the history of the Roman Senate. These discourses were not \ndesigned solely for history students. Instead, they were intended to \nprovide all of us with a perspective on the roots of American \ngovernment and the extraordinary importance of maintaining unfettered \ncongressional control over the power of the purpose.\n  On one occasion, Senator Byrd spoke for 6 hours on the floor and \nprovided the Senate a broad overview of the evolution of parliamentary \ngovernment in England and how evolution influenced our Founding Fathers \nin shaping this Government.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on about Senator Byrd's history \nlessons. But what I want to do is suggest that when future historians \nare writing about the 20th century Senate, Senator Robert Byrd will \nsurely be remembered as one of the giants who followed in the footsteps \nof Henry Clay and Daniel Webster.\n  In particular, I believe Senator Byrd should be commended for his \npassionate defense of the rights of the minority in this body and to \nunlimited debate. Many Americans are often frustrated with the slowness \nof the pace of the Senate. But Senator Byrd rightly notes that in \npermitting unlimited debate, the Senate stands as a bulwark against \ntyranny and the passion of the moment.\n  We all owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Byrd for his wisdom. I wish \nhim a very happy birthday this coming Monday and my sincere regards to \nhis lovely wife Erma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17460-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ORDER FOR RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I have been researching today also what \nis happening here with regard to this funding gap, as it is called in \nGovernment circles. I find there have been 15 such funding gaps in a \n19-year period since 1977. One went 17 days. And I am becoming \ndisturbed because of the two functions I perform here in the Senate. \nOne is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee with regard to \nthe general civil service and Government employees, per se; and the \nother is pertaining to the Department of Defense.\n  At this time I want to speak primarily on the Department of Defense. \nIf we are in session later today I do intend to speak about Government \nemployees per se, because I think there is a strong feeling building \nhere, for some reason, that those people who have been declared \nnonessential and are not reporting for work are somehow at fault in \nthis, and they are not going to be paid when we finally reach a \nconclusion, which we must reach at some point.\n  But, Mr. President, I want to talk now about the Department of \nDefense bill because I had urged that bill be held up and not sent to \nthe President because I did not want it caught in this current, very \ndeep controversy. But it has now been sent to the President for his \nsignature.\n\n  There is every indication the President will veto that bill, for \nseveral reasons. He, of course, has the prerogative to reach the \nconclusion that he has reached with regard to the funding levels in our \ndefense bill. I am here right now to urge the Department of Defense to \nconfer with the President and do their utmost to get this bill signed. \nAs I noted during the debate here on the floor of the Senate on that \nbill, this is a bill that I think is of immediate concern to the \nDepartment of Defense and one that I believe the President must sign.\n  If he does not sign it, under the current hiatus in terms of this \nfunding, we are going to be in real difficulty. Today 300,000 civilian \nemployees in the Department of Defense have been furloughed. The \nDepartment of Defense depots, supply centers, training ranges, and \npeople who are currently on route in personal moves have been stopped. \nThey can no longer spend money.\n  Now, we have U.S. troops deployed abroad. I spoke at length on the \nfloor the other night about that also. And 240,000 or more American \ncitizens are deployed abroad as members of our armed services. They are \nin Macedonia, Haiti, Cuba, Southwest Asia, all over the world, and \nthere are many afloat. We cannot afford any further interruption in \ndefense fundings and programs if we are to maintain our \nresponsibilities throughout the world as the world's last superpower.\n  I think this would be a sad time for Saddam Hussein or the North \nKoreans to misunderstand the will of the United States to provide the \npeople and the material and money to fund the commitments we have made \nthroughout the world. \n\n[[Page S 17461]]\n\n  As I said, I believe the President must sign this bill in the \ninterests of our national security. We have a very strange situation \nfacing the Department of Defense right now. Remember, there is no \ndefense bill until he signs it. If he vetoes it, there is still no \ndefense bill. There should have been a new defense bill on October 1. \nWe were prepared to go to a defense bill, but we have been held up by \nan extraneous issue for a long period of time this year.\n  But today the Department of Defense responded as follows: With regard \nto civilian payroll, there are 780,000 workers that must be paid by \nNovember 24. There are no funds to make that payroll. On the military \npayroll, there are 1,600,000 people who must be paid by November 28. \nThere are no funds to make that payroll.\n  Many people believe that the food and forage concept will allow the \nDepartment of Defense to meet those obligations. That is not true. The \nfood and forage statute, which is an ancient statute, gives the \nDepartment the authority to write IOU's for food for people in the \nfield. It does not impact payroll. There will be no money to meet the \npayroll under food and forage.\n\n  As I stated, with regard to the transportation of troops, there are \ntroops in training centers that cannot return to their units. There are \npeople en route home for the holidays that will not be able to return. \nThere are no funds available for discretionary travel. All fuel--all \nfuel--for Department of Defense expenditure will expire on November 24.\n  For vehicles, aircraft, and ships, they are procured through the \ndefense logistics agency, and we are informed that that agency will \nhave no cash to procure fuel after November 24. The military services \nwill have to draw down from existing supplies at bases or at sea, if \nnecessary, in an emergency. And I assume they will be reserved for \nemergencies.\n  With regard to spare parts, we get spare parts under the defense \nbusiness operations fund. That fund also is in the situation where it \nis critical already. There is money in the bill that was presented to \nthe President. If it is not there, there is going to be a critical \nsituation with regard to our stockpile of spare parts worldwide.\n  For those people who have States that are involved in the industrial \nproduction--my State is not--but just remember that all procurement is \nsubject to appropriated funds. If this bill is vetoed and there is no \ncontinuing resolution covering defense, all of those contracts for \nproduction and procurement will have to cease because the inspector \ngenerals will have to notify all of those contractors that the \nDepartment of Defense cannot meet the payroll, cannot pay those \ncontracts because of the clause in each of them that says they are \nsubject to available funds.\n  With regard to overseas operations, Mr. President, we have many \npeople out there in many dangerous jobs in counternarcotics operations, \nfrom those flying the so-called cap, the oversight function in Iraq, \nthe no-fly zone in Bosnia, the naval blockade in the Adriatic, all of \nthe work we are doing in Cuba, all of the containment operations on \nNorth Korea. All of them--all of them--are at risk if this bill is not \nsigned.\n  Now, I urge the President to sign this bill, but in any event I urge \nthe Senate and the House to recognize the problem if he does not. If \nthe President does not meet his responsibility, that does not mean that \nI am going to shirk mine. I intend to object to the passage of this \nresolution unless it is amended to cover the Department of Defense. And \nfurthermore, I intend to find some way to get before the Senate a \nresolution which will, in fact, cover the full spectrum of the problem \nthat exists now.\n  We are coming close now to the record as far as the time that we will \nhave people furloughed, sent home, people that want to work, and then \nlater we will pay them. Now that is another matter I want to cover. I \nhave had several Members of the Senate tell me, ``Well, this time we're \nnot going to pay them.'' Never in the history of the United States have \nwe failed to pay the workers who have been sent home because of any \nhiatus in the availability of cash to pay them for their jobs.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, we hire people by the year. Most \nemployees of the Federal Government are hired under contract for a full \nyear. Their salaries are stated by the year. There are very few that \nare under hourly or under temporary hiring contracts, which are short \nof that.\n\n  It is my position that the failure of the Congress and the President \nto come together to make available the funds does not amount to a \ncancellation of that contract. If it does, I think they could all sue \nus for breach of contract.\n  I heard today both in Maryland and in Colorado, Federal civilian \nemployees are going to the State unemployment office to get money to \nlive. I do not know about the rest of the Members of the Senate, but \nraising five children since I have been here, I have seen many days, I \ntell you, if my paycheck had been interrupted, there would have been \nsevere trouble in my financial circumstance. People have car payments \ndue, they have rent payments due, they have all sorts of problems that \nhave to be met.\n  Mr. President, they cannot exist without this money. It is our job to \nstay in session until we get the job done. I am going to object to an \nadjournment resolution. I am going to object to any recess. I want the \nSenate to stay in session until we find a way to pay the people we have \nhired to do the work that we consider to be necessary. Having been \ntemporarily determined to be nonessential does not mean they are not \nstill employees of the United States. They deserve to be paid and paid \nwhen their money is due.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I pose a question to my distinguished \ncolleague on my time. Senator Stevens and I have met this afternoon on \nthese questions.\n  First, I wish to join the Senator in the amendment, as we discussed \nearlier, to such measures that may be coming through here which can \nhopefully forestall this very serious list of DOD activities that would \nbe curtailed as a consequence of the current funding problems.\n  But I address the first one to the Senator. We discussed that DOD, \nwhich faces a civilian payroll of 780,000 workers that must be \nprocessed on November 24, currently has no cash and likewise the \nmilitary payroll of 1.6 million currently has no cash.\n  I hope that the Secretary of Defense will learn now, if he does not \nalready know, about these problems and will immediately contact the \nSenator from Alaska this afternoon, because this message that the \nSenator from Alaska sends this afternoon, and in which I join, is going \nto cause incredible alarm not only in the United States but in our \nfarflung military installations where our troops are serving throughout \nthe world.\n\n  I think this requires immediate response from the Secretary of \nDefense. I congratulate my distinguished colleague for bringing that \nup.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia. I might \nsay, I have conferred with the Secretary in the past. I believe he \nshares the opinion that the bill could be signed. I cannot speak for \nhim. But it is my opinion that if the President decided he did not like \nthe level of funding, he could send up rescissions to the Congress.\n  But again, that is all within the prerogative of the President. I \nthink we have our prerogatives, too. I have reached the determination \nwe must do everything we can to see to it that this funding continues \nin some way. If the President exercises his right to veto this bill, \nthen we still have the duty to come forward with another bill. I \nremember one time when the Congress sent to one President about 21 \ndifferent bills in the process of about a week trying to solve this \nproblem. Today, we are holding them up. I do not criticize the \nleadership for that, but we have a bill still here that we can amend \nand try to find a common ground with the President.\n  The main thing is, in my opinion, the Nation's security is at \njeopardy if we do not pay these people. The Nation's security is at \njeopardy if we are going to run out of fuel, not have flying time, \nsteaming time and the ability to move our forces by using fuel.\n  I thank the Senator. \n\n[[Page S 17462]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague. He \nis chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee, as the Presiding Officer knows well. This is a subject he \nhas dealt with in his distinguished career in the U.S. Senate. When we \nmet this afternoon to go over these items I thought it imperative we \nbring it to the attention of the Senate indeed. I do not want to cause \nundue alarm to 780,000 workers on the civilian payroll and 1.6 million \nin uniform. Please, we say, Mr. Secretary of Defense, take this message \nimmediately and provide us with such response or solution as the \nSecretary of Defense and the President may have.\n  I should also like to add, Mr. President, that the contractors who do \nwork with the Department of Defense are likewise faced with the lack of \nfunding. The Defense Contract Audit Agency apparently is going to shut \ndown and thereby terminate the payment of contractors all across \nAmerica that are performing defense work.\n\n  What happens at that point? What happens at that point is that there \nis a ripple effect. Their employees cannot be paid, and with the \n800,000 now in the Federal Government not receiving pay, there could be \nanother 800,000 of those employees not receiving their compensation \nthrough the Department of Defense as a consequence of the Defense \nContract Audit Agency.\n  So I join with Senator Stevens in calling on the Secretary of Defense \nto give us a specific reply to that problem, because this is becoming \nincreasingly serious, for a lot of innocent--and I underline, Mr. \nPresident, ``innocent''--people who are being caught up in this \ncontroversy between the President and the Congress.\n  I feel ever so strongly about the need for a 7-year balanced budget. \nI came to the Senate with my distinguished colleague, the acting \nminority leader, Senator Exon, some many years ago. I have great \nrespect for him. But I say to my distinguished colleague, I think there \nshould be unanimity of viewpoints that we can achieve a balanced budget \nin 7 years. That should not be a subject of disagreement. I just hope \nthat we can, in the words of the acting majority leader, use ``honest'' \neconomic assumptions which the Senator from Nebraska understands very \nclearly, having served on the Budget Committee throughout his career, \nuse that type of data to bring about this balanced budget.\n  So I return to the question on the Defense Department and, \nincidentally, so far as I can determine, the Defense Contract Audit \nAgency is still dealing with 1995 fiscal year funds which are available \nand not subject to the current impasse on the budget. But if this \nreport is true, that is very disturbing.\n  Further, Mr. President, I would like to have printed in today's \nRecord an article that appeared in the Virginian-Pilot newspaper in my \nState which chronicles the impact of a defense contractor. I will read \na few lines of that:\n  ``The Navy is unable to pay new bills from local shipyards because of \nthe Federal shutdown and, as a result, many yards may soon be cutting \nback operations . . .'' in the Tidewater region of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia.\n  We have the largest naval base in the world and a tremendous \ninfrastructure of contractors which support those naval and maritime \nactivities. This article depicts in a very colorful way, in an accurate \nway, the impact on the individual shipyard workers.\n  So I close my remarks, again, by saying that I continue to be \nconcerned about these employees. We will achieve this 7-year balanced \nbudget--I am confident of that--one way or another. But in the \nmeantime, let us not bring further injury and further concern and \nemotional stress on so many innocent people who have offered to devote \ntheir careers either to Federal service as public servants or those who \nare performing the contracts for the Federal Government.\n\n  I was heartened by the meetings I had with the Speaker of the House \nand others earlier today that there is the assurance that eventually \nthe Federal employees will be justly compensated for that period in \ntime in which they were furloughed, but we cannot give that assurance, \nindeed, it is not the responsibility of Congress, to the employees of \nthe contractors of the Federal Government. Their pay remains uncertain.\n  I should also like to have printed in this Record of today a letter \nto the Honorable Tom Davis, a Member of Congress from the Commonwealth \nof Virginia. A similar letter went to the Hon. Frank Wolf, a Member of \nCongress from the Commonwealth of Virginia. The three of us are \ntalking, on the average, three or four times a day about this problem \nand working together. It reflects the assurance of the leadership and \nthe Congress, both the House and the Senate, to take care of the \nFederal employees.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter and this article from the \nVirginian-Pilot be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas Davis,\n     Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: We will be sending soon to President Clinton a \n     bill to continue funding for the federal government through \n     December 1, 1995. Besides providing for government services, \n     this bill also funds federal workers' salaries.\n       If the President decides to veto this legislation to keep \n     government operating, the possibility exists that some \n     federal workers may be furloughed. In the event that this \n     takes place, it is our commitment that federal employees will \n     not be punished as a direct result of the President's \n     decision to veto funding for their salaries. Should this \n     happen, we are committed to restoring any lost wages in a \n     subsequent funding bill.\n       Again, we want to reassure you that if the President vetoes \n     the continuing resolution and requires federal workers to be \n     furloughed, we are committed to restoring any lost wages \n     retroactively.\n           Sincerely,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n                                             Speaker of the House.\n     Bob Dole,\n     .

Roper IV, executive vice president of operations for \n     Norshipco, which employs 2,200 full-time workers at its two \n     yards in Norfolk and 600 people part-time. ``There's a lot of \n     ifs here.''\n       The Navy is paying pending bills that have been processed \n     by the Navy's local contracting office, the Supervisor of \n     Shipbuilding, Repair and Conversion in Portsmouth. Officers \n     running that office are looking for a way to resume \n     processing new bills so payments to the yards won't be \n     interrupted.\n       ``Obviously there is national security that comes into play \n     at some point . . .,'' said Cmdr. David S. Hattich, the \n     officer in charge of contracting in the Portsmouth office. \n     ``It's not in the government's interest to see (the \n     shipyards) get to the point where their cash flow is so \n     impacted that they can't perform.''\n       Nearly 700 civilian workers were furloughed from the Navy's \n     contracting offices in Portsmouth and Newport News. Without \n     those workers, the Navy can't process bills from local \n     shipyards.\n       ``At some point I presume we'll have to bring some skeleton \n     staff back in to work,'' Hattich said.\n       The contracts office also won't be awarding any new \n     contracts for the duration of the shutdown.\n       The Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth is not being \n     affected by the shutdown.\n       Marine Hydraulics International Inc., which emerged from a \n     bankruptcy reorganization in October, was determining \n     Thursday how many of its 248 employees it would have to lay \n     off immediately, said Vice President Gary Brandt.\n       The yard suspended activity on some recently negotiated, \n     but not finalized, add-ons to its contract to repair the \n     guided-missile frigate Clark at its Norfolk facility, Brandt \n     said. MHI will continue already contracted work on the Clark \n     as long as its financing holds out, Brandt said.\n       The extent of the impact depends a lot on how long \n     government operations are suspended without some form of \n     relief for the shipyards.\n\n[[Page S 17463]]\n\n       ``If it's just a day or two, then it's no big deal,'' \n     Hattich said. ``If it lasts 90 days like some people are \n     saying, then we have a problem.''\n       ``Thirty days is probably longer than we can stand,'' \n     Norshipco's Roper said Thursday. ``I'm not sure I can \n     guarantee my work force can continue beyond tomorrow.''\n       Norshipco does have some commercial jobs, but not nearly \n     enough to sustain its work force, he said.\n       Moon Engineering Co. Inc. expects it could feel the \n     pressure in two to four weeks, said James Thomas, the \n     Portsmouth shipyard's executive vice president and general \n     manager. ``I really can't say when right now,'' Thomas said.\n       ``We have a lot of government receivables out now,'' he \n     said. ``How soon (we're hurt) depends on whether they get \n     paid.''\n       Moon started a contract on the destroyer Peterson three \n     weeks ago. The cruiser Ticonderoga arrived at the yard \n     Thursday for repairs and maintenance.\n       ``We've got about 250 to 300 employees here now and we're \n     still working, but if push really came to shove, we're going \n     to have to send people home,'' Thomas said.\n       Metro Machine Corp. has the resources to keep operating for \n     now, said its president, Richard Goldbach. ``I don't see it \n     affecting us unless it lasts past a week or two,'' he said. \n     ``We'll worry about it then, but I think we'll have the \n     resources even then to keep operating.''\n       Other shipyards also could be unaffected by the shutdown. \n     Newport News Shipbuilding doesn't expect any impact on its \n     work force because of its financial condition, a spokeswoman \n     said.\n       The giant Peninsula shipyard, which builds aircraft \n     carriers for the Navy and employs nearly 19,000 people, is \n     owned by a multi-billion dollar conglomerate that probably \n     has the financial wherewithal to sustain the yard's \n     operations.\n       Colonna's Shipyard Inc., a small Norfolk shipyard, expects \n     to survive on its usual diet of commercial work, said Vice \n     President Doug Forrest. ``We don't have any Navy work in the \n     yard now,'' he said.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17460-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17463-S17464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Alaska, my \nfriend from Virginia, and my friend, Senator Lott, for their remarks on \nthe matter at hand. I understand as a senior member of the Armed \nServices Committee, and I join and thank Senator Stevens, Senator \nWarner, and others for bringing up this matter. It is a very critical \nmatter and we cannot pass over it. So whatever help I can be to you in \nthis regard, I will be.\n  I simply point out that Senator Warner and I came here together, and \nwe have served on the Armed Services Committee ever since then. I have \nbeen disappointed, as he has, that we still have not reported out of \nthe Armed Services Committee the authorizing legislation, which \ncustomarily should precede the appropriations that are handled so very \nably, and have been for so many years, by my colleague from Alaska. You \nbring up a very good point. I think that, as important as that is, we \nshould realize and recognize that people in other areas are just as \nsurely affected adversely. That is why we have to move.\n  Thank you very much, my friend from Alaska, for saying we should stay \nhere for however long it takes; there should be no recess. I was \ndelighted, in case my colleague did not know it, that within the hour, \nthe House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected a move by Speaker \nGingrich to adjourn the House of Representatives. How in the world \nanybody who understands Government--including the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives, who evidently you have been in contact with \nregarding the dire circumstances coming on to the Defense Department--\nwhy in the world he would want to adjourn the House of Representatives \nis beyond me. I was delighted to see that it was overwhelmingly \nrejected. I do not know whether there has ever been a case before where \na motion to adjourn has been overridden on the floor. I do not ever \nremember that happening, at least on this side, while I have been here.\n  I think maybe that message was sent very loud and clear to the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives that this is no time for us to \nbe adjourning or recessing. We have to stay here regardless of how \nearly we come in or how late we work every night, to show that we are \ntrying to work out the problems on this. I suspect and say, without \nknowing it for sure, that if the Members on the floor of the Senate \nright now would have their way, we could probably sit down and resolve \nthis matter very, very quickly. But politics on both sides, \nunfortunately, are being played.\n  I simply say that I was so pleased that the House of Representatives \ndid not take the recommendations of their Speaker and adjourn. I \nthought it was rather interesting as I watched that vote, that early in \nthe first 5 minutes of that vote, I believe there were 87 or 88 \nRepublicans who had voted with their leader, Speaker Gingrich, to \nadjourn the House of Representatives. But before the vote was over, \nwhen the Republicans saw what was happening, that 87 or 88 shrunk down \nto, I believe, about 32 at the end, as even the Republicans recognized \nthat their leader was way, way off base by trying to adjourn with the \ndire circumstances that face our country today, including the ones \nbrought forth and explained in great detail by my friend from Virginia \nand my friend from Alaska. I will be of whatever help I can.\n  Now, on the overall and underlying matter that was addressed by \nSenator Lott, objected to by the minority leader, I think this points \nup the problem that we have today. Let me, as best I can, try to \nexplain what is being overlooked in this discussion. Within the last \nfew minutes, I have heard, I believe, the phrase ``balance the budget \nin 7 years'' about 17 times. Well, Mr. President, notwithstanding the \nfact that there is some dispute as to how we get there, this Senator \nhas wanted to balance the budget in 7 years, if not sooner, for a long, \nlong time.\n\n  In fact, I was one of those that had voted for the constitutional \namendment that would have been referred to the States to accomplish \nthat end. So my credentials, certainly, with regard to national defense \nand certainly with regard to fiscal responsibility, I think, are pretty \nwell established, and most people even on that side of the aisle would \nagree.\n  I simply say that, when you throw around this phrase, a 7-year \nbalanced budget--I have been for that for a long, long time, as have \nmany people on this side of the aisle. I would like to advise all so \nthat we can straighten that out--all that are hearing my voice at this \ntime--that as late as last night when we thought we were very near \nreaching a compromise, we had as a part of that agreement that we would \nbalance the budget in 7 years. That was put up not by the President, \nbut by Leon Panetta and myself and others who were in on the \nnegotiations. So when we throw around the term ``balance the budget in \n7 years,'' not everybody, but most people are for that. The President's \nChief of Staff was here offering to enter into an agreement for a \ncontinuing resolution to accomplish that end.\n  Now, the holdup comes with regard to how we reach that balanced \nbudget in 7 years. Therein lies the grave concerns. What the \nRepublicans are saying, I believe, without emphasizing it, is that they \nwant to tie the President's hands to a 7-year balanced budget on their \nterms. I simply say, Mr. President, that I think that is wrong for lots \nof reasons, and I will not be part of that.\n  When you ask the question, ``What is at stake here?''--and that \nquestion is asked by Senator Lott--well, what is at stake here is a \ngreat deal. What is at stake here are basic principles of Government, \nand most of us on this side of the aisle do not agree with the way \nthose on that side of the aisle are coming up with their numbers, \nsetting their priorities. We think they are mixed up. I said earlier \ntoday on the floor of the Senate and, therefore, I will try again at \nthis time to keep my rhetoric within due bounds, because I do not \nbelieve expanded rhetoric of simply abuse is particularly constructive.\n  However, among other things that have been overlooked about what is \nat stake here, I interpret it as being a basic violation of \nconstitutional principles that is at stake here. The Constitution \nguarantees the right of the President to veto a bill passed by the \nCongress. The Constitution does not say that he has a right to veto \nonly after consultation with Congress. The Constitution does not say \nthat the President, in balancing the budget, has to do it in a fashion \nand in a manner that the majority of the House or Senate propose. The \nConstitution guarantees, as a very important part of that document--and \nthe Framers of the Constitution, in attempting to have balance of the \nthree equal branches of \n\n[[Page S 17464]]\nGovernment to try to balance the judiciary, executive, and the \nlegislative, gave the President that power.\n\n  What the Republicans are really doing, Mr. President, whether they \nrealize it or not, is putting a gun to the head of the President of the \nUnited States, saying, ``If you veto, which you have a right to do \nunder the Constitution, we are going to take that away, or attempt to \ntake it away by saying to you we are going to close down Government if \nyou exercise your right, Mr. President.''\n  We are going to violate the principles of the Constitution simply by \nputting that gun to your head and saying, ``If you do that, we will \nclose down Government because you, Mr. President, can't veto this bill \nor you will close down Government.''\n  I think the President is standing up not only for himself but every \nother President that we are going to have in the years to come. If this \nPresident of the United States does not stand up and protect the \nprerogatives of the President of the United States, that are guaranteed \nin the Constitution, if he is going to set precedence here to some time \nin the future with some other Congress and some other President, they \nare going to hark back and say ``Well, the Republicans back there in \n1995 took away the prerogatives of the President.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator from Nebraska \nhas expired.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent since there are no \nother speakers on this side of the aisle that I be allowed to continue \nfor an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will allow for another 3 minutes and then I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. So, Mr. President, I simply say, what is at stake here is \nthe fact that we cannot get together.\n  What is at stake is the President of the United States and others who \nwere negotiating last night said, ``OK, 7 years. We will work for a 7-\nyear balanced budget but we are not going to accept what I think is \nbeing tried to be dictated to by the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives.''\n  We are in a very serious situation. I looked at the clippings from \nthe newspapers back home today. One headline says ``GOP Puts Wrapping \non Budget Package;'' ``Return to Sender Seen as Response.''\n  Here is another: ``Gingrich's Remarks Fuel Democrats' Budget Fight.'' \nDown below that a headline, ``Park Service to Evict Campers.''\n  Then, of course, ``Veto Expected As House OK's Defense Funds.'' That \nis what has been addressed here.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that if we could have the continuing \nresolution that we have been pleading for, on a short-term basis, that \nhas been continually rejected by the Republicans, primarily led, I \nsuspect, by Speaker Gingrich, we could have that continuing resolution, \nall of us know that all of these concerns that have just been addressed \nby the Senator from Alaska and others would fade. They just would not \nbe there.\n\n  Why can we not be reasonable? Two other items and headlines: ``Office \nof Aging Plans Furloughs, Service Cuts,'' and ``21 Guard Drills Are \nCanceled As Budget Standoff Continues.''\n  Let me read briefly from the ``Office of Aging Plans'':\n\n       The Eastern Nebraska Office on Aging intends to furlough 74 \n     of its 90 employees because of the federal budget dispute.\n       Bob Whitmore, a spokesman for the Omaha-based agency, said \n     the furloughs would take effect at 5 p.m. Wednesday. . .''\n\n  All this would not be necessary and we would not go through the silly \ncharade if we could have, as we have had several times in the past, a \nshort-term continuing resolution to December 5 or December 15.\n  All this could be set aside if it were not for the fact that the \nRepublicans were trying to put that gun to the President's head to take \naway the constitutional right guaranteed to the President by saying \n``You are going to do it our way or none, or we will close down \nGovernment.''\n  I hope we have an understanding between cooler heads in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 1 minute and 21 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do hope that I could pick up on your final comments, I \nsay to my good friend--that is, cool heads. I hope the Senator would \nrephrase some of his rhetoric about the gun to the head.\n  I kind of think that this matter needs a little cooling off in terms \nof rhetoric, Mr. President. I know that the meetings which I have \nattended today, it has been calmness, coolness, and very conscientious \nefforts on behalf of those in attendance to try to bring this to \nresolve.\n  I know the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Dole, is going to be \nworking through the early evening. I hope to work with him on this \nmatter.\n  One last comment. The distinguished colleague, a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, mentioned the authorization bill. I say that \nChairman Thurmond has been working through late last night and again \nthis morning with the ranking member, Mr. Nunn, and other members of \nthe committee.\n  I am pleased to say I think we are making some progress on that bill \nto bring it to a conclusion and soon, hopefully, present it to the \nSenate, the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17463-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17464-S17465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BALANCE THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, America is watching what we do here today, \nor more importantly, what we fail to do. I think they are watching with \na much more critical eye than we are willing to give them credit for.\n  I say that because it was well over 20 years ago when another Senator \nfrom Virginia put legislation through this body, passed by law, to \nbalance the Federal budget within a very short period of time. That was \nlaw. That was Federal law, Mr. President.\n  This Congress went by it so fast that it was not even the blur of a \nstop sign. Four times following that over the last two decades this \nCongress has passed laws, I tell you, to balance the Federal budget. \nYet, of course, that never happened.\n  We are now nearly $5 trillion in debt. We have a $200 billion \ndeficit. This President came forward last night and said, ``Let's set a \ngoal. Let's once again have a goal to achieve a federally balanced \nbudget.'' Somehow that was worthy.\n  I know what the American people are saying at this moment. ``Oh, no, \nyou don't, Mr. President. We don't trust you nor do we trust the \nCongress. You no longer have any credibility in the area of spending \nbecause you have shown you cannot control your appetites.''\n  That is why only by 1 vote out of 535 votes this year, 435 votes, did \nwe miss sending out an amendment to the Constitution of this country to \nassure the citizens' right to decide on whether they want a balanced \nbudget or not.\n  I know what folks in my State are saying right now. While they \nrecognize the inconvenience of what we do at the moment, and while \nthere are Federal employees in my State who are furloughed by phone \ncalls pouring in to all of my State offices and my office here, on a \n12-1 ratio, they are saying, ``Don't blink. Don't blink. It is not a \ngoal. It is no longer a concept. It is no longer an ideal.''\n  They are saying, ``Make it a reality, Mr. President. Balance the \nFederal budget and do it now. Put together what you promised us in last \nyear's election that you would do.'' Are we once again going to be the \ntraditional politician of Washington and tell the citizens one thing \nand then bow to the pressure to do something else? I say no, absolutely \nno. It is time we send a message to the American people that we mean \nexactly what we told them.\n  Mr. President, we have people out of work on the Federal payroll \ntoday because of you. You are the one who vetoed the bills. You are the \none who is now saying you will veto the DOD appropriations bill.\n\n  Senator Stevens from Alaska was in here very distressed, as he should \nbe, that we have now done our work and tonight a bill that will put \nhundreds of thousands of men and women, both civilian and in uniform, \nback to work--this President says ``No, I will veto it.'' Why? Because \n``It does not meet my goal.''\n  Mr. President, check in the Constitution. Read the Constitution. Who \nbudgets for our Government? We do. You \n\n[[Page S 17465]]\nexecute the budget, Mr. President. That is what the Constitution says.\n  I have advocated giving the President more authority. In the balanced \nbudget amendment that I helped craft it has been the No. 1 amendment \nhere on the floor of the Senate and in the House for well over 5 years. \nWe have given the President a right to become a full participant in the \nbudget process but he does not have that right now.\n  Yes, he can veto. But when he vetoes, it is without question his \nresponsibility for the people who are no longer employed by action of \nthat veto.\n  So we crafted another continuing resolution and he said, ``I will \nveto it. Don't send it down,'' and it has not gone down.\n  Last night we passed a balanced budget for 1995.\n  This President says he will veto it. Mr. President, this is one \nSenator who is not going to bow to that kind of pressure. I will not \nvote for a goal or a concept or an ideal. And I encourage all of my \ncolleagues not to vote that way either. We will vote for a balanced \nbudget in 7 years and we will vote for it based on legitimate, legal, \nresponsible figures that tell the truth and show the American public \nexactly what we are spending and where we are spending it and where the \nrevenue to spend is coming from. That is what this Government and that \nis what this Congress must do, without question or without doubt.\n  For, if we do not, the clock continues to tick. A $5 trillion debt, a \n$5.1 trillion, $5.2 trillion, a $5.3 trillion, and on and on and on. \nAnd the children of tomorrow are going to owe, not $15,000 or $16,000 \nor $17,000 of their earnings back to Government for the debt we \ncreated, it will be $20,000 or $25,000 or $30,000 or $40,000. The \nAmerican people are smarter than that. How possibly can we continue to \ndo that?\n  That is why we saw the greatest political realignment ever in the \nhistory of our country occur last November, because finally the \nAmerican people said, ``Enough is enough.'' Mr. President, hear me: I \nwill not bow to the goal or the concept or the idea, because I know \nwhat you want. You have already indicated it. You want billions more to \nspend for programs that are questionable in their nature as to the \nservices they provide.\n  The American people want a balanced budget. We have now labored \nnearly 11 months to craft a budget and bring it into that concept and \ninto those parameters. It has not been just the Republicans that have \ndone that; it is Republican and Democrat alike.\n  So I hope our leadership will not bend. I hope our leadership will \nlisten to their people and listen to the phone calls. Adhere to a \nbalanced budget. Adhere to the tough decisions. Say to this President, \nif you will not agree with us, then we will continue our work. We will \nnot recess, as I have encouraged our leader not to do, and we will \nbring down the appropriations bills and we will fund a balanced budget.\n  I will tell you that is a gun to no one's head. That is simply what \nthe American people want. The hand-wringing is over with. We have spent \n30 years playing this game, and I sincerely believe the game is over. \nIt is now time to realize we must do what the American people asked us \nto do and do so in a responsible fashion.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17464-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, with the Senate's \nconsideration of the Budget Reconciliation bill, the rubber really met \nthe road. This is the real thing.\n  We have been warning for some time now that this bill would represent \nthe extreme priorities set largely by the majority in the other House. \nThe budget reconciliation bill which the conference set us--conference \nwhich effectively excluded Democrats--and which the Senate passed on \nnear party lines, included a very large cut in Medicare. The $270 \nbillion cut is three times what is necessary to stabilize the trust \nfund. These plus a cap on direct student loans, reductions in the \nearned Income tax credit for working Americans, all, in part, are to \npay for a large tax break, the benefits of which will go mainly to the \nwealthiest among us. There are a number of other shortsighted changes \nin Federal programs including cuts in child nutrition programs.\n  Mr. President, for the past week we have seen the Speaker of the \nHouse and Republican majority irresponsibly shut down large parts of \nthe Government and threaten the credit rating of the United States. \nThis is a long-planned tactic to force the President to accept their \nextreme budget priorities. Now, those priorities are laid bare in this \nbill for all to see.\n  The issue isn't whether one favors a balanced budget. I do. I have \nvoted for one on more than one occasion.\n  Let us look at balance, as the Republicans have defined it. On the \none side, \n\n[[Page S 17466]]\nthere are $247 billion in tax breaks, which mainly benefit the \nwealthiest of Americans. On the other side, for ordinary, middle-income \nAmericans, there will be increases in Medicare premiums, increases in \ncollege loan costs, and for some working Americans with wages under \n$30,000 per year, a $32 billion tax increase. The tax increase on those \nreceiving the earned income tax credit hurts America's most vulnerable \nworkers, including more than 4 million workers who make less than \n$10,000. Overall, according to U.S. Treasury data, 12.6 million \nhousehold would have their earned income tax credit reduced under this \nlegislation. 7.7 million households would see a net increase in taxes.\n\n  These priorities are wrong. I have supported a balanced budget. I \nhave supported a budget balanced in 7 years. But, I cannot accept, and \nI do not believe the President will sign a budget as skewed as the one \nwhich is before us today. The issue is not whether to balance the \nbudget or when to balance the budget. The issue is how to balance the \nbudget.\n  The Republicans have tried to strong arm the President into accepting \nthese priorities. They planned this course months ago. It's bad enough \nthat the majority is willing to shut down functions of the Government \nwhich many people rely upon and that they are willing to risk the \ncredit rating of the United States. But, to add insult to injury, we \nhave seen from their own statements that this is a long-planned tactic.\n  As long ago as April 3, the Washington Times reported that:\n\n       House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed yesterday to create a \n     titanic legislative standoff with President Clinton by adding \n     vetoed bills to must pass legislation increasing the national \n     debt ceiling.\n\n  And in May, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich said,\n\n       We'll probably have a few train wrecks, but that's always \n     helpful in a revolution.\n\n  In September, Speaker Gingrich said,\n\n       I don't care what the price is. I don't care if we have no \n     executive offices and no bonds for 60 days--not this time.\n\n  It is clear again why the majority has been holding the Government \nhostage. They have a set of budget priorities which do not fare well in \nthe light of day. They are bad for senior citizens, bad for children, \nbad for working Americans. So, let's get on with it. They can pass it, \nthey have the votes. The President will veto it. And then, we can get \non to the real business of resolving our differences. Negotiations need \nto go forward to reach a bipartisan agreement, so that we can reach a \ngenuine balance budget with a time certain and with the right \npriorities. This is how our system works. Let us get reasonable people \naround the table. America is waiting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17465-6", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, late last night the Senate passed \nunanimously the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1995, including my \nlegislation, the California Cruise Industry Revitalization Act.\n  At long last, this legislation has left the dock, and once we work \nout differences with the House on other provisions, we will finally put \nmy State's cruise industry back on track, providing jobs and tourist \nrevenue for California.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to the bipartisan leadership \nof the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee for their work \nin moving this important authorization bill for the U.S. Coast Guard to \nthe Senate floor for passage. I particularly wish to thank my \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee chairman, Senator Chafee, for \nhis diligent effort to fashion a compromise on the difficult issues \nraised in the House version of this legislation that fall within his \ncommittee's jurisdiction.\n  This Coast Guard bill includes a provision that is critical to a key \nelement of my State's economy, California tourism, particularly our \ncruise ship industry and the jobs that depend on it.\n  On the first day of the 104th Congress, I introduced legislation, the \nCalifornia Cruise Industry Revitalization Act, S. 138, to amend the law \npassed by the 102d Congress which allowed gambling on U.S.-flag cruise \nships but that also allowed States to outlaw gambling on ships involved \nin intrastate cruises. My legislation would lift the ban on gaming on \ncruise ships traveling between consecutive California ports. The \nCommerce Committee this summer agreed to include my legislation as \nsection 1106 in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1995.\n  Let me explain why this provision is so important to my State.\n  In 1992, subsequent to the congressional action, the California \nLegislature dealt the State's tourism industry a severe blow by passing \na law prohibiting on-board gambling. However, it failed to distinguish \nbetween cruise ships making multiple ports of call in the State while \non an interstate voyage, and the so-called cruises to nowhere whose \nonly purpose is shipboard gambling.\n  Consequently, California's cruise ship industry, which had been \ngrowing at an average annual rate of 17 percent since 1989, began to \nrun aground because cruise lines immediately revised their itineraries. \nThe State's share of the global cruise ship business has dropped from \n10 percent to 7 percent at the same time growth in the cruise ship \nbusiness overall has climbed 10 percent a year.\n  My legislation is essential to restoring California's cruise ship \nindustry which has lost hundreds of jobs and more than $250 million in \ntourist revenue since the State law's enactment. Many California cruise \nship companies have bypassed second and third ports of call within \nCalifornia.\n  The law to prohibit gambling cruises to nowhere has had the effect of \ndiscouraging cruise ships from traveling between California ports, even \nif the voyage is part of an interstate or international journey. In \neffect, a cruise ship traveling from Los Angeles to San Diego could no \nlonger open its casinos, even in international waters. But if the ship \nbypassed San Diego and sailed directly to a foreign port, it could open \nits casinos as soon as it was in international waters.\n  According to the Port of San Diego, that port alone has lost $78 \nmillion in economic impact, hundreds of jobs and over 300 cruise ship \ncalls. That is more than two-thirds of its cruise ship business.\n  Los Angeles has lost business as well, with the projected loss of \nport revenue is $3 million, with 118 annual vessel calls at risk. \nBeyond the port, the economic impact to the city amounts to $14 million \nin tourism and $26 million in retail sales. The total impact estimated \nby the Port of Los Angeles is an estimated $159 million and 2,400 \ndirect and indirect jobs.\n  Ports all along the coast from Humboldt Bay to San Diego have \nsuffered economic losses. For a State still recovering from an economic \nrecession, defense downsizing and back-to-back natural disasters, a \nblow to a major industry in the State--tourism--is unfathomable.\n  Section 1106 would resolve this problem by allowing a cruise ship \nwith gambling devices to make multiple ports of call in one State and \nstill be considered to be on an interstate or international voyage, if \nthe ship reaches an out-of-State or foreign port within 3 days.\n  Gambling operations still would be permitted only in international \nwaters. The effect would expand only the non-gambling aspects of cruise \nship tourism by permitting more ports of call within the State. \nCalifornia is the only State affected by this bill.\n  Mr. President, former Congresswoman Lynn Schenk had labored \ntirelessly to include this legislation in the House Coast Guard bill. \nUnfortunately, the bill died in the Senate last year when the Coast \nGuard bill was lumped together with other maritime legislation that \nstalled.\n  The future of California's cruise industry rides on this provision. \nAn identical provision is contained in the House version of the Coast \nGuard authorization bill. I urge my colleagues to swiftly resolve the \nother issues in conference and send the bill to the President for his \nsignature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17466-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17466-S17467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ANNIVERSARY OF LEBANON'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this month we mark the 52d \nanniversary of the independence of Lebanon. Each \n\n[[Page S 17467]]\nyear as we mark the anniversary, Lebanese-Americans and the friends of \nLebanon reflect on Lebanon's past and look ahead as it rebuilds for the \nfuture.\n  Six years after World War I, Lebanon was declared a republic, through \nstill under French mandate. When France's World War II Vichy government \nwas forced to surrender to Allied forces in July 1941, the Free French \nofficially declared Lebanon independent on November 26. Elections took \nplace during the summer of 1943, and by November 1943, when the new \ngovernment took over, the French mandate was effectively terminated.\n  In the same year, Christian and Moslem leaders in Lebanon negotiated \nan agreement called the National Pact, which defined Lebanon as a \ndistinct, sovereign country. The agreement was based on the principle \nof equitable religious representation in government and administration. \nThe country's Maronite Christian, Sunni Moslem, Shia Moslem, and Druze \npopulations were all represented in Lebanon's new parliament.\n  Lebanon's new system of government functioned effectively until 1975, \nwhen the country was thrust into a civil war. Tragic domestic upheaval \npersisted until 1989, the year that the Taif Agreement ended the civil \nwar. The Taif Agreement was intended to lead to full restoration of \nLebanon's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity.\n  Of course, the Taif Agreement has not yet led to the fulfillment of \nthese goals. However, it has been a stepping stone toward peace in \nLebanon. Beirut is more tranquil and Lebanon's free-market economy \ncontinues to recover after the years of turmoil the civil war produced. \nDespite these successes, Lebanon continues to suffer the presence of \nforeign soldiers, further hindering the rebuilding of the country.\n  Peace within Lebanon depends greatly on peaceful relations with its \nneighbors. This peace cannot permanently take root in Lebanon until \nLebanon is able to fully regain its national sovereignty and settle is \ndifferences with its neighbors in the region.\n  I believe it is important for the Lebanese people, as well as anyone \nwho holds an interest in the region, to honor Lebanon's independence \nand to reflect on the spirit of the agreement on which modern Lebanon \nwas founded. Lebanon has shown its great resilience. And, the Lebanese \npeople, in all of their diversity, have shown their ability, in the \npast, to work together peacefully for a stronger Lebanon. We all hope \nthat the future of Lebanon is bright, and that the people of Lebanon \nwill come together to build on this land's rich heritage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17466-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17467-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17467-S17468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate, for the information of all \nSenators, that we have presented the Democratic leader with a \ncounteroffer on how we can end this impasse as far as the partial \nshutdown of the Government is concerned. I know that Senator Domenici, \nchairman of the Budget Committee, and Congressman Kasich, chairman of \nthe House Budget Committee, will be calling Leon Panetta, the \nPresident's Chief of Staff--may have called him by now or will be \ncalling soon.\n  Hopefully, they can meet with Mr. Panetta tomorrow, early afternoon, \nabout 1 o'clock. So it seems to me, in the event something should \noccur, that we should be at least prepared to act on it in the U.S. \nSenate. Sunday sessions are extraordinary, but in this circumstance I \nthink it is very appropriate.\n  So we will come in at 2:30 in the afternoon. I hope we can resolve \nthis matter tomorrow. The House also would be available, I think within \na few hours, I am told by the Speaker, to assemble enough House Members \nto take action in the event that it is necessary tomorrow.\n  So, if we can, I would say to my colleagues, whose staff may be \nlistening, or just for their information, if there should be a rollcall \nvote, we will give everybody adequate time to be here. So I would not \nbe concerned about that. If we should reach an agreement, I hope that \nwe could do it on a voice vote because some of our Members would have \nto come long distances.\n  Of course, if we should reach agreement tomorrow, we will not be in \nsession next week. So we will convene tomorrow, hopefully to work out, \nor continue to work out, some agreement on the continuing resolution.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the majority \nleader. We started out early this morning and, indeed, worked through \nmuch of the day in very serious meetings, two of those meetings with \nthe Speaker of the House. Throughout, the majority leader has expressed \ngreat compassion for those who have been furloughed.\n  Once again, both the leadership of the Senate and the House wish to \nconfirm in one way or another that we are going to see that there will \nbe no loss of pay, and we express our profound compassion for the \nstress and the strain brought upon families. Repeatedly in the most \nrecent meeting of an hour ago with the Speaker, our distinguished \nleader said time and time again, he knows the great concern with these \nindividuals and their families. So that will be done.\n  Of course, the proposition that we sent down to the President again \npreserves that 7-year balanced budget. That is, in my judgment, the \nkeystone and the arch we hope to build to solve this between the \nexecutive and the legislative branches.\n  So, again, I express my appreciation to the leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we do have a continuing resolution that has \nbeen passed by the House and the Senate which we will be pleased to \nsend to the President if there is some indication the President will \nsign it. I think he has indicated to the contrary. So we will not, at \nleast at this moment, send it to the President.\n  We did send, again for the information of all of our colleagues, \nthree appropriations bills to the President today: Defense \nappropriations, a very important bill. If he would sign that bill, I am \ntold by Senator Stevens from Alaska, chairman of that subcommittee, \n183,000 people could go back to work. That is a big, big bill. That is \nabout a fourth of those presently furloughed.\n  So I hope the President will take a careful look at the defense \nappropriations bill. In addition, the White House has now received the \nlegislative appropriations bill and the Treasury-Post Office \nappropriations bill. I understand that the President may sign those two \npieces of legislation which, again, will take off some of the strain. \n\n[[Page S 17468]]\n\n  But I want to make the point, this is not just about people being \nfurloughed. This is about a fundamental difference on how we achieve a \nbalanced budget and whether we achieve it in 7 years, as the Republican \nCongress feels we can, or whether it is 8 years, 9 years, 10 years or \nmaybe 7 years, if the President would agree.\n  So I hope we can continue to work. Most of us will be happy to meet \nlater this evening if there is any opportunity to work out a successful \nagreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/S17467-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 2:30 P.M.
