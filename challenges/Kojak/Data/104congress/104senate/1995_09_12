The distinguished Senator from North \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I inquire if the Conrad-Bradley \namendment is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2529\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], for Mr. Conrad, \n     for himself and Mr. Bradley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2529.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Conrad-Bradley amendment is based on \nthe four principles of requiring work, protecting children, providing \nflexibility for States, and promoting the family structure. Our \namendment fundamentally reforms the welfare system by allowing States \nto choose between the pure block grant approach of the Dole bill and a \nprogram that maintains a safety net for children, provides an automatic \nstabilizer for States, and includes the funding to pay for them.\n  None of us can predict the future. If there are floods in \nMississippi, earthquakes in California, a drought in North Dakota, or \nsome economic calamity in Colorado, a flat-funded block grant approach \nmay not meet the need. We should retain the automatic stabilizer that \nallows a State to receive the help it requires. After all, this is the \nUnited States of America, not just 50 separate States.\n  Our amendment allows States to choose the Dole approach or the \nConrad-Bradley option for 4 years. After that, the State may continue \nits program or switch to the other approach at their option. Our option \nprovides States with complete flexibility to design work requirements, \njob training programs, to determine eligibility and sanctions. It \nallows States to set time limits of any duration for participants, \nprovided that no participants are terminated if they comply with all \nState requirements.\n  The Conrad-Bradley amendment expands the State flexibility already \nincluded in the Dole bill. It uses States as laboratories to \nexperiment, to find what is effective in welfare reform strategies. \nAlthough the States will have almost total flexibility to design their \nown welfare programs, they will do so without the risk that a natural \ndisaster or economic collapse will prevent them from protecting \nchildren and families.\n  The Dole proposal before us already includes such an option for the \nfood stamp program. If an option to choose between a pure block grant \napproach and a system that automatically adjusts for the need is \nappropriate for food stamps, I suggest we should provide the same \noption for the Dole AFDC block grant.\n  According to CBO, our amendment provides protection for children and \nStates while saving $63 billion over 7 years, compared with the $70 \nbillion of \n\n[[Page S 13316]]\nsavings in the current version of the Dole bill. In other words, we \nreduce the overall savings in the Dole bill, which are currently $70 \nbillion, by $7 billion over the 7 years, in order to protect children \nand protect the States--to preserve the automatic stabilizer mechanism.\n  Again, it is a State choice. They can choose the pure block grant \napproach of the Dole bill. They can choose that for 4 years. Or they \ncan choose the approach in our bill, which represents the most dramatic \nwelfare reform ever presented on the floor of the Senate.\n  Finally, the Conrad-Bradley amendment eliminates the need to struggle \nover State allocation formulas because it allows States to choose, to \nchoose between the Dole block grant approach and a funding mechanism \nthat automatically adjusts for State need and effort.\n  Proponents of the Dole bill say that we should let States experiment. \nWe agree. That is precisely what we ought to do. Let us let the States \ngo out and try various welfare reform strategies and see what works. \nThat makes good sense. Let us give the States a chance to experiment. \nLet us give the States a chance to determine what works and what does \nnot work. But let us maintain the automatic stabilizer to help States \nhit by natural disasters or economic calamities. Let us make certain \nthey have the resources to meet the need that none of us can foresee. \nLet us make certain that we can protect children.\n  We are, after all, the United States of America, not the divided \nStates of America. Let us remember our strength flows not only from our \ndiversity, but from our union.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President at the request of the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Bumpers], I ask unanimous consent that his name be added \nas a cosponsor of S. 978.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of Feinstein amendment No. 2469, on which there \nwill be 4 minutes of debate equally divided, followed by a vote on or \nin relation to the amendment.\n  The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I respectfully suggest the Senate is not \nin order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will take their conversations off the \nfloor. The Senate will be in order. There will be 4 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order? We need to know what we \nare voting on. We cannot hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Chair advises \nSenators to take their conversations off the floor. The Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order. There are \ntoo many discussions going on toward the rear of the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators at the rear of the Chamber----\n  Mr. BYRD. And staff. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia, because I believe this is a very important amendment.\n  Let me quickly sum up how my amendment, I believe, improves the \nunderlying bill. In the Dole bill, 31 States have their funding frozen \nat fiscal year 1994 levels for the next 5 years. Funding is frozen \ndespite very tough mandates to States which require a minimum work \nparticipation rate, which CBO says, as late as last night, only 10 to \n15 States will be able to meet. Those States that cannot meet the \nminimum work participation rate will have a penalty of 5 percent with \nanother 5 percent from the State, or a 10-percent cut in funds, and all \nbut 19 States are locked out of the so-called growth formula.\n  So this is major. What I would like to say to my colleagues who \nrepresent the 31 States that are frozen out of the Dole bill is this: \nNot only will your State be required to meet that mandate, not only \nwill your State receive no additional funding for child care or job \ntraining to meet the mandate, and even though your State will almost \ndefinitely experience an increase in poor population, your funding is \nfrozen.\n  This bill, my amendment, takes the language of the House which says \nthat the poor population of the State, as reflected by the census, will \nbe used to determine the growth allocation. And, in fact, 27 States \nincrease their funding under my amendment over the Dole bill.\n  Those charts have been distributed to you, and I urge, if you are one \nof those 27 States, that you vote for this amendment. The amendment is \nfair. It is as the House does it. It simply says the census determines \nthe numbers and the money for growth is accommodated in that way.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. \n\n[[Page S 13317]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Is there \nfurther debate? The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to vote for \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I must once again respectfully suggest \nthe Senate is not in order. We cannot hear the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair asks that Senators withhold \nconversations. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it was very difficult to solve the formula issue when \nwe decided we were going to reform welfare. The most fair formula is \nthe underlying bill, the Dole-Hutchison formula.\n What it does is allow everyone to win at some point. No one loses what \nthey have now. Yet, the low-benefit, high-growth States are not \npenalized in years 3, 4, and 5.\n\n  When we decided to block grant for 5 years, we had to look at the \naccommodation for the high-growth States where they had low benefits. \nThat is because the high-benefit States get their windfall in the \nbeginning. Whereas, California gets $1,016 per poor person grant. \nStates like Alabama get $148. Mississippi gets $138, as compared to \n$1,000.\n  So the goal of our underlying bill is to reach parity slowly, without \nhurting the New Yorks, the Michigans, and the Californias, but bringing \nup the States that no longer have to have a State match and are very \npoor. So it is equitable and it is fair.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the overall picture and understand \nthat if we are going to have welfare reform, we must start with the new \nparameters, which are that the State match is going to be phased out. \nYes, New York and California had big State matches and, therefore, got \nmore Federal dollars. They are going to keep those Federal dollars, \neven as the State's match is phased out. But the low-benefit, high-\ngrowth States are going to get their help in the end. That is why this \nis a balance. That is why this is fair and why the low-benefit States \nare not going to have to pay in order for California to continue to \ngrow.\n  We will never reach parity under the Feinstein amendment. There will \nnever be fairness in the system as we go to the Federal dollars, \nwithout State matches. The only way that we can go toward the goal of \nparity and equality in this country is to stay with the underlying \nbill.\n  I hope you will vote against the Feinstein amendment and stick with \nthe Dole-Hutchison formula, which is fair to everyone.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment from the \nSenator from California.\n  The reason I oppose this amendment is because it does nothing to help \nus meet our real goal in this debate, which is the fundamental reform \nof a failed welfare system.\n  Instead it reopens a funding formula debate that pits State against \nState, and puts the whole endeavor of welfare reform in dire jeopardy.\n  Let me be clear that my State is one that would benefit from the \nadoption of the Feinstein amendment. There are elements of the Senator \nfrom California's amendment that I believe have merit, and I believe \nshe has made some important points in the debate on her amendment.\n  Nevertheless, the practical effect of her amendment will be to reopen \na battle that can only stand in the way of the enactment of this \nimportant welfare reform bill. I intend to vote against this amendment, \nand I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 40, nays 59, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 410 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Cochran\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 2469), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nlimited on the Ashcroft and Shelby amendments to 1 hour on each \namendment, equally divided between the sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the so-called \nBreaux amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent at this time that Senators \nJeffords, Kohl, Snowe and Baucus be added as original cosponsors to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, what we present today in this amendment is \na bipartisan effort, which is the way that welfare reform has to be \naccomplished in this country. There is no way that we as Democrats can \nwrite the bill by ourselves. There is no way the Republicans, by \nthemselves, could write a bill that will become law. This amendment \nrecognizes that, and it is a bipartisan effort.\n  We have worked with distinguished Members of the other side, \nRepublican colleagues, to craft this amendment to make it fair, to make \nit one that can receive bipartisan support and reach a majority. It may \nnot be perfect, but I think it reflects the best thoughts of those of \nus who have been involved in this effort for a long period of time, and \nI ask that our colleagues give it their favorable consideration.\n  Let me just preface what my amendment does by mentioning, just for a \nmoment, a little of the history of this effort to try to solve welfare \nin our country. It has always been a joint effort between the States \nand the Federal Government.\n  On average, the States generally contribute about 45 percent of the \ntotal welfare funds to welfare programs within their State borders and \nthe Federal Government contributes the other 55 percent, on the other \nhand, of the welfare dollars going into various States.\n  It has always been a joint venture, if you will, a partnership, if \nyou will, between the Federal Government and the States. For the first \ntime in the 60-year history of this bill, the other body--our \ncolleagues and friends in the House--has terminated that partnership. \nThey \n\n[[Page S 13318]]\nhave said that there is no longer any requirement that the States put \nup any money if they do not want to help solve this problem. They say \nthey are for block grants, and that in their minds means that the \nFederal Government sends them all of the money and they have no \nobligation to put up anything. They say that the Federal Government \nwill continue to give the same amount over the next 5 years even if \nsome of the programs that they have developed in their State reduces \nthe number of people on welfare.\n  That is right. Under the House proposal, the Federal Government would \ncontinue to send the States the same amount of money every year for \nwelfare even though there are fewer people each year in that State that \nare on welfare. What kind of a partnership is that? That is giving the \nFederal Government all of the responsibility of raising all of the \nmoney, and giving the States the same amount of money each year, no \nmatter what happens within those State borders.\n  I think the concept of block grants can be made to work sometimes, \nbut it has to be a partnership. We all know that when you are spending \nsomebody else's money, it is much easier to spend it in any way you \nwant to spend it. All of the legislative bodies, if they think the \nmoney is coming from Washington, are less responsible, in my opinion, \nwhen it comes to spending those funds than if they have to raise it \nthrough the tax programs in their respective States.\n  We have all heard stories about block grant programs that have not \nworked at this very point in the sense of having States misuse block \ngrants coming from the Federal Government. We heard the story about the \nLaw Enforcement Assistance Administration block grants. Someone in one \ncommunity was using the Federal money to buy a tank for the police \nchief. Why not? It is Federal money. They did not have to contribute to \nit. They thought it was a nice thing to do, and they did it. So the \npolice chief got a tank.\n  The Wall Street Journal just recently reported how State auditors in \none State discovered that the State squandered $8.3 million in Federal \nchild care grants on such things as personal furniture and designer \nsalt and pepper shakers. Robert Rector, of the Heritage Foundation, \ncertainly not a Democratic organization by any stretch of the \nimagination, recently commented on this phenomenon by saying:\n\n       If there's anything less frugal than a politician spending \n     other people's money, it's one set of politicians with no \n     accountability spending money raised by another set of \n     politicians.\n\n  That is the point, Mr. President. That is the reason the Finance \nCommittee considered this proposal, a proposal that said the Federal \nGovernment would continue to maintain our effort here in Washington in \nhelping to solve welfare problems, that the State had no obligation to \nspend any of their money whatsoever. Therefore, I offered an amendment \nin the Finance Committee which required the States to maintain the same \neffort the Federal Government was maintaining; that if the States \nreduced by $5 the amount of money needed for welfare because of fewer \nwelfare people, then the Federal Government would reduce our \ncontribution by the same amount. That is why the amendment that is now \nbefore the Senate has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office to \nsave $545 million over 7 years.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment that the Congressional Budget Office \nsays will save $545 billion over the next 7 years. That is why I think \nthat all of our colleagues who are interested in trying to save money \non welfare reform would look with favor and support my amendment.\n  I want to point out on this first chart how the current system works, \nand why I think it makes sense. When you have a real partnership, with \nFederal and State funds both being used and contributed, you see here \nin the chart that about 9 million children of America get help and \nassistance under this program. You see, according to the blocks here, \nthat we have five blocks with the representative Federal contribution \nand four blocks representing the State contribution to help 9 million \nkids. That is the current partnership. Without any State funds, under \nthe House bill, if you say all right, the State does not have to put up \nanything, obviously, you are going to lose the blue boxes which \nrepresent the State contribution and instead of helping 9 million \nchildren get aid and assistance, you are now only helping 5 million.\n  What we are saying essentially by this amendment is that we want to \nmaintain the partnership, we want to maintain the effort. We think what \nthe House has proposed is absolutely unacceptable because it says that \nStates should not have to contribute anything if they do not want to. \nThat is not what real reform is all about.\n  The second chart that we have would also show something that I think \nis important. It shows that if you have the States willing to put up \nnothing, how it would affect the number of jobs that have been created \nover the past years. Right now, there are 630,000 job slots. These \ninclude work programs, education, training, and child care that are \nprovided for through the Federal and State partnership.\n  If State spending were to be cut by 10 percent, which would be \nallowable under both the House and the Senate proposals, if they were \ncut by only 10 percent, you are talking about a cut down to 290,000 \njobs being available, a dramatic reduction. If the States were to cut \ntheir contribution by only 20 percent, you would not have any jobs \nfunded at all. We all know that without work, you are not going to have \nreal reform. Welfare reform is about creating jobs. If you allow the \nStates to do less than they have been doing, or nothing at all, you are \ngoing to obviously dramatically adversely affect the creation of jobs \nunder the welfare reform bill. Therefore, this amendment is absolutely \ncritical.\n  The third thing is that my amendment would enable both the Federal \nGovernment and the State governments to share the savings of welfare \nreform. One of the reasons we are trying to enact welfare is to save \nboth the Federal Government and the State governments money. My \namendment says that if the State government is going to reduce the \namount of money they spend on welfare, so should the Federal \nGovernment. The House bill, in comparison, says: Look, if the States \nare going to spend a lot less because fewer people are on welfare, the \nFederal Government is still going to continue to give the same amount \nof money to the States. What kind of nonsense is that? If the State is \ngetting $10 million from the Federal Government and reduces the number \nof people on welfare, under the House bill they still get the same \namount of money from the Federal Government. There is no reduction. \nThat does not make any sense whatsoever in times of tight budgetary \nrestriction. If the State government can save money because of fewer \npeople being on welfare, that is a good thing to happen. But the \nFederal Government should also say that we should also be able to \nreduce our contribution if the States have been able, through new \ninventive programs, to reduce the number of people on welfare.\n  Also, my amendment, which requires the States to continue to \ncontribute 90 percent of their funding, would discourage the \nsupplementing of existing State resources.\n  With the budget that we passed in the Congress, we made a clear \nstatement that, ``Federal funds should not supplant existing \nexpenditures by other sources, both public and private,'' and that the \n``Federal interest in the program should be protected with adequate \nsafeguards such as maintenance of effort provisions.'' My amendment \nwould ensure that Federal dollars are not used to replace State welfare \nspending, which could be diverted to other uses like roads and bridges.\n  Mr. President, simply put, under the House-passed amendment on \nwelfare reform, the States under this provision have no requirement to \nhave any maintenance of effort, no requirement to participate \nfinancially in solving the welfare problem. If a State wants to say, \n``Well, we used to spend X amount of dollars on welfare programs. We \nwant to take half of that, and we are going to use it for roads and \nbridges, or to buy furniture for State employees, or we are going to \nuse it to pay for State raises for all of the State employees,'' Mr. \nPresident, under this amendment, the Federal Government still continues \nto contribute the same \n\n[[Page S 13319]]\namount. The State is left off the hook for any real obligation to help \nsolve the problem.\n  We are not going to be able to solve the problem just here in \nWashington. States are going to have to be involved, and they are going \nto have to be involved financially in order to see that the programs \nare handled properly, that there is a real interest in the program, and \nthat adequate funding for the program is available. We all know that \nwhen you come to lobbying for scarce State funds that people on \nwelfare, and children in particular, who are innocent victims, do not \nhave a very strong lobby.\n People who build roads and bridges and highways do. So if a State all \nof a sudden sees the House-passed bill in front of them they are going \nto say, look at this pot of money. We are going to take all the money \nthat we used to use for welfare, and we are going to build roads and \nbridges and give State pay raises because that is what gets you \nreelected.\n\n  I think that is wrong. Another thing that they could say is by \nreducing the amount of money they contribute to welfare programs, by \nreducing the income of a person, they are entitled to more food stamps \nbecause this is 100 percent federally funded. This is another unique \nway that the Federal Government is going to get stuck with the tab \nunder the proposal in the House--let us just reduce the amount of money \nwe give on welfare, and we know by doing that welfare recipients are \ngoing to get more in food stamps and, by golly, food stamps are paid \nfor by the Federal Government 100 percent. Is this not a great way of \ngetting rid of an obligation.\n  What that is going to do is cost the Federal Government and the \ntaxpayers substantial amounts of money. That is one of the reasons CBO \nhas scored my amendment as saving $545 million over the next 7 years. \nThere is no other amendment pending that is going to produce those \ntypes of savings. It is very simple. As a State legislator, I know if I \nreduce my State's spending on a program for welfare recipients, they \nare just going to get more money in food stamps that are paid for by \nthe Federal Government 100 percent. Is that not a great way to get out \nof my obligation and stick it to the Federal Government and stick it to \nthe Federal taxpayers because they are going to have to pick up 100 \npercent of the tab for the cost of food stamps.\n  The only way we are going to solve this problem is with a real true \npartnership. My understanding of what the majority leader on the other \nside has offered is to say I think you have a point, Breaux, and this \nzero contribution by the States is really insufficient. They have \ndevised an amendment I think that says, well, we are going to require \nthe States to pay up to 75 percent of what they have been spending and \ncontribute 75 percent for the next 3 years. But then after that it \ndisappears. If a 75 percent contribution is good for the first 3 years, \nwhy is it not good for the life of the program or 5 years? What is \nmagical about having it for 36 months and then, poof, it disappears? If \nit is good for the first 3 years, it should be good for the years of \nthe program.\n  The real critical point is this. And I am really trying to speak in a \nbipartisan fashion. If my colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle really think 75 percent is a reasonable contribution by the \nStates--I think it is too low, but they think it is reasonable--does \nanyone who has been around here more than 6 weeks think if we go to the \nconference with the House with the requirement that the States put in \n75 percent of what they have been spending and the House has a \nprovision which requires zero, does anybody think we are going to come \nout with 75 percent? Of course not.\n  If you have been on a conference before, you know how these things \nare generally settled. You divide by 2. The difference between 0 and 75 \nis 37\\1/2\\ percent. And that is what likely is to come back from a \nconference when the House comes in with a zero requirement and the \nSenate comes in with a 75 percent requirement.\n  So I urge my colleagues who may think that my requirement requiring a \n90 percent contribution by the States of what they have been spending \nis too high to recognize that this bill has to go to conference. If we \nare going to come out with anything near 75 percent, I suggest it is \nabsolutely essential that we come in with a minimum of a 90 percent \nrequirement, knowing that in the conference it is going to be \nconferenced out and you generally split the difference when you go to \nconference.\n  I think we can pass all the laudatory measures and resolutions we \nwant saying that our conferees should stick with 75, and we know they \nare going to stick with 75, and they will argue for 75. That is good. \nThat is fine. I have been on conferences time and time again, and I \nhave been around here too long to know that is not what happens. The \nother body feels very strongly that there should be no contribution by \nthe States. I think almost everybody in this body thinks there should \nbe a contribution. If you think 75 percent is a fair amount, it is \nabsolutely essential that we go to conference with a higher amount.\n  Let me also say, Mr. President, that the amendment I have offered has \na great deal of support from people who believe in block grants in \nparticular. I know that Gov. Tommy Thompson from Wisconsin, who has \nbeen quoted so often on welfare, has said that ``welfare reform \nrequires a cash investment up front. That investment eventually turns \ninto savings.''\n  I agree with that, but I am concerned you are not going to be able to \nget money out of State legislative bodies for welfare reform without \nthis provision. If States are told they do not have to put up anything, \nmany States will put up nothing. That is simply a fact of life. \nTherefore, a requirement that they contribute in this maintenance of \neffort is absolutely essential.\n  We can argue all we want about what is proper, 75 or 90, but I remind \nmy colleagues when we go to conference we will be going to conference \nwith a group of House Members who will feel very strongly that zero is \nthe proper amount. If we are ever going to come out with something that \nmaintains effort on the States at an appropriate and proper amount, \nthen we absolutely are going to have to come in with an amount that is \nconsistent with what I have in my amendment, and that is a 90 percent \nrequirement. That allows the Federal Government to save substantial \namounts of money--$545 million over 7 years as scored by CBO. It \nrequires the States to participate in a partnership arrangement for the \nsolving of this particular problem.\n  Mr. President, with those comments, I reserve the remainder of my \ntime at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask, how much time does the Senator \ndesire?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will be happy to yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I rise in support of the amendment that has been offered \nby the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux], because I do think it is \nessential that we ensure a continued Federal-State partnership with \nrespect to welfare programs, and certainly regarding the welfare reform \nwe are attempting to make in the Congress today.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana underscores a \nvery essential point, and I think it gets to the heart of what welfare \nreform is all about--that it is in fact a mutual cooperative effort \nbetween the Federal Government and the States to get Americans off \nwelfare, so that they can pursue opportunities to self-sufficiency, \npersonal responsibility, and discipline.\n  Since 1935, when title IV of the Social Security Act was adopted, \nwelfare has always been a Federal-State partnership. And as we attempt \nto reengineer the welfare system in America today as we know it, I also \nthink we should renew our commitment to that partnership. The bottom \nline is the States have a tremendous stake in the success and outcome \nof welfare reform.\n  At the same time, I think it is also essential that they have a \nfinancial commitment and a financial stake in this reform. Many \nStates--and I think we all can understand this--will continue to extend \ntheir programs to the neediest, as they do today, but they are also \nfacing the same antitax, antigovernment, antiexcessive spending \nsentiment that we are in the Senate and in the entire Congress. \n\n[[Page S 13320]]\n\n  These States at the same time also have balanced budget requirements \nand commitments. In fact, most States do throughout the country. So \nthey will be facing competing demands and interests for money.\n  Under the legislation that is pending before the Senate with respect \nto welfare reform, there is no requirement that the States contribute \nwhat they have spent in the past with respect to welfare. That is a \nconcern which I have and one I share with the Senator from Louisiana.\n  In the last 20 years, cash assistance by the States toward welfare \nhas been reduced by 40 percent when you take into account inflation. \nThat is 40 percent. I do not think there is any question, as we pursue \nwelfare reform, that we are going to still make a commitment, probably \nas great as what we are making today, in order to ensure that those \nindividuals who are on welfare will move toward self-sufficiency in the \nfuture.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana mentioned, Governor Thompson, who has \nhad a very successful welfare reform program in the State of Wisconsin, \nhad to make a commitment of fivefold toward job training and child care \nin order to make it a success. For every dollar they invested, they got \n$2 in return from benefits.\n  Now, the Breaux amendment says that if the States do not wish to make \ntheir commitment of 90 percent of their spending at the 1994 level \ntoward welfare, they can reduce it, but at the same time the Federal \nshare will be reduced as well, dollar for dollar. I do not think that \nis unfair. I think the Federal Government should share in the benefits \nand the success of the program as well as the savings because this \nshould be a shared partnership. If we are able to save money, the \nFederal taxpayers should save it as well. We should stand to gain from \nthe successes as well as the savings. So we are asking the States to \nspend 90 percent of what they spent at the 1994 level over 5 years.\n  I think it is essential there is a 5-year commitment toward the \nmaintenance of effort. It is not that we are saying that we do not \nexpect States to make a commitment, but there have been some States who \nmade a greater commitment toward welfare in the past than others. It is \nnot saying we do not trust the States. I do not think it is a question \nof trust. It is a question of shared responsibility and the question of \nfairness.\n  Without the requirement for a fiscal commitment by the States to at \nleast spend 90 percent at the 1994 level toward welfare, some States \nmay not keep their end of the deal. Now, welfare reform was not \ndesigned to get the States off the hook. We are trusting them immensely \nthrough the enormous flexibility that is being granted to them through \nthe block grant program. They stand to gain enormously in terms of how \nthey implement a welfare reform program that is tailored to their \nparticular State and to their constituency.\n  And we think that they can do a better job than the Federal \nGovernment. But we also know that it is going to continue to require a \ncommitment on their part in terms of contributions. And that is, as we \nwere having this debate this week on the issue of child care, we know \nwe are going to need a tremendous commitment toward child care. And \nthat is why I was pleased that Senator Dole included language that I \nand others proposed with respect to child care so that those families \nwho have children of 5 years or under who demonstrated a need for child \ncare and were unable to obtain it because of distance or affordability \nwill not be sanctioned. And I think that is an important provision in \nthe legislation.\n  But I also think that we have to ensure that the States will continue \nto make their commitment toward child care or job training or health \ncare. And they will have the flexibility under this legislation to \ntransfer from one to the other. But the fact of the matter is, they \nshould make a maintenance of effort toward what they have contributed \nin the past, and we are asking them to provide 90 percent, which is \nless than what the Federal share would be, because the Federal \nGovernment would be required to pay 100 percent of their share of their \ncontributions to the States at the 1994 funding level.\n  I think this is a very important principle to adopt, Mr. President, \nbecause combined Federal and State spending approximates more than $30 \nbillion. The States contribute about 45 percent of the total amount of \nmoney spent in this country on welfare. That is 45 percent. So without \nthe Breaux amendment, we risk having nearly half of what is now spent \non welfare siphoned off to other programs. That may mean that we will \nnot have the kind of commitment toward child care or job training or \neducation programs that are absolutely essential and necessary if we \nare going to make welfare reform work.\n  We want the States to reduce the rolls, absolutely. But the question \nis how they reduce those rolls. We want to make sure they do it in a \nway that we reach the final goal of allowing welfare recipients to \nbecome independent and self-sufficient. That is the bottom line. \nBecause that is in the best interest of this country. So I think it is \nimportant to have a maintenance-of-effort requirement in this \nlegislation because we know that essentially the States cannot spend \nmuch less than what they are spending today on welfare and think that \nwe are going to have a successful welfare reform program. I do not \nbelieve it can happen, as you can see, in the State of Wisconsin, when \nGovernor Thompson made a fivefold commitment toward an increase in \ncommitment toward education, job training and child care.\n  So I think that this is a very important amendment. And as I said----\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. SNOWE. If States want to reduce their commitment, then the \nFederal share will be reduced as well. It is not preventing the States \nfrom reducing their share, but if they do, then we have a proportionate \nreduction of the Federal share as well.\n  I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I commend the Senator for her comments on this \nlegislation. And I prefer calling it the Breaux-Snowe amendment and \nthank her for her contribution in that regard.\n  I wanted to--the Senator served in the other body, as I have. And the \nstatement that some have said is that, ``Well, you know, we really \nthink that 75 percent is an appropriate amount. That is why we should \npass a maintenance-of-effort requirement, and the States will have 75 \npercent, and then when we go to conference we will come back with 45 \npercent, and that will become law.'' And my concern is--and I ask the \nSenator to comment--the other body has a zero requirement for the \nStates spending anything.\n  Does the Senator from Maine also have the same concern about what \nwould happen in the conference if we start out and figure it with a \nsubstantially lower amount than the body of this amendment?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes, I share the Senator's concern in that regard because \nthere is no maintenance of effort whatsoever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you.\n  I share that concern because the House does not include any \nmaintenance of effort, no percentage in that regard. So we go in, and \nwe know there is going to be much less than that because of the House's \nposition. So we are at 90 percent. We are going to come out with much \nless. And I think that is why this amendment is preferable in that \nregard. I think it is essential to have a 5-year commitment. If we go \nin with less than 5 years, we know we will probably, at best, probably \nget maybe 3 years. But I do think it is important that we have both the \n90 percent and the 5 years to go with a strong position into the \nconference.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I hear great consternation \n\n[[Page S 13321]]\n  of what is going to go on when this bill reaches conference. We have to \nvote for the Breaux amendment because of positioning, and we have to \nposition ourselves at 90 percent so we can get something, because the \nHouse is at zero and we are at 90 percent. The Senator from Louisiana \nsuggested we may get up to 45 percent. If we go in with 5 years, the \nHouse has nothing, we will get 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  I do not want to speak for the majority leader, but I think we would \nbe willing to say that we will go with 45 percent and 2\\1/2\\ years, and \nwe will stick to that in conference.\n  So if the Senator is concerned about what we are going to bargain, I \nthink we are willing to make that commitment right here on the floor of \nthe Senate. And I think the leader could come over and say that we will \nfight and stand firm on 45 percent and 2\\1/2\\ years. And if that is----\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We are willing to take that tough stand.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Now the Senator is arguing that 45 percent is the \nappropriate, proper amount?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No. I was responding to what the Senator anticipates \nhappening in conference. And I think we can save ourselves a lot of \nproblems. I think what this shows is that this is not really an area of \nprecision. I mean, we do not have a lot of precision here of what \nshould be the maintenance of effort, whether it is 90, 75, or 50 \npercent.\n  It is really a question of philosophy as to whether you want to give \nthe States the flexibility to be able to reap some rewards in managing \ntheir own program and whether you trust Governors and State \nlegislatures. I think there is and has traditionally been at the \nFederal level a mistrust. I think that is unfortunate.\n  I will have comments later. But I see the Senator from Missouri, who \nwas a Governor of the State of Missouri, and who was elected as \nGovernor and Senator. I would be interested to hear from the Senator \nfrom Missouri as to whether those constituencies that elected him to \nboth offices require him to do different things, whether he should feel \ndifferently as Governor and not care for the poor as Governor but care \nfor the poor more as a Senator. I would be interested in whether there \nis that transformation as held in the State office as opposed to \nholding the Federal office, whether you care more about poor people as \na Senator than you did as a Governor.\n  I would be happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to question the public \npolicy value of trying to lock States into spending 90 percent as much \nas the Federal Government has on a series of programs, many of which \nnot only have failed, but have locked people into dependency and have \nlocked people into poverty. I think there are very substantial and \nsignificant public policy reasons to say that we should allow the \nStates the flexibility to correct the errors of the Federal Government \nrather than to pass legislation which would require State and local \ngovernments to persist in the errors of the Federal Government.\n  The Breaux amendment would require that there be a 90-percent \nmaintenance of effort. And in my understanding of it, that means that \nwe would require that States spend 90 percent of any block grant just \nas the Federal Government did, in other words, lock in an amount of \nspending. This could be a serious problem for States because, in some \ninstances, it could actually require that States build the program to \nbe a much bigger program than it now is. It might require States to go \nout and get far more people into the program than they now have.\n  Let me just give you one example that flows out of my experience as \nGovernor, but really persists and has come as a part of the testimony \nthat has been in the debate about welfare from my successor and from \nthe people in his administration. As you know, I did not have the \nprivilege of being succeeded by a Republican. So a Democrat is now \nGovernor of our State. And so, I want you to know that these figures \nare not Republican figures or Democrat figures. They happen to be \nDemocrat figures, but they came from an administration that followed \nmine.\n  Take one of the biggest welfare Programs of all. The most costly \nwelfare program of all is the Medicaid Program. In the Medicaid program \nin my home State, the Medicaid director has said that if he could just \nhave the money and not have all the Federal red tape, instead of \nserving 600,000 people with the money, he would be able to serve \n900,000 people with that same amount of money, meaning that there are \ntremendous inefficiencies in the Federal program; that these \ninefficiencies, as a matter of fact, if they could be wiped out, would \nbe more than a 10-percent benefit to the program. They could provide \nfor a 50-percent increase in the population being served.\n  If we were to apply the Breaux amendment to that kind of a situation, \nwhat would happen? The Breaux amendment would require spending 90 \npercent of the money, which would mean that you would get 90 percent of \nthe increased number of people that could be served absent the Federal \nregulations. That would, in a program like the Medicaid program in \nMissouri, automatically boost the program from a 600,000 population \nprogram to an 810,000 population program, because we would mandate that \nthey spent 90 percent as much as they would now be spending, but do it \nin a context without the Federal regulations, which would allow for \ngreater efficiencies.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Does the Senator realize the Republican amendment locks \nin the Federal contribution at 100 percent for 5 years? Even if the \nState is successful in reducing the amount of people on welfare, your \namendment locks the Federal Government into spending 100 percent for 5 \nyears. If it is improper to lock the State into spending 90 percent, \nwhy is it proper to require the Federal Government spend 100 percent, \neven though you have fewer people on welfare?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. We would do so by ending the entitlement, and that \nprovides an incentive to the States to reduce welfare, as opposed to \nthe Breaux amendment which would provide a mandate, in many instances, \nto increase welfare.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield further on that point, just to \nclarify. It is an important point. Under the Republican amendment, the \nFederal Government is locked into spending 100 percent no matter what \nthe State does.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Federal Government is locked into spending 100 \npercent by an amount determined by its expenditures last year, and then \nany savings that come out of that should inure to the States. The \ndifference is under the block grant proposal. There would be a massive \nincentive for the States to save money and to reduce welfare rolls.\n  Under the Breaux amendment, which would require a 90-percent \nexpenditure, instead of saving the money and devoting it to things that \nmight be more needy, they would be required to spend it in the same way \nthey had previously, which could result in the anomaly of increasing \nwelfare substantially.\n  Let me just move away from the area of Medicaid, for instance. Food \nstamps are the second largest of all the welfare programs. The \ntestimony from the Office of Inspector General and from the Food and \nNutrition Service and the Department of Agriculture is there is about a \n12-percent administrative cost in food stamps. There is about a 12-\npercent slippage when you consider trafficking in food stamps and fraud \nand mistakes and those kinds of things, or about 24 percent of the \nprogram--24 percent of the program--does not really get to needy folks. \nIf you are to take that kind of a welfare program and send it back to \nthe States with a 90-percent requirement that they keep spending the \nmoney for the same program, it is another case where they might have to \nincrease the number of people on welfare.\n  Mr. President, I think what we have here is a classic situation: Are \nwe here to reform the welfare system? Are we here to reduce welfare or \nare we here to increase welfare? In my State, the people of Missouri \nspell ``reform'' r-e-d-u-c-e. They believe they sent us here in the \nyear 1994, last year, to do something about an epidemic of welfare \n\n[[Page S 13322]]\nwhich is pulling more and more people into the category of dependence \nand despair and fewer and fewer people into the category of \nindependence and industry.\n  I think we have to ask ourselves the question: What is our purpose in \nreform? I think our purpose in reform ought to be giving States the \nincentive to move people off welfare and, yes, if there are surplus \nfunds and they have been successful in doing that, let the States \ndevote those funds to the benefit of the entire population.\n  Let me just raise another issue. The other issue is this: If States \ndo get the number of people down on welfare--and, after all, we should \nbe trying to get fewer people on welfare, not more. The index of a \ncompassionate society, J.C. Watts said, and he is profoundly correct on \nthis, and the Chair, being from Oklahoma, knows Congressman Watts well, \nthe compassion of a society should not be how many people you can get \non welfare, but a really compassionate society should have few people \non welfare.\n  If you are required to keep spending lots and lots more money on \nwelfare per capita than you have, if you have any inefficiencies now \nthat are expressed in the program, if you have to spend more money per \ncase, what does that do? If you have the case level down to 75 and you \nstill have to spend at 90, you have to make that case much richer, you \nhave to provide more benefit.\n  As you increase the benefit, what do you do? You attract people back \ninto the system. The pernicious impact of the Breaux amendment would be \nto attract more people into welfare to the extent the States were able \nto reduce the welfare caseload and the administrative cost to a level \nbelow 90 percent.\n  We do not want to build a welfare system here; we want to make a \nwelfare system that helps people out of welfare into work. We do not \nwant to make the benefits richer so it makes it harder for people to \nmove from welfare to work; we want this system to be designed to meet \nthe needs of truly needy individuals but without a Federal mandate that \nmight require the State of Missouri, for instance, if it were to be \napplied to Medicaid, to move from 600,000 people on welfare to 810,000 \npeople on welfare, or, in the area of food stamps, if you could somehow \nget a good bit of that 24-percent slippage out of the system, that \nwould require an increase in the benefits so that more people would be \nenticed into the system rather than fewer.\n  This is a fundamental point that if you are going to reduce the \nnumber of people on welfare and you require the amount of money to be \nmaintained at a very high level, you have to make the benefit richer \nand richer and richer. And if you enrich the benefit while you are \ndecreasing the population, then all of a sudden people will start \nseeing the benefit being richer again, and you will attract more people \ninto the system.\n  We do not want to build into welfare reform. We do not want to sow \nthe seeds of its own destruction. We do not want to build a structure \nand mechanism which will result in welfare being increased and grown.\n  I said the people of Missouri spell ``welfare reform\" r-e-d-u-c-e, \nand they do not want to grow welfare, they want to slow welfare, not \nbecause it is so much a question of how much money we are spending, it \nis a question of how many lives we are losing. We are losing \ngenerations of children.\n  Another point: There seems to be some question--and I am glad the \nSenator from Pennsylvania raised this with me--as to whether people at \nState capitals can be sensitive to the needs of the needy. It is as if \nsomehow people can only be heard if they have needs in Washington, DC. \nI suppose it might be as a result of the history of this whole \nenterprise of welfare, if we could mislabel welfare as an enterprise. \nIt might be that if we were to discuss the history, we could see why \nthat question comes up, because there was a time in America's history \nwhen individuals who were needy were not well represented in politics.\n  Back in the fifties and sixties, there were laws that related to \naccess to voting which kept a lot of people from voting. The civil \nrights movement was a response to that. And then the Supreme Court of \nthe United States in the 1960's said, ``We can't have rural communities \nhave an improper impact on legislation because they do not have the \npopulation anymore.'' So there was a Supreme Court case called Baker \nversus Carr that provided for one man, one vote. And there is only one \nlegislative body in the United States of America that does not \nrepresent one man, one vote. It is the U.S. Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this is the only body in America that is \nnot equally represented by the people of this country. Every State \ncapital has a specific, both in their senate and house of \nrepresentatives, except for Nebraska, of course, which only has one \nhouse, every State capital has one man, one vote. People have access to \nthe ballot box like never before. As a matter of fact, the civil rights \nlaws of the third quarter of this century moved to guarantee access and \nmoved to remove legal barriers from voting and political participation.\n But just this decade, the Congress of the United States moved to \nremove virtually any kind of barrier. As a matter of fact, there is a \nspecial privilege for people on welfare. They are automatically asked \nto register when they go on welfare.\n\n  There can be no argument that people in need are people who are \ndisenfranchised in the United States. The idea that you have come to \nthe Federal Government to be heard or to have an impact as a citizen is \na bankrupt argument. It may have had currency at one time, but that \ncurrency has been substantially devalued by a change in the law, both \nthe judicial law and the legislative law.\n  The people of this country are represented and can be heard in their \nState capitals. I submit that they will be heard there better than in \nWashington, DC. As a former Governor, I witnessed far more people \nvisiting me in the State capital than visiting me here in Washington, \nbecause the only disenfranchisement that comes now is a \ndisenfranchisement of distance. Frankly, I cannot name a single State \nfor which Washington, DC, is a closer destination than their State \ncapital. It is simply not the case. If we give States discretion about \nhow to spend this money so we can have real reform, needy people can go \nto the State capital. Needy people know that if the State makes a \nmistake, it is easier to correct and more quickly corrected than it is \nif the country makes a mistake. Needy people know that if there is a \nmistake in 1 program out of 50, it is not nearly as bad as if it is a \nnational mistake. Needy people know that to get legislation changed in \nWashington, DC, you have to fight your way through special interests \nand all kinds of power groups, politically. They know that at the State \nlevel individual voices are heard, and the voices of neighborhoods and \ncommunities are heard.\n  So I rise to oppose this amendment because I think it will hurt the \npeople who are in need in this country. I rise to oppose this amendment \nbecause I think it is an amendment which is designed to \ninstitutionalize and guarantee the maintenance of the current system. \nIt is incomprehensible to me, after the people spoke in 1994 as loudly \nas people spoke to me just last month when I was home, just \nincomprehensible to me that we would not want to really reform this \nsystem, that we would want to guarantee that the system is 90 percent \nthe same as it is now. If a State can save enough money to go below \nthat 90 percent, or devote that resource to additional education or \nadditional ways of helping people pick themselves up and carry \nthemselves out of poverty, we say: No dice, no; you have to be at least \n90 percent as inefficient as the Federal Government, 90 percent as \npunitive as the Federal Government; you have to be at least 90 percent \nas unsuccessful as the Federal Government.\n  I think we need to turn these States loose. There is very little \ndoubt in my mind that there are just ways that people will solve these \nproblems. Ninety percent, I think, would lock in a spending level. \nNinety percent would likely lock in, in some cases, an increase in the \nnumber of people on welfare. I cannot think of anything more tragic \nthan the State to sweeten its system, to redesign its program, and as a \nresult of \n\n[[Page S 13323]]\nthe redesign of the program, end up sucking more people into a system \nwhich has already impoverished many and stolen the future of \ngenerations.\n  In some communities, like Detroit, 79 percent of all the children are \nborn without fathers. We have an epidemic that is aided and abetted by \nthis system, which is counterproductive. We should not institutionalize \nthe status quo, and we must reject the Breaux amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nhis insightful comments. I think he really speaks from the kind of \nexperience that we need here in this Chamber, as somebody who served as \na Governor and has managed a welfare program, who understands the \ndynamics in the State capitals and the likelihood of success of the \nDole substitute.\n  I think his words of support and encouragement for the bill, as it is \ntoday, and particularly the maintenance of effort provisions, are \nimportant, and I want to congratulate him for not only his statement \nhere, but the tremendous amount of work he has done on this \nlegislation, to bring consensus to the Republican side of the aisle and \nmove this matter forward. He has really been a standout on this issue. \nI thank him for his comments and for his work on this legislation.\n  The Senator from Vermont is here. I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds just to make the \ncomment that there clearly must be a grave amount of misunderstanding \nof what the Breaux amendment does.\n  The Breaux amendment allows the State to spend as much or as little \nas the State wants to spend. But it says that when a State spends 10 \npercent less than they are spending now, the Federal Government will \nalso reduce our contribution. We on our side, in a bipartisan spirit, \ndo not want to make the Federal Government spend 100 percent of what we \nare spending now for the next 5 years. If the State reduces their \namount, the Federal Government should have the right to do that, as \nwell. That is what the Breaux amendment is all about.\n  I yield at this time to the very distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nwho has a long history of outstanding work in welfare reform and \nlooking out for the needy. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Breaux \namendment. I listened to the very eloquent and excellent statement of \nthe former Governor of Missouri, and there is no question in my mind \nthat if all the Governors of this Nation were like the former Governor \nof Missouri, we might not need this amendment.\n  My memory goes back to the 1960's, when we started the welfare \nreform. It was because there were many areas of this Nation where the \nStates dropped the ball with their responsibility on welfare, and the \nFederal Government came in to try to get some uniformity of standards \nin the ability to take care of the people of this country who were \nunable to take care of themselves or needed help in getting into a \nposition where they could do so.\n  I point out that in the Breaux amendment here, we are dollar for \ndollar, not percentage. So you could eliminate all your State moneys \nand, in many cases, end up with plenty of Federal funds left, so you \nare only going down dollar for dollar. I think that is an important \nconcession to those of us who want to see this; that is, not to go over \nthe formula reduction, so if they go down 1 percent, we go down 1 \npercent. It is a modest proposal in that respect.\n  Second, the 90 percent is, I think, a reasonable figure to utilize. \nIt does allow some drop in State effort, without losing Federal funds.\n  I would like to also emphasize how critically important this \namendment is to some of us who want to reach a consensus on welfare \nreform. There are about three areas, to me, which make the difference \non whether I will support the bill or not. This is one of them. It is \ncritical in the length of time, as well as percentage. But we cannot \nreduce the participation of States as an important part of the welfare \nreform and make it important that they continue to participate in the \nfinancing of that.\n  Without a partnership provision like this, States could reduce their \nwelfare expenditures to zero and use only Federal dollars for the \nentire costs. But with this amendment, States will have a continuing \nincentive to use their own resources in conjunction with Federal funds. \nWithout, I foresee a major shift of the entire financial responsibility \nfor welfare onto our already overburdened Federal budget. I see us \nreturning to the problems we had before the advent of the Federal help.\n  Our efforts to reform the welfare system must not dismantle the \ncurrent partnership by allowing this cost shift. We simply cannot \nafford it. Right now, the Federal Government funds only 55 percent of \nthe total national welfare funding, while States contribute the \nremaining dollars, almost $14 billion in fiscal year 1994.\n  While the exact State-by-State ratio of State to Federal dollars \nspent on welfare varies by State, depending on available resources, \nboth overall and individually, States make a major contribution. This \nshould continue to be the case even after welfare reform. Welfare is a \njoint State/Federal responsibility that will not be there if there is \nnot a monetary commitment.\n  While it is true that the leadership has incorporated a partial \nprovision, an expectation of 75 percent effort from the States for the \nfirst 3 years of the bill, I believe that this provision for 90 percent \nfor the full 5-year term of the bill is essential and critical to this \nbill being passed.\n Either we believe States have a responsibility to contribute State \nfunds toward welfare or we do not. I do not think that responsibility \nsomehow evaporates after the first 3 years.\n\n  Some may argue States rights against this provision. That States must \nbe allowed to decide how much to spend and on whom to spend it. Some \nmay argue States must be able to innovate in their delivery of benefits \nto save money.\n  I agree. I agree that States should be able to set their own funding \nlevels, their own benefits, design their own programs, save money. As \nwe know, perhaps too acutely right now, the appropriations process is a \ndifficult one, requiring painstaking decisions. State budgets around \nthe country are also under stress, some States may well decide that \nwelfare is not a priority for them that it was in 1994, that they want \nto save money for welfare to use somewhere else in their budget.\n  I believe that when money is saved, and less is spent on welfare, \nboth the State and Federal taxpayers should share in the savings. If \nthe State share goes down, so should the Federal dollar, on a dollar \nfor dollar basis.\n  The welfare partnership amendment has been called a maintenance of \nefforts provision. It is, in that it would encourage States to continue \nto contribute State dollars toward welfare costs. But it is not the \nsame as many of the maintenance of effort provisions of the past that I \nthink my colleagues are most familiar with.\n  Under the partnership, we ask that the States maintain a spending \nlevel of only 90 percent, not 100 percent, only 90 percent of their \n1994 fiscal year expenditures on cash benefits, job education, and \ntraining and child care. Most maintenance of effort provisions require \n100 percent effort or penalize with a total withdrawal of all Federal \nfunds.\n  This partnership provision is much more reasonable. If a State \nchooses to go below the 90 percent of the fiscal year 1994 State \nfunding levels, it will experience a dollar for dollar reduction in the \nFederal grant. For every dollar the State chooses not to spend, they \nwill receive one less Federal dollar. Of course, the reduction does not \neven begin to occur until the State funding levels fall below 90 \npercent of the 1994 levels, and that is important to remember that \nbaseline is there. If you create savings, if you were able to reduce \nyour roles, then that baseline still is there.\n  In other words, assume that Vermont, through its innovative \ndemonstration program, becomes so adapt at moving people off welfare to \nwork that they save money. They do not need as much as they did in 1994 \nbecause the caseload is dramatically reduced.\n  So the State decides it can afford to spend less overall on welfare. \nUnder this proposal, the first 10 percent of savings goes to the State \nalone. They we can reduce State spending by 10 percent without \naffecting their Federal \n\n[[Page S 13324]]\ngrant. After that, as the savings grow, the Federal Government share \nwill go dollar for dollar in that spending reduction, once it goes \nbelow 90 percent of the 1994 level. If it does not go below the 1994 \nlevel they can make the savings without the provision.\n  Without this provision, we, the Federal Government, will continue to \nsend the same amount to States while they cut back their own \nexpenditures.\n  However, I think that Vermont, like all other States, should continue \nin partnership with us for welfare spending. The States will be able to \nset levels of spending based on need. There is no financial cliff in \nthis provision. No financial cliff as has been indicated by some. If \nyou go one dollar below the 1994 levels you lose all your Federal \nfunds. No, that is not the case. The reduction is gradual and \nproportionate to what the States set as need.\n  The States currently have some flexibility in setting their benefit \nlevels. Under this bill, the flexibility will be enhanced and expanded. \nI believe that many of these State flexibility changes are positive, \nthat State innovation should be encouraged and the Federal requirement \nshould not be overly prescriptive.\n  The bill will allow States to experiment with benefit levels, \nbenefits delivery and eligibility, and do all they want within the \nguidelines to be able to bring about savings.\n  Left to their own devices, States can probably show us here in \nWashington a thing or two about designing programs. I am sure they can. \nMy own State of Vermont has been involved in a very interesting and \nsuccessful demonstration project using a combination of sanctions and \nadditional support services with its welfare population.\n  I also believe that States may well be able to save money as they \ninnovate and become more efficient. As they save money and are able to \nreduce their State welfare spending by moving people off welfare into \nwork, this amendment would allow the Federal Government to share in \nthose State savings. This provision allows us to share in those \nprovisions. I want to emphasize that.\n  Without it, States would no longer need to spend their State funds on \nwelfare cash assistance, child care, education, and job training in \norder to receive Federal dollars. Regardless of State funding \ncommitment, the Federal Government's funding stream will remain \nconstant, frozen at the 1994 level.\n  Mr. President I want to remind my colleagues that it is those very \nnumbers, the 1994 Federal funding levels, that were set in proportion \nto the amount spent by the States in 1994. To continue at those same \nFederal levels without a requirement that States also spend seems very \ndangerous to me.\n  Realistically, the entire responsibility for the welfare system would \nbe shifted to the Federal Government. States would no longer have a \nfinancial incentive to use State dollars along with their Federal \nallocations. The incentives for making the system better would go away. \nIf they wanted they could choose to narrow their welfare eligibility \nand reduce benefits and pay for it all with Federal dollars.\n  I guess this amendment is about several things. It is about savings \nfor the Federal Government as well as the States after reform. It is \nabout fairness. And it is about continuing shared responsibility for \nwelfare. It is ironic that we talk of the devolution to the States, the \nimportance of governance at the local level, we simultaneously make \nwelfare a solely Federal responsibility.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting what I believe is one \nof the most critical amendments we will have here today. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to \nthe vote on the Breaux amendment scheduled for 2:15 that each side be \ngiven 2 minutes to explain their bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield briefly 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. The suggestion \nhas been made that somehow the incentives for savings persist in this \nbill. I think it is pretty clear that once you get below 90 percent for \nevery dollar you save, when you would otherwise have gotten $2 for \nhaving saved that dollar you only get $1 because the dollar you would \nsave in regard to the Federal Government then is shared back to the \nFederal Government.\n  The question is, how much incentive do we want to put in this bill to \nreform welfare? I believe we want to put a substantial incentive in \nthis bill to reform welfare. We want it reformed significantly.\n  I do not think the people want us tinkering around the edge with the \nprogram, but they want us to give States broad latitude and broad \nincentives.\n  My understanding of the Breaux amendment is it would reduce that \nincentive substantially. To the extent that the incentive for reform is \nreduced by having the States benefit less financially when there has \nbeen reform, I think we will get less reform.\n  I think the question is, do we want a lot of reform? Do we want major \nreform? Do we want sweeping reform? Or do we want reform that is \nincremental, and if there are incentives to additional reform they are \ndiminished substantially.\n  In my judgment, we want to provide the maximum level of incentives \nwhich is what I believe the Dole bill does, and is the appropriate way \nfor us to move in this manner.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nMissouri and add to that the Senator from Vermont said that there would \nbe a sharing of the savings on the Federal Government side with the 90 \npercent maintenance of effort, and I remind the Senator in the Dole \nmodified amendment that if you fall below 75 percent, every dollar you \nfall below is shared dollar for dollar from the Federal Government.\n  In other words, if the State drops below 75 percent, every dollar \nthey spend less, the Federal Government has to give $1 less. So there \nis the same identical provision already in the Dole modified bill as in \nthe Breaux amendment.\n  There are several points I could make on the Breaux amendment and \nthey go beyond the philosophy that we are discussing here as to whether \nwe should be requiring States to maintain effort.\n  I think one of the most important things is the drop in caseload that \nwe have experienced in the last year. If you look at the numbers from \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, what they show is that \nsince May 1994 we have seen a drop from 14 million recipients on AFDC, \nto May 1995 a little under 13.5 million--a drop of over 525,000 \nrecipients in the program.\n  The principal reason for the reduction is not based on the economy or \nanything; it is because we have seen States like Michigan and Wisconsin \nand others institute these work programs and change the welfare laws to \nreduce caseloads. Michigan has reduced their caseload by 30 percent in \nthe past couple of years. What we are seeing is States that are doing \nexactly what this bill will facilitate other States to do, are reducing \ntheir caseloads. By reducing their caseloads, they are obviously saving \nmoney and they are putting more people to work.\n  However, if we stick those States with a 90-percent maintenance of \neffort, what you say to Michigan is, ``OK, Michigan,'' or someone like \nMichigan, who after this bill passes enacts a program similar to \nMichigan's, ``You can reduce your caseload by 30 percent but you cannot \nreduce your welfare expenditures by 30 percent; you still have to spend \n90 percent of what you were spending now, based on 1994, not 1995,'' \nwhere, as I said, we have already seen a reduction. So you are basing \nit on last year's figure, which was a historically high figure, saying \nyou have to maintain 90 percent of that even though you may drop your \ncaseload under programs that are, today, as much as 30 or more percent \nreduced. So you are holding States, as the Senator from Missouri said, \nto spend money on people on welfare even though there may not be those \npeople to spend it on. I think that is unwise.\n  As the Senator from Missouri said, it is an incentive not to reform. \nIt is an incentive not to reform if you cannot save any money by \nreforming. One of the reasons you see welfare reform is, obviously, you \nwant to get people to work and off welfare. But also you want to save \ntaxpayers' dollars in the process. So this is a real disincentive. \n\n[[Page S 13325]]\n\n  If we were going to have a figure, 90 is much too high. It does not \nallow for innovation. It does not take into account innovations that we \nhave seen in States today and the dramatic reductions in caseloads that \nwe have seen in programs that I think are going to be more common after \nthis legislation is passed. I think it is a step very damaging to \nreform. This is a back-door way of trying to keep the status quo in \nplace, and I think it is a very dangerous addition to this bill.\n  I also would say, you have an interesting question about what is \nfair. You say maintain effort at 90 percent. That sounds fair to all \nStates. Every State has to maintain their effort at 90 percent. That \nwould be fair if every State had the same effort in the first place. \nBut they do not. In fact, there are wide disparities as to what States' \nefforts are today.\n  For example, I pulled this out of the Wall Street Journal of August \n21. It is from the House Ways and Means Committee. It says that if you \nhave a State like Mississippi, that their average monthly AFDC payment \nper family is $120 per family. A State like Alaska's is $762 per \nfamily.\n  What we are saying in the Breaux amendment is, ``Mississippi, you \nhave to maintain 90 percent of $120; Alaska, you have to maintain 90 \npercent of $762.'' Is that fair? Is that fair to States like Alaska, \nwhich are now being given a block grant and, under the Dole formula, \nare not going to be growing as much? Why? Because the Hutchison growth \nformula targets low-benefit States. They will grow. Their maintenance \nof effort is 90 percent of the low number, but they will grow. States \nlike California, which has a $568 per family contribution and Hawaii \nwhich has $653, Vermont, $548, those States with high-dollar \ncontributions now will not participate in the growth fund. So you are \nlocking them in at a high-participation rate and not giving them any \nmore money.\n  I do not think that is a fair way to do it, and, in fact, it could \neven get worse because there are many people who are going to vote for \nthe Breaux amendment who are also going to vote for the Graham \namendment, the amendment of Senator Graham from Florida, who will be \noffering his fair share amendment. That will completely eliminate all \npast relationship of how AFDC was distributed and make it purely on a \nper-person-in-poverty allocation. So the State match will be irrelevant \nunder the Graham amendment.\n  So, what would happen, in fact, will happen if we adopt the Breaux \namendment, and then, as again many who will vote for the Breaux \namendment will vote for the Graham amendment, what will happen is there \nwill be States like New York and Alaska and Hawaii and California that \nwill be required to spend more money than the Federal Government will \ngive them under the new formula. So their maintenance of effort will \nactually be higher than what they get on the Federal level. How is that \nfair?\n  We are saying you have to keep your contribution high and, oh, by the \nway, we are going to take ours and cut yours substantially from your \ncurrent level. Those are kinds of games that you get into when you have \na block grant and try to keep a maintenance-of-effort provision in a \nblock grant proposal. It does not work.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Sure, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Back to the basic point I think the Senator is making, it \nis that somehow if the Breaux amendment passes States will not be able \nto reduce the amount of money they spend on welfare. That is absolutely \nand clearly incorrect. States are encouraged to spend less through \nreforms. We just say if they are spending less than 90 percent of what \nthey spent the year before, the Federal Government will also reduce our \ncontribution.\n  Does the Senator disagree that under the Republican proposal, you \nlock in the Federal contribution for 5 years? Even if the State has \nless people on welfare, saves money, the Federal Government is still \nrequired to spend 100 percent of what they spent in 1994?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes. And the reason we lock in--reclaiming my time--the \nreason we lock in the number is because, as the Senator from Louisiana \nknows, if we did not block grant this program and did not reform this \nsystem and allowed what happened, for example, under the Daschle \namendment, to occur, AFDC would continue to grow. In fact, the Federal \ncommitment would be even greater in 5 to 7 years.\n  So the fact we lock it in now, many would say, because of inflation, \nis ``a cut.'' We are in fact locking in. In fact, I think one of the \nbiggest criticisms I have heard from the other side of the aisle is \nthat what we are in fact locking in, that is not generous enough. We \nneed to give more. In fact, we had an amendment there today to put in \n$7 billion more. We had an amendment from the Senator from Connecticut \nto put in $6 billion more for children. There is a barrage, and I \nassume it will continue, of amendments from your side of the aisle to \nsay we should be spending more.\n  We are going to try to strike a balance. We do not want this program \nto continue to increase. We do not want to cut back the Federal share \nbecause we, too, believe in a partnership. But we will say, we will \ntell you, States, we will commit you to flat funding over the next 5 \nyears. And what we want you to do is to be innovative. We will keep the \ndollars there to allow you to innovate and allow you to move forward. \nAnd the incentive, then, is for you to get more people off the program, \nto get more people into work, and, yes, save some State dollars.\n  We think those are powerful incentives, if we keep there the steady \nhand from the Federal level. So I think it is a fair compromise, in a \nsense, not to increase funding but to hold the level funding.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I think it is well known that States are \npaying disproportionate shares of the welfare benefits in their States. \nSome States pay 25 percent or 28 percent of the welfare benefit. Some \nStates pay as much as 60 percent of the welfare benefit.\n  In the event that some States are paying 60 percent, if they save----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from New York----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Fifty.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, 50 percent, pardon me. I stand corrected \nand thank the Senator from New York. Fifty.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. New York is 50.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. New York is 50.\n  A State that pays 25 percent of its benefit is able, by paying that \nbenefit, to attract 3 Federal dollars to the State. And, so, if they \nwere to effect a savings and they only got to save the State's part and \nthey had to give the Federal part back, by saving 25 cents for the \nState they could curtail the flow of $1 for the State; they would \ncurtail the flow of 3 additional dollars to the State.\n  What I am trying to say is that a program which provides reductions, \nof course, savings--if it is just one for one--is a program which does \nnot provide the same amount of incentives as if you get to keep the \namount that is left in the block grant.\n  If it is a one-for-one savings, it is the same for all States. But we \nwant to have States with an incentive to reform the program, and the \nlarger the reward for reforming the program and reducing the roll, the \nlarger the incentive. And it seems to me the incentive is larger under \nthe Dole bill, which provides that you not only get to keep the State's \nshare which you save, but you get to keep a dollar that reflects the \nState's share for every dollar you save in the Federal Government.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Missouri is \nright, that the Dole formula is fair. And it is also, I think, \nstructured to create the incentive for States to reform their welfare \nsystem. Remember, if we are going to pass the Dole amendment, the \nStates will then have the opportunity--I am confident that every State \nwill take this opportunity because under this bill we block grant money \nto the States--they will have to at some point convene their \nlegislature and with the Governor will have to develop their own \nwelfare plan. I think it would be incumbent upon them, almost a \nrequirement, that they do so because they would have block grant funds \nand would have to take some action to spend the dollars. So we would be \nforcing every legislature in the country to go forward and redesign \ntheir program. \n\n[[Page S 13326]]\n\n  What the Dole amendment does is say for the first 3 years you have to \nmaintain 75 percent of effort. There is a lot of argument here about \nStates racing to the bottom. You cannot race to the bottom, \nparticularly if you are a high-dollar State, if you have to maintain 75 \npercent of your revenue. If we are going to make the State legislatures \nreform welfare, they are going to do it relatively quickly within the \nfirst year or two. So we will have the results.\n  To suggest that we need to stretch this to 5 years suggests that \nState legislatures are going to continually every year be reforming and \ncutting their welfare rolls. As we know, we do not do that. We do not \ndo that here. The State legislatures do not reform welfare every year. \nThey pass a welfare package, and, like this body, see how it works. It \ntakes some time.\n  So I think a lot of this, whether we have 3 or 5 years, is really \njust a matter of making yourself feel comfortable in Washington. The \nreal changes in welfare will occur in the first 1 or 2 years. I think \nthat is the important thing to look at.\n  I want to talk a little bit more following up on the disparity among \nStates. I think this is really an important and significant problem \nwith this 90 percent basis of effort. One of the things that I had \nsuggested--and we are not able to come to closure on this--is that it \nis not fair for New York and Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania spends per \nchild, based on the State cash aid relating to this block grant, about \n$1,092 per child. That is ranked 17. Alaska is No. 1 with $3,182, and \nlast is Mississippi with $107. So the disparity is just tremendous. To \nsuggest that we are being fair hereby saying Mississippi has to \nmaintain 90 percent of $107, and Alaska has to maintain 90 percent of \n$3,182, again does not reflect the reality of a block grant.\n  Eventually over time what this block grant is hoping to do, as the \nSenator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, suggested with her growth \nformula is to equalize the Federal contribution per child across this \ncountry. So a child in Alaska should not be paid more out of the \nFederal coffers than a child in Mississippi. I think that is sort of a \nnonsense thing. I think most of us, if we are going to go to this block \ngrant, would like to see us achieve a program where the Federal \npayments per child would be the same. I do not see how we get there, in \nfact, I do not think we can get there, if we require States to maintain \nthis high share of effort.\n  I am hopeful that we agree to this compromise that was in the Dole \nmodified bill at 75 percent. It is a reasonable compromise. It puts the \ncompromise in place for 3 years, which I think is the most crucial time \nwhen these State legislatures are enacting their programs, and it does \nnot penalize a high-dollar State.\n  The compromise that I had even offered was to suggest that States \nlike New York and Pennsylvania would not have to maintain 75 percent of \ntheir effort but they would only have to maintain 75 percent of what \nthe average effort is among States. So, if you took all the States' \ncontributions already and set an average, I think according to the gain \nper child average of State cash aid here, I would guess would be \naround--just looking at the numbers, the 25th State is Wyoming at $758. \nThat is the median. I assume the average is somewhere close to that; to \nsuggest that Alaska would have to maintain 75 percent of $758 instead \nof $3,182 and any State above the average would only have to maintain \n75 percent of the average, I think is a fair burden to put on States \ngiven the fact that a lot of these States are going to be growing, or \nare big States and are not going to get any more money.\n  Any State below the national average, Maine being one, which is 26th, \nand Louisiana, which is 50th out of the 51 jurisdictions, Louisiana is \nat $155. I mean, I can understand why the Senator from Louisiana wants \na 90 percent maintenance of effort for Louisiana. It is $155 per child \nin 1994. But I am in Pennsylvania. I have $1,092. You are saying that \nthe State government of Pennsylvania has to maintain $900-plus in \nPennsylvania but $130 in Louisiana. How is that fair when we are block \ngranting the funds? We are not over the next 5 years giving \nPennsylvania one additional dollar, and I might add Louisiana gets a \nbig chunk of the growth fund because they are a low-dollar State. This \nis having your cake and eating it, too.\n  I think that is just too penalizing of larger States that have made \nsubstantial contributions to welfare. You are going to stick them with \na program that maybe passes the administration. We have a new Governor \nin Pennsylvania, and the Governor, I know, is very aggressively \npursuing a reform of the welfare system. And what we are going to do \nwith Pennsylvania is lock them into high contributions of 1994 forever, \nthat they have to continue if they want to continue to receive their \nFederal dollars. Remember, you say, ``Well, if you reduce the amount of \npeople on welfare, you lose dollar per dollar.'' Pennsylvania is not \ngoing to have any increase in Federal dollars. If Louisiana goes below \n75 percent, they are still going to get an increase in Federal dollars \nbecause of the growth formula.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think it creates a lot of inequity in the system.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The decision of what the States do is their decision \ntaking into account the cost of living in the respective States. The \ncost of living in Louisiana is substantially less than in your State or \nNew York. That is a State decision. But with the Senator's own \namendment--the alternative does not in fact lock in the Federal \nGovernment at 100 percent. If it is inappropriate to lock in the \nStates, why is it appropriate to lock in the Federal Government at 100 \npercent no matter how much the State reduces their caseload? Under your \napproach, the Federal Government continues to have to give 100 percent \nof what they are giving in 1994. If we are going to have savings, why \nshould not the Federal Government share in the savings, which, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, saves the Federal \nGovernment $545 billion?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Because we would like to see some innovation occur at \nthe State level. We believe if you lock in the Federal contribution and \ngive the States the opportunity to actually save dollars, that is the \nkey. When you say, ``Well, the States can go ahead and reduce their \ndollars,'' but when they reduce their dollars, they lose Federal \ndollars. So in a sense they are a wash because, sure, they have spent \n$1 less of their money but they get $1 less. So they are pretty much \nheld harmless.\n  I think that is not a great incentive to save money if in fact for \nevery dollar you save you lose a dollar.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Why is it inappropriate? If the States can save a dollar, \nwhy should not the Federal Government save a dollar?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The point that I am trying to make is that, in effect, \nwhen you consider the net amount of money spent by the State, it is not \nreally saving any money because what they are doing is, when they \nreduce their dollar, they lose a Federal dollar. So they are at zero. \nSo there is no incentive financially for them to go below the 90 \npercent.\n  That is why I am saying this is sort of a bad way of supporting high \nexpenditures of welfare dollars. What we are trying to do is say, if \nyou want to innovate, we want you to innovate. We are willing to put up \nmoney so we will encourage you to innovate. We will encourage you to do \nwhat Michigan has done--as the Senator from New York is fond of \nsaying--under the current law, under the 1988 Family Support Act, to \nreduce your caseload, get people to work. And by coming up with these \ninnovative solutions and getting people back into the work force, you \nwill in fact benefit financially. Under the Breaux amendment, they will \nnot benefit financially because for every dollar where they go below 90 \npercent, they will lose a Federal dollar. So they are at a zero \nposition as far as benefits. I think that is a real impediment to the \nkind of innovation that we want to see on the State level.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana.\n  This amendment is straight forward. It says to States, all States, if \nthe Federal Government turns over a block of money to do as you please \nin welfare reform, we ask that you commit your own resources as well. \nThat is a fair deal. \n\n[[Page S 13327]]\n\n  Welfare reform is a partnership. It isn't just a State problem and it \nisn't just a national problem. It's everybody's problem. Unfortunately \nnot every State has viewed it that way over these past decades. Some \nStates simply don't want to make a commitment. If this legislation \npasses without a requirement that the States maintain their commitment, \nI have no doubt some Governors and State governments will quickly cut \ntheir funding to real welfare reform at the very same time they are \naccepting Federal dollars.\n  Mr. President, what of those States that are sincere about welfare \nreform? What happens when the next recession hits? Will political \npressures force them to fund other programs from current State welfare \nfunding? There will be more people who will need assistance but at the \nsame time many school budgets will be squeezed by that recession and \nthey will be asking for some of these welfare dollars. In the next \nrecession what if the crime rates increase? If the prison system needs \nmore dollars where will these Governors get the money? And what about a \nrace to the bottom? If one State cuts its spending on welfare will the \nneighboring State be forced to do the same? One State may decide it can \nattract new jobs and companies from another State by offering a \nbusiness tax cut funded from State welfare dollars.\n  In my state of Maryland we have not received an overly generous \nFederal match when it comes to welfare funding. We are willing to do \nour part. What we do not want is to be forced into a race with another \nState that is more concerned about cutting benefits as a substitute for \nreal welfare reform.\n  If we are serious about welfare reform then it is time we demand that \nthe State governments as well as the Federal Government make a \ncommitment. That commitment demands more than just different ideas, it \ndemands both Federal and State resources and dollars.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished ranking \nmember of our Finance Committee, the Senator from New York, 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania \nfor his very open and candid remarks.\n  I would like to approach this subject from a slightly different \nangle, which is to make the case that Federal initiatives have begun to \nshow real results in moving persons from welfare to work. It took a \nlittle while for the 1988 legislation to take hold, but it did. What we \nput at risk at this point is giving up all that social learning, about \n20 years really, that built up to the 1988 legislation and has followed \non since.\n  The Senator from Louisiana mentioned it when in the Chamber he gave a \nclip from a Louisiana paper, in Baton Rouge, ``Project Independence \nTrims Welfare Rolls Across State.''\n  Just a few days ago, last week, we heard Senator Harkin of Iowa \ndescribe the legislation that had been adopted for new pilot projects \non welfare around Iowa, passed by Governor Branstad, now having 2 years \nof experience. ``The number of people who work doubled, went up by \nalmost 100 percent and the expenditures per case are also down by about \n10 percent.'' And I point out once again that is the Family Support \nAct.\n  Now, in this morning's Washington Post, we have a very able essay by \nJudith Gueron, who is the head of the Manpower Development Research \nCorp., ``A Way Out of the Welfare Bind.'' As I have said several times, \nresearch at MDRC was the basis of our 1988 legislation. Data we had. \nShe makes a simple point that ``Public opinion polls have identified \nthree clear objectives for welfare reform: Putting recipients to work, \nprotecting children from severe poverty, and controlling costs.'' And \nshe makes the point that this triad involves conflicting goals at first \nglance. She then goes on to say that we seem to be learning how to \nresolve those conflicts.\n  I will read one statement, if I may.\n\n       A recent study looked at three such programs in Atlanta, \n     Grand Rapids, Mich., and Riverside, Calif. It found that the \n     programs reduced the number of people on welfare by 16 \n     percent, decreased welfare spending by 22 percent, and \n     increased participants' earnings by 26 percent. Other data on \n     the Riverside program showed that, over time, it saved almost \n     $3 for every $1 it cost to run the program. This means that \n     ultimately it would have cost the Government more--far more--\n     had it not run the program.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, it is not at this point any longer politically \ncorrect to say that those programs began under the Family Support Act. \nThey are programs under the job opportunities, basic services. I regret \nthat you cannot say this. The Department of Health and Human Services \nwould deny it. Silence is the response to the first success we have \never had with this incredibly defying, mystifying, sudden social \nproblem. If we give up the maintenance of effort, we will give up the \nresources that made these programs possible.\n  Senator Grassley has been talking about the wonders in Iowa, Senator \nHarkin about the wonders in Iowa, Senator Breaux about fine programs \nsuch as Project Independence in Louisiana. Atlanta, Grand Rapids, \nRiverside--real results. They are results from a secret program called \nthe Family Support Act, the job opportunities, basic services.\n  I hope we do not do it, Mr. President. I hope we support the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. This is not a moment of which anybody can be \nparticularly proud.\n  Let me be clear. If we put through time limits, we strip the Federal \nGovernment of responsibility, you will cut caseloads 10, 15 percent. \nThere is always on the margin people who really do not--if the \nalternative was sufficiently unpleasant, they would leave. But you will \nnot change the basic phenomenon of nonmarital births, out-of-wedlock \nbirths such that in the city of New Orleans, 47 percent of the children \nare on welfare at one point or another in the year. That is small \ncompared to the city of Washington, but it is not small compared to the \nconcern of the Senator from Louisiana. He cares about those children. \nThey are his children. They are our children, too. And if we abandon \nthe Federal maintenance, the Federal level of effort, we abandon those \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article in the \nWashington Post about the secret Government program that has done such \nwonders in Riverside and Grand Rapids and Atlanta be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 12, 1995]\n\n                     A Way Out of the Welfare Bind\n\n                         (By Judith M. Gueron)\n\n       Much of this year's debate over welfare reform in \n     Washington has focused on two broad issues: which level of \n     government--state or federal--should be responsible for \n     designing welfare programs, and how much money the federal \n     government should be spending.\n       The debate has strayed from the more critical issue of how \n     to create a welfare system that does what the public wants it \n     to do. Numerous public opinion polls have identified three \n     clear objectives for welfare reform: putting recipients to \n     work, protecting their children from severe poverty and \n     controlling costs.\n       Unfortunately, these goals are often in conflict--progress \n     toward one or two often pulls us further from the others. And \n     when the dust settles in Washington, real-life welfare \n     administrators and staff in states, counties and cities will \n     still face the fundamental question of how to balance this \n     triad of conflicting public expectations.\n       Because welfare is such an emotional issue, it is a magnet \n     for easy answers and inflated promises. But the reality is \n     not so simple. Some say we should end welfare. That might \n     indeed force many recipients to find jobs, but it could also \n     cause increased suffering for children, who account for two-\n     thirds of welfare recipients. Some parents on welfare face \n     real obstacles to employment or can find only unstable or \n     part-time jobs.\n       Others say we should put welfare recipients to work in \n     community service jobs--workfare. This is a popular approach \n     that seems to offer a way to reduce dependency and protect \n     children. But, when done on a large scale, especially with \n     single parents, this would likely cost substantially more \n     than sending out welfare checks every month. To date, we \n     haven't been willing to make the investment.\n       During the past two decades, reform efforts, shaped by the \n     triad of public goals, have gradually defined a bargain \n     between government and welfare recipients: The government \n     provides income support and a range of services to help \n     recipients prepare for and find jobs. Recipients must \n     participate in these activities or have their checks reduced.\n       We now know conclusively that, when it is done right, the \n     welfare-to-work\n      approach offers a way out of the bind. Careful evaluations \n     have shown that tough, adequately \n\n[[Page S 13328]]\n     funded welfare-to-work programs can be four-fold winners: They can get \n     parents off welfare and into jobs, support children (and, \n     in some cases, make them better off), save money for \n     taxpayers and make welfare more consistent with public \n     values.\n       A recent study looked at three such programs, in Atlanta, \n     Grand Rapids, Mich., and Riverside, Calif. It found that the \n     programs reduced the number of people on welfare by 16 \n     percent, decreased welfare spending by 22 percent and \n     increased participants' earnings by 26 percent. Other data on \n     the Riverside program showed that, over time, it saved almost \n     $3 for every $1 it cost to run the program. This means that \n     ultimately it would have cost the government more--far more--\n     had it not run the program.\n       In order to achieve results of this magnitude, it is \n     necessary to dramatically change the tone and message of \n     welfare. When you walk in the door of a high-performance, \n     employment-focused program, it is clear that you are there \n     for one purpose--to get a job. Staff continually announce job \n     openings and convey an upbeat message about the value of work \n     and people's potential to succeed. You--and everyone else \n     subject to the mandate--are required to search for a job, and \n     if you don't find one, to participate in short-term \n     education, training or community work experience.\n       You cannot just mark time; if you do not make progress in \n     the education program, for example, the staff will insist \n     that you look for a job. Attendance is tightly monitored, and \n     recipients who miss activities without a good reason face \n     swift penalties.\n       If welfare looked like this everywhere, we probably \n     wouldn't be debating this issue again today.\n       Are these programs a panacea? No. We could do better. \n     Although the Atlanta, Grand Rapids, and Riverside programs \n     are not the only strong ones, most welfare offices around the \n     country do not look like the one I just described.\n       In the past, the ``bargain''--the mutual obligation of \n     welfare recipients and government--has received broad \n     support, but reformers have succumbed to the temptation to \n     promise more than they have been willing to pay for. Broader \n     change will require a substantial up-front investment of \n     funds and serious, sustained efforts to change local welfare \n     offices. This may seem mundane, but changing a law is only \n     the first step toward changing reality.\n       It's possible that more radical approaches--such as time \n     limits--will do an even better job. They should be tested. \n     But given the public expectations, we cannot afford to base \n     national policies on hope rather than knowledge. The risk of \n     unintended consequences is too great.\n       States, in any case, are concluding that time limits do not \n     alleviate the need for effective welfare-to-work programs. In \n     a current study of states that are testing time-limit \n     programs, we have found that state and local administrators \n     are seeking to expand and strengthen activities meant to help \n     recipients prepare for and find jobs before reaching the time \n     limit. Otherwise, too many will ``hit the cliff'' and either \n     require public jobs, which will cost more than welfare, or \n     face a dramatic loss of income with unknown effects on \n     families and children and, ultimately, public budgets.\n       Welfare-to-work programs are uniquely suited to meeting the \n     public's demand for policies that promote work, protect \n     children and control costs. But despite the demonstrated \n     effectiveness of this approach, the proposals currently under \n     debate in Washington may make it more difficult for states to \n     build an employment-focused welfare system. Everyone claims \n     to favor ``work,'' but this is only talk unless there's an \n     adequate initial investment and clear incentives for states \n     to transform welfare while continuing to support children.\n       Many of the current proposals promise easy answers where \n     none exist. In the past, welfare reform has generated much \n     heat but little light. We are now starting to see some light. \n     We should move toward it.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Thanking the Chair and thanking my friend from \nLouisiana, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 10 seconds--\n--\n  Mr. BREAUX. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. While I put on a button from Riverside, CA. It says, \n``Life Works If You Work.'' That is the spirit of these programs, and \nthey are working. But we cannot talk about them, evidently.\n  I thank the Senator. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  I wish we could solve all of our problems with a button; it would \nmake it a lot better.\n  What interests me about this amendment, Mr. President, in a sense, it \nmay be the most important amendment we are making to this bill and yet \nit has such an awkward title, maintenance of effort, that vast numbers \nof folks who might be listening or watching do not know what we are \ntalking about.\n  The Breaux amendment has to pass if welfare reform is going to work. \nIt absolutely has to pass. A welfare reform bill with this name should \nfree up States to do all kinds of things with new flexibility, without \nmicromanagement from the Government. But welfare reform should not \nencourage States, or in fact even egg them on, to back out of their \ncommitment to poor children. If you look around now at State \nlegislatures, what is it they are discussing? Their woes with Medicaid \nand the temptation--believe me, if they are not required to participate \nin welfare reform, a number of them will not. They simply will not.\n  To me, the Breaux amendment is the answer. It very clearly says to \nthe States, you keep your end of the bargain, and we at the Federal \nlevel are going to keep our end of the bargain, just as we have always \ndone on both sides.\n  Again, speaking as a former Governor, I sincerely doubt that \nGovernors who like the welfare reform bill before us just exactly the \nway it is without the Breaux amendment, for example, would ever propose \nthat kind of a relationship in some of their dealings with local \ncommunities or counties in terms of matching grants.\n  In fact, that is part of what money is for, is to leverage more out \nof other people. You say, ``Here is a certain amount. You put up some \nmore, and together we can do this. But if you do not participate, we \ncannot.'' And it is human nature in State and local government, just as \nit is at any level.\n  The majority leader made some modifications to the Republican welfare \npackage just before the recess. And one of them involves the claim that \nhe added a maintenance-of-effort provision. It is not, in fact, that. \nIt is very weak. And we can and must pass the Breaux amendment, in this \nSenator's judgment, and not accept the majority leader's modification.\n  In the first place, the majority leader's modification only lasts for \n3 years. We are talking about a lot longer period than that before we \ncome back to this subject in a major way. And it asks States to put 75 \npercent of a portion of their AFDC spending back in 1994 back into \ntheir future welfare reform system.\n  In fact, the Dole provision adds up to only asking all States to \ninvest a grand total of $10 billion a year just for the first 3 years, \nwith no basic matching requirement whatsoever for the last 2 years on \nthis bill. So it is a fraud.\n  This leaves a gaping hole in the State's share, if compared to the \ncurrent arrangement across the country. So $30 billion could and \npossibly will disappear from this country's safety net for families and \nchildren.\n  What is worse to me, almost more cynical, is the clever attempt in \nhow a State's share is calculated under the Dole modification. The Dole \nbill would allow States to count, so to speak, State spending on a \nwhole variety of programs simply mentioned in this bill but not \npertinent.\n  For example, States would be able to get credit, essentially, for \ntheir spending on food stamps, SSI, other programs that help low-income \npeople towards meeting their requirement. That means that money for \nprograms not specifically directed to financing basic welfare for \nchildren could easily count towards the so-called maintenance of \neffort. Again, this is a flatout invitation for States to back out of \nkeeping their basic historical responsibility to children.\n  And remember, two out of every three people that we are talking about \nin this country on welfare are children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I hope urgently that colleagues on this side of the \naisle, and as many colleagues as possible on the other side of the \naisle, will support the very important Breaux amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Iowa?\n  \n[[Page S 13329]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, because I do not want to speak on the \namendment, I ask unanimous consent to use my 5 minutes to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had an opportunity to read in the New \nYork Times this morning that the President has been making speeches \naround the country and particularly in response to action yesterday by \none of our subcommittees of appropriations, because yesterday the \nNational Service Corps was zeroed out by the subcommittee. And the \nstatement that I do not like is referenced to the fact that we are just \nplaying politics when a program like this is zeroed out. I hope I can \nstand before this body as a person who has criticized the National \nService Corps or AmeriCorps with credibility and say that I can be \nwatchful of how the taxpayers' dollars are spent without being accused \nof playing politics. Most of my colleagues would remember that during \nthe Reagan and Bush years when we controlled the White House and even \ncontrolled this body during part of that period of time I was not \nafraid to find fault with my own Presidents--Republican Presidents--\nwhen this was a waste of taxpayers' dollars when it comes to \nexpenditures for defense.\n  I think I have a consistent record of pointing out boondoggles, \nwhether it be in defense or anything else. And I have raised the same \nconcerns about AmeriCorps based upon the General Accounting Office \nsaying that each position costs $26,650 and that that is about twice \nwhat the administration said that these would cost. And the poor \nAmeriCorps worker getting $13,000 out of that $26,000 for their \nremuneration so that much of the money is going to administrative \noverhead and bureaucratic waste. And I do not see, when we are trying \nto balance a budget, that we can justify a program that is going to \nhave about 50 percent of its costs not going to the people that are \nsupposed to benefit from that program. And so I have pointed out to the \nPresident the General Accounting Office statement. I wrote a letter to \nthe President on August 29 of this year, more or less saying reinvent \nthe program or it is going to be eliminated.\n  I have not heard a response from my letter to the President yet. I \nhope he will respond. But I have suggested that he needs to keep the \ncosts of the program within what he said it would cost a couple years \nago when it was invented, and that most of the benefits of it should go \nto the people that are doing the work, not to administrative overhead.\n  And I suggested reinventing it by doing these things. And I will just \nread from the letter six headlines of longer paragraphs that I have \nexplaining exactly what I mean.\n  No. 1, limit the enormous overhead in the Americorps program.\n  No. 2, ensure that the private sector contributes at least 50 percent \nto the cost of AmeriCorps. This was an important point that the \nPresident was making when the program started, that at least $1 or 50 \npercent of the total cost would come from the private sector; $1 of \ntaxpayers' money leverages a dollar of private sector investment. I \ndoubt if we would find fault with the program if it were to do that. \nThen I also suggested limiting rising program costs by not awarding \nAmeriCorps grants to Federal agencies. They say that they get match on \nthis--if EPA has a program with an AmeriCorps worker, that whatever the \nEPA puts in is part of the match. Well, that is the taxpayers' match; \nthat is not a private sector match.\n  I said funds must be targeted to assist young people in paying for \ncollege because some of the money is going to volunteers who will \neither drop out or not use the money to go to college.\n  Then I said to increase the bang for education bucks by making sure \nthat the money is used for those who are going to go to higher \neducation.\n  Finally, I suggested that if the President wants to reinvent the \nprogram, to tell us where in the VA budget, VA-HUD appropriations bill \nthe money ought to come from because there is a lot of other money \nused. As Senator Bond said yesterday, the money was taken from \nAmeriCorps and put in the community development block grant program.\n  I am suggesting to the President that he needs to take into \nconsideration--could I have 1 more minute, please?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. One additional minute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggested to the President that he, according to this \nchart, consider the fact that he has 20,000 volunteers of AmeriCorps; \nand we have got 3.9 million Americans who volunteer. These are young \npeople, volunteers who do not worry about getting paid anything for \nvolunteerism.\n  A second thing that the President should consider is that for one \nAmeriCorps worker we can finance 18 low-income people to go to college \nwith a Pell grant. Those are some alternatives that the President ought \nto think about as he has a news conference today to expose what he says \nis playing politics with his program.\n  When I make a suggestion to the President that he reinvent the \nprogram according to his own definition of how that program should be \nfinanced and operated, I mean reinvent it. Just do what the President \nof the United States said the program was going to cost and who it was \ngoing to benefit or it will be lost. I speak as a person who wants no \nplaying of politics, but as a person who wants to make sure that the \ntaxpayers' dollars are used well, whether it is in AmeriCorps or \nwhether it is in a defense program.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Who yields time to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I would like to compliment my \ncolleague and friend from Iowa for his work on AmeriCorps. I hope that \nthe American people realize, according to the General Accounting \nOffice, that the cost per beneficiary is $27,000. The Senator from Iowa \nhas been very diligent in trying to awaken America to this enormously \nexpensive program. It is a new program. I understand it is one of \nPresident Clinton's favorite programs, but it is enormously expensive--\nenormously expensive.\n  So I compliment my colleague from Iowa for bringing it to the \nattention of this country, and, hopefully, we can stop wasting \ntaxpayers' money and maybe do a better job either through the student \nloan program or Pell grants and help lots of people go to school and \nobtain a college education instead of a few select receiving benefits \nin the $20,000-to-$30,000 category.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13329-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13329-S13333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2488\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nmy friend and colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux. I think if we \nadopt the so-called Breaux amendment, we are preserving welfare as we \nknow it. President Clinton said we want to end welfare as we know it, \nand I happen to agree with that line. But if we maintain or if we adopt \nthis maintenance of effort, as Senator Breaux has proposed--he has two \namendments, one at 100 percent and one at 90 percent--if we adopt \neither of those amendments, we are basically telling the States: ``We \ndon't care if you make significant welfare reductions, you have to keep \nspending the money anyway.''\n  So, there is no incentive to have any reduction of welfare rolls; \ncertainly, if you had the 100-percent maintenance of efforts. ``States, \nno matter what you do, if you have significant reductions, you spend \nthe money anyway.'' That is kind of like ``in your face, big \nGovernment, we know best; Washington, DC is going to micromanage these \nprograms anyway. Oh, yeah, we'll give money to a block grant, but if \nyou have real success, you have to spend the money.''\n  I think that is so counter to what we are trying to do that I just \nhope that our colleagues will not concur with this amendment. This is a \nvery important amendment.\n  I just look at the State of Wisconsin. Currently, they are saving $16 \nmillion a month in State and Federal spending. \n\n[[Page S 13330]]\nBetween January 1987 and December 1994, they experienced a 25-percent \nreduction in their AFDC caseload. My compliments to them. I wish more \nStates would do more innovative things to reduce their welfare \ncaseload.\n  This amendment of my colleague, Senator Breaux, says, ``States, even \nif you do that, if you have phenomenal success, you still have to spend \nthe money. You have to spend as much money as you did,'' and the year \nthat they picked, using the year of 1994, it was an all-time high for \nAFDC caseload.\n  Between May 1994 and May 1995, nationally there was a reduction of \n520,000 recipients on AFDC. So, he happens to pick the highest caseload \nyear as the base and then says, ``States, you have to maintain a level \nat either 90 percent or 100 percent of that level. You have to spend \nthe money. You can't enjoy the benefits and allow your constituents to \nmaybe have more money for education, roads or highways, even if you \nreduce your welfare caseload.'' In other words, let us make sure we \nkeep rolling out the State money.\n  I think that is a serious mistake. We will be voting on this, I \nbelieve, shortly after the policy luncheons. I urge my colleagues to \nvote no on the Breaux amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask the Chair how much time is remaining for both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 15 minutes; the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I take this time just to try and conclude what we are \ntrying to do with my amendment.\n  We, in a bipartisan spirit, in joining with our Republican \ncolleagues, offered an amendment that simply says States should be \npartners in welfare reform with the Federal Government; that the States \nshould be required to help participate and help fund welfare reform; \nthat it is not right, as the other body has done in their bill, to say \nthe States have to put up nothing; that it becomes a 100-percent \nFederal burden and the Federal Government has to pay for the entire \ncost of welfare. That is what the bill that passed the other body says. \nIt says there is no maintenance of effort on behalf of the States at \nall, and that is wrong.\n  I think that we, in this body, clearly feel that the States should \nhave to participate financially in helping to solve these problems. It \nis like we said before, if you spend somebody else's money, you can be \nvery careless in how you spend it. Therefore, if the States are \nrequired to participate and put up some of their money, I think we will \nall do a better job in crafting programs that, in fact, are truly \nwelfare reform.\n  Our legislation says that the States should participate by putting up \n90 percent of the money that they put up in 1994. The Federal \nGovernment will continue to put up 100 percent. If the States are able \nto reduce their caseload by welfare reform, we are very pleased with \nthat. That is the goal. The Federal Government should participate in \nthose savings as well as the States participate in those savings.\n  The Republican bill, on the other hand, says we are going to continue \n100 percent Federal funding for 5 years, no matter how much the State \ngovernment is going to be able to reduce the people on welfare, and \nthat is wrong. If there are savings to be made by fewer people on \nwelfare, then the Federal Government should benefit from those savings, \nas should the State benefit from those savings.\n  That is what the bill says. That is why my amendment is scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office to save $545 million in this program over \nthe next 7 years. That is real savings. If you vote against the Breaux \namendment, you are saying, ``I'm not interested in saving $545 million \nto the Federal Treasury. I do not care. It is not important.''\n  Well, I think it is important. That is why we have tried to craft an \namendment that is balanced, that, in effect, saves Federal dollars as \nwell as it saves State dollars.\n  It is simply not correct to say under my amendment the States would \nnot be able to spend less on welfare. Of course they can. We want them \nto spend less, but when they spend less, we want to be able to spend \nless as well. That is a true partnership that has been in existence for \n60 years.\n  It is incredibly wrong, in my opinion, to say for the first time we \nare going to put all the burden on the Federal Government to pay for \nthe cost of welfare reform. It has to be a partnership if it is going \nto work.\n  My amendment maintains that partnership and, at the same time, \nprovides for real economic savings, savings to the Federal taxpayer to \nthe tune of $545 million over 7 years. There is no doubt about that. It \nhas been scored by CBO. We think it makes sense.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of the time on the 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana keeps \nbringing up the point about the Federal Government contributing 100 \npercent, not having the benefit of any savings. I just suggest to you \nthat if what we want to accomplish here is savings in the welfare \nsystem, the 90-percent maintenance effort will do more to reduce those \nsavings than anything we have seen produced.\n  The fact of the matter is, yes, his amendment may be scored as a \nreduction in Federal outlays. But I suggest, Mr. President, if you went \nback to the Congressional Budget Office and said, ``What would be the \nincrease in State spending as a result of this amendment,'' you would \nsee that it would be more than offset in the reductions in Federal \nspending.\n  What does that mean? That means from the average taxpayer who does \nnot care whether the money is being spent on the Federal level or State \nlevel, they are going to pay more for welfare.\n  That is the bottom line here. It is not how much the Federal \nGovernment saves, or how much the State government saves, or how much \nwe spend and they spend, but how much the taxpayers spend on the \nprogram.\n  I think what your amendment will do is net result in higher welfare \nexpenditures. Sure, they will have to pay more State taxes or more \nmoney to the State than the Federal if we equal them out dollar for \ndollar in taxes.\n  The fact of the matter is your amendment will cause States to spend \neven more money than what we save on the Federal side. I think that is \nclear. I think that is your concern.\n  Do not try to approach this amendment that we are somehow being nice \nto taxpayers. Taxpayers pay State taxes and Federal taxes. When you \ntell them they have to pay more on the States, more than we save on \nFederal, this is not a friendly taxpayers amendment. This will cost \nmore money to the average taxpayers in America, not less.\n  Just because we save a few dollars, they will be more than made up by \nrequired increased expenditures on programs that are being dramatically \nreduced.\n  I have a table that shows from just 1993 to 1994, and I say to the \nSenator from Louisiana that we have even seen more reductions in \nwelfare caseload from 1994 to this year because of other programs being \nput into effect.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this table \nshowing the change in the average number of AFDC recipients from 1993 \nto 1994.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      TABLE 1.

Mr. President, what it will show is that we have seen \nState after State--Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, \nGeorgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan--many States who have \nalready reduced their caseload or are in the process through welfare of \nreducing it more, and the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana will \nmake them spend as much money, although they have less on the caseload.\n  That just is not right. That penalizes States for doing exactly what \nthey want them to do. I think it is a well-intentioned amendment. I \nunderstand the concern for the race to the bottom.\n  But the Dole, as modified, bill provides adequate safeguards to make \nsure that States are not going to eliminate their welfare expenditures. \nI think it does so in the context of encouraging welfare reform on the \nState level.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum. I ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  We have had a lot of discussion as to the amendment that I propose \nwhich requires the State to participate and how it affects the States.\n  I mentioned a number of Governors who have spent a great deal of time \non this effort, including the former chairman of the National \nGovernors' Association, Governor Howard Dean of Vermont. I quote him:\n\n       I support the concept of State maintenance of effort as \n     envisioned by Senator Breaux and other Senators. States \n     should provide adequate levels of support for welfare \n     programs to prevent a ``race to the bottom.''\n\n  The Governor of Colorado, Gov. Roy Romer:\n\n       The Federal-State partnership is an essential component in \n     a strategy designed to provide families with temporary \n     assistance to help them achieve or regain their economic \n     self-sufficiency. We are particularly concerned that if \n     States reduce their commitment to these programs, then \n     responsible States will become magnets for displaced welfare \n     clients.\n\n  These Governors are recognizing that, yes, States ought to have to be \nrequired to participate in solving welfare problems, that we should not \nengage in a race to the bottom as could happen if we have no \nrequirement that the States actively participate.\n  Equally as important, Mr. President, is the comment by the chairman \nof the U.S. Catholic Conference, the domestic policy chair, the Most \nReverend John Ricard, auxiliary bishop of Baltimore who said:\n\n       We urge you to pass genuine reform which strengthens \n     families, encourages work, promotes responsibility, and \n     protects vulnerable children, born and unborn, insisting that \n     States maintain their current financial commitment in this \n     area.\n\n  Catholic Charities President, Fred Kammer, said:\n\n       In exchange for Federal dollars and broad flexibility, \n     States should be expected to maintain at least their current \n     level of support for poor children and their families.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is very clear the distinguished Governors \nand other distinguished social experts in their field have recognized \nthe importance of requiring States to continue to participate.\n  That is, in fact, what the Breaux amendment does. We do it and at the \nsame time save the Federal Government $545 million over the next 7 \nyears as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. That partnership \nis absolutely essential. To say the States would not have a requirement \nto be able to be participants in this process I think is the wrong \nmessage.\n  I say under our amendment, States clearly would reduce the amount of \nmoney they spend, and after it is reduced by more than 10 percent, the \nFederal Government will be able to reduce our contribution so that \nthere should be joint savings by people who pay Federal taxes, as well \nas by people who pay State taxes.\n  It is wrong to maintain 100 percent Federal requirement as the \nRepublican position does even if there are reductions in the amount of \npeople on welfare and any particular State.\n  Both sides should say the States have the flexibility to cut up to 10 \npercent under my amendment and still get 100 percent Federal funding. \nIf they cut further than that, if they decide to spend more money on \nroads and bridges, well, then, the Federal Government ought to have the \nright to spend less, as well. If they do so because they reduce the \nnumber of people on welfare, we should benefit from those savings, as \nwell.\n  That is what a true partnership is all about. That is what the Breaux \namendment tries to accomplish. And I think it is important to know \nthere is a bipartisan effort here. This is not a party difference, it \nis a question of how we achieve a mutual goal of true welfare reform.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Maine. Does he \nwish to speak in support? What time does he require?\n  Mr. COHEN. Not more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Breaux \nmaintenance of effort provision. While I want to let States step up to \nthe plate and implement innovative welfare to work programs with the \nassistance of Federal Government--not interference--I believe a \nFederal-State partnership is a key part of successful welfare reform. \nTherefore, Congress must make a strong statement on the need for State \ninvestment in welfare.\n  We need to encourage States to provide their own funds as a condition \nof receiving the Federal block grant. Under current law, States have an \nincentive to spend their own money on AFDC and related programs. That \nincentive is the Federal match. Fourteen States receive one Federal \ndollar for each State dollar they invest. The rest of the States \nreceive more than a dollar-for-dollar match.\n  Under Senator Dole's maintenance provision, States can satisfy the \nrequirement by spending money on any program which is modified or \naltered in any way by the Dole bill. This would mean State spending on \nfood stamps, State foster care, Head Start, or even SSI State \nsupplemental benefits would satisfy the requirement in the Dole \namendment.\n  I support the Breaux amendment to require a State match, using a \nformula of a dollar for dollar to determine the Federal match for each \nwelfare dollar a State spends. If a State reduces its spending below 90 \npercent of its 1994 spending on AFDC and related child care programs, \nadministrative costs, and job training and education funds--for each \ndollar the State spends below that threshold, the Federal grant to the \nState will be reduced by $1.\n  This amendment is extremely important. It maintains an incentive for \na \n\n[[Page S 13332]]\nState to spend its own resources to aid its own people. Understand, \nhowever, that the State match does not require a State to spend money. \nIf a State is successful in trimming its caseload or cutting \nadministrative costs, there is no requirement that it maintain its \nspending. But if a State is going to realize savings in the welfare \nprogram, I think the Federal Government should share in the savings, \ntoo.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to the debate with considerable care, \nand I must say I find myself in agreement with at least the very last \npoint made by the Senator from Louisiana about the need to try to \napproach welfare reform on a bipartisan basis, because I do not think \neither Republicans or Democrats necessarily have the right solution. I \nhave read a great deal by sociologists. I have listened to the \ncommentators on television, those who are advocating change. There is a \ngeneral consensus that we have to change the system, but there is no \nagreement on what those changes should be, and few are confidently \npredicting what the ultimate consequences of any reform are likely to \nbe.\n  It seems to me that welfare recipients generally can be divided into \nthree groups. On the one hand we have people who lose their jobs after \nworking years and years and are temporarily in need of assistance and \nshould have that assistance. There are those at the other end of the \nspectrum that I think we all recognize that, by virtue of some \ndisability or some other handicap as such, they are unable to work and \nthey deserve our support and not our scorn. Then there are those in the \nmiddle category, people whom we feel generally should be expected to \nwork, who have been caught up in a cycle of welfare over decades, if \nnot generations, even though they would seem able to work. We have to \nreform the system in order to encourage, if not require, these people \nto break the cycle by entering the workforce long-term.\n  So I have looked at the various proposals, and I come to the \nconclusion, after listening to my colleague from Louisiana, that there \nshould be a maintenance of effort undertaken by the States. A couple of \nreasons lead me to that conclusion. On the one hand, I believe, as my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, and also my colleague from Vermont \nindicated, there is a partnership between States and the Federal \nGovernment. The State is under no requirement to spend $1. The State \ndoes not have to spend anything if they do not want to. They can decide \nthey do not want to take care of welfare recipients; that those who are \nout of work, either voluntarily or involuntarily, that is not their \nproblem. But States that take this view should not expect to continue \nto receive the same amount of Federal welfare dollars.\n  Without a maintenance provision, some States may engage in a race to \nthe bottom by setting their benefits low to discourage residents in \nStates providing minimum benefits from moving to States with more \ngenerous benefits. This concern has been dismissed by opponents of this \namendment but remember: For years, many conservatives have argued that \nwelfare recipients moved from State to State to get generous benefits. \nIn a recent survey done in Wisconsin, 20 percent of newly arrived \nWisconsin welfare recipients admitted that they had moved to get a \nbigger check.\n  We must also address the vulnerability of the new block grant program \nto cost-shifting. Increasingly, we have seen States which excel in \nshifting recipients in the general assistance and AFDC programs into \nthe SSI Program, a program funded entirely by Federal dollars. By \nshifting their cases to the SSI Program, the States can be big winners: \nStates are able to recoup interim general assistance payments that they \nprovide to the beneficiary, from the date of application for SSI to \ndetermination of SSI eligibility. Even more important, States will \navoid future costs by shifting populations to a program entirely funded \nby the Federal Government. One State contracted with a for-profit \ncorporation at a cost of $2.7 million to shift cases from the State's \ndisability rolls to the SSI Program. The State enjoyed net savings of \n$27 million in 1992 because of this concentrated effort to more people \nto the SSI Program.\n  I predict that we will see additional cost-shifting onto the Food \nStamp Program. Without a strong maintenance of effort provision, States \nwho retain food stamps as a Federal program can do what other States \nare already doing--pay lower AFDC benefits. When that happens the \nFederal Treasury will bear the burden as the food stamp benefit \nincreases because the cash benefit is low.\n  We must steer away from doing anything to encourage States to make \nunreasonable cuts in their welfare spending. We do not want Federal \nprograms to become a magnet for new recipients who hope that the \nFederal Government will absorb reductions by the State. This increases \nbudget costs for the Federal Government. Just as important, the results \nwe hope to attain through reform of welfare have only a small chance of \nbeing realized because we have excused the States from shared fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  For these and other reasons, Mr. President, I wanted to indicate I \nintend to support the Breaux amendment, and I yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in the couple of minutes left before \nconcluding our side of this debate, I just suggest this really boils \ndown to whether you really want to see dramatic reform or not and \nwhether you want to see dramatic savings in the welfare system. \nBecause, if you require States to keep 90 percent of maintenance of \neffort, what you will do is create a disincentive in an approach that \nwas supposed to be the maximum incentive to welfare reform; to get \nwelfare savings for the taxpayer--to do both.\n  I think it is pretty clear this is sort of a moderating attempt to \ntry to make welfare reform not as dramatic as it could be. I think that \nis unfortunate. I think what the public has demanded on the issue of \nwelfare is that you cannot go too far in trying new things to get \npeople off welfare, to get people on to work, to reduce the amount of \nexpenditure that we have.\n  I remind all Senators that, even under the Republican plan as it \nexists today, welfare spending will go up 70 percent--70 percent--over \nthe next 7 years. It was scheduled to go up 77 percent. We have it go \nup only 70 percent. That is hardly dramatic, but it is something. It is \na start in the right direction, at least, because we believe even \nthough the Federal expenditures on welfare will go up 70 percent, we \nbelieve State expenditures will come down and come down dramatically. \nWe are willing to make that tradeoff because we believe ultimately the \ntaxpayer is going to benefit more from this proposal because of lower \nState expenditures even though the Federal Government is going to \nmaintain a relatively high level of expenditures.\n  I am hopeful we can look to the goals of this, the Dole substitute, \nwhich is dramatic, ingenious, inventive reform, to get people back to \nwork, all at a savings of taxpayers' dollars on the Federal level and \neven more dramatically on the State level.\n  If this amendment is adopted, we will see less reform, less \ninnovation, and more money spent overall on welfare. And that is not \nwhat the goal of this welfare reform debate should be.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes 50 \nseconds left.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, do I understand we have an agreement that \nthere will be 4 minutes after we return?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, has the Republican side yielded back their \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. What do I have left? Do I have any?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and a half.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would say, Mr. President, when we return after the \nparty \n\n[[Page S 13333]]\ncaucuses, we will be, of course, voting on this amendment. I think, \nfrom our perspective, this has been a real effort at trying to reach a \nbipartisan agreement. We have Republican cosponsors and we have \nDemocratic cosponsors of this effort. It is an effort to try to achieve \na partnership between the States and the Federal Government.\n  The States should be required to participate. The Federal Government \nis required to participate. When savings are achieved, which they will \nbe, both sides should benefit from those savings. When States spend \nless money because they have fewer people on the welfare rolls, the \nFederal Government should have to contribute less money, not the same \namount. That is why our amendment clearly is scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office as saving $545 million over the next 7 \nyears. Those are important savings. Without my amendment, they will not \nbe achieved.\n  I think this amendment continues the participation that we have had, \nallows the States to be inventive as to different types of programs \nthey come up with, but requires them to participate. The Federal \nGovernment should not have to pay 100 percent of the cost of welfare. \nThe States should participate, and jointly, together, we can produce a \nbetter result.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13329-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Breaux amendment No. 2488.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think we had a good debate on the \nmaintenance of effort provision. I think it boils down to simply this. \nIf you want a welfare reform bill to come out of the Senate that is \ngoing to be an impetus for change, it is going to say to the States to \ngo out there and be innovative and be able to reduce the welfare \ncaseload, reduce the amount of State expenditures, and have the \nflexibility you need to do those without artificially holding States to \nthe high level of maintenance of effort. I think the Dole 75 percent \nprovision that is in there right now does that. It prohibits a race to \nthe bottom. It gives States flexibility. It says be innovative. It \nsaves money. And I think that is really what we want to accomplish. It \nis a prevention of the worst-case scenario which is no welfare spending \nfrom the States, and at the same time provides that amount of \nflexibility that is needed to go forward and do some dramatic changes \nin the welfare system. I think we have struck a very responsible \ncompromise.\n  I think this amendment goes too far. This basically says we are going \nto continue to spend money. The Senator from Louisiana often says we \nare going to save money at the Federal level. Why should not the \nFederal Government save money? We may be saving money on the Federal \nlevel but we are spending a lot more taxpayers' money at the State \nlevel. The taxpayer overall under this amendment will lose even though \nthe Federal Government is going to save a little money. It will spend a \nlot more in State resources. Again, it is an unfriendly taxpayer \namendment and at the same time stifles innovation.\n  I urge the rejection of the amendment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks by pointing out \nthat for 6 years we have had a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States. The House, when they took up welfare reform, \nsaid for the first time the States will have no obligation to do \nanything. They can spend zero dollars if they want. But the Federal \nGovernment has to continue to foot 100 percent of the bill. That is \nwrong.\n  My amendment says we are going to require the States to spend 90 \npercent of what they were spending and the Federal Government will \nspend 100 percent of what it was spending. But if the States are able \nto reduce what they spend below 90 percent, we will also reduce the \nFederal contribution. If they save a dollar, we will save a dollar. \nThat is a true partnership. They can be as inventive as they want. We \nhope they are. We hope they save money. But when they save money and \nspend more than 10 percent less than they were spending last year, the \nFederal Government will also reduce our contribution.\n  The Congressional Budget Office looked at our amendment and the \nCongressional Budget Office said that it would save $545 billion over \nthe next 7 years. Without my amendment being adopted, we will not see \nthose savings implemented into law. Mr. President, $545 billion over 7 \nyears is a significant amount of money. It maintains the partnership \nbetween the Federal Government and the States. Why should we in \nWashington send the money to the States if they are not going to \nparticipate? If we let the States get off the hook and we continue to \nsend the money, that is not a true partnership and that will be \ncontrary to the reforms that we are trying to reach. Anybody who has \never been to a conference around here knows the House has a zero \nrequirement. If we go in with a 75 percent requirement, in all \nlikelihood we are going to split the difference.\n  So if all of our Republican colleagues think 75 percent is a \nreasonable amount to come out of a conference, I would suggest it is \nabsolutely essential that they vote for the Breaux amendment as it \ncurrently is drafted.\n  I yield the time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to table the Breaux amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Louisiana. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nconsider amendment No. 2562, offered by the Senator from Missouri [Mr. \n\n[[Page S 13334]]\nAshcroft]. There will be 1 hour for debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself 10 minutes, \nand I ask to be notified when the 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. President, we are debating this week a very important topic, and \nit is not the future of a series of governmental programs, not the role \nof the Federal Government in providing for a social safety net. We are \nnot debating how much money we will save. What we are debating this \nweek is nothing less than the lives of millions of American citizens.\n  The welfare program, as it is currently constituted, has entrapped \nmillions of Americans and has robbed literally generations of their \nfuture. What we are debating is whether we will continue to subsidize \nthe current system, which may feed the body, but it numbs the spirit. \nIt is a system which traps people in a web of dependency, places them \nin a cycle of hopelessness and despair. It is a system which promises a \nway out, but punishes those who try to find the way out.\n  Today's welfare system is heartless and cruel; it is unfeeling, it is \nuncaring. Whatever we do, we must remember those facts, and we must \nremember the faces that are the portraits of suffering that have been \ndrawn on the canvas of American history by our welfare system as it is \nnow constituted.\n  Welfare's failure is evident in many programs. Nowhere is it more \nevident, though, than in the Food Stamp Program. Food stamps, part of \nthe Great Society's war on poverty. Today, food stamps is the country's \nlargest provider of food aid. It is also, arguably, the Nation's most \nextensive welfare program. Last year, the program tried to help more \nthan one out of every 10 Americans at a cost of nearly $25 billion.\n  As the chart behind me illustrates, spending on food stamps has \nincreased exponentially since becoming a national program in the early \nseventies, a quite dramatic and rapid increase. It has not been a \nfunction of population growth alone. This expansion is the result of \nfraud and abuse, compounded by oversight, as well as a variety of other \nfactors.\n  This stack of papers in front of me on the desk to my left is a stack \nof the 900 pages of food stamp regulations that States are forced to \ncomply with in trying to help individuals find their way to \nindependence and out of the despair of the welfare trap.\n  It is important to note that we have tried to reform welfare on \nprevious occasions and tried to reform food stamps, as well, in the \nprocess.\n  The last real attempt at reform was in 1988, and you do not have to \nhave particularly strong analytic skills to see what has happened since \n1988 in the food stamp program: The program has skyrocketed.\n  A 1995 General Accounting Office report, a 1995 GAO report, found \nthrough fraud and illegal trafficking in food stamps, the taxpayers \nlost as much as $2 billion a year. Mr. President, $2 billion a year is \na lot of money. That would average out to $40 million per State. That \nis close to $800,000 a week, per State, all across this country.\n  Furthermore, despite GAO's conclusions that the resources allocated \nfor monitoring retailers was grossly inadequate, in other words we have \nnot had the kind of enforcement that GAO says might be appropriate, the \nFood and Consumer Service officials still uncovered 902 retailers \ninvolved in food stamp fraud last year alone. That is where food \nstamps, which are designed to help people with nutritional needs, are \nused to acquire any number of other things that are not part of the \ndesign for food stamps.\n  In February 1994, the Reader's Digest chronicled fraud and abuse in \nan article entitled the ``Food Stamp Racquet.'' One example was Kenneth \nCoats, no relation to the occupant of the chair I am sure, but owner of \nCoats Market in East St. Louis. It seems Mr. Coats paid as little as 65 \ncents on the dollar for food stamps and then cashed them in at full \nvalue.\n  During a period of 18 months he redeemed $1.3 million, enabling him \nto pay for his children's private schooling, with enough left over for \n$150,000 in stocks, five rental houses and a Mercedes.\n  If that were not bad enough, Reader's Digest reported that this was \nnot Mr. Coats' first attempt at defrauding the American taxpayers. Ten \nyears earlier his market was disqualified from participating in the \nFood Stamp Program because of fraud, though he was only disqualified \nfor 6 months. Obviously, he was back in business. And at 65 cents, \npaying welfare recipients and cashing them in with the Government at \nobviously the face value, he made quite a bit of money.\n  Now, there are stories of food stamp fraud and abuse to be found in \nevery State in the Nation. There is a lot to like about the Food Stamp \nProgram but there are many ways in which this so-called ideal \ntransitional benefit has been a problem. They are a stopgap measure. \nThey serve the people. They serve children. They serve the elderly.\n  But there is a lot to dislike about the program which we have already \ndiscussed. It is because we want to change this system to help people \nand to empower States that I am today introducing this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we can do better. My amendment would fundamentally \nchange food stamps. Instead of having a system run and administered by \nbureaucrats in Washington, my amendment would return responsibility for \nthe Food Stamp Program to the States. It would do it with an important \nqualifier: It would do it still allowing funding for growth at the CBO \nprojected levels for the next 5 years.\n  Unlike the present system, however, this block grant would give the \nStates an incentive to improve the program's performance and \nefficiency. It would accomplish this by allowing any and all savings \nachieved by the States to be applied to help more people who are really \nin need.\n  This approach, if adopted, would have enormous advantages. One, it \nwould allow States to spend available resources on the people who need \nfood, rather than on feeding the bureaucracy. It would make it possible \nto reduce some of the costs. The highest administrative costs in \nwelfare, 12 percent, are in the Food Stamp Program.\n  Second, it would allow the States to coordinate their efforts in \nassisting the needy. So much of the problem we have now is when we \nshift welfare burdens from one quadrant of the welfare equation to \nanother.\n  The leadership's bill would maintain many of the complicated \nregulations which have frustrated State efforts to help individuals in \nneed. I think we need to give States the flexibility to administrator \nneed in accordance with the needs of the needy and the State rather \nthan in accordance with the 900 pages of Federal regulations.\n  Third, a clean block grant to the States will work to end the fraud \nand abuse which have cost the taxpayers billions. I think this is so \nbecause when the State has a block grant and it reduces fraud and \nabuse, it gets to keep the money which has been involved in the fraud \nor abuse.\n  There will be a real incentive for the States to drive down the costs \nassociated with fraud and abuse. It is true that the leadership bill in \nthis measure has some incentives but they are not incentives which \nwould thoroughly match the incentives of a block grant, the structural \nincentives of providing for savings and allowing the States to recoup \nthe savings in their entirety.\n  Finally, States can provide individualized assistance. They know \ntheir welfare recipients' needs. They can coordinate thoroughly on \ntheir own terms their welfare programs.\n  We have real welfare reform. It is time for us to understand that \nreforming this, the largest of the welfare programs which touches more \npeople than any others, should be a part of that reform.\n  We have heard a lot about devolution, that term that means we need to \nreduce the size and scope of the power of Washington. Well, we need to \nchange the way in which Washington has affected the welfare system by \nstopping the arrogant assumption that Washington knows best, \nparticularly in such a significant program. Every American has had an \nexperience at some time or another with the abuses that are involved in \nfood stamps. Federalism has one of its hallmarks of trusting Government \nclose to the people. It is time \n\n[[Page S 13335]]\nfor us to do that with the Food Stamp Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has spoken for 10 \nminutes. I believe he wanted to be notified.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such additional time \nI may need to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. A vote for this amendment is a clear and principled \nstand for the limits of the Federal power and the need for State \ncontrol.\n  A vote against this amendment is also clear. It is a clear statement \nagainst the rights of people to control their own destinies, their own \nlives, in a way that is free from the intermeddling of nearly 1,000 \npages of regulation, micromanaging what happens in States, interfering \nwith their ability to meet the needs of their citizens.\n  We are in the midst of a long and substantial debate. It is a \nnecessary debate on welfare. Passions are high. Rhetoric is high. \nProgress is slow. It is time for us to make real progress on a major \nwelfare program.\n  Every so-called welfare reform for the past two generations has had a \ncouple of things in common. They have resulted in more people being \ntrapped in the web of dependency; and second, they have resulted in \nmore bureaucracy. We need not rearrange the deck chairs on the welfare \nbureaucracy again. We need to make substantial changes. We cannot \nafford half measures. The poor cannot afford half measures.\n  We are about to fundamentally change AFDC. We are about to \nfundamentally change a number of other smaller welfare programs. It \nseems we are just happy to tinker around the margins with food stamps.\n  I believe food stamps are welfare. They are the largest--they serve \nmore clients than any other welfare program. They provide an incentive \nto illegitimacy, just as AFDC does, by providing more payments with \nmore children that are brought into this world while on welfare. They \nare a part and parcel of the welfare system which seeks to help but \nactually hurts.\n  I do not know how it is that block grants can make sense for \neverything else from AFDC to job training but not for food stamps.\n  Yet, given all this, the leadership bill makes involvement in the \nfood stamp block grant optional while simultaneously creating a \ndisincentive for individual States to choose to operate under the block \ngrant.\n  By removing Federal entanglement, it is my hope we can begin to \neliminate the fraud, cut down on waste, the high administrative costs, \nand make it possible for States to take action which helps move people \nfrom welfare to work.\n  If we succeed where others have failed, we must be bold and \nconsistent. I do not think we need to wait 7 years to determine whether \na food stamp block grant is desirable. Washington's one-size-fits-all \nsystem has not worked. Continuing a system that entraps people in \ndependency will do nothing more than to sow the seeds of future \ndisaster.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Indiana yield?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator as much \ntime as he requires.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager and \nchairman.\n  I have listened to the speech of my distinguished colleague from \nMissouri, and if this indeed was simply a question of whether the \nStates could make the decisions or not, it would be one thing, but it \nis not. In fact, it is quite the opposite.\n Under the bill of the distinguished Republican leader, the States have \nthe right to make a decision--a decision to choose to take a block \ngrant instead of food stamps, or to participate in the Food Stamp \nProgram. The amendment, No. 2562, by the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri, removes that right.\n\n  I think, also, it removes an option available to many of the elderly \nand disabled. If somebody has received 24 months of assistance in their \nlifetime, then food stamps can no longer be made available unless they \nare working. We see where, if somebody has had assistance years before, \nworked many, many, many years before becoming disabled, they are told \n``You got your bite of the apple a long time ago.'' They lose their \nfood assistance under this amendment. States no longer have the option, \nunder this amendment, of choosing a block grant instead of food stamps, \nand participating in the Food Stamp Program.\n  The bill does impose on States, whether they want it or not, an \nunfair formula for providing funds. If you look at the formula, it \npenalizes growth States but also penalizes States that face recessions. \nDuring the last recession, when millions of people lost their jobs, \nthey turned to food stamps to help feed their children. Under this \namendment, when there is a recession, then benefits would be cut. Just \nwhen a temporarily out of luck family would need assistance, the \namendment says, ``Too bad, have a hungry day.'' For example, if you are \nan industrial State and large manufacturing plants suddenly close, that \nis when this could cut in. It seems, when fewer people need food \nstamps, the benefits increase again.\n  Let me give an example. In California a couple of years ago, there \nwas a massive earthquake. Mr. President, 40 percent of all the food \nstamps issued in California were issued in L.A. County for that month. \nBasically, what we would say under this is we are going to allow the \npeople who lost everything they had in L.A. County because of the \nearthquake to eat. But all the rest of the State is going to go hungry.\n  One of the things the Food Stamp Program is supposed to do is to help \neven out those kinds of peaks and valleys because the earthquake that \noccurs in California may be the hurricane that occurs in Florida or the \nrecession that occurs in Illinois or the flood that occurs along the \nMississippi or Missouri River.\n  So I think we should not eliminate the choice of whether States \nshould decide to take the block grant. Congress should not impose that \non them. There are a lot of decisions that Governors and legislators \nhave to make, so I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment. It \nremoves the State\"s right to decide, hurts the elderly and disabled, \nand hurts some States at the expense of the others.\n  I like the original Agriculture Committee bill written by Senator \nLugar. It gives the States plenty of flexibility. It does not abandon \nthe Federal-State partnership.\n  We have worked for years, constantly, to improve aspects of the food \nstamp program. The bill I talked about before that I introduced, on \nelectronics benefits transfer, will do that. We have tightened and \nlimited eligibility. But in the only major power on Earth that can not \nonly raise enough food to feed 250 million people but have food left \nover for export and for storage, I question whether we should tamper \nwith the most basic program for feeding hungry people--the elderly, \ndisabled, those temporarily out of a job.\n  There are those who rip off the system and we can nail them. We have \nlaws to do that. But let us not say you are going to be removed. And \nlet us not say this is something that encourages more babies. What are \nyou going to say, that if we do not feed a hungry baby, if we cut off \nthe food, that baby will suddenly go away? Are we saying do not have \nthe baby, abort the child, or do something else? The fact of the matter \nis, a hungry child is a hungry child. That child does not make that \ndecision to be hungry. That child does not make that decision to be \nborn. Let us not think that child will go away if we simply cut the \nfood stamps or any other benefits for them.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana \nfor his courtesy and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an employee of \nthe Congressional Research Service, Joe Richardson, be granted \nprivilege of the floor during consideration of welfare reform \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont for his thoughtful debating comments. He has offered leadership \nin the \n\n[[Page S 13336]]\nnutrition area throughout the entirety of the 19 years that I have \nserved in this body.\n  Throughout that period of time, I have been deeply concerned about \nthe Food Stamp Program for several reasons, and the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri has expanded on many of them. The Food Stamp \nProgram, because it is a national program and an extraordinarily \ncomplex one dealing with myriad retail situations, has led to great \nfraud and abuse. That has been a concern of the Committee on \nAgriculture really throughout the entirety of the program. It has to be \nour concern today.\n  But I have also been deeply concerned about the Food Stamp Program \nbecause it is the basic safety net for nutrition for Americans. It is \nthe stopper, in terms of people starving, in this country. We have \nknown that. We have regretted its abuse on occasion, but we have \ncherished the thought that every American, in a country of abundance, \nwould have a chance to eat. That is fundamental and that we must \npreserve.\n  The distinguished Senator from Missouri, the great Governor of his \nState, has been a fighter for the reinvigoration of federalism, and I \nshare that idealism. As mayor of the city of Indianapolis, I was \ninvolved in the first wave of the new federalism with President Nixon. \nProgram after program came to our city. We tried to demonstrate, I \nthink with some success, that mayors and local officials, in addition \nto Governors and county officials, can handle most of the aspects of \nthe internal workings of government in this United States best at the \nlocal level. Clearly, in the welfare reform debate we are now having, \nwe are about to test out the proposition that we should give back to \nStates and local governments authority to handle a great deal of \ndifficult matters.\n  But in the case of the food stamp and nutrition programs, the House \nof Representatives and the Senate to date have said that there must be \na safety net, basically, for eating, for nutrition--a safety net \nagainst starvation in this country. This is not an experimental \nsituation in which, as the Senator from Missouri advocates, like it or \nnot we send it back to the States and say to the Governors: ``You are \ngoing to have to run it. You may not have asked for it. You may not \nwish to deal with it at all. But, by golly, you are going to have it \nand with exactly the same amount of money being spent now with a little \nbit of inflation rise per year. It does not matter whether the country \nis in recession or prosperity; it does not matter whether you have more \npeople coming in. That is your tough luck. We are going to send it to \nyou because we are tired of it and we do not want to spend any more \nmoney on it and we do not want to take the responsibility for it.''\n  Mr. President, I believe that is an understandable attitude but, I \nhope, not the attitude the Senate winds up with today. Because, for \nmany thousands of Americans, that is likely to be a disastrous decision \nand Senators really have to consider and weigh on their consciences \ntoday the proposition, which is a very fundamental one, before us.\n  As the Senator from Vermont pointed out, we are not doing this \namendment as a favor to Governors. As a matter of fact, most have not \nrequested this responsibility. Most of the Governors coming into our \ncommittee have not wanted the responsibility. To give some impression \nthat Governors all over the country are eager to grasp all of this is \ntotally erroneous.\n  There are some very able Governors who want to run it, and my \njudgment is that they will run it very well. But we have had a good \nnumber of Governors who have said we are inundated by people. We are \ninundated by the economic cycle. Yet, here we debate on this floor \ntoday the thought that, like it or not, the States will simply have the \nFood Stamp Program, or, as a matter of fact, they may not have much of \na program at all.\n  The Governors may decide, in fact, to use the money for something \nelse. If you happen to be a citizen of one of those States, you are out \nof luck. We have said thus far, Mr. President, that if you are an \nAmerican, if you are here in this country and you are unemployed, you \nare disabled and you have problems, there is at least a safety net. And \nwe have been proud that has been the case.\n  Let me just say that the Committee on Agriculture, long before we got \ninto the welfare debate, was involved in reform of food stamp \ndiscussions this year. We are also involved in a very serious budget \nproblem. We are going to have a reconciliation bill shortly. By \nSeptember 22, we must report from our committee $48.4 billion of \nsavings over a 7-year period of time.\n  Mr. President, we have identified $30 billion of savings in the \nnutrition programs and most of that in the Food Stamp Program. The \nCommittee on Agriculture has been diligent because we have tried to \nboth reform the program and make certain it was less expensive even \nwhile retaining the basic safety net of the program. The House of \nRepresentatives has done a similar job.\n  Mr. President, I will point out that the Republican leadership \nwelfare proposal we are now debating, as does the House bill, does not \nblock grant the Food Stamp Program but makes dramatic changes in its \nstructure. It greatly expands the States' administrative flexibility \nand ability to implement welfare reform initiatives. By allowing States \nto operate a State-designed simplified food stamp program for cash \nwelfare recipients and have more control over a host of regular program \nrules, States are given the option of taking the food stamp assistance \nas a block grant.\n  So, Mr. President, if I am in error--and there are a host of \nGovernors out there who have been eager to get this program, they are \ngoing to have that option. They may be lined up at the door, but I have \nnot seen the line. All I am saying is they have that option. If they do \nso, they must spend 80 percent of the money that the Federal Government \nis spending on food. The rest can be spent on employment and training \nprograms and, up to 6 percent, on administration.\n  The citizens in their State will have to hope that those Governors \nand legislators, if they become involved in that decision--that is a \nvery interesting question, Mr. President: What if there was a case in \nwhich State legislators allow the Governor alone to make such a \ndecision? Should a decision as grave as this one be vested in a \nGovernor to take an entire State off the Food Stamp Program \nirrevocably, a one-time decision from which there is no return without \nthe legislature, without any check and balance within that State? \nShould the Governor, in fact, be prepared to terminate the program if \nthat is his wish or her wish, as the case may be? Where is the \ndemocracy in that situation even while we are eager to shed this burden \nand move down the trail of devolution?\n  Let me say it is important that Senators know the reforms that were \nenacted by the Agriculture Committee and have been adopted by the \nleadership proposal. I cite not all of them but ones that I think are \nvery important that Senators know are a part of this bill but would not \nbe a part necessarily of any regime in any State that decided simply to \nblock grant food stamps.\n  In this bill, we disqualify any adult who voluntarily quits a job or \nreduces work effort. We deny food stamps to able-bodied adults 18 to 50 \nwithout children who received food stamps for 6 months out of the \nprevious 12 months without working or participating in a work program \nat least half time. Those are pretty stringent qualifications.\n  We ensure that food stamp benefits do not increase when a recipient's \nwelfare benefits are reduced for failing to comply with other non-work-\nrelated welfare rules, such as the failure to get children immunized. \nStates may also reduce food stamp allotments for up to 25 percent for \nfailure to comply with other welfare programs rules. States may do \nthat.\n  We allow in this bill States to disqualify an individual from food \nstamps for the period that they are disqualified from other public \nassistance programs for failure to perform an action required in the \nother program. For example, failure to comply with AFDC work \nrequirements must trigger a food stamp disqualification. We establish \nmandatory minimum disqualification periods for violation of work rules, \nand States may adopt even longer disqualification periods and may \npermanently \n\n[[Page S 13337]]\ndisqualify a recipient for a third violation of a work rule--\npermanently disqualify.\n  We give States control over the Food Stamp Program for households \ncomposed entirely of AFDC members as long as Federal costs do not \nincrease. States choose their AFDC rules, food stamp rules, or a \ncombination to develop one standardized set of rules. States may do all \nof this under this bill.\n  Mr. President, if this is the case, a Senator might ask, why the \nobjection to simply letting States do it all? Why not make it \npermissive? Why spell it out in a Federal bill? We do so to preserve a \nnational safety net.\n  The leadership bill before us now that we are debating is not a bill \nthat is very permissive. This is a bill that saves $30 billion over 7 \nyears. In almost every conceivable way, in the 106 pages which the \nAgriculture Committee put together, it tries to make certain that food \nstamp programs stay on the straight and narrow.\n  Perhaps State legislatures will want to replicate that. Perhaps \nlegislatures want to borrow this intact and pass it as a State law. But \nif they do not, Mr. President, the Governor of that State is going to \nhave a heck of a time administering food stamps. The provisions in the \nleadership bill come from a body of knowledge and experience over the \nyears of how fraud and abuse occur, and it occurs in many, many ways, \nnot easily discovered in a transition period of a few weeks during \nwhich time the States with or without enthusiasm take over the Food \nStamp Program.\n  Mr. President, the overwhelming case for a rejection of this \namendment finally comes back to the fact that none of us can foretell \nthe future in a dynamic economy such as ours. We are a free country. \nThank goodness. People can move from State to State, and they do so by \nthe tens of millions every year.\n  Yet, Mr. President, we are in the process of about to lock in flat \namounts to States for the duration of this experiment, an amount of \nmoney that will not be changed if that State has a huge number of new \npeople coming into it for whatever reason.\n  Perhaps States may say, ``Well, we will control that. We will simply \nabandon the Food Stamp Program. There is nothing attractive about our \nState. Why not let other States that have a food stamp program take \ncare of persons who are disabled or suddenly unemployed, or infants and \nchildren or what have you? Why not let those States take care of them?\"\n  Mr. President, people can pick and choose where to live by their \nmigratory patterns in this country. Perhaps the idea of a safety net \nwherever it is, is not attractive to Senators or citizens. But I have \nnot heard the case made on those grounds very frequently. And I would \nsay furthermore that even if there were no changes in population in the \ncountry, clearly there are changes every year in the economic cycle.\n  In my home State of Indiana in 1982--I was reminded of this as we \nwere discussing another food stamp amendment yesterday--in Kokomo, IN, \nin Anderson, in Muncie, Indiana where there were large concentrations \nof auto workers at a time of great recession, the unemployment reached, \nin each of those cities, 20 percent. I would just say that kind of \nunemployment is massive, and it is horrible to witness.\n The Food Stamp Program was very important to those cities, very \nimportant to our State. Whoever was Governor of Indiana could not have \nanticipated in 1979 and 1980 or even 1981 that there would be 20-\npercent unemployment in those localities. There was no way anyone could \nhave been wise enough to have prophesied that. But the Governor of \nIndiana was mighty pleased that in fact there was a safety net for \nnutrition in our country and in the State of Indiana at that point and \nthat he was not responsible at that moment for facing a whole apparatus \nfor administering the Food Stamp Program.\n\n  Our Governor did not assert that he was wiser than everybody in the \ncountry; that he could do it better. He knew the problems better in \nKokomo. Of course, he did. But that would not have made a whit of \ndifference in terms of the nutrition needs of people who were suddenly \nand massively unemployed in ways that were not going to be remedied \nvery rapidly.\n  Mr. President, it is simply reckless in a country of great dynamic \nchanges of population and in the economic cycle to throw away the \nsafety net; and that is the issue here.\n  The Senator from Missouri, in intellectual fairness, has presented \nvery squarely that his amendment is the end of the Federal safety net, \nthe end of the Federal Food Stamp Program, and there are many who will \nrejoice in that and say good riddance; we should never have started \nthis humanitarian effort to begin with.\n  I am not one of them, Mr. President. I am hopeful a majority of \nSenators do not join in that point of view either. Of course, we must \nreform, and I have listed 6 of possibly 50 very sizable, tough reforms. \nOf course, we have to downsize and, of course, we have to economize. \nAnd we are doing it with a vengeance; $30 billion in 7 years for food \nstamp recipients, but, of course, we must have a safety net in a vast \nand complex country such as ours.\n  Mr. President, I yield and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I inquire as to the remaining time on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 16 minutes and \n55 seconds, the Senator from Indiana has 7 minutes and 18 seconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield so much time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The question we debate today is not whether or not \nthere will be assistance to individuals who are in need. The question \nwe debate today is whether or not that assistance will be delivered by \nState officials who are proximate to the problem or whether we are \ngoing to persist with a one-size-fits-all system in Washington, DC, \nwhich is characterized by the highest administrative costs of any \nwelfare program, rampant fraud and abuse, and 900 pages of excessive \nFederal regulations. I have not proposed ending the ability of States \nto meet the needs of their people. I am proposing enhancing the ability \nof States to meet those needs.\n  The distinguished Senator from Vermont talked about the needs in the \nevent of earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters. And the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, for whom I have great respect, \ntalked about needs in times of recession. I believe those are needs, \nthose are legitimate needs, those are times when people legitimately \nneed assistance, and I believe that assistance can best be rendered if \nwe ask those at the State level to effect those programs they can \neffect to provide delivery of the services.\n  I might point out that the proposed amendment does not diminish the \nfunding available for food stamps. We took the CBO numbers, the \nprojections under the Dole bill and said those would be the amount of \nthe block grant.\n  This is not a debate over the amount of resources that will be \navailable. This is a debate over whether that resource will continue to \nbe delivered through a one-size-fits-all bureaucracy that has failed in \nWashington, DC, or whether we are going to empower States that have \nsubstantial ideas on what they can do to deliver this program.\n  Let me quote to you what Gerald Miller says, director of social \nservices for Governor Engler in Michigan.\n  ``Under a block grant,'' he said, ``States could deliver services \nmore cheaply and efficiently without cutting benefits.'' Miller \ncontends that if the food stamp program remains unchanged, it will have \nto be cut to meet deficit reduction targets. If the food stamp program \nwere to be made into a block grant,'' he said, ``I don't know one \nRepublican Governor who would cut benefits to one client.\n  The distinguished Senator from Indiana indicated that Republican \nGovernors or Governors in general might not be in favor of these kinds \nof amendments. I am pleased to just say that I know of one Governor, \nGov. Tommy Thompson, who is a leading Republican Governor and one of \nthe leading proponents of welfare reform in the country. I have his \nletter dated September 11, 1995, which I will submit for the Record. \n\n[[Page S 13338]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           State of Wisconsin,\n\n                                               September 11, 1995.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senators Ashcroft and Shelby: As I know you both \n     agree, the welfare reform bill currently being considered, S. \n     1120, is a dramatic improvement over current law. Each of you \n     has submitted amendments to this bill which allow for still \n     greater flexibility in the use of food stamps in the form of \n     block grants. The purpose of this letter is to support your \n     efforts in this regard.\n       Senator Ashcroft's amendment allows the maximum level of \n     state flexibility while preserving the anticipated level of \n     federal financial support envisioned in the leadership bill. \n     Senator Shelby's amendment would also allow for generous \n     state flexibility while at the same time reducing federal \n     expenditures on food stamps through anticipated improvements \n     in state efficiency in managing the program.\n       I heartily endorse both of your efforts to increase the \n     level of flexibility allowed in the management of the food \n     stamp program. In addition, the transferability of funds from \n     the food stamp block grant to the AFDC block grant, which is \n     common to both your bills, is of critical importance to \n     states like Wisconsin. We anticipate spending more on work \n     programs and supports to work, such as child care, and less \n     on unrestricted benefits. Therefore, we need this funding \n     flexibility.\n       We fully support both of your efforts to improve the \n     leadership bill to allow for more effective administration of \n     the food stamp block grant.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy G. Thompson,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is addressed to the Honorable Richard C. Shelby of \nthis body and to me. It endorses the effort to increase the flexibility \nfor States in the Food Stamp Program and the block grant program.\n  Now, reference has been made to the safety net for nutrition; that we \nneed to help citizens who are in real need; we need to deliver and meet \nthat need effectively.\n  Reference has been made to the potential--and I do not understand \nthis--of an irrevocable, one-time decision by Governors to abandon food \nhelp to their citizens. I do not know of any Governor that has that \nkind of authority, and I do not know of any government anywhere in the \nUnited States that can make irrevocable decisions to abandon things.\n  The political process operates. People with needs know their way to \nthe State capital. It is easier to get there than it is to the National \nCapital. Welfare recipients have the right to vote. This body and the \nU.S. Congress in the last session provided a special means of \nregistering welfare recipients so that they would be given a right to \nvote, their voice would be heard, making their voice heard in a place \nclose to them, the State capital, instead of demanding that they come \nto Washington to have their voice heard, and demanding that they find \ntheir way through 900 pages of Federal regulations appears to me to be \nan important thing.\n  Let me just additionally say it was indicated no one has the ability \nto know what the future holds if we were to have a block grant to the \nStates. I can tell you what the future holds if we do not block grant \nthis to the States. The future holds the same kind of problems that we \nhave had in the past with entitlement spending that continues to build \nthe program. When the Federal program is an entitlement program, it is \nin the interest of the State to build the program. States administering \nthe program without a financial stake in the program keep shifting \npeople into the program; it brings money to the State automatically. It \nis part of the pernicious impact of this Federal system of welfare \nwhich has resulted in a growing portion of our population being \ndependent on Government rather than a shrinking portion of our \npopulation being dependent on Government.\n  It is a simple question. Do we want more welfare and less \nindependence or do we want more independence and less welfare? The \nstructure of the way we deliver benefits should not be designed to \nincrease welfare as it is now. It should be designed to increase \nindependence.\n  I believe the opportunity made available to the States of this \ncountry through a block grant so that States can formulate their own \nrules and they know they are operating within a limited amount of \nresources is exactly what we need. An entitlement system simply is \nabsent the kind of incentive for reduction in the problem.\n  We need to reform welfare, not to grow it. People in my State, when \nthey spell reform, spell it r-e-d-u-c-e, reduce. It is time for us to \nreduce welfare.\n  So with all due respect for my distinguished colleagues from Vermont \nand from Indiana, who have indicated that it is important to have an \nentitlement program that is open ended, I think it has the wrong \nstructural incentives.\n  One last point that I would make. My respected and distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, mentioned we could not consider \nthis program to be an incentive for illegitimacy. I do not think it was \ndesigned to be an incentive for illegitimacy. But the fact of the \nmatter is that the more children you have in the family, the bigger the \nbenefits are. And in the context of a benefit that can be changed into \ncash with unfortunate and inappropriate ease, I think it is undeniable \nthat we have simply exacerbated the problem.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me just indicate again that the welfare \nreform bill in front of the Senate is not one that is permissive. It \ntalks about reform and reduction, as the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri has pointed out. All of the requirements that I mentioned in \nthe reform of food stamps are clearly not permissive. They do not \npermit a program that is open-ended. Quite to the contrary, they demand \na program that reduces expenses by $30 billion in 7 years of time, a \nprogram that is thoroughly conversant with fraud and abuse, as has been \nobserved and will be discovered by States that attempt to run these \ncomplex programs. But, Mr. President, I have no quarrel with a Governor \nor a State that wishes to take over the Food Stamp Program. As a matter \nof fact, the bill in front of us permits that explicitly.\n  What I do think is inadvisable is for the Congress--or the Senate \nmore particularly today--to simply say, whether you want the program or \nnot, it is yours and you are going to have to deal with it, all of the \nregulations, all of the stipulations. And even if you are well \nmotivated to serve those who are hungry, you are going to have to \nfigure out from scratch how to do that and on a limited amount of money \nthat will not increase whether the economic times change or the \npopulation changes. That I think, Mr. President, is ill-advised, and so \ndo many others.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, Mr. President, \nletters from the Food Marketing Institute, from the National-American \nWholesale Grocers' Association, the National Cattlemen's Association, \nand the National Peanut Council, Inc., that back the current proposals \nin the welfare bill that is before us and would oppose block-granting \nfood stamp programs.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Food Marketing Institute,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: The retail food industry full supports \n     the efforts of this Congress to produce meaningful welfare \n     reform that is simpler, more efficient and less costly than \n     the current system. The food stamp program is one aspect of \n     welfare reform that is of particular concern to our industry. \n     We have been participating in this program for over twenty-\n     five years and have long supported food stamps as an \n     effective and efficient way of reducing hunger.\n       FMI supports the food stamp reforms approved by the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee. The supermarket industry believes the \n     Agriculture Committee bill allows state and local flexibility \n     to create innovative programs while maintaining a system that \n     guarantees allocated funding will be used for food \n     assistance. Research has demonstrated that removing the link \n     between program benefits and the actual purchase of food \n     results in the deterioration of nutritional diets, especially \n     for our children. Food assistance programs are different from \n     other welfare programs--they are the basic safety \n\n[[Page S 13339]]\n     net for those who cannot afford adequate diets. We are concerned that \n     converting the federal nutrition program into a cash program \n     would inadvertently result in eliminating the current food \n     stamp program and the long-term effects would be disastrous.\n       As the most effective way to curb fraud and abuse, FMI \n     supports the conversion of paper food stamps to a nationally \n     uniform EBT system. Without a uniform national delivery \n     system, there is potential for different sets of standards \n     and operational procedures all of which would make it \n     impossible to set up an effective central monitoring system \n     to detect fraud and abuse. Continued access for recipients in \n     rural communities and urban centers is critically important \n     as we move to implement a nationwide EBT system. We support \n     modifications to the Agriculture Committee bill to assure \n     that all EBT systems are compatible and available to the \n     smallest, local community stores. This will allow recipients \n     to retain the freedom to shop at stores of their choice \n     without overly restricting state flexibility. A uniform \n     delivery system is the best way to reduce cost and make this \n     important domestic feeding program even better and more \n     efficient. Current law also prohibits the government from \n     shifting EBT program cost to retailers who are licensed to \n     accept food stamps which would in effect eliminate many from \n     participating in the program. We would oppose any efforts to \n     eliminate that protection.\n       FMI pledges to work with you to achieve meaningful welfare \n     reform. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that \n     cashing out the food stamp program would be a disaster for \n     needy families and their communities all across America. This \n     is why we support the approach taken by the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee.\n       The Food Marketing Institute (FMI) is a nonprofit \n     association conducting programs in research, education, \n     industry relations and public affairs on behalf of its 1,500 \n     members including their subsidiaries--food retailers and \n     wholesalers and their customers in the United States and \n     around the world. FMI's domestic member companies operate \n     approximately 21,000 retail food stores with a combined \n     annual sales volume of $220 billion--more than half of all \n     grocery store sales in the United States. FMI's retail \n     membership is composed of large multi-store chains, small \n     regional firms and independent supermarkets. Its \n     international membership includes 200 members from 60 \n     countries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Tim Hammonds,\n     President and CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                            The Food Distributors Association,\n\n                                               September 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n         Forestry, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lugar: The National-American Wholesale \n     Grocers' Association and the International Foodservice \n     Distributors Association (NAWGA/IFDA) supports the reform of \n     our welfare system, including the significant reforms your \n     Committee has recommended for the Food Stamp Program. \n     However, we do not believe ``cashing-out'' the Food Stamp \n     Program falls under the rubric of reform. NAWGA/IFDA is an \n     international trade association comprised of food \n     distribution companies which primarily supply and service \n     independent grocers and foodservice operations throughout the \n     U.S. and Canada.\n       We understand that several amendments may be offered in the \n     coming days which would effectively cash-out the Food Stamp \n     Program. NAWGA/IFDA respectfully urges the rejection of these \n     amendments.\n       There is no conclusive evidence that cashing-out the Food \n     Stamp Program would improve the delivery of welfare benefits. \n     In fact, cash-out demonstration projects conducted by the \n     Department of Agriculture have shown a five to eighteen \n     percent decline in food expenditures. Although attractive \n     because of its administrative simplicity, we do not believe \n     that such a system could effectively serve food stamp \n     recipients.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Kevin Burke,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Government Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             National Cattlemen's Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Bill Emerson,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to convey the National \n     Cattlemen's Association's recent grassroots policy decisions \n     on Welfare Reform and specifically block granting federal \n     food-assistance funds (H.R. 4). The National Cattlemen's \n     Association, which is the national spokesperson for all \n     segments of the U.S. beef cattle industry representing \n     230,000 cattle producers throughout the country, supports \n     welfare reform by providing increased control to local \n     government. Cattle producers have long supported the \n     Commodity Distribution Program and other food assistance \n     programs, as a means of providing nutritious foods to those \n     in need in a cost effective manner. We believe it is time \n     however, to review these programs and make appropriate \n     changes to increase their efficiency and effectiveness.\n       In addition to overall themes of increasing state \n     flexibility balancing the budget, the National Cattlemen's \n     Association supports the following provisions in any welfare \n     reform legislation:\n       Money designated for food stamp recipients must be spent on \n     food only.\n       A commodity purchase group should continue within USDA to \n     assist states in increasing their volume purchasing power, \n     thus saving states money.\n       A means must be established to purchase non-price supported \n     commodities when an over-supply situation occurs.\n       Third party verification to assure contractual performance.\n       Adequate nutritional standards for school lunch programs.\n       The National Cattlemen's Association supports efforts to \n     control federal spending and decrease the size of the federal \n     government. We would very much like to work with you to make \n     these goals a reality. For further information, please \n     contact Beth Johnson or Chandler Keys in our Washington \n     office (202) 347-0228.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Sheri Spader,\n     Chairman, Food Policy Committee.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                National Peanut Council, Inc.,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, December 9, 1994.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: We write to urge you in the strongest \n     possible terms to oppose proposals, such as those included in \n     the Pension Responsibility Act (PRA), to replace current \n     federal food assistance programs with block grant funding. We \n     oppose both the concept of block grant funding and the \n     sharply reduced funding levels that have been proposed.\n       We oppose these proposals for the following reasons:\n       (1) The block grant approach fails to assure that federal \n     dollars will go for their intended purposes. Under the PRA, \n     large portions of federal funding for food assistance could \n     be provided in cash. Specifically, the PRA would allow \n     benefits previously provided as food stamp and WIC coupons to \n     instead be provided as cash. Thus, states would be free to \n     provide assistance that could be devoted to other non-food \n     needs. This approach could not only have a serious \n     deleterious effect on low-income children and families but \n     also could effect adversely the entire food and agriculture \n     economy. In addition, the block grant converts nutrition \n     programs from entitlements into discretionary programs \n     subject to annual appropriations. Thus, there is no guarantee \n     that any federal dollars will be available for food \n     assistance.\n       (2) The block grant approach is inherently insensitive to \n     the poor when their needs are greatest. There is no mechanism \n     in block grants to assure assistance will expand during a \n     recession or when need arises (such as a natural disaster). \n     At the very time that needs go up in one state and \n     potentially down in another, the funding will be inflexible \n     and thus inefficiently applied to those states.\n       (3) The PRA would likely end the school lunch program as we \n     know it. By proscribing assistance paid for meals served to \n     ``middle income'' children, the likely result of the PRA is \n     that millions of school children and thousands of schools \n     will abandon the current system that guarantees free and \n     reduced price meals to low-income children. Far smaller \n     cutbacks in this subsidy in 1981 resulted in a loss of about \n     2,000 schools and two million children (750,000 low-income) \n     from the program.\n       (4) The block grant approach removes from food assistance \n     any tie to nutritional standards. Once states are free to \n     design any program they want, there will be no assurance that \n     the federal dollars are being spent consistent with \n     fundamental standards on diet and health.\n       The block grant approach, especially with reduced funding \n     levels, will result in more children in this country going \n     hungry. Most of the programs affected are child nutrition \n     programs, and half of all the participants of the largest \n     nutrition program affected (food stamps) are children.\n       The resulting tremendous increase in need cannot be met by \n     private charities. These institutions have repeatedly \n     documented that they cannot meet the demand currently placed \n     upon them. Furthermore, we strenuously object to any policy \n     that could have the effect of an exponential increase in the \n     number of Americans who must feed their families through soup \n     kitchen and bread lines. This is no way for the greatest \n     nation in the world to care for its needy residents.\n       Finally, we suggest that a return to block grants ignores \n     the history of why federal food assistance programs were \n     established. The federal government stepped in because states \n     were either unable or unwilling to meet the needs of our \n     people.\n       The federal nutrition programs are an enormous success \n     story, built with bipartisan support from Congress over many \n     years. Study after study has documented the effectiveness of \n     the very programs that proposals like the PRA would turn back \n     to the states. These programs have been proven to enhance the \n     health and education of our children, some saving money in \n     the long run. They also can serve as effective organizing \n     tools for crime prevention.\n       Initial estimates indicate the PRA could reduce food \n     assistance funding by about ten percent ($4 to $5 billion a \n     year) from the projected $40 billion FY 1996 food assistance \n     funding level. Even this inadequate level would not be \n     guaranteed since each year's funding would be subject to \n     appropriations. There may be a need for the federal \n     government to save money, but not feeding hungry \n\n[[Page S 13340]]\n     children and their families is a poor place to start.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Dr. A. Wayne Lord,\n\n                                 National Peanut Council Chairman,\n                                              Southco Commodities.\n                           Amendment No. 2562\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe Ashcroft amendment on food stamps.\n  For the second straight day we are being asked to launch an attack on \nthe Food Stamp Program. Once again I want to restate that Democrats \nsupport real reform of food stamps, not an effort to take food away \nfrom people. This amendment block-grants food stamps and in the process \ndenies a safety net for kids. Once we turn this program into a block \ngrant we end our commitment to feed all those children who fall victim \nto the next recession.\n  I am serious about reforming this program. I am pleased that Maryland \nhas lead the country in introducing ways to cut down on fraud by going \nto an electronic system. Democrats have included reform of food stamps \nin our welfare reform bill. We included increased civil and criminal \nforfeiture for grocers who violate the Food Stamp Act. We tell stores \nthat they must reapply for the Food Stamp Program so that we make sure \nthat fraud is not happening. Retailers who have already been \ndisqualified from the WIC Program are disqualified from food stamps. We \nencourage States to enact their own reforms including the use of an \nelectronic card and a picture ID. Democrats don't stop there. We are \nwilling to require able-bodied people to work.\n  Mr. President, the fight here is over food, not fraud. This amendment \nwould take the current system and throw it out. After we eliminate the \ncurrent system we then turn it over to State governments. There are no \nguarantees in this amendment that States will not create their own \nbureaucratic wasteland. No guarantees that money going for food won't \nbe diverted to nonnutrition needs. If we block-grant food stamps, what \nguarantees U.S. taxpayers that the dollars going for food stamps won't \nbe converted to fund other programs in the next recession? What \nguarantees do we have that these nutrition funds won't become a bailout \nfund for some politically vulnerable Governor?\n  Mr. President, I repeat, I am for welfare reform--all Democrats are. \nThat is why we worked hard at a real reform bill. That bill includes \nreforms to the Food Stamp Program. This amendment replaces reform with \nregression. Regression back to a time when we did not commit our Nation \nto a goal of feeding hungry people. It is time we focused our attention \nback on reform. We can do that by voting down this amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I \nask once again for clarification of how much time remains to the two \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 5 minutes; the \nSenator from Missouri has 8 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be deducted equally from both \nsides.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield myself as much time as I may require for a \nconcluding statement. I see no other Senators wishing to speak on this \nsubject on our side.\n  Mr. President, let me just state the case for retaining the welfare \nbill in front of us, the leadership bill, which permits block granting \nto States but does not demand it.\n  First of all, the mandatory block grant would subject poor children, \nfamilies, and elderly people to serious risks during economic \ndownturns.\n  Second, the formula for distributing funds would be inequitable and \nwould penalize large numbers of States, especially those with expanding \npopulation.\n  Third, the Agriculture Committee, which I chair, would have to make \ndeeper cuts in farm programs or the school lunch or other child \nnutrition programs because the amounts in the Ashcroft amendment are \nnot as great a cut as the ones that we have already made. There is a \ndiscrepancy of over $3 billion as we calculate it.\n  Fourth, the amendment would likely lead to sharp reductions in food \npurchases and nutritional well-being and would injure the food and \nagricultural sectors of our economy.\n  Fifth, the bill denies food stamps to indigent, elderly, and disabled \npeople who do not meet the work requirements.\n  Sixth, the amendment allows States to withdraw all State funds used \nto administer the Food Stamp Program and substitute Federal funds for \nthem.\n  Seventh, the amendment would widen disparity among States and \nintensify a race to the bottom.\n  Eighth, Mr. President, it would weaken the safety net for children \nthroughout the country.\n  And, finally, the amendment could increase fraud even though the \ndesire, obviously, of the proponents is to limit fraud. There is no \nguarantee that States, starting from scratch in a complex program, \nwould enjoy a situation of a greater fight against fraud than we \nexperience in the Federal Government. Really, I think the evidence is \nto the contrary.\n  Mr. President, for all of these reasons, plus the obvious one, and \nthat is a safety net of nutrition for Americans is vital and it should \nnot be cast away in this amendment, I call for the defeat of the \nAshcroft amendment and the retention of the safety net that we have \ncurrently.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I inquire of the Chair the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 7 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Indiana has 1 minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to ask the Members of this body to vote \nin favor of endowing the States with the opportunity to substantially \nreform the welfare system, the single largest component of the welfare \nsystem, which touches almost 1 in every 10 Americans, and to do so by \nproviding the resources to the States so that their legislatures and \ntheir Governors can make the resources available to truly needy \nindividuals in a way that is far more efficient, is far less likely to \nconsume additional resources. This is an idea which is welcomed by the \nStates. Let me read from Governor Thompson's letter sent to my office.\n\n       Senator Ashcroft's amendment allows the maximum level of \n     state flexibility while preserving the anticipated level of \n     federal financial support envisioned in the leadership bill. \n     In addition, the transferability of funds from the food stamp \n     block grant to the AFDC block grant, which is common, is of \n     critical importance to States like Wisconsin.\n\n  Wisconsin, as you know, has been a leading State in welfare reform. \nOne of the reasons it is important that we have the kind of \ntransferability and that we put AFDC and food stamps both into block \ngrants is that, if you leave one Federal program as an entitlement \nwithout any limit as to the spending involved and you put another \nFederal program into a block grant, States can shift people from one \narea to another, pushing people into one area and elevating the Federal \nresponsibility in order to curtail the responsibility of the State.\n  This would distort the allocation of resources. It simply would not \nbe appropriate. We need to have the discipline and the management tools \nnecessary for these programs to be administered appropriately and \nhonestly. You could understand that if the AFDC Program, which is a \nshared program between the State and the Federal Government were to be \nblock granted, and you maintained an entitlement in food stamps, that \nit would lead States to shift people from the limited area of State \nassistance to the unlimited area of the entitlement.\n  The distinguished Senator from Indiana has indicated that they hope \nto have savings of a substantial amount as a result of reforms that \nhave been added to the program. Of course, we have seen these reforms \nyear after year and time after time. We had major food stamp \nlegislation in 1981 and then in 1988 and several times it has been \nadjusted in this decade. We have also seen what the chart shows: That \nfood stamp consumption goes up and up.\n  It is anticipated that food stamps will rise. Under the Dole bill, \nfood stamp consumption is supposed to go up. SSI is supposed to go up. \nIt is anticipated that AFDC will remain low. \n\n[[Page S 13341]]\nSurprise, surprise. The Dole bill, the leadership bill, provides that \nAFDC would be a block grant where the incentives would exist to keep \nthe program down. And the anticipated rises here, frankly, by CBO are \nnot rises that project any cost shifting, sending people from this \ncategory into these categories. That is not the reason for the rise, \nthat is just another projection.\n  But if we make this a block grant program and it is limited and we \nsay that these continue to be unlimited in entitlement programs, the \nnatural tendency will be for States to start shifting clients from this \nclient base over into these categories. As I suggested, these \ncategories are likely to be increasing even further.\n  I believe that the people of this country have called upon us to \nreform welfare. To ignore the largest single welfare program in terms \nof people that it touches in this country and to say that it is off the \ntable, and to call it some kind of a safety net, and to say we cannot \ntrust local officials or State officials to be compassionate in the \nadministration of these funds, and to say that we prefer the Federal \nbureaucracy, and that somehow there is greater compassion in this body \nand the Congress than there would be at State capitals, I think is to \nmiss the point. The point should be that we should be focused on \nreforming the welfare system. We will not get great reform if we say to \nStates, ``Well, you can opt into a block grant but, on the other hand, \nif you do not opt into a block grant, we will let you continue in an \nentitlement program.'' ``In an entitlement program'' means you can \ncontinue to get money for all the people you can possibly find to \nqualify.\n  The incentives for cost reduction in that environment, the incentives \nfor caseload are substantially lower than they would be in the setting \nof a block grant.\n  Not only would the incentives be substantially lower, but compliance \ncosts, for complying with these 900 pages of regulations, still exist. \nYou still find yourself in a system with about 24 percent friction in \nthe system--the fraud, the abuse, the high administrative costs. It has \nbeen estimated that perhaps the leadership bill would take 90 pages out \nof the 900 pages of regulations. Some suggestion has been made, well, \nthe States would not know how to come up to speed on this. After all, \nthey could not do this in a couple weeks, they could not make this \ntransition.\n  The truth of the matter is that States have had to administer this \nprogram covered over with the redtape of the Federal bureaucracy for \nyears for the last quarter century. They know this program better than \nthe Federal officials do. There are not that many food stamp employees \nin the country that are not State and local governmental employees, but \nthey know what they are working under and they know how it is burdening \nthe system and they know the additional costs. It is that additional \ncost that has caused them to say, if we could have this program as a \nblock grant, we could serve people far more carefully and far better.\n  So I believe that our responsibility is a responsibility to really \nreform welfare. Our responsibility is a responsibility to avoid cost \nshifting. Our responsibility is a responsibility to recognize that we \nhave been working with a failed system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator his time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I urge the Members of this body to include, in real \nreform for welfare, reform of the biggest of the welfare programs, the \nFood Stamp Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would like a \nmoment to consult with the Senator from New York. Therefore, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded. \n\n[[Page S 13342]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \nwhich I now would like to have a vote on and discussion.\n  Essentially, this is the bottom-line child-protection amendment. It \nestablishes a requirement that there be a voucher program for children, \nminor children, whose families would otherwise be eligible for \nassistance except for the time limit or other penalties, and where the \nparent has not complied with whatever the State rules are, the payment \nfor that child's assistance could be made if necessary to a third \nparty.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take a good look at this \namendment and to support it because, quite frankly, this amendment is \none that can be supported by those who favor block grants and by those \nwho oppose block grants. It also warrants support by those who favor \nState flexibility and by those who oppose State flexibility. This \namendment speaks to maintaining a safety net for poor children.\n  This amendment essentially provides a floor below which no child in \nthis United States will fall. Essentially, what it says is that \nchildren will not be penalized for the behavior of their parents. We \nhave already had a lot of discussion in this forum about welfare \nreform, and the extent to which it affects the children. Quite frankly, \nthe numbers make it very clear that out of the 14 million people in the \nUnited States who are currently receiving AFDC, 9 million of those \npeople are children.\n  So essentially, if we penalize the majority, the children, for the \nbehavior of their parents, I think we will have committed a great harm. \nIt seems to me that our efforts to reform the welfare system should at \na minimum do no harm to the children.\n  Mr. President, the United States, our country, has a child poverty \nrate of some 22 percent. That is one in five children who is poor. Our \nchild poverty rate exceeds those of all the other industrialized \nnations. As we address the whole issue of poverty in the United States, \nand particularly child poverty, it seems to me that we ought to provide \na minimum below which no child will fall, a minimum safety net that \nstill allows the States to construct their own rules and requirements. \nA State can set up whatever kind of plan it wants to, at least within \nthe parameters of the underlying legislation. A State will have the \nflexibility through the block grants to do as they will in terms of \ntime limits, in terms of other requirements. But at a minimum, I think \nwe should have consensus in this body that children caught in that \nsituation will not be penalized for the failure of their parent to \ncomply with the rule, whatever that State rule is, pertaining to \nwelfare.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would ensure at a very minimum that \nevery State will provide essential support through a voucher for poor \nchildren whose parents and families no longer qualify for assistance. \nThe amendment would allow the use of block grant funds for this \npurpose. So in that regard, it will allow for the maintenance of the \nflexibility that is in the underlying legislation again for the \nprotection of children.\n  Mr. President, I ask for my colleagues' support of this legislation. \nI am prepared of course to entertain any questions regarding this.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, I would like to point to the notion \nthat, with regard to the underlying legislation, there is a 5-year time \nlimitation in terms of public assistance. It is unlikely, quite \nfrankly, but there is the possibility--hopefully, it will not happen \nall that often, but there is at least a prospect--that we will have 6-\nyear-old children walking around with no subsistence, with no support, \nwith no help at all.\n  If, indeed, their parents fail to comply with the time limit in this \nbill or any other limitation that may be proposed by this legislation \nor the State in developing their plan, again I think we have to be \nmindful and cognizant of the fact that as Americans we have an \nobligation to all the children and that we would want to ensure that, \nat a minimum, there be an opportunity for those children who are left \nout to be fed, to be housed, and to receive adequate care.\n  The child-voucher approach will allow payment to a third party for \nessential services provided to minor children.\n  Mr. President, that, in substance, is the child-voucher amendment. I \nhave on previous occasions discussed this issue in depth, regarding the \noperation of the welfare program with regard to children and the \noperation of the underlying legislation.\n  There is little question but that there ought to be some minimal \nstandard. I believe the child-voucher amendment allows that, and so \nagain I would entertain any questions about this legislation and ask \nfor its favorable consideration.\n  I would also point out, Mr. President, this amendment has been \nanalyzed and the CBO analysis is, ``The amendment would not alter block \ngrant levels and therefore would have no direct impact on Federal \nspending.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I inquire about how the time is being \ndivided at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 48 minutes and \n10 seconds remaining, and the opposition has 58 minutes and 52 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the sake of time being treated fairly, \nif we do go back into a quorum, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbe equally divided on both sides.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I think I am going to object to that.\n  I would say to my colleague, I am prepared to talk about this \nfurther.\n  Mr. LOTT. Fine.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. My own view was that I thought the opposition, if \nthere is opposition--I hope there will not be opposition; it seems to \nme on this amendment we should reach consensus about it. But in the \nevent there is opposition, I hope that the opposition would express \nitself in this period and would actually engage in dialogue about the \nimportance of having again this child-voucher approach or some bottom-\nline protection for children. It seems to me to be an important enough \nsubject to talk about it as opposed to just going into a quorum call.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Illinois \nwill yield, that would be fine, if the Senator is prepared to speak \nfurther. And I am sure we will have some comment in opposition or some \nfurther discussion. But I just did not want us to be in quorum call \nwith the time being counted just against this side. If the Senator \nwould like to speak, that will resolve the problem, and then I am sure \nwe will begin to ask questions and have dialogue.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. All right, I will continue then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, a lot of what I have to say about this particular \namendment is in reiteration of what I said the other day. And, again, I \nwould call my colleagues' attention to the significance of having a \nbottom-line protection for children. If anything, this amendment says \nthat we will do no harm by the children; that in order to get the \nconduct of the 4.6 million adults who are receiving public assistance, \nwe will not hurt the 9 million children who may be caught up and not \nunderstand all the rules.\n  The children are not responsible for their parents not going to work. \nThe children are not responsible for their parents not complying with \nthe family cap. The children are not responsible for their parents not \nabiding by the rules. The children have no way of fighting back or even \nchallenging a State's decision to construct a program in one way or the \nother.\n  In light of the fact that what we are doing with this reform effort \nis setting up 50 different assistance systems--that is essentially what \nis going on--by devolving from the national program \n\n[[Page S 13343]]\nunder the Social Security Act for public assistance, we are allowing \nthe States to craft their own programs, and so a child living in one \nState or another may well wind up really the victim, if you will, of an \naccident of geography.\n  It seems to me that at a minimum we ought to be able to say, as part \nof our national commitment as Americans, we are not going to allow a \nchild to go homeless; we are not going to allow a child to go hungry; \nwe are not going to allow a child in any State to be subject to the \nvicissitudes of misfortune, or, alternatively, to an accident of \ngeography, and that we will provide a minimal safety net under which \nchildren can be cared for.\n  This issue is actually one of the more troubling aspects of this \nwhole debate--the question of what about the children, what do we do \nabout the children in the final analysis.\n  Earlier in the debate about welfare reform, the question was raised \nby some: Well, what happens if the parents do not comply with the \nrules? Then what do you do with the children? The suggestion was even \nmade by some that you put them in orphanages.\n  We do not yet have the orphanages. We do not yet have any \nalternatives for these babies who may well be left homeless and hungry, \nwith no subsistence at all if their parents get cut off of welfare.\n  I raised the issue with my colleagues the other day about the notion \nthat while it is being touted as a new approach to public assistance, \nreally this is an old approach; what we are doing here has happened \nbefore in this country.\n  I put into the Record this article from the Chicago History magazine \ncalled ``Friendless Foundlings and Homeless Half Orphans,'' and it \ntalked about the situation in our country before we had a national \nsafety net for children, what happened there.\n  What we found was that, depending on the State of residence, \ndepending on where the child lived, the different States responded to \nthe issue of dependent children in different ways. And, in many \ninstances, the children were left to their own devices--sleeping in the \nstreets, in some instances, a parent--and that is where the term \n``homeless half orphan,'' which I never heard before I read this \narticle, came from. The women in some instances could not support them \nand would take to the doors of a church or orphanage and just leave \nthem there for the winter so as to provide their babies with some way \nto live when times were really hard.\n  I do not think we want to go back to that in this country. As a \nmatter of fact, I am certain of it. And I do not sense frankly that \neven the architects of this bill want to go move this country backward. \nThe architects of this legislation, however, have often said, well, we \nare just going to take our chances because the States are going to do \nno harm to the children. States will not leave the children homeless \nand hungry, and the States will not make decisions, the Governors will \nnot make decisions that will hurt the children any more than we in the \nSenate would want to hurt the children.\n  And I am prepared reluctantly to take the gamble that we all will \ntake with the passage of this legislation, that that is the case. But I \nhave to raise the question whether or not, as a national community, we \nare willing to take that gamble on the backs of the children, whether \nor not we are willing to take that gamble without regard at all to any \nprotection for them, any bottom line for them.\n  Would it not be in our own interests as a national community, all of \nus, because we are all residents of various States, residents of the \nState that sent us here in the first instance, we are residents of \nlocal governments as well, but would not it make sense for us to have \nsome bottom level below which no child--no child--will be jeopardized? \nThat is the only question. Are we prepared to take a loser-risk-all \nkind of gamble, or are we willing to say with regard to the basics of \nsubsistence issues for children--food, clothing, care, shelter--with \nregard to health, with regard to those very basic things, we are going \nto provide some level of support?\n  That is what this child voucher amendment does. It says to the \nStates, you are free to do what you want to do in terms of constructing \nthe parameters and the operation and the system for your program. You \nare absolutely free to do that. But at a minimum, you have got to \nprovide that if a child winds up with nothing because that child's \nparent does not comply with the rules or does not fit into the program, \nthat that child in the final analysis will be entitled to a voucher, \nthe voucher is not for any adults, it is for that child, that 6-year-\nold, that 7-year-old, that 4-year-old even, that that child will be \nentitled to a voucher. Vouchers would go to a third party and it might \nwell be an orphanage or might be somebody in the community or it might \nbe some other system that the State establishes. We are not telling the \nStates how to do this.\n  We are just telling them that there has to be this bottom-line \nprotection and that they have an obligation to try to work out some \nsystem so that children will not fall below the level of care and \nsubsistence that as a national community we believe is appropriate. We \ndo not want to get to the point--and I do have the picture; I do not \nknow if it is still here--that was demonstrated graphically in the \narticle that talked about what we had in this country before we had a \nnational safety net, a national commitment to safety for the children. \nWe do not want to wind up with children sleeping in the streets and \nfending for themselves. This is actually a picture. This picture is not \nmade up. And this is in the United States of America, let me point out. \nThis is not some foreign country, although we do, frankly, have \npictures of foreign countries that do not have a child safety net and \nthe situation of their children is dire in 1995. But this particular \npicture here which I would call the Chair's attention to, this is a \nfascinating article.\n  And if the Chair gets an opportunity, because I know, Mr. President, \nthat you have a great interest in this subject, this article was \nwritten regarding turn-of-the-century America and the situation \nregarding child welfare in this country. This picture here was taken in \nIllinois, I say, in my own State, circa 1889. This is 1889.\n       Until the reform efforts of the late 19th century, the \n     public largely ignored the plight of destitute children. \n     Barefoot children wandering about the streets, boys selling \n     newspapers, and ``street arabs'' sleeping on top of each \n     other for warmth, were among the realities that forced \n     charities to undertake measures to protect orphaned and \n     abandoned children.\n\n  Again, I cannot imagine anybody in this Chamber wanting to go back to \nthis type of child poverty. I do not think anybody wants to get to this \nagain. But the only way we can keep this from happening this happening \nin this country is to provide for a basic safety net. And that is \nexactly what the child voucher amendment does.\n  Mr. President, one of the other issues in terms of the analysis of S. \n1120, the underlying legislation, that I thought ought to command and \ncompel our attention are the issues of the number of children that \nmight be kicked off, if you will, because their families did not comply \nwith the rules, either the time limit or the family cap or whatever.\n  The estimates are that if the bill--I will quote--if the bill were \nfully implemented, the States would not be able to use Federal funds to \nsupport some 3.9 million children because those children are in \nfamilies that have received AFDC for longer than 5 years. This analysis \ntakes into account that 15 percent of the entire caseload will be \nexempt from the 5-year limit. If the States were to impose a 24-month \ntime limit instead of a 60-month time limit, 9 million children would \nbe denied assistance.\n  Now, Mr. President, those are not my numbers. Those are the numbers \nfrom HHS. And I think those are numbers that all of the authors of S. \n1120, the authors of this plan, recognize to be true. This is not made \nup. And so the question becomes for all of us--do we really want to \ntake the chance that some 3.9 million children will be left to be \nstreet urchins and left to their own devices because of the time limit \noperation in the bill? Or more to the point, if we change the time \nlimit and impose some other requirements--or worse yet, the States \ncould impose a time after 24 months--if that were to happen, as many as \n9 million children would be denied assistance altogether? I, for one, \ndo not believe that is a chance that any of the Members of this body \nwant to take. \n\n[[Page S 13344]]\n\n  Certainly we have some philosophical disagreements about this \nlegislation. There are disagreements about the many constituent parts \nof it. But on this, Mr. President, I believe there can be no \ndisagreement that the children are deserving of our absolute \ncommitment, and the children are deserving of some protection, and, in \npassing this legislation, we will provide a minimal level of \nprotection. And I have proposed that the way we do that is to state for \nthe record that the States should be required to establish a child \nvoucher program so that those children would be eligible for assistance \nsuch as food, care, and shelter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I would like to say that this amendment, which is similar in \nnature to what Senator Daschle had offered in his substitute, really \ndoes violate the whole principle of ending welfare as we know it. What \nthis amendment does is continue the entitlement to welfare benefits \nalbeit in a different form. It is not cash, it is vouchers, still an \nentitlement, Federal dollars to families on welfare in perpetuity. \nThere is no time limit. So this will, in effect, end the time limit.\n  Now, if we are serious--I would say that the President when he \noffered his bill a year ago in June, although he had some loopholes, he \ndid have a time limit. And he did, after 5 years, under some \ncircumstances, not many, unfortunately, but some circumstances actually \nend welfare in the sense that the cash assistance, voucher--no further \nentitlement under AFDC would be continued. And to suggest that if we \nprovide in an entitlement just for children and not for the mother that \nsomehow the children are going to get this money and the mother or \nfather, whoever the custodial parent, is not going to get this--I do \nnot know many 3-years-olds who fend for themselves. The money is going \nto go to the parents and it is going to be a support.\n  Now, I would say, under the Dole modified bill, we do continue to \nsupport that family with Medicaid, with food stamps, with housing if \nthe family qualified for housing. About 25 percent of families on AFDC \nqualify for Federal housing assistance, whether it is section 8 or \npublic housing. So all of those benefits continue. And all we are doing \nis saying, after 5 years, after we have given you intensive training \nunder this bill--we believe there will be intensive worker training or \nretraining if necessary, 3 years of work opportunity--at some point the \nFederal contract with the family who is in need ends. And what we are \ngoing to say is we will continue to provide food and medical care and \nother things if you chose not to go to work.\n  But at some point we are going to say we are not going to continue to \nprovide assistance in the form of cash, or in the case of the Senator \nfrom Illinois's amendment, a voucher, which is the equivalent of cash \nto provide for other services that cash would be used for.\n  So to me this is just a backdoor attempt to continue the welfare \nentitlement in perpetuity. And if you understand the whole motivation, \nthe reason the President in such dramatic fashion in 1992 stood \nsquarely behind the idea of ending welfare as we know it, that whole \nconcept of ending welfare as we know it was based on a time limit,\n a 5-year time limit on welfare. You cannot end welfare if you continue \nwelfare, and this continues welfare. If we adopt this amendment, anyone \nwho stands here and says, ``We are ending welfare as we know it'' is \nnot telling the truth, because you continue the entitlement. It is very \nimportant that this amendment, although I understand and respect the \nSenator from Illinois and her desire to protect children, I suggest \nthat you can go to cities across this country and find pictures of \nchildren in, unfortunately, the same situation today. Usually, they may \nnot even be out on the street, because in many of these neighborhoods, \nthey certainly would not be safe out on the street because of the \nviolence and the degradation that we have seen in the communities that \nthey live in.\n\n  We go back to the whole point that we are here today, and the whole \npoint we are here today is the current system is failing the very \nchildren it is attempting to help. To suggest we are going to help \nchildren by continuing dependency, by continuing the welfare system, in \na sense, with this entitlement stretching on in perpetuity, I think, \njust belies the fact that the system is failing.\n  I appreciate her concern for children, and I think everyone here who \nstands behind the Dole bill has that same concern for children. We \nhonestly believe, and I think rightfully believe, that ending the \nentitlement to welfare, requiring work, moving people off a system \nwhich says, ``We are going to maintain you in poverty,'' to a system \nthat says, ``We are going to move you out of poverty,'' that is a \ndynamic, time-certain system, is the way to really change the dynamics \nfor the poor in America today and for the children in America today.\n  It is a philosophical difference. Many times I go back home and I \nhave town meetings. People at my town meetings say, ``Why don't you \nfolks just work it out? You are always playing politics down here. Why \ndon't you folks come together?\"\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, we did come together on one of \nher amendments. She was to offer three. One of the amendments we \naccepted. We accepted her amendment on a demonstration project, called \nJOLI, $25 million. We understand that that system is experiencing some \nsuccess, so we agreed to accept one of her three amendments.\n  The other two we have very different policy differences. This is not \npolitics. They are fundamental differences of opinion as to whether \nwelfare is working with a system of endless entitlement, or whether we \nneed, as the President has stated, to put some certainty of time, some \ncommitment to the individual that welfare will be there to help for a \ndiscrete period of time to intensively try to turn someone's life \naround with the expectation and requirement that at some point you will \nmove off and the social contract between the Government, whether it is \nthe State or whether the State, hopefully under the Ashcroft provision \nof the Dole amendment, moves it to the private sector and has a private \nentity more involved in provision of welfare, whatever the case may be, \nwe believe that that dynamic process is so possible under this \namendment, that is so different than what we have seen in the past, \nthat I am hopeful that we can defeat this amendment, keep that time-\nlimit provision in place and move forward with this bill.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. He is correct, the job training demonstration \namendment has been accepted, and I am delighted to have been able to \nwork with him in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Second, I say to him that this is not a back door around the time \nlimit. If anything--and I want to make this point because I think it is \nvery important to our colleagues' analysis of the child voucher \namendment--if anything, this amendment is no more and no less than an \ninsurance policy for the children.\n  We know there is going to be a time limit. That is written in the \nlegislation. We know there are going to be work requirements. There may \nwell be a family cap. We know all these things are happening, but there \nare so many uncertainties in this legislation, not the least of which \nis whether or not the parents will be able to find jobs after 5 years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that only 10 to 15 States \ncould potentially meet the fiscal year 2000 work participation \nrequirements in this legislation. They go on to say that because the \nbill provides States with significant flexibility to set policies that \nmay affect caseloads, the estimate contains a high degree of \nuncertainty.\n  To the extent that there is uncertainty here, are we really prepared \nto say we are going to make 6-, 7-, and 8-year-olds pay for any failure \nof our analysis? Are we going to make them pay for the sins of their \nparents? Are we going to make them pay for our failure to adequately \nput together a system that addresses the issues that go to poverty?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, when he starts talking about this \n\n[[Page S 13345]]\n  issue, starts talking about crime and violence in the communities. \nThere are a lot of issues involved in this whole question of welfare. \nBut I say to my colleagues once again, welfare does not stand alone in \na vacuum. It is only a response to a larger issue, which is poverty, \nchild poverty.\n  Our Nation has tried different approaches to the issue of dealing \nwith child poverty and destitute children, and now we are about to try \nanother one. We are about to try the ``ending of welfare as we know \nit.'' Well, Mr. President, it is just like anything else. We all know, \nfor example, that we are going to die, but most of us have the sense to \ngo ahead and get an insurance policy anyway.\n  The fact of the matter is that this is going to change. Will we have \nan insurance policy for children? I submit that we should. I hope that \nmy colleagues will agree with me, and I urge your support for the child \nvoucher amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, before I do, Senator Lieberman has requested to be \nadded as a cosponsor on the child voucher amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent that he be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Also, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Murray and Mikulski be added as cosponsors to the child \nvoucher amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. And I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nchild voucher amendment.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I understand we will stack the \nvotes on these amendments; therefore, I want to move on to the second \namendment in this series and get that resolved as well.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13333-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            THE WAR ON DRUGS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier today, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services released the results of its 1994 National Household \nSurvey on Drug Abuse. According to the survey, marijuana use among \nteenagers has nearly doubled since 1992, after 13 straight years of \ndecline.\n  This troubling fact confirms what we already know: Today, our \nchildren are smoking more dope, smoking and snorting more cocaine, and \nsmoking and shooting up more heroin than at any time in recent memory.\n  Unfortunately, while drug use has gone up during the past 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, the Clinton administration has sat on the sidelines, \ntransforming the war on drugs into a full-scale retreat.\n  The President has abandoned the moral bully pulpit, cut the staff at \nthe drug Czar's office by nearly 80 percent, and appointed a surgeon \ngeneral who believes the best way to fight illegal drugs is to legalize \nthem. He has presided over an administration that has de-emphasized the \ninterdiction effort, allowed the number of Federal drug prosecutions to \ndecline, and overseen a source-country effort that the General \nAccounting Office describes as badly managed and poorly coordinated.\n  Mr. President, illegal drug use declined throughout the 1980's and \nearly 1990's, so we know how to turn this dangerous problem around. It \nmeans sending a clear and unmistakable cultural message that drug use \nis wrong, stupid, and life-threatening. It means beefing up our \ninterdiction and drug enforcement efforts. It means strengthening our \nwork in the source countries by making clear that good relations with \nthe United States require serious efforts to stop drug exports.\n  And, yes, it means leadership at the top, starting with the President \nof the United States.\n  Today's survey is yet another warning for America. We must renew our \ncommitment to the war on drugs, with or without President Clinton as an \nally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13345-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13345-S13356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2472\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This, again, \nis separate and distinct from that. If anything, the child voucher \namendment really is the most important in terms of the children.\n  This next amendment goes to the adults. What do we do about the \nparents? In that regard, as we know the underlying legislation calls \nfor States to provide work experience, assistance in finding employment \nand other work preparation activities, section 402(A)(2) of the bill.\n  One of the uncertainties in the legislation, uncertainties that CBO \nspoke to, that many of the speakers on this issue have noted, is that \nthe States have not yet geared up to do this. Only a few will be ready \nto move forward.\n  We have the example of Wisconsin. I understand in a couple of \ncounties there they have already moved to a work assistance kind of \nprogram, an initiative. Other States have tried it. Under the Family \nSupport Act, those kinds of work-training experiments and initiatives \nare encouraged.\n  The point is that a lot of States have not yet moved to that. The \nquestion is whether or not the States will actually do so, whether they \nwill actually move to employment training, work preparation, work \nexperience, assistance in finding employment for individuals. Again, \nthe CBO estimates that there is not enough funding in the bill to do \nthat.\n  This legislation says that the State should not just kick somebody \noff of assistance--this is as to the adults, not the children, as to \nthe adults--the States should not kick the adults off unless they have \nprovided work assistance.\n  Now, HHS has estimated that under the leadership plan, some 2.9 \nmillion people would be required to participate in a work plan under \nthe plan. That is fine. The point is that in terms of the number of \ndollars to meet that participation rate there is not enough, it is also \nestimated we need 161 percent more dollars than presently provided in \nthe legislation.\n  Clearly, there is a dissonance, a gap in the interesting goal and our \nintent to provide work and job training assistance and our dollars that \nwill flow to do so. We do not know how that will come out. It creates a \ngreat uncertainty.\n  It seems to me that, again, as a bottom line--as to the adults--we \nought to make it clear that States should not just kick people off \nwithout providing them with some assistance.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a good look at this. Again, we have \nthe numbers from CBO regarding whether or not their respective States \nwill be able to meet the work requirements and not have a penalty. Most \nof the States will not. It is estimated only 10 to 15 States already \nare geared up sufficiently to provide the kind of work assistance that \nthe bill, the underlying legislation, calls for.\n  All this amendment says is that States must provide those services in \nterms of job assistance and the like if they are going to cut people \noff at a time certain, whether it is 5 years, 2 years, 1 year, 6 \nmonths, or whatever the time limit is.\n  Again, this State responsibility amendment, if anything, goes to \nproviding the parents with some comfort level that in the event there \nare no jobs in their area, in the event the State has not been able to \nget them into some kind of gainful employment, that they will not \nthereby lose their ability to feed themselves and to provide for their \nchildren.\n  I point out, Mr. President, also that this amendment only requires \nthat the States deliver the services to those recipients that the State \ndecides need to have those services. That is not to say they have to \nprovide everybody with \n\n[[Page S 13346]]\njob training. The State can make decisions as to who has to go into job \ntraining or receive education.\n  We are not fooling with States' flexibility with this amendment. What \nwe are saying in those instances, and there are instances where either \nthere are no jobs or the State has not been able to figure out a way to \nget people transported to where the jobs are located, or, \nalternatively, the individual has been trained for a job but the job \ndoes not exist any longer, in the event that happens, they will not be \ndenied assistance.\n  I think Mr. President, given the fact we have huge dissonances in our \neconomy, again, this is a response to poverty this amendment is needed. \nIt is not the answer to it but it is a start.\n  The answer to poverty, which is where the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand I are most in agreement, the answer to resolving poverty is to look \nat the underlying economic issues and to create an environment in which \njobs get created, that people can go to and earn a sufficient living to \nsupport their families. That ought to be our objective, and I think \nthat will be our objective as we take up these issues.\n  As we talk about what is our interim response to poverty, if welfare \nis that response, we ought to make certain that we do not wind up just \nthrowing people over the edge of the Earth because we have failed to \nactually address the fundamental issue of economic dislocations.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if you were in committee--I know the \nSenator from Pennsylvania was there--the other day when we were talking \nabout this. In my own State, there are areas of my State where there is \n1 percent private employment. One percent private employment.\n  Mr. President, that is not a recession or depression. That is \neconomic meltdown. If an individual lives in an area where there is 1 \npercent private employment, then the question becomes where, pray tell, \nare they going to work?\n  This chart shows areas of high unemployment in the city of Chicago \nspecifically, but I was in southern Illinois just this weekend and the \nsingle biggest complaint and cry I heard there was about the huge \nunemployment and dislocations caused by closing of the coal mines. We \nhad not gotten to the point of economic development there, to provide \npeople with alternatives to working in the mines. In areas of the city \nof Chicago, there is a community with 72.3 percent poverty rate. \nUnemployment is 43.4 percent. Given the way we count unemployment \nnumbers, that is only counting the people that have been in the job \nsearch for the last 6 months, so a lot of the people in this category \nhave given up looking, so the numbers are even higher.\n  These numbers, Mr. President, again, these numbers in certain \nsegments are even higher. Again, I point to what I thought was the most \nstunning, stunning example, and that was the area that had 1 percent \nprivate employment.\n  Until we figure out how to get capital into those communities, until \nwe figure out how to get jobs created in those communities, we will \nhave to do something. I dare say the States will have to come up with \ntransportation initiatives to move people out of their neighborhoods to \nneighborhoods where the jobs are or figure out some public service; \nthey will have to work through these plans.\n  That is the whole import of this devolution of welfare, sending it to \nthe States, is tell them, ``You go figure this out.''\n  As we do that, the question becomes, what about these individuals \nthat get caught up and for whom there are no options? I dare say, Mr. \nPresident, we have an obligation to see to it that these individuals--\nand, again, every State has them, I have numbers even for the Presiding \nOfficer's State--but as we go through this experiment, I do not think \nwe have the luxury of being generous with the suffering of others, and \nthat we want to really, really put ourselves in a position where people \nwho want to work but cannot find work wind up with absolutely nothing \nand with no help from their State in helping them to do better and to \ndo for themselves and to provide for themselves and their families.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the second \nState responsibility amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois knows how much I \nappreciate her efforts and how much she tries to do good here on the \nfloor. Certainly, what she is talking about here is something that is \nvery alluring and very tempting, if you do not care where the moneys \nare coming from, if you do not really care about trying to reach a \nposition whereby we live within our means.\n  Under the Moseley-Braun amendment that is currently being debated, it \nprohibits the States from imposing a time limit if the States fail to \nprovide job-related services, that is work experience, work preparation \nactivities. So, if the State fails to do that, then the State cannot \nimpose a time limit on how long a person has to get to work.\n  The things that can be said for this amendment, it seems to me, are \nthat a State should not be able to cut recipients off without providing \nthem training to become self-sufficient. And the second point would be \nthe States will not be willing to spend money on recipients that need \nextensive services. At least that is the argument.\n  But when you look at the other side of the argument, that is, when \nyou have to stop and think is this the right thing to do if we want to \nget spending under control, if we want to have a true welfare reform, \nif we want everybody on a equal level, if we want a level playing field \nand everybody understands the rules and lives within them, then you \nhave to look at the fact that this, some believe, and I am one of them, \nis a back-door attempt at continuing the entitlement.\n  Let us be honest about it. Entitlement programs have been eating the \nbudget alive. They go on and on, up and up, without any controls, no \nceilings, no lids, no nothing. Gradually, demand always outstrips \nsupply when you make something free. That is just the way it is. It is \nhuman nature. People take advantage. And this would really allow an \nentitlement program to continue.\n  Second, it would create a new entitlement which requires States to \nprovide services. One of the reasons we are doing this welfare reform \nbill is to try to end these escalating entitlement programs, to get \nspending under control, face our problems, but face them within an \nauthorization process that says this is the limit to where we are \ngoing, we are not going to go beyond that. We are going to be fair, we \nare going to try to take care of people--we do not want anybody to be \nwithout a work life experience, we do not want to have people without \nappropriate training--but this is what we are going to spend this year. \nIf we find that does not cut it, does not make it, we can always \nincrease the authorization and appropriation to take care of it. But we \ndo not need to create new entitlement programs which are programs that \ngo on regardless of what Congress says. They keep going up and up and \nup as people take advantage of them.\n  The third point is this opens the States up to lawsuits from \nrecipients who claim they do not get the type of training they want, \nrather than the type of training the State thinks they need. So any \ntime a recipient or potential recipient feels he or she is not getting \nwhat they want, even though the State is providing job training and \nother forms of training and education, they can turn around and sue the \nState and say, ``I am not getting what I want,'' and the State finds \nitself embroiled in litigation.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is not the way it should work.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator from Utah yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. This section of the bill, 402 of the legislation, \nrefers to the State and the definition of the eligible State. It would \nbe my understanding of the operation of law that here, this would not \nconfer standing upon an individual to sue. This section of the bill \nrelates to the State's obligations vis-a-vis its development of its \nplan. So this is not calling on the States to do anything but abide by \nits own plan. It would not, however, confer standing on an individual \nto sue with regard to enforcement of that plan.\n\n[[Page S 13347]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. As I read it, it does; it is the failure of the State to \nprovide work-related activity. The amendment reads:\n\n       The limitation described in paragraph (1) shall not apply \n     to a family receiving assistance under this part if the State \n     fails to provide the work experience, assistance in finding \n     employment, and other work preparation activities and support \n     services described in [this] section.\n\n  I contend that does give a right to sue to recipients.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Again, this section amends lines 13 through 18 on \npage 25 of the bill which relates to State planning. Again, without \ndebating----\n  Mr. HATCH. No, according to this amendment, it amends page 40 between \nlines 16 and 17.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I am sorry, that is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I go to page 40, amending section requirements and \nlimitations and put this in between lines 16 and 17, the Senator \nprovides for an entitlement. It seems to me the Senator provides for a \nmeans whereby people can bring litigation if they do not get their way. \nThat just is not the way we can run the business here.\n  We have to presume that when we provide these funds, the States are \ngoing to utilize them properly and they are going to provide job \ntraining or work-related programs that work. What you do is make it \nanother entitlement, which is what is eating our country alive.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. No, sir--will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Again, on page 43, lines 16 to 17, those sections \nrefer to the development of the State plan, and the amendment says the \nlimitation described in paragraph (1) shall not apply to a family if \nthe State fails to provide work experience, assistance in finding \nemployment, and other work preparation activities, support services \ndescribed in section 402(a)(1)(A)(ii).\n  Again, the issue of standing is a different one. Whether we argue--we \ncan debate the issue on the entitlement, whether or not this creates an \nentitlement. But on the issue of standing, I think for the record it is \nreally important to make clear this is not allowing and it is not the \nintent of this sponsor to allow an individual cause of action, right of \naction under this section. It only goes to the development of the \nState's plan and administration of the plan.\n  Mr. HATCH. If you look at the way it is written, it certainly does. \nFrankly, that is one of the reasons--only one of the reasons--I think \nthe amendment is inadvisable, even though I have to acknowledge I \nappreciate what the distinguished Senator is trying to do. But we just \nplain--I think the big argument is, this is another entitlement that \ncontinues to go on and on and escalate on and on, and to which there is \nno lid, there is no cap. It is a never-ending type thing that just puts \nus into even more of a budgetary difficulty than we have been in \nbefore.\n  All of us want to help people who do not have the training. We know \nthe way to get people off welfare is to get them trained; give them job \ntraining, give them the education, the vocational education and other \nthings that will help them to become self-supporting, self-sufficient \ncitizens.\n  But we want to get away from the entitlement approach, which just \nallows people to make ingenious arguments that they should have \nsomething that really the State has not provided or does not think it \nis advisable to provide. I do believe, if you read this carefully, it \nis subject to litigation.\n  But be that as it may, the fourth reason I would give as to why we \nreally should not support this amendment is that this is similar to the \nDaschle bill, in that it says there is a time limit, but there are so \nmany exemptions that there is not really a time limit.\n  The major exemption is this. It creates a loophole. Those who are \ndeemed by the State as work ready can insist on going through job \ntraining and other services in order to avoid work in the private \nsector. That is one of the things that this amendment will do. And \nthere are people who take advantage after advantage after advantage of \nthe job training and other services, rather than having to go get a job \nin the private sector and work every day and do what they should do, \nsupport themselves and/or their families if they have a family.\n  Again, I have to say that I know what the distinguished Senator is \ndoing. I know her heart is right. I know she is trying to do what is \nright. But it is a difference in philosophy.\n  We have had 60 years now of entitlement programs that have been \neating the American public, the taxpayers, alive and not doing the job. \nThey are not doing the job. In fact, they are doing a lousy job, and \nthey are eating us alive, they are ruining the country. And now we are \ngoing to add another entitlement to this when we write a bill that \nliterally will get job training and other related services to the \npeople as they need it. And we have the States develop and administer \nthese programs.\n The States are in a better position to do it than the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  Just look at what entitlements have meant. We are talking about just \nAFDC spending. They are not all entitlements. From 1947 to 1995, in \ncurrent dollars, we have gone since 1947 in AFDC spending from $106 \nmillion--that is current dollars--to $18 billion. And we are worse off \ntoday than we were then. That is a 17,000-percent increase, a lot of \nwhich is driven by the entitlement nature of a number of these \nprograms.\n  If you use constant dollars, constant 1995 dollars, it would go from \n$697 million in 1947 to $18 billion. That is a 2,500-percent increase.\n  So, if you take current dollars, it is a 17,000-percent increase; \nconstant dollars, based on 1995, would be a 2,500-percent increase.\n  Of course, the source of this is the Congressional Research Service \nof June 1995. It shows how these programs tend to run away if we do not \nwrite language in that requires the States to live within their means. \nIn this particular case, this language would not require the States to \nlive within their means. As a matter of fact, it allows the States and \nit allows the individuals to continue to run wild as we have in the \npast without any sense or protection to the taxpayers.\n  Everybody knows that in my whole career, 19 years here, I have worked \nhard for on-the-job training, the Job Corps, the whole bit. We now have \nover 150 job training programs in this country. Every time we turn \naround, we create another one. A lot of them are entitlements.\n  This welfare bill should try to consolidate some of these to reduce \nthe entitlement nature of our legislative process and reduce the burden \non the taxpayers. Frankly, we are a lot better off facing the music \nevery year and having the States have to face the music within certain \ncaps, albeit sometimes entitlement caps but nevertheless caps, and go \non from there.\n  I encourage our fellow Senators to not vote for this amendment \nbecause I think it just continues business as usual. I have to admit it \nis well-intentioned but naturally it is bad. I commend my friend for \nher good intentions. But it still undermines the basic thrust of what \nwe are trying to do here, getting spending under control while being \ncompassionate, reasonable, and decent for people who need to get off \nwelfare rolls and get on to the work rolls.\n  We think the exemption and the back-door loophole here really \nundermines what we are trying to do.\n  So I encourage folks to vote against this amendment as much as I \nappreciate and respect my friend from Illinois.\n  Can I just say one other thing about it? This amendment does not \namend the State plan provisions. The State plan provisions are found in \nsection 402. This amends section 405 following the minor child \nexemption and the hardship exemption.\n  So, as such, it is an entitlement, and, as such, it gives the right \nof litigation that would not otherwise be, that I talked about that \nlets the individuals second-guess the State. I know in some of the \nStates there are lawsuits by recipients that do not get the type of \ntraining that they want rather than what the State thinks they should \nhave. I think those are important points.\n  It is for the totality of those reasons why we should vote this \namendment down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  \n[[Page S 13348]]\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is pretty clear certainly that \nit is a very difficult thing to argue with the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, a man for whom I have the highest regard and \naffection. And, quite frankly, I do not know if I would want to, but at \nthis point I am going to have to respectfully disagree with my senior \ncolleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. As a lawyer I am \nreading the same language also.\n  Again, to the Senator from Utah, just on this point, I will make it \nand move on because there are other larger points to be made about this \namendment.\n  Section 405 of the legislation referred to the State requirement, the \nState plan, and the time limitation. All that this amendment does is to \ncall on the States to do what it says it is going to do in the plans. \nIt does not create a private right of action. We could argue that until \nthe cows come home and probably put everybody else to sleep who may be \nlistening to this debate. But rather than do that, I would like to go \non. But I did want to make the point that it is this Senator's \nintention and this Senator's reading of the law that it does not create \na private right of action.\n  To move on, I think it is interesting to note that a lot of the \ndebate and a lot of the argument against this amendment that I am \nhearing has to do with the word ``entitlement'' and what is an \nentitlement and what is not. I find a very curious kind of logic \nunderlying the opposition which says we have failed to address and \nresolve the issue of poverty and employability of people. Therefore, we \nare going to give up. We are going to say we are out of the business. \nWe are going to give it to the States, cap the amount of money they can \nspend on this stuff, and it is their problem. That, it seems to me, \nreally kind of begs the question in terms of what are we going to do.\n  Assuming for a moment that the State plan has a job and work \nrequirement, I do not think anybody here would argue that people who \ncan work should work, that people who have the ability to go to work \nought to do that, and that States ought to require them to do that. I \ndo not think there is much argument there.\n  But assuming for a moment the State plan calls for work assistance \nand the State does not give that work assistance and then after \nwhatever the time limit is--right now it is 5 years in the bill, and it \nmay, not too long before this legislative process is over, change--but \nassuming for a moment that the time limit is met and the individual has \ngotten nothing, the State has not done what it is supposed to do under \nits own plan, that person then is not only denied subsistence but, more \nto the point, that individual's children are denied subsistence.\n  I mean let us talk about who the object is here. We have 5 million \nadults. Paint a picture of the people on welfare in poverty in this \ncountry. Again, we have the numbers here regarding poverty in the \nUnited States. It is a number about which none of us should be proud. \nBut in any event, we have some 14 million recipients, people on the \nwelfare program, and 14.2 million give or take. Of that 14.2 million \npeople, 9.6 million are children.\n  So we are going to construct all of this stuff to get to the parents, \nthat the parents have to go to work, which, again, we are not arguing \nabout that. But we are not going to give them any help.\n  The State plan says they should go to work and the States are going \nto help them. We just might not do that, and it would risk these 9 \nmillion children. You talk about putting the cart before the horse. You \nare hurting potentially--we do not know this to be the case. I hope, \nfrankly, the most optimistic projection turns out to be true. I hope \nthat every State plan works, and I hope that every State is able to \nfind people jobs, and I hope that parents who are right now drug \naddicted, irresponsible, and ripping off the taxpayers turn around, \nstraighten up, and fly right, do the right thing, and take care of \ntheir own children. That is what we all hope for.\n  But the question is, are we really going to allow for all those 10 \nmillion babies to be jeopardized, to be left with the potential of no \nsubsistence at all because of the sense of the parents, or, worse yet, \nfor the sense of the State in not helping the States, which the State \nsays it wants to do?\n  That is what these two amendments are about. I mean, these are \ndifferent amendments. That is kind of where it is.\n  Are we going to jeopardize the children? I think the bottom line is \nthat we could have a consensus that children will not be hurt.\n  I point out that in fiscal year 1992--I think this is an important \npoint--42 percent of the youngest children in these welfare families \nwere under the age of 3.\n  So I would say to my colleague, if you are not going to support \nenforcing work training for their parents, at a minimum support an \ninsurance policy for the kids;\n an insurance policy for children so that, worse come to worse, if all \nelse fails, the State does not provide assistance for the work training \nor the family cap gets violated, the mother keeps having babies, \nwhatever situation happens, at a minimum we have a safety net for \nchildren.\n\n  Now, is that an entitlement? Well, you may want to call it that, but \nit seems to me that one of the issues for our time is whether or not as \na national community we have an obligation to provide for destitute \nchildren. We do not have the orphanages for them. We do not have the \nprivate sector options for them. We really do not have any mechanisms \nin place. It seems to me that we have an obligation at a very minimum \nto provide those children with some options and, on the other hand, \nwith regard to their parents, to provide the parents with some job \ntraining.\n  I submit to my colleagues, let us separate out--as we try to get at \nthe 5 million parents, let us not jeopardize the 10 million kids.\n  And with that, I again yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to myself such time as I need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, again, the major issue here is this is \nanother entitlement program. I do not think the American people realize \nhow many entitlement programs we have in the Federal Government as we \nexist right now. I am going to talk generally, and I think these \nfigures are pretty accurate.\n  Today, in the Federal Government, there are approximately 410 \nentitlement programs--410. The bottom 400 will total about $50 billion \nin spending. They are relatively small programs. Most of them are under \n$10 billion each, although to me that is a fairly substantial program. \nBut the bottom 400 are costing us $50 billion and going up every year.\n  The top four entitlement programs currently in our country today--\nthese are programs that automatically go up no matter what the Congress \ndoes. Year after year after year, this Congress basically has not been \nable to restrain the growth of spending. The top four entitlement \nprograms are as of fiscal year 1994, to make that clear, No. 1, Social \nSecurity. Social Security in 1994 cost us around $333 billion, and it \nis going up and everybody knows it. It is going up dramatically, and \neverybody knows it.\n  No. 2 is Medicare. When we first enacted it, those who argued for \nMedicare said it would be a relatively small cost. If I recall \ncorrectly, it was somewhere between $10 and $20 billion a year. It is \nnow up to $177 billion a year as of 1994. Of course, it is more this \nyear, in fiscal year 1995.\n  So Social Security is $333 billion. Medicare in 1994 was $177 \nbillion. Medicaid, which also was supposed to be a relatively low \nfigure, to take care of people who really need help, who were low-\nincome people, low-income seniors as well, and some who are persons \nwith disabilities, now costs us, in 1994, $96 billion.\n  Other retirement programs are entitlement programs costing us $65 \nbillion as of 1994. These big four, plus interest, will be about $900 \nbillion in 1995.\n  The point I am making is that about 400 programs cost us about $50 \nbillion. These four will cost us $900 billion. And as you all know, \nthey are going up.\n  Take Medicare. Medicare, at $177 billion last year, if we keep going \nthe way we are going, will be off the charts by \n\n[[Page S 13349]]\nthe year 2002. We are trying to restrain the growth, not cut Medicare, \nbut restrain the growth from its current 10.4 percent approximately a \nyear down to about 6.4 percent--above the rate of inflation, by the \nway. And already, because we have announced we are trying to restrain \nthe growth of that entitlement program, some of the hospitals and \nothers are trying to find ways of restraining the growth, just because \nwe are saying it has to be done. Can you imagine if we pass legislation \nthat says it has to be done? They are going to have to live within the \n6.4, which is about 2\\1/2\\ percent above the inflation rate.\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side want the 10.4 to keep going \non, which will eat this country alive. And I am going to make that \npoint. And it is true of all of these big four entitlement programs. \nLet me just make the point. The big four entitlements, plus interest, \nwere----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. They were and they will be if we do not pass the balanced \nbudget----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield just for 1 second?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not the case AFDC is not one of the top, one \nof big four entitlements?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is not. Neither will the Senator's amendment be, but it \nstill is an entitlement program, and we need to stop doing \nentitlements. Let me make my point.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield? The Senator is including \nSocial Security and Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Mr. HATCH. Including all entitlement programs to make this point, \nbecause it makes the point that we have to face the music someday. We \ncannot just keep entitling our runaway budget.\n  Now, we are going to continue Social Security the way it is. I do not \nthink anybody here is going to change it. We are trying to make some \nchanges in Medicare, maybe Medicaid. And I do not know of any changes \nin the retirement programs. But there is an effort to try to restrain \nthe growth of runaway spending.\n  One of the reasons it has run away is an entitlement program--now, \ntrue, this would be one of the less than $10 billion programs, although \nit would rapidly escalate as an entitlement program. I just make this \none point. I am just trying to make this point on how entitlements are \neating us alive and why as a principle we want to stop making things \nlegislative entitlements.\n  The big four entitlement programs, plus interest, were 25 percent of \ntotal spending back in 1965--25 percent of total Federal spending. By \n1975, they were 36 percent of total Federal spending. By fiscal year \n1985, they were 47 percent of total Federal spending, going up every \nyear. By fiscal year 1995--this is just the big four, just the big \nfour--Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and retirement--they will be \nalmost 60 percent of the total Federal budget. And by fiscal year 2005, \nthese entitlement programs will be almost 70 percent, not counting the \n400 smaller entitlement programs that automatically will be going up \nthemselves unless we put a lid on it and say we are not going to go the \nentitlement route anymore.\n  We know that Social Security is going to keep going up the way it is. \nWe know that Medicare is going to go up dramatically even if we are \nsuccessful in restraining the growth from 10.4 percent down to about \n6.2, 6.4 percent--above inflation, by the way, is that figure. We know \nMedicaid is going to keep going up, and we know other retirement \nprograms are going to keep going up. In fact, the 400 programs will \nkeep going up unless we put some restraint of growth and unless we stop \nthe entitlement nature of these programs and face the authorization and \nappropriations process every year as good legislators should.\n  I wanted to make that point because as sincere as the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois is, and I know she is, and as compassionate as \nshe is--and I feel the same way--I think the bill has better language \nto take care of these problems with less problems than will arise if we \nenact her amendment. And the principle of stopping these entitlement \nprograms to the extent we can ought to be observed.\n  That is why I suggest we have just got to bite the bullet around here \nand we have to do what is right. I have also made the point that there \nare other reasons why the amendment is one that should not be \nsupported. The main reason is it is another entitlement program.\n  I understand we differ on whether it entitles recipients to bring \nlitigation. But be that as it may, there is no time limit, no real time \nlimit in this amendment because those who are deemed by the State as \nwork ready will be able to insist on going to job training rather than \ntaking a job. Then they can avoid working in the private sector, \nsomething we want to stop. We want people who are ready and able to \nwork; to work. And that is what this bill is going to try to get done. \nI think it makes a valiant and very intelligent attempt to do so. And \nit should not be changed into another entitlement program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The Senator from Utah and I find ourselves singing from the same \nchoir book sometimes and other times singing on different pages. But \ncertainly with regard to our need to balance our budget and get our \nfiscal house in order, he and I could not be more in agreement.\n  We were on this floor together during the debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment, both of us supporting moving in the direction of a \nbalanced budget. But how one gets to a balanced budget, gets on a \nglidepath to some fiscal integrity--and fiscal integrity is as \nimportant as getting there. So the question becomes, what are our \npriorities and how will we approach the difficult issues as we are \ntrying to get our fiscal house in order? How are we going to approach \nthat task?\n  Let me suggest that we not do it on the backs of children and that we \nnot target and single out poor people for our exercise in newfound \nfrugality and our exercise in fiscal right thinking. The fact of the \nmatter is--and let us talk about the numbers for a minute because it is \nvery important. In the first instance, AFDC is not one of the big four \nentitlements. Those big four entitlements will be the topic of many \nupcoming floor discussions. I served as a member of the bipartisan \ncommission on taxes and on entitlement and tax reform, and, yes, we \nhave some serious and thorny issues to deal with. But AFDC is not one \nof those big four entitlements.\n  Indeed, in 1969, Aid to Families With Dependent Children took up some \n3.1 percent of our Federal budget. In 1994 it had declined. I know this \nis counterintuitive. This does not comport with what the talk shows \nwill tell you. But the reality is that the numbers showed it had \ndeclined to 1.1 percent of the budget. The fact of the matter is that \nover time the amount of AFDC payments have not kept up with inflation \nand have declined some 47 percent in the last 25 years.\n  And let me give you another fact that may sound counterintuitive. In \n1993, the total cost-benefits, plus administration, Federal and State--\nFederal and State; this is everybody--the total cost was $25.24 \nbillion, which is an amount equivalent to 1.8 percent of Federal \nGovernment outlays. That is total, State and Federal. The Federal \nGovernment's share of AFDC costs came to $13.79 billion in 1993, or \n0.98 percent of total Federal outlays.\n  So what we are talking about is less than 1 percent of total Federal \noutlays that can have a devastating, devastating effect on the almost \n10 million children in this country who receive assistance.\n  Again, my colleagues have argued that our efforts so far have not \nworked. And indeed, if anything, one of the more distressing and \ndepressing charts--and I do not think I have a large version of this, \nMr. President--but this one talks about the percentage of low-income \nchildren lifted out of poverty. It has got Sweden, 79.7 percent; \nGermany, 66.7 percent; the Netherlands, 73 percent; France 78.2 \npercent; \n\n[[Page S 13350]]\nthe United Kingdom 73.5 percent; Australia, 45.1 percent; Canada 40.8 \npercent; United States, 8.5 percent, under 10 percent.\n  We have done less with our wealth and the efforts that have been \nstarted to try to fix this situation and to address poverty and have \nbarely gotten underway before we got into the debate about ``getting \nrid of welfare as we know it.'' Here we are in a situation of saying, \nwell, we have not come up with a magic potion or the silver bullet to \ndeal with the issue of poverty, and so we are going to junk our \ncommitment altogether.\n  All these amendments say--it does not say we are going to spend more \nmoney. In fact, the legislation has a ceiling on the amount of money \nthat will be spent in this area. It does not say that anybody is \nentitled to stay on forever. In fact, if anything--again, the issue \nhere--the legislation is time limited, may well have family caps, and \nit may have other kinds of limitation that the States will develop. All \nthese amendments say is that when all is said and done, no child in \nthese United States will be allowed to go without food, without \nshelter, without subsistence.\n  And it also then says, that is after the 10 million people, almost 10 \nmillion children, on assistance, receiving assistance, as to their 5 \nmillion parents, it says no parent will be kicked off for failing to \nmeet a work requirement if the State has not lived by its own words in \nterms of supporting work.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise with the most emphatic support of the amendment \nof the distinguished, learned Senator from Illinois, who brings to us \nthe central subject of this legislation, which is children and what \nwill happen to them under the provisions we are discussing.\n  I have two charts which I would like to suggest involves the central \nissue of the number of families that would be affected by a 5-year time \nlimit. This is the work of the Urban Institute, established almost 30 \nyears ago when it was thought we would address these issues at a time \nwhen they were--Franklin Roosevelt might have said it--``a cloud no \nbigger than a man's hand,'' that would come into the situation we are \ntoday of the number of families who would lose their benefits, who \nwould see a 5-year time limit reach them.\n  In the year 2001, a total of 1.4 million families; make it almost 2 \nmillion, 2.5 million children. In 2002, 1.65; make that 3 million \nchildren.\n  This is the Urban Institute, Mr. President. This is not a political \ndocument. It is not one that is even touched by the necessary \ndifferences and tensions between the executive branch and the \nlegislative branch. This is the Urban Institute, under William Gorham, \nwith whom I worked on the task force that produced the Economic \nOpportunity Act of 1965. Bill Gorham and I worked together. He never \nstopped working at this. He has created an institute of impeccable \nstandards. No one will ever say that we have got the most perfect \nmeasuring systems, but we have peer review, we have measures of degrees \nof confidence in data. And the numbers are overwhelming.\n  In the year 2003, 1.8 million families; 2004, 1.9 million; 2005, 1.96 \nmillion--call it 2 million families, and call that 5 million children. \nThe 2 million is an estimate; the 1.96 is exact. I am making a round \nnumber. Five million children with no provision for their support, with \ntheir support in some sense illegal--certainly not contemplated, \ncertainly not desired by this legislation. Are we to believe that my \nfriend from Utah, who is as compassionate and understanding a man, a \nmember of our congregation 19 years ago on this subject--this is what \nhas happened. And this is why it would happen and where it would \nhappen. The numbers are startling.\n  The proportion of children receiving AFDC--I would like to bring this \naround so my friend can see it. My friend from Illinois has seen it in \nthe past. This is what we are dealing with. Thirty years ago when the \nOEO legislation was adopted, when the Urban Institute was established, \nwe were talking about numbers so small that you could say let them be \ndone by church, let them be done by localities, let them be done by \nmunicipalities.\n  In Baltimore, MD, in the course of a year, 56 percent of all children \nreceive AFDC. At any given moment, 43 percent are receiving it.\n  In Detroit, MI, in the course of a year, 67 percent, numbers that we \nhave not contemplated. This is a time of continued economic prosperity, \nin the aftermath of a half-century in which we basically have managed \nthe business cycle. We have had pockets of unemployment, but \nunemployment ranged at very comfortable levels. The level of employment \nis high.\n  In Los Angeles, 38 percent, Los Angeles, the setting of all those \ngrand houses, remarkable neighborhoods, 38 percent.\n  Philadelphia, I do wish my friend from Pennsylvania were here so I \ncould say to him, in Philadelphia, 57 percent of the children are on \nAFDC at some point during the course of a year.\n  In my own city of New York, 39 percent; New Orleans, 47 percent; \nMilwaukee, 53 percent; Memphis, 45 percent; Cleveland, 66 percent. \nThese numbers overwhelm a social system. It cannot handle it.\n  Should we have ever gotten to this point? I do not say we should \nhave. Should we have done more? Yes, we should have. Have we done some \nthings? Yes, we have. We have certainly committed the Federal \nGovernment to this issue.\n  I was reading this morning the statement in the Washington Post by \nJudith Gueron, president of Manpower Development Research Corp., as the \nSenator from Illinois well knows. She was saying, ``Look, we are \nlearning to do these things.'' She talked about Riverside, talked about \nAtlanta, talked about Grand Rapids, Family Support Act, jobs programs, \nworking, getting hold, finally getting it.\n  The Senator will remember the director from Riverside, CA, where \nPresident Bush visited 3 years ago. There was a button: ``Life works if \nyou work,'' getting the sense that welfare offices should be employment \noffices. If only people had been a little more gracious to Frances \nPerkins, and if only Frances Perkins had been a little less willing to \naccommodate whatever President Roosevelt seemed to need at the time, \nthe AFDC Program would be in the Department of Labor. The Social \nSecurity Act, with its retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, \ndependent children was to be in the Department of Labor, but there was \nthe suspicion of labor, and such, and the underestimate of Mrs. \nPerkins' enormous ability. She said, ``All right, we will have an \nindependent agency.'' Had it not been, right now, when you walk into a \nwelfare office, you would be in a U.S. Employment Service office, but \nit did not happen. But it is happening again.\n  The Daschle bill contemplated the first thing you do when you arrive \nat the welfare office is, how are we going to get you a job? But right \nnow, not to see the enormity of this problem, the dimension of this \nproblem, to think we can turn it back, cut it back and turn it back \nwithout huge costs to children is baffling to me.\n  I thank God the Senator from Illinois is here. I hope she will be \nheard, and if she is not, pray God for the children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, since we have additional time left \nover, I would like to engage the Senator from New York, who is a world \nrenowned expert in this area. He has spoken to the fundamental issues \nof, again, how we respond to poverty and, how it is necessary to take \nthis conversation away from the hot buttons and the catchwords and talk \na little bit about the demographic data that really underlie the \nreality of what we are doing here.\n  There is a social issue and an issue of policy and an issue, really, \nof the kind of country we are going to have. \n\n[[Page S 13351]]\n\n  So I raise with my colleague, who has studied these data, this issue, \njust this graph. I know he has seen this before.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Percentage of low-income children lifted out of \npoverty. Our country, America, does so much worse, less well than \nothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nminutes and that Senator Moynihan might respond to the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, in the Senator's view, will the \npending legislation resolve the disparity between the United States \nresponse to poverty vis-a-vis the other industrialized nations in the \nworld?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, to respond to my friend from Illinois, I \ncan only offer a judgment of a better part of a lifetime dealing with \nthese matters, that it would make it hugely worse. We would be off that \nchart. We would be an anomaly among the developed nations of the world. \nWe would be an object of disdain and disbelief. I can say no more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator very much. I will say a little \nmore in response to that. We have an opportunity to provide a bottom \nline below which no child in America will be allowed to fall. I, \ntherefore, ask my colleagues' support for the pending child voucher \namendment, as well as the worker responsibility amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my friend from New York. \nI do not think there is anybody on this floor who has a greater \nbackground and knowledge in this area. So, naturally, I am very \nconcerned about the statistics and facts that he has brought forward.\n  So I appreciate the efforts made by the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois. I would never ignore her remarks or those of my friend from \nNew York, who, like I say, has as much knowledge and background in this \narea. We have to strengthen our budget and move toward a balanced \nbudget, or no amount of money is going to be worth anything, because we \nwill monetize the debt and, in the end, the dollar will go to zero. \nThat is where we are headed if we do not do some intelligent things \nnow.\n  These are tough choices. I believe that the approach Senator Dole is \ntaking is about as good a one as we can take at this time. I wish we \ncould do more. The fact is that we have to find the dollars and be able \nto do more. We cannot lose sight of the fact that we are working toward \na balanced budget.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2473\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to the \nconsideration of amendment No. 2473.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I understand that this amendment \nhas been accepted by the other side.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2473) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what is the current parliamentary status \nof the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments numbered 2471 and 2472 are \ncurrently pending, and all time for debate on those amendments has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, is there unanimous consent for time for \ndisposition of subsequent amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under regular order, time has expired on these \ntwo amendments. The next amendment is the Graham-Bumpers amendment, and \nthere is no time limit on that amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two pending \namendments be set aside for the purposes of considering amendment No. \n2565.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2565\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, amendment No. 2565 has been sent to the \ndesk pursuant to the filing requirement of last week.\n  Mr. President, this evening with my colleague Senator Bumpers, we \nrise to offer an amendment to the pending amendment of Senator Dole \nwhich would dramatically affect the fairness of the funding allocations \nto the States under this legislation. We describe our amendment as the \nchildren's fair share amendment.\n  Our approach is simple. We believe that the funding to the individual \nStates, and therefore to their children, should be needs based. As a \nresult of our formula, States would receive funding based on the number \nof poor children within that State in the particular year in which they \nreceived funding.\n  There are two modifications to that basic principle: that funds \nshould be allocated where poor children are in the year of \ndistribution. Recognizing the fact that this legislation imposes some \nvery serious mandates on States, particularly in areas of preparing \npersons for work, and to be able to meet specific numerical goals for \nthe percentage of welfare beneficiaries who are employed, we believe \nthat there is a minimum amount of funds required for any State in order \nto meet those obligations. Therefore, we provide that no State will \nreceive less than either 0.6 percent of the national allocation, or \ntwice the actual amount of that State's 1994 expenditure level, \nwhichever is less. That will assure that all States will have a basic \namount of funds in order to discharge their responsibility.\n  The second principal modification from the pure principle of \nallocating funds where poor children are located is that all States, \nexcept those covered by the small State allocation, will be subject to \na transitional period by which their increases in funding in any year \nwould be limited to no more than 50-percent of what they had received \nin fiscal year 1994 for fiscal year 1996, or no more than a 50-percent \nincrease in fiscal year 1997 over what they received in 1996 and so \nforth. The purpose of this is to provide for a 4-year transition period \nin order to get to the goal of parity for all poor children in America.\n  The savings from this allocation of increased ceiling would exceed \nthat for the small State minimum allocation. The net effect of these \nadjustments would be reallocated among the States which receive less \nthan their 1994 actual expenditure.\n  Any formula allocation should be guided by some underlying principles \nand policy justifications. One fundamental principle of the Federal \nGovernment allocating money to its citizens through the States should \nbe fairness--fairness to America's children, fairness to the States, \nand fairness to the Nation.\n  There is another principle which should be applicable in this \nlegislation; that is, will the distribution of funds allow the \nfundamental objective of the legislation to be attained? The objective \nof this legislation is to facilitate \n\n[[Page S 13352]]\nthe movement of welfare beneficiaries from dependency to independence \nthrough work. Will the funds as allocated to the 50 States, and \navailable to them in order to meet that objective, be equitable? If we \nare going to a block grant, welfare we must be very careful that these \nprinciples, particularly the principle of fairness, fairness to \nchildren, is met.\n  The General Accounting Office noted in its report of February 1995 \nentitled ``Block Grants: Characteristics, Experience, and Lessons \nLearned,'' that ``because initial funding allocations used in current \nblock grants were based on prior categorical grants, they were not \nnecessarily equitable.''\n  Senator Bumpers and I propose a funding formula that would clearly \nmeet the following principles: block grant funding should reflect need \nor the number of persons in the individual States who require \nassistance. The principle No. 1 of a block grant program should be to \nreflect need or the number of persons in the individual States \nrequiring assistance.\n  A second principle of block grants should be that a State's access to \nFederal funding should increase if the number of persons in need of \nassistance increases and decrease if the number of persons requiring \nassistance declines.\n  Third, States should not be permanently disadvantaged based upon \npolicy choices and circumstances which were prevalent in years prior to \nthe block grant.\n  And fourth, if requirements and penalties and public ridicule are to \nbe imposed upon States, as I envisage will be the case with the bill of \nSenator Dole, then fairness dictates that all States have an equitable \nand reasonable chance of reaching those goals.\n  If I might comment about public ridicule, one of the provisions in \nthe original version of this legislation--and I believe that it is \nretained in the modified version--is that there will be periodic \nevaluations of how the 50 States are conducting their business under a \nreformed welfare.\n  States will be ranked assumedly from 1 to 50 as to how well they are \ndoing in terms of achieving the objectives of moving people from \ndependence to independence. Yet, we are going to be saying to some \nStates you start this process, as with Mississippi, with $331 per year \nper poor child in your State, another State will start this process \nwith $3,248 per poor child per year. And yet we are going to publish a \nreport analogous to an Associated Press rating of football teams how \nwell each State did in meeting the directives, the mandates, the goals \nof this legislation. It would be as if one State was able to field a \nfully professional team and another State had to find a group of junior \nhigh school beginners to play this game. Yet, they are both going to be \nsubject to the same evaluation. That is the public ridicule I suggest \nis going to be a consequence of this inequitable funding formula.\n  The test by which States should be evaluated would seem reasonable. \nIn sharp contrast, the amendment as offered by Senator Dole fails to \nmeet any and every test of fairness of a block grant. In fact, the \nformula used in the Dole amendment would perpetuate the inequities of \nthe status quo.\n  What are some of the problems with the amendment that is before us as \noffered by Senator Dole? The authors of the leadership proposal have \nfailed to learn the lessons cited by the General Accounting Office and \nother experts who have examined block grants. They have chosen to \ndistribute welfare funds to States well into the future based on fiscal \nyear 1994 allocations.\n  Ironically, in the name of change and in the name of reform, we are \nlocking in past inequities in distribution of Federal funds. We are \nrepackaging them as block grants. We are punting welfare to the States \nand failing to take into account future population or economic changes \namong the States and failing to give the States an opportunity within a \nreasonable period of time to achieve parity and equity in the treatment \nof the poor children within those States.\n  By allocating future spending on the basis of 1994 allocation, the \nDole bill fails to distribute money based on any measure of current or \nfuture need. It fails to account for population growth and economic \nchanges. It would permanently disadvantage States well into the future \nbased on choices and circumstances made in the past. And it would \nunfairly impose penalties on States. The Dole allocation is essentially \nbased on the status quo.\n  How was the status quo arrived at? How did we end up with a system in \nwhich one State gets $3,248 per year per poor child and another State \ngets $331?\n  The answer is that we had a system which had as one of its principal \nobjectives to encourage those States that were able, capable and \nwilling to invest substantial amounts of funds in their cash assistance \nto welfare beneficiary programs. Since we are in a nation which, \nunfortunately, has huge disparities in capability as well as in \npolitical will from State to State, we have ended up with huge \ndisparities in terms of Federal funds for poor children. The basic \nformula has been that for every dollar a State would put up, there \nwould be a Federal match.\n  For the most affluent States, the matching rate is 50-50--a dollar \nfrom the State draws down a dollar from the Federal Government. For \nStates that are less affluent, they have a somewhat richer matching \nrate, going all the way up to the poorest State being able to get 83 \nFederal dollars for every 17 State dollars. And based on that formula \nwe have ended up with a situation as it was in 1994 and as it is almost \nproposed to be continued into the indefinite future.\n  One other modification has been made to that, however, Mr. President, \nand that is that a group of some 19 States which had the \ncharacteristics of either growing at a rate faster than the Nation as a \nwhole--and there are some 17 States that met that standard--or States \nwhich were more than 35 percent below the average of the Nation in \nterms of funds per poor individual received a bonus and that bonus is \n2.5 percent growth beginning in the third year of this 5-year plan.\n  So beginning in the third year, if you have been receiving $100 \nmillion, you got $102.5 million, and a similar 2.5-percent adjustment \nin the fourth and the fifth year. That adjustment distributes \napproximately $800 to $900 million over the 5-year period, concentrated \nin the third, fourth and fifth year of the 5-year period.\n  The status quo plan, the plan that is based on funds as they were \ndistributed in 1994, will distribute approximately $85 billion over \nthat same 5-year period. So the amount of funds that are intended to \nrepresent poverty and growth are a pittance compared to the enormous \namount of money that is going to be invested in continuing the status \nquo as it was in 1994.\n  The consequence of this allocation is this map that is called \n``Children's Fair Share Allocations.'' The States in red on this map \nbenefit by using a formula based on status quo and the modest \nadjustment which I have indicated. The States in yellow are the loser \nStates in that allocation and, conversely, would benefit if the funds \nwere distributed on the basis of where poor children in America live.\n  Mr. President, the current proposal before us, the formula of Senator \nDole, would result in extreme disparity between States in Federal \nfunding for poor children. For example, Mississippi would receive $331 \nper child in 1996 compared to an affluent northeastern State's $2,036 \nper poor child.\n  Let me repeat that. Mississippi, $331; an affluent Northeast State, \n$2,036; an affluent far Northwestern State, $3,248.\n  In effect, those affluent States would receive six times or more \nfunding per poor child than the poor State of Mississippi. Even under \nthe formula of Senator Dole, Massachusetts--another affluent \nNortheastern State--would receive $2,177 per poor child. If you combine \nthe per child total from five other States--you combine the amount that \na poor child in Alabama, in Arkansas, in Louisiana, in South Carolina, \nand in Texas, if you combine what those children would receive in a \nyear--that total would not equal what a poor child, a single poor child \nin Massachusetts would get in a single year.\n  To state it another way, the Federal Government effectively values \npoor children of that affluent State five times more than it does the \nchildren of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas. \nThere is no justification for poor children to be treated with less or \nmore value by the Federal Government depending on the State in which \nthey happen to live. \n\n[[Page S 13353]]\n\n  The proponents of the Dole formula will argue that some States will \nqualify for the 2.5 percent adjustment in the bill to address these \ndisparities. However, a sizable number of States that are not treated \nfairly under the current system would receive zero remedy from the \nlimited, inadequate 2.5 percent adjustment feature. Those States which \nwould get zero remedy from the 2.5 percent adjustment include Kentucky, \nOklahoma, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, West Virginia, Kansas, \nand North Dakota. All of those States are well below average Federal \nfunding per poor child, yet would get no benefit from the proposed \nremedy.\n  Moreover, even for those who do qualify, the adjustment is marginal \nand may fail to treat all poor children equally. Let me use as an \nexample again Mississippi. How long will it take under the 2.5 percent \nformula for Mississippi to come up to the average of the country in \nterms of funds available per poor child? Will it take 10 years, will it \ntake 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 60 years, 70, 80, 90? No. \nIt will take 100 years for Mississippi to go from its current $331 per \npoor child to reach the average of the Nation at 2.5 percent a year.\n  How long will it take for Mississippi to reach the level of an \naffluent Northeastern State? It happens to come out historically and \nsomewhat ironically that it will take 206 years for Mississippi to \nreach the same level as the affluent Northeastern State. That happens, \nMr. President, to be the same number of years looking backward to the \nsigning of the U.S. Constitution. So Mississippi could look forward to \nall of the generations and all of the historical changes that have \noccurred since this great Nation was established. All of that would \nhave to elapse again before Mississippi, under this formula, would \nreach the parity of an affluent Northeastern State.\n  In contrast, the amendment as offered by Senator Bumpers and myself \nwould eliminate these disparities in less than 4 years. Mr. President, \nif we are going to have a serious debate, let us have a debate over how \nmany years should we allow ourselves to eliminate this unfairness. Is 4 \nyears too hurried a time for equality? Is 100 years adequate time to \nachieve the equality? I believe that we ought to have as a principle \nthat all poor children in America have equal value and that we should \nmove as expeditiously as possible to put that principle into our law.\n  These disparities in State-to-State funding have real consequences on \nthe lives of children. These are not just accounting or statistical \nissues. These 5 and 6 and more to 1 disparities have in the past and \nwill continue to have real human consequences. The State of Washington, \nfor example, received $2,340 per poor child in 1994, $2,340 compared to \n$393 per poor child in South Carolina, almost a 600 percent difference.\n  Should we be surprised that there are tremendous outcome differences? \nThe State of Washington's children rank seventh and sixth in rankings \nof infant mortality and percentage of children in poverty. The State of \nWashington's children ranked 12th overall in the children's well-being \nindex as established by the Casey Foundation. Meanwhile, South Carolina \nwith one-sixth the funding per poor child ranks 48th among the States \nin infant mortality, 45th in the percentage of children in poverty, and \nranks 46th in the children's well-being index.\n  It will be the height of irony, if not hypocrisy, to change our \nwelfare system and not address this cruel disparity. When people ask, \nis the welfare system broken? the answer is almost universally, yes. \nAnd what is one of the key elements of a broken system? It is the fact \nthat we have tolerated for too long a system that has resulted in these \nextreme disparities in the treatment of children and the consequence on \nthe children in their ability to grow up healthy, strong, educable, and \nproductive citizens.\n  But these are not the end of the list of adverse consequences of the \namendment as offered by Senator Dole in terms of how to allocate funds. \nLocking in historical spending will also lock into place inefficiencies \nof the status quo, the very status quo that we are supposedly reforming \nin this legislation. In 1994, the national average monthly \nadministrative expense per welfare case was $53.42--$53.42. New York \nand New Jersey, however, had administrative costs exceeding $100 per \nwelfare case, almost twice the national average, eight times the \naverage of West Virginia, which administered its program for $13.24 per \nwelfare case. Those States with higher administrative costs in fiscal \nyear 1994 would receive block grant amounts reflecting their higher \nfiscal year 1994 costs for the next 5 years, whether or not those costs \nare justified.\n  This formula fails to take into account demographic and economic \naccounts. Initial disparities locked in by the Dole approach would \nactually intensify as a result of the different rates of anticipated \npopulation growth through the end of the decade. Between 1995 and the \nyear 2000, 10 States are projected by the U.S. Census Bureau to grow by \nat least 8 percent. Eight States are projected to grow less than 1 \npercent or experience a population decline. Among the fastest growing \n25 States, the top half, 17 of those growth States would receive \ninitial welfare allocations below the national per poor child average. \nSeventeen of the twenty-five fastest growing States start this process \nat below the national average.\n  Thirty Senators, including the Senators from Texas and both Senators \nfrom my State, raised this issue in a May 23 letter to the Finance \nCommittee chairman, in which we stated: ``Block grant funding would be \nlocked in, in spite of rapidly changing patterns of need. This \ndisconnect between need and funding would produce devastating results \nover a 5-year period.''\n  Proponents of the Dole formula would argue that some States will \nqualify for the 2.5 percent annual adjustments beginning in the third \nyear to address population growth. However, six growing States--\nWashington, Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, California, and Delaware--all fail \nto qualify for the adjustment despite projected above-average \npopulation growth.\n  Moreover, even with the 2.5 percent adjustment, Texas would only \nreceive $445 per poor child in the year 2000,\n and 27 percent of the $1,600 per poor child in Connecticut, which that \nState would receive despite the fact that its population is projected \nto decline between 1995 and the year 2000.\n\n  So a State whose population is going up, a State which entered this \nprocess as one of the lowest in terms of funds for poor children, would \nbe even further disadvantaged, while a State which entered the process \nat a relatively high level with a declining population of poor children \nwould be further advantaged.\n  Another difficulty with the legislation before us, Mr. President, is \nthat under the proposal, States that receive less than their fair share \nof funding per poor child are most likely to be penalized with a 5-\npercent reduction in their funding for failure to meet the bill's work \nrequirement. To meet the work standards in the bill, States would be \nmandated to spend large chunks of their Federal funds for job training \nand for child care.\n  According to estimates by the Department of Health and Human \nServices, the additional cost of the work program and the associated \nchild care needs would absorb more than $8 out of $10 of Federal \nallocations to Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas; that over \n80 percent of the Federal funds from those States would go to meet the \nnew Federal mandates in work requirements and child care.\n  But, again, we see wide disparities. In California, New York, Oregon, \nand Wisconsin, less than 4 out of 10 Federal welfare dollars would be \nsubject to the Federal mandates under this bill; that is, those States \nwould be able to meet the same mandates by using less than 40 percent \nof their Federal money, while the poor States would have to use over 80 \npercent of their Federal funds in order to come into compliance.\n  Washington would tell the States that they have to spend block grants \non job training and child care or face 5-percent penalties for failure \nto meet the work requirements. For States facing sanctions, the States \nwould receive vastly different amounts of support to reach a common \ngoal. That, Mr. President, is patently unfair.\n  I might add that some of the States that are treated the most \nunfairly under this bill are represented by Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle who \n\n[[Page S 13354]]\njoined in that letter to the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  If I could just put this in the context of my State and in the \ncontext of what it is going to mean in the lives of real children, in \nmy State, a family on aid to families with dependent children, which is \ntypically composed of a single female and two children, receives $303 \nper month; $303 is their current allocation. Fifty-five percent of that \ncomes from the Federal Government; 45 percent, State funds. That means \nthat Federal funds represent approximately $168 or $169 of the $303 \nthat is being required.\n  Under the proposal, 63 percent of the Federal money in my State of \nFlorida would be required to meet the mandates of job training and \nchild care; 63 percent would be required, which means, Mr. President, \nthat less than 40 percent of that $168 is going to continue to be \navailable to meet the economic needs of children.\n  It is that 40 percent, plus the $135 that comes from the State, that \nbuys the clothing, that pays the light bill, that pays the rent, that \nprovides whatever transportation costs, that meets their health care \nneeds that are not covered by Medicaid. Think in your own life \nexperiences of meeting all of those needs on $303 a month. You would \nalso qualify for $304 a month in food stamps to cover your food budget. \nBut think of what it would mean to live at that level and then to see \nyour $303 monthly stipend reduced to $198, which is what is going to \nhappen with the mandates on child care and on work training, and that \nassumes that the State will continue to maintain its current level of \neffort.\n  Just a few hours ago, we defeated an amendment that would have \nrequired a maintenance-of-State effort. So that is speculative as to \nwhether, in the case of my State or any other State, there will be a \ncontinued maintenance of effort, which would keep the level of monthly \nsupport at the $198 level, not the $303 level which is currently \navailable.\n  Another factor, Mr. President, is that a wrong decision made today is \nnot a decision likely to be reversed. The history is that once a \nfunding formula is adopted, there will be great difficulty, if not \nimpossibility, of future change. Example after example can be cited of \nblock grants which are being allocated today because of funding \ndecisions in the past, often decisions which are historic and \nirrelevant to needs today.\n  The General Accounting Office notes that, for instance, under the \nmaternal child health block grant, funds continue to be distributed \nprimarily on the basis of funds received in the fiscal year 1981 under \nthe previous categorical program. A program in 1995 is distributing \nfunds based on a preexistent categorical program of 1981.\n  I am concerned that our successors would be looking back from the \nperspective of the year 2015 wondering why we are distributing a \nsignificant amount of Federal funds for block grants to States to meet \nthe needs of poor children based on a categorical program of 1981.\n  The General Accounting Office proceeds by saying:\n\n       Only when the funding exceeds the amounts appropriated in \n     fiscal year 1983 are additional funds allocated in proportion \n     to the number of persons under the age 18 that are in \n     poverty. We found that economic and demographic changes are \n     not adequately reflected in the current allocation resulting \n     in problems of equity.\n\n  As Ronald Reagan might have said: Deja vu, there we go again.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude with two final comments. One looks \nforward and one looks back. The debate that we are having today \nforeshadows a much larger debate that we are likely to have on \nMedicaid. More than $4 of every $10 that Washington sends State \ngovernments are Medicaid dollars. This is the program that provides \nmedical assistance to the poor, elderly, disabled, and poor children \nand their families. Medicaid is nearly five times larger in terms of \nits Federal role than welfare; $81 billion were distributed last year \nas opposed to $17 billion distributed in welfare reform.\n  We are already hearing that if the policy is adopted of using \nessentially the status quo as the basis of distributing welfare funds, \nthat that will establish the precedent for how we should distribute \nMedicaid funds; that by locking in past spending patterns and \ninequities in this program, we are setting the precedent for the much \nlarger Medicaid Program.\n  Again, remember my previous point: Block grants, once established, \nhave proven to be highly resistant to subsequent change.\n  Finally, Mr. President, to look back. I say this with sadness but \nalso with candor. This Congress has been faced over the past several \nyears with a number of major challenges.\n  Examples: In the early eighties, we were faced with the challenge of \nreforming our financial institutions. A number of pieces of legislation \nwere adopted with that as their intention. Unfortunately, less than a \ndecade later, we were back passing further legislation to deal with it \nwith the calamity of our financial institutions which have largely been \noccasioned by our earlier actions.\n  In 1986, we passed what was supposed to be major tax reform, intended \nto simplify the Internal Revenue Code. Today, there is so much public \ndismay at the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code that we are \ntalking about a complete repeal of the income tax and the substitution \nof a consumption tax, or a flat tax, or some other basic new approach \nto domestic revenue procurement.\n  In the mid-1980's, we passed a catastrophic health care bill that was \nintended to deal with some of the inadequacies in Medicare. Within less \nthan 2 years, we repealed the bill that we passed, and now we are back \nlooking at Medicare reform again, but no longer looking at legislation \nto fill the gaps of the program, but rather to add new gaping holes to \nMedicare and new expense to the beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that all of those past precedents have \nsomething in common; that is, we allowed the theory of how things were \ngoing to work to get ahead of common sense and practicality as to how \nthings would work. We, I fear, are about to make the same mistake \nagain.\n  I will state, with no doubt of the correctness of history in this \nstatement, that a plan which is as fundamentally unfair in the \ndistribution of funds as this which is before us today--a plan which so \nfundamentally mistreats two-thirds of the States of this Nation, in \nterms of their ability to achieve the goal of facilitating the movement \nof welfare-dependent individuals to the independence of work, that a \nplan that has those kinds of imperfections embedded in its basic \nallocation of funds to achieve its purpose, will fail. And we will be \nsubjected to more public animosity toward this institution for failure \nto have carried out our task in a craftsmanlike manner.\n  The public will continue to be outraged at what it sees as the abuse \nof people who are living on a public system without contributing to the \nbetterment of the public. We will continue to see poor children start \ntheir lives with the extreme disparities that exist today. We will see \nthis institution held in even more public disrespect because of our \ninability to deal intelligently, thoughtfully, rationally, with an \nimportant national chapter. We are dealing here with fundamental \nfairness. The proposal before us fails to meet that standard.\n  Senator Bumpers and I, joined by our other colleague, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, have provided to the Senate an alternative which will meet \nthe goal of treating poor children in America as they should be \ntreated--each with equal worth and dignity.\n  I urge the adoption of the children's fair share amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it was our informal understanding--we \nhave no time agreement--that we would alternate from one side of the \naisle to the other.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have no problem with that. I think the Senator from \nTexas wishes to speak.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would be happy to let Senator \nBumpers proceed. I do not mind waiting. I am going to be here anyway.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator from New York wish to speak at this \ntime?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No. The Senator from New York is awaiting with great \nexpectation the remarks of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am immensely flattered, Mr. President. \n\n[[Page S 13355]]\n\n  Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate we had some great \npeople here: Hubert Humphrey, Abe Ribicoff, Jacob Javits, John Pastore, \nScoop Jackson, Ed Muskie--truly great men, great Senators who believed \nin the theory of enlightened self-interest, who believed in governing.\n  Hubert Humphrey used to make a great speech, and he said, ``This will \nnever be a great place for any of us to live until it is a good place \nfor all of us to live.'' I agree totally with that statement. As I \nthink of those words and the author, I cannot help but wonder what \nHubert Humphrey would think about a bill that said, ``If you are rich \nand affluent, we will make you more affluent; and if you are poor, we \nwill punish you and make sure those in poverty stay in poverty.''\n  Well, even the people in the U.S. Senate would take strong exception \nto that if they believed that was our philosophy or that was what we \nwere about to do.\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what this bill does. Senator Graham \nhas covered just about everything that needs to be covered. As Mo Udall \nused to say, ``Everything that needs to be said has been said, but \neverybody has not said it.'' So while I know that much of what I have \nto say will be repetitious of what my good friend, and the real author \nof this amendment, the Senator from Florida, has said, it bears \nrepeating to make sure that the all Senators understand what they are \nvoting on.\n  In 1994, the AFDC formula allowed the following: If the States want \nto add more money to their AFDC program, the Federal Government will \nmatch it dollar for dollar. So what is the result? The result is the \nsame as it has been for years under this formula. The ``haves,'' the \naffluent States, put more money into AFDC, so they get more money. If \nthey add $100 per child per year, the Federal Government gives them \nanother $100. That whole concept is flawed, totally, fatally flawed, \nbecause what it says is, ``If you are wealthy, we will make you \nwealthier, and if you are poor, we will make you poorer.''\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, everybody knows that this amendment is \na fair proposition. What Senator Graham and I are suggesting is that we \ndivide all the money in the pot by the number of poor children in the \ncountry and we allocate it to the States based on the number of poor \nchildren each State has. For example, if we had 10 million poor \nchildren in the country, we would divide the total pot of money by 10 \nmillion and that amount would be paid to each State for every poor \nchild in that State.\n  Madam President, the problem Senator Graham and I are trying to solve \nis a result of the formula we've used for the AFDC Program since its \ninception. Under that formula, the more affluent States have, over a \nperiod of years, received the lion's share of the Federal money because \nthey were able to put more State money in the program, and we were \nmatching it.\n  On the face of it, we should applaud States that have tried to \nimprove and do better for themselves. But we should not penalize those \nwho are not affluent and who could not put more money in.\n  Think about this for a moment. I want Members to think about this. I \nhave good friends in this body from States who make off like bandits \nunder the Dole bill.\n  Just take the State of Rhode Island. We have two fine Senators, my \ndear friends from Rhode Island, but I do not believe either Senator \nfrom Rhode Island would say they believe that a poor child in Rhode \nIsland is worth $2,244 a year, but a poor child in my home State of \nArkansas is worth only $394. What in the name of all that is good and \nholy are we thinking about here?\n  All my life I have had to say I come from a poor State. I hate to say \nthat. But I have always believed that being upfront and candid about \nyour own plight is good for the soul and good for understanding.\n  I cannot believe that we are about to pass a bill that allows New \nYork, for example, to get $2,036 for every single poor child on AFDC, \nand my State $394. They get five times more than my State. If this were \nState money I would not squawk. But it is not. It is Federal money out \nof the U.S. Treasury, and we are saying that if you come from an \naffluent State which has been able to put more and more into the \nprogram, and we have matched it more and more as you put more in, you \nwill benefit permanently. We are looking at a gross inequity and we are \nratifying it. We are institutionalizing it for all time to come. States \nlike New York, the home of my very good friend and ranking member on \nthe Finance Committee, will always do very well under the Dole formula.\n  The Dole formula claims to correct these inequities over time. For \nexample, if my home State of Arkansas goes below 35 percent of the \nnational average for concentration of poverty, the Dole formula \nprovides a little honey pot from which the State can get a 2.5-percent \nbonus. How that warms the cockles of my heart.\n  If my State gets that 2.5-percent bonus it will only take us 84 years \nto reach the national average. And it will only take us 177 years to \ncatch up to New York. If I thought I would live to see that, I might \nfavor it. Unhappily, I will not be around.\n  Sometimes as I get steamed up making these speeches on the floor I \nget to thinking, am I living in a loony bin? Is this actually going on? \nIs it happening? And often the answer is yes.\n  If you want to take all this Federal money and give it to every poor \nchild in America on an equal basis under the proposition that a poor \nchild in Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, North Dakota is worth as much as \na poor child anywhere, count me in. And then if the State wants to \nenrich that, let them.\n  They have a right to do that, even though, Madam President, school \ndistricts all over America are being ordered by the Federal courts to \nequalize their school expenditures among the poor districts as well to \nbring them up to par with the more affluent districts.\n  If you come from an affluent school district in my State you get \nvoice, glee club, debate. You get field trips, you get everything, \nbecause the people in that district are more affluent and the more \naffluent they are, the more advantages and opportunities they want \ntheir children to have. So they vote for higher taxes to support those \nprograms.\n  Then you take some poor school in the Mississippi Delta. I do not \ncare how hard they try. I do not care how much they stretch out. I do \nnot care how much they sacrifice. They can never, never reach the \naffluence of the more prosperous school districts. So the courts are \nsaying nowadays, you cannot do that anymore, you have to equalize these \nState funds.\n  This bill says that in the very first year, a State has to get 25 \npercent of the people on the rolls into the work force. I am going to \nsay women, rather than people, because the adults in this program are \nalmost exclusively single mothers with children. I do not say this to \nbe sexist. I say it because that is the way it is.\n  This bill says to each State, New York and Arkansas alike, that \nduring the first year, 25 percent of these women must enter the work \nforce, and, if they do not, we are going to penalize them by reducing \nthe amount of their block grant. By how much? Up to 5 percent.\n  I want you to think about the lunacy of that provision. They say: Get \nthese women into the work force. But there is not enough money in the \nbill for child care, even if there were jobs available and women \nwanting to take them. There is not enough money in this bill to provide \nthe kind of child care you would have to have to even come close to \ngetting 25 percent of these women into the work force.\n  I do not want to stray too far afield, but the Senator from New York \nwas quoted in the paper the other day with a magnificent statement. Ten \nyears from now, more and more thousands of children are going to be \nsleeping on the grates in this country. This bill is a veritable \nassault on the children of this country. I wonder where some of these \npeople who purport to have these great family values and Christian \nbeliefs are when we are debating things like this? Why do they not \nsense the inequities of this? Why do they not understand that millions \nof children who have little chance now are going to have much less \nchance in the future when this bill becomes law?\n  You think about West Virginia, with an administrative cost of $13.34 \nper caseload per year. I am sorry the senior Senator or junior Senator \nfrom West Virginia are not here to hear me laud \n\n[[Page S 13356]]\nand commend their State for their very low administrative costs in the \npresent AFDC Program. I did not get a chance to check it in my State, \nbut I know our average is in that vicinity. The national average is \n$56, and in some States it is as high as $106. Under this bill we are \nrewarding those States with high administrative costs. We are rewarding \nStates that have a $106 administrative expense and punishing the State \nof West Virginia for being good stewards over the administration of \ntheir funds.\n  Madam President, every year for 5 years--you have to get 25 percent \nof the women off the rolls the first year, the next year you have to \nhave 5 percent more, the next year 5 percent more, until, in 5 years, \n50 percent of these people are off the rolls. On a point that is not \nrelevant to this amendment, I submit to you that 20 percent of the \npeople on AFDC today are incapable of either finding or holding a job. \nWhat happens to them?\n  One morning one of my sons came home. I have to tell you, all my \nchildren are pretty liberal when it comes to poor people. They have \ngood values. I am immensely proud of every one of them. My son, who \npractices law downtown in Washington, DC, said, ``Dad, I wish you would \ngo with me in the morning. Our firm is in charge of feeding the \nhomeless people in the morning.''\n  ``Where?\"\n  ``A project called SOME, So Others May Eat. I think it will be good \nfor your soul.''\n  It was nearing Christmas. My daughter, who was in school in New York, \nwas home for Christmas. We all went. The temperature was 28 degrees, \nand 400 men and 2 women were standing outside waiting for the dining \nroom to open. So I flipped pancakes for 3 hours--the best day's work I \never did. Then I went around, just like I would at a political rally, \ntalking to these men. ``Where do you come from?\"\n  I found that one-third of them had jobs. About a third of them had a \ndrug habit. And a third of them were essentially dysfunctional, they \ncould not hold a job. And being dysfunctional is not peculiar to men, \nit is also true of women, and a lot of women on AFDC today cannot and \nwill never take, or be able to hold, a job. What happens to them? If \nthe goal is to get everybody off the rolls, how on Earth are you going \nto do it?\n  Senator Graham made a very salient point a moment ago about some \nStates trying to meet their mandates. They have nothing left after they \nmeet the mandates. I think he said in Florida, 63 percent of the funds \nthat Florida will get will go to meet the mandates and what is left \nwill go out in AFDC grants. In my State it is almost 80 percent, which \nmeans when we meet the mandates of this bill, we will have $40 a year \nper child to hand out.\n  The most cruel among us may say, ``Well, you have food stamps on top \nof that.'' Food stamps will not pay the electric bill. Food stamps will \nnot pay for a child's medical care, for housing, or for his clothing. I \ncannot believe how callous and indifferent we are to the least among \nus.\n  I started off mentioning de Tocqueville. I never tire of talking \nabout him. He talked about enlightened self-interest. That is a very \nsimple proposition that has governed my entire life. The principles I \nlearned in Sunday school in the Methodist Church and the principle of \nenlightened self-interest that I learned from reading ``Democracy In \nAmerica'' have governed my life, and that is where my values come from.\n  And what does it mean? It means that when some poor soul is reaching \nfor the first rung on the ladder and you are on the top rung, you do \nnot step on his hands. You reach down and take his hand and you pull \nhim up. You pull him up because it makes him a better citizen, it makes \nthe country a better country, and it makes me a better person.\n  How could anybody quarrel with those three principles, all of which \nare unassailable? So that is what is wrong with this bill. We are \nreaching out and giving a hand to some and we are stepping on the hands \nof millions who did not have a dog's chance to begin with and will have \neven less.\n  Madam President, I could not vote for this bill. I will never vote \nfor a bill that includes so many things I deplore in this country. I \nmight also say I would hate to have to go home and explain to my folks \nwhy I voted for a bill that uses their tax dollars and sends back to \nthem only $394 for each poor child at the same time it sends the State \nof California $1,716. You can use all the sophistry in the world. You \ncan use every kind of convoluted argument in the world to try to defend \nthis. It is indefensible.\n  So, Madam President, I am honored to join my good friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Graham and Senator Bryan, in trying to bring some \nsense and sanity to this bill. There are a lot of things about this \nbill I do not like. I would have a very difficult time voting for this \nbill even if this amendment was agreed to. I am not terribly worried \nabout that.\n  But, for the life of me, when you look at that map and you see the \nStates that are helped and the States that are hurt under this \namendment--which simply says divide the pot of money by the number of \npoor children in this country and send it out to them on a per capita \nbasis--you cannot improve on that. So I am hoping when the rollcall is \nup on this amendment, people will look at that chart and realize we are \nnot talking about State money; we are talking about Federal taxpayers' \nmoney. We are distributing it in the most unkind, most unfair way I can \nimagine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13345-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1995\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2565\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I want to talk about the underlying \nformula, the Dole-Hutchison formula that is in this bill. The key to \nour formula is balance. When we looked at the monumental problem of \nwelfare reform, the main goal we had was to keep the reform in the bill \nbut not penalize any State too much. So what we did was take the high-\npayment States, the high-welfare States, and we froze them. That is a \nbig gain in the beginning for those States because we felt that we \ncould not go to a State like New York or California and say next year \nyou are getting a cut. So we freeze them for 5 years.\n  When you are talking about a 5-year block grant, you have to be very \ncareful. You have to be careful about year 1, but years 3, 4 and 5 are \njust as important, especially if you are a growth State. And, if you \nare a low-benefit growth State, you do not have the margin of error \nthat would allow you to absorb growth with a very low benefit in the \noutyears.\n  So we took this problem, and we said how can we do a 5-year block \ngrant so we can plan for the budget, so that we can balance our budget \nresponsibly without hurting any State too much? That is what the Dole-\nHutchison formula does. It leaves the high benefit States whole. They \nnever lose anything that they had in 1994 and beyond. No State loses \nanything they had from 1994 on. But we took $887 million and we \nallocated that for low-benefit high-growth States so that in the \noutyears, 3, 4, and 5, we knew what the budget would be but we allowed \nthem a modest growth. It is modest. It is 2.5 percent per year for a \nlow-benefit high-growth State.\n  So our goal is to slowly reach parity. It is slower than many of us \nwould like to see because many States start very low like the Senator \nfrom Arkansas who was just speaking. He is one of the States that is \ngoing to grow slowly. But, if you put food stamp and AFDC together--and \nthey do go together--most States will eventually reach parity. But they \nwill do it gradually. They will do it without hurting any other States.\n  What is wrong with the Graham amendment? We have heard Senator Graham \nand Senator Bumpers talk about the merits of their formula. If I were \nthe dictator, I would say sure, let us start next year, and let us say \neverybody is going to be equal in America. What is the problem with \nthat? The problem is this is the United States of America. We have 50 \nStates that have to come together to make collegial decisions. We have \nto do it in a responsible way so that one State is not such a big loser \nthat it could put that State in severe financial straits from which \nthey really could not recover. That is what is wrong with the Graham-\nBumpers amendment.\n  It is totally fair. There is no question about it. But if you do \ntotally fair on paper and do not take into account that someone has to \npay for this, then it is just what you have--something on paper because \nit will never be a collegial decision that is fair enough that all of \nus could feel in good conscience that we could adopt it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator is saying this is totally fair. I think she \nis right given this abstract when you say start all over. But as you \nknow, in the bill, I think what we propose is a modification by the \nleader to the substitute. There is going to be an 80-percent \nmaintenance of effort provision in all 5 years of this bill which means \nthat these States, like New York and California that have high \nmaintenance efforts, are going to require that they continue to \ncontribute 80 percent of the 1994 funding level. If we are going to \nrequire 80-percent maintenance of effort, how could there conceivably \nbe a situation where New York, for example, where we are going to \nrequire New York with their maintenance of effort provision to actually \ncontribute more on the State level than the Federal Government will \nunder the Graham formula? Could that be a result?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct. That could be a result. That is \nexactly correct. You see, there is another point here. When we are \ntalking about the underlying bill, we are talking about redistributing \n$887 million over a 5-year period. So we are holding everyone harmless. \nEvery State is held harmless. And the low-benefit, high-growth States \nthat need that extra help are going to divide the $887 million. But the \nGraham-Bumpers amendment does not redistribute $887 million. It \nredistributes $17 billion. It takes the entire pot of $17 billion, and \nit says, OK, we are going to put it on a 5-year plan, and at the end of \n5 years every person in America is going to have the same amount. When \nyou do that, someone has to pay.\n  Let us look at what happens. New York loses $4.6 billion. In a $17 \nbillion redistribution, one State loses $4.6 billion to pay for the \nredistribution to the other States. California is the biggest loser. \nCalifornia would lose $5.4 billion.\n  So really you are talking about almost half of the entire amount--\nactually more than half the amount of the entire amount--which is going \nto come out of two States.\n  Madam President, we are a country. There is no State that can stand \nto lose that kind of money and make it.\n  So that is why it is very important that we look at realism. What do \nyou think is going to happen if this amendment passes? If this \namendment passes, there is no welfare reform. The bill comes down. It \nis over.\n  So I ask my colleagues as they are looking at this amendment, which I \nwould love to vote for, and 35 States come out better. But the price \nwhen the pound of flesh comes straight out of the heart is too high. \nAnd I think if we are not serious about welfare reform that we can go \nblithely along and say, ``Oh, sure. Let California sink into the \nPacific. Let New York go into the Hudson River. And, sure. We will have \nwelfare reform that everybody can live with.'' Well, everybody except \nNew York and California, and anyone who has a conscience. It is like \nthe child who is going after the big bubbles. When the child gets the \nbubbles the child finds that there is only air in its place.\n  So the difference between the two bills is really the difference in \nwhether we have welfare reform or not.\n  Let me say that I sympathize with Florida, and I sympathize with \nArkansas. The biggest winner in the Graham amendment is Texas. The \nbiggest single winner of any State in the entire Union is my home State \nof Texas. We gain over $1 billion. But I did not come here to get a big \nwindfall for Texas when I know that if I went for that beautiful bubble \nwhat would happen is we would go back to welfare as we know it, which \nno one in good conscience can say is right for this country.\n  We must persevere to have welfare reform. All of us must give a \nlittle. And the underlying Hutchison-Dole formula does give Florida \ngrowth. We worked very hard to make sure that the 19 States that have--\nactually, it is 20 States--that have low benefits and high growth do \nnot suffer to such a great extent that they would be in jeopardy. And I \ndo sympathize with Florida. Florida is like Texas. We have illegal \nimmigration that costs our States dearly. There is no question about \nit.\n  However, the Graham-Bumpers amendment is not the answer if we care \nabout welfare reform. If we care about welfare reform, we will all give \na little so that there is a fairness in the system, and we will all win \na lot because the people of America will have welfare reform that is \ngoing to allow States to have time limits for able-bodied recipients to \nhave welfare, that is going to provide for child care and job training. \nBut it is going to require work for welfare for able-bodied recipients, \nand it is going to have caps on spending in welfare so that the hard-\nworking American family will know that someone is not staying on \nwelfare generation after generation having things that the hard-working \nfamily is not able to buy for its own children. No longer is that going \nto be tolerated in this country.\n  That is what welfare reform does, if we are all willing to give a \nlittle for everyone to win. That is why the underlying formula is \nbalanced. It is why no one is completely happy with it and why it is \neasily subject to attack. But \n\n[[Page S 13358]]\nI worked very hard with many other Senators who were concerned about \nthe original Finance Committee bill to try to come up with something \nthat was fair to everyone--not everyone's total liking but fair so that \nno one would go home saying they did not get something. They either get \nwelfare reform that is good for every taxpaying family in this country, \nand they get either a benefit in the beginning if they are a big \nwelfare State, or a benefit toward the end if they are a low-benefit, \nhigh-growth State.\n  I think we have accommodated the needs of every State in a reasonable \nmanner, and that is the bottom line. It is balance. It is fairness. It, \nabove all, is keeping the goal of welfare reform so that everyone knows \nthat it is not going to be welfare as we know it. It is not going to be \nbusiness as usual. It is going to be better for every American if we \ncan persevere and do the right thing.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I note that the Senator from Texas has to be elsewhere \nin a moment, but if she could stay just for a moment I would like to \nsuggest that something exceptional has happened tonight. It may be \nsomething that Benjamin Disraeli wrote turns out to be wrong, and this \nis a new thought to me. But I was going to read a passage from \nConingsby published in 1870 when the young Coningsby is having \nbreakfast with the old duke, and the old duke says:\n\n       In a couple of years or so you will enter the world; it is \n     a different thing to what you read about. It is a masquerade; \n     a motley, sparkling multitude in which you may mark all forms \n     and colours, and listen to all sentiments and opinions; but \n     where all you see and hear has only one object, plunder.\n\n  Now, I think that the Senator from Texas, having said it is clearly \nthe case that she is going to oppose a proposal in which the chief \nbeneficiary in the first instance and on a superficial level perhaps \nwould be the State of Texas, leads me to raise the question: Did \nDisraeli get it right or was it invariably a rule, or is there a \nHutchison exception?\n  In any event, I thank her for her remarks and do observe if this \nmeasure would cost the State of California $5.4 billion and the State \nof New York $4.6 billion, it hardly would be a promising addition to \nthe legislation, the underlying bill before us.\n  I would like to talk just a little bit about this subject, Madam \nPresident. We are talking about Federalism here. We are talking about \nsome of the complexities, some of which have grown too complex over \ntime. But the first point I would like to make is this: The disparities \nin AFDC benefits and Federal contributions, sharing contributions, how \ndo they arise? The Senator from Texas happens to be right about them. \nThey arise primarily for one reason which is very little understood and \npossibly never will be understood, that AFDC is not an entitlement to \nindividuals; it is an entitlement to State governments for a Federal \nmatching share of what the State governments choose to spend on the \nprogram.\n  This goes back to the 1935 Social Security Act. It has been varied \nsomewhat from time to time. But the essential fact is that the States \nare left to design their own programs or have no program.\n  It would surprise many today to know that you do not have to have an \nunemployment insurance program. You do not have to have aid to \ndependent children or, as it later was, Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren. If you do, you are guaranteed a Federal match. States may \nchoose to set generous eligibility thresholds and benefit levels, or \nthey may choose not to. If they opt for a larger social safety net, \nthey pay for it. But they also qualify for more matching Federal funds. \nThe incentive is optional but intentional.\n  Now, that Federal match from the beginning--the beginnings are in the \nGreat Depression--was heavily skewed toward States in the South and \nWest. It is only beginning to be better understood that it was part of \na policy of the New Deal, although it comes from New York: a President \nfrom New York State, a Secretary of Labor from New York State.\n  The object of the New Deal was to move resources away from cities \nsuch as New York, Wall Street as it would be termed, to the South and \nWest, the Tennessee Valley, for the great water projects to reclaim the \narid West. In this particular program, the formula, the matching rate, \nis borrowed from the Hill-Burton formula which came into effect just \nafter World War II--Lister Hill of Alabama. The formula was used to \nallocate funding for a great hospital construction program. Our \nesteemed former colleague, Senator Russell Long of Louisiana, informed \nme that the Hill-Burton formula is the South's revenge for losing the \nCivil War.\n  What it does, Madam President, it writes algebra into our statutes. \nThe States receive a Federal match that is determined by the square of \ntheir per capita incomes so that the relative difference in those \nincomes becomes exaggerated. And so it is such that until very recently \nsome States in the South received an 83 percent match from the Federal \nGovernment, other States such as New York, California, and I do believe \nMaine--we will check that in a moment--get 50 percent; 50 percent is \nthe minimum. Actually, Maine's current Federal match rate is about 63 \npercent.\n  It now goes from 50 percent to 79 percent. One of the first proposals \nI made when I came to the Senate 19 years ago when this was just \nbeginning to be so patently inequitable, simply because costs of living \nwere so different, I said, if we were going to have algebra in our \nstatutes, instead of the square of the difference, why not the square \nroot?\n  Well, I did not get much support for the idea. But one did begin to \nstudy the differences in tax capacity, the differences in costs of \nliving. It makes astounding differences. If you just take that fixed \npoverty level, you will find you underestimate the true cost-of-living \nequivalent of the poverty level in a State such as mine by about 30 \npercent.\n  A word, if I may about per capita income. In virtually every debate \nwe have on this floor or in committee about the States' relative fiscal \ncapacity, we use per capita income as the proxy. Per capita income is a \nproxy, but not the only one. States such as Texas, for instance, that \nare endowed with natural resources may impose a severance tax when \nthose minerals and natural gas and crude oil are severed from the \nground. A severance tax is a wonderful way to raise revenue because the \nend user, usually out of State, ultimately pays it. I would note that \nTexas does not have a personal income tax. Perhaps one is not needed. \nAfter all, the State can export much of its tax burden out of State.\n  The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations [ACIR] has \nlooked into this. This is the ACIR established under President \nEisenhower in 1959, a nonpartisan, professional group. In 1982, the \nAdvisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations with its long history \nof research, adopted the following resolution.\n  It said:\n\n       The Commission finds that the use of a single index, \n     resident per capita income, to measure fiscal capacity \n     seriously misrepresents the actual ability of many \n     governments to raise revenue. Because states tax a wide range \n     of economic activities other than the income of their \n     residents, the per capita income measure fails to account for \n     sources of revenue to which income is only related in part. \n     This misrepresentation results in the systematic over and \n     understatement of the ability of many states to raise \n     revenue. In addition, the recent evidence suggests that per \n     capita income has deteriorated as a measure of capacity.\n       Therefore, the Commission recommends that the federal \n     government utilize a fiscal capacity index, such as the \n     Representative Tax System measure, which more fully reflects \n     the wide diversity of revenue sources which states currently \n     use. * * *\n\n  Another problem with viewing income as a proxy for wealth is that it \nfails to consider differences in the cost of living which, as I said a \nmoment ago, can be quite large. Residents of New York and Connecticut \nmake more than do their neighbors in Mississippi and Alabama. But they \nneed to spend more, too.\n  The other side of the equation is poverty. We have a national poverty \nthreshold adjusted only by family size and composition. I think we \nwould all agree if you just looked at the simple numbers, the richest \npeople on Earth live in Alaska. Well, no, they do not. They have to pay \nso much more for \n\n[[Page S 13359]]\nwhat they consume as against the persons in the lower 48, they are \nprobably, relatively speaking, not as well off.\n  The point about the problem we are dealing with right now is that, \nfor example, a family of four just above the poverty threshold living \nin New York City is demonstrably worse off than a family of four just \nbelow the threshold in rural Mississippi.\n  Each year for the last 19 years I put out a compilation of the flow \nof funds between the Federal Government and the 50 States entitled \n``The Federal Budget and the States.'' Here, I will display the report \nfor you for the purposes of the Senate.\n  More recently, the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at \nthe John F. Kennedy School at Harvard has begun computing the actual \nnumbers. I write an introduction. They have come up with an index to \nsubnational poverty statistics. That is, Professor Herman B. Leonard, \nwho is academic dean of the teaching programs, and Baker Professor of \nPublic Finance, and Monica Friar, who is his associate in this matter.\n  And we just look at the ``Friar/Leonard State cost-of-living index,'' \nas it is known, we find that--again I use my own State because I have \nbeen working at it--New York's poverty rate jumps from the 18th highest \nin the Nation to the sixth highest. It is no longer the case of the \nMississippi Delta. It is no longer the case that poverty is more \nprevalent in the high plains. It is no longer the case that it is \nAppalachia. The sixth highest poverty rate in the Nation is in New York \nState once you adjust for the cost of living, which is obviously what \npoverty is all about. What does it get you with what you have?\n  Earlier this year, a National Academy of Sciences [NAS] panel of \nexperts released a congressionally commissioned study on redefining \npoverty. The study, edited by Constance F. Citro and Robert T. Michael, \nis entitled ``Measuring Poverty: A New Approach.'' According to a \nCongressional Research Service review of the NAS report:\n\n       The NAS panel (one member among the 12 member panel \n     dissented with the majority recommendations) makes several \n     recommendations which, if fully adopted, could dramatically \n     alter the way poverty in the U.S. is measured, how Federal \n     funds are allotted to States, and how eligibility for many \n     Federal programs is determined. The recommended poverty \n     measure would be based on more items in the family budget, \n     would take major noncash benefits and taxes into account, and \n     would be adjusted for regional differences in living costs.\n       * * * Under the current measure the share of the poor \n     population living in each region in 1992 was: Northeast: 16.9 \n     percent, Midwest: 21.7 percent, South: 40.0 percent, and \n     West: 21.4 percent. Under the proposed new measure, the \n     estimated share in each region would be: Northeast: 18.9 \n     percent, Midwest: 20.2 percent, South: 36.4 percent, and \n     West: 24.5 percent.\n\n  But getting back to Hill-Burton, the fact is that this benefit \nformula, called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, has always \nbeen designed to bring more Federal funds to Southern States than to \nNorthern ones. And again, when we talk about these matters, we cannot \nseem to get past talk about per capita income as a measure of a State's \nrelative capacity.\n  It is not, Madam President, as I showed just a moment ago. Per capita \nincome disguises the large effects of cost of living.\n  Madam President, the point here is that we have a set of Federal \noutlays which have corresponded to two things. First, they have helped \ncompensate States with low per capita income way in the back; 83 \npercent to Mississippi, but only 50 percent to California, the Federal \nmatch. But also, the outlays reflect State spending. And the States \nthat would be injured in this matter are just those States who of their \nown choice have chosen to provide a higher level of provision for \ndependent mothers and children.\n  Per capita disparities exist in the block grant allocations because \nStates are different--vastly different--in their willingness to spend \ntheir own money on their own poor people.\n  Now, if at the moment we end the Federal entitlement, turn this \nmatter back to the States, where it had been indeed as a widow's \npension in the early years, in the 1930's, going back to the Depression \nera, what we shall have done is penalize everything we would have \nthought to be admirable in American public life. And by admirable we \nwould think of provision for children in a world in which they are so \nextraordinarily exposed to the dissolution of family and the onset of \nenormous levels of dependency such as were never seen in the 1930's and \nwe now find ourselves baffled by and troubled by in the 1990's.\n  Let us take the analysis a bit further. ACIR does marvelous work and \nissues clearly written reports that too few of us in this Chamber read. \nOver the years, ACIR has developed and refined a really important \nindex. They now have a measure of State revenue capacity and tax \neffort, without wishing to make any complaints of one kind or another. \nHere we go back to 1975, and we bring ourselves back up to 1991. And we \nlook at New York. New York is the black dots. Its tax capacity goes \ndown. And it goes up a bit, then comes down a bit. Just about average \nfor the Nation. It was below average and now at 103. The State of \nFlorida has stayed about average all along, and right now, 1991, its \ntax capacity is 103 too. The two States--New York and Florida--they are \nidentical. They have the same per capita tax capacity.\n  But New York, with an older tradition, has a tax effort of 156 as \nagainst the national norm of 100. And Florida has a tax effort, rising \na bit of late, nothing dramatic, just as we decline a bit, of 86. New \nYork has twice the tax effort of Florida. It is a public choice. Some \nStates will value public goods more than private goods and others \nprivate goods more than public goods. Some have higher capacity. Some \nhave less. But the disparities are nothing such as they were thought to \nbe in years past. But if the Senator from Florida wants to know why \nthere are State-by-State funding disparities under the block grant, he \nneed look no further than this chart.\n  Now, under the logic of the amendment offered by the senior Senator \nfrom Florida, we will reward his State's behavior by giving it an \nadditional $1.7 billion over the next three years while we punish New \nYork by taking away $2.7 billion of its block grant; $4.6 billion over \nthe life of the bill.\n  The practical effect of the Graham amendment is to reallocate money \nfrom high tax effort States--States that are willing to spend their own \nresources on their own poor people--to low tax effort States--States \nthat, for whatever reason, are not willing to make those investments. \nEven though most of the less generous States benefit from the Hill-\nBurton formula and States like New York do not. This certainly does not \ncomport with my notion of Federalism.\n  I suppose the response is that we are talking about Federal funds. \nWell, why limit ourselves to a discussion of Federal welfare funds? Why \nnot consider all other Federal funds? Perhaps we should block grant \nNASA spending and allocate the dollars to each State on a per capita \nbasis. Perhaps we should block grant farm price supports. Perhaps, \neven, defense spending. Why not? Given the prevailing opinion regarding \nthe competence of Washington, maybe New York would be better off if it \nwere to receive block-granted defense funds allocated on a per capita \nbasis. After all, I am sure that New Yorkers are more aware than \ndistant DoD bureaucrats which points along our boundary with Canada are \nmost susceptible to invasion.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that, in keeping with the spirit of the \nGraham amendment, we extend it to cover all Federal spending. Let us \nsmooth out the disparities that exist in the per capita allocation of \nall Federal dollars. Now, if we consider all Federal spending, we \ndiscover that it amounts to $5,095 per person in Florida. In New York, \nthe total is a less munificent $4,973. Perhaps the senior Senator from \nFlorida would be amenable to an effort to reallocate some of the \nFederal funds that flow to his State so that the disadvantage New York \nsuffers can be ameliorated.\n  Let us extend the analysis and consider not just spending received, \nbut taxes paid, as well. Between fiscal years 1981 and 1994, on a \ncumulative basis, if New York's percentage share of allocable Federal \nspending had been equal to its share of taxes paid, the State would \nhave received an additional $142.3 billion. Florida, on the other hand, \nwould have received $38.5 \n \n[[Page S 13360]]\n\nbillion less. I think notions of fairness and equity have been turned \non their head here.\n  The same may be said for regions. In the Northeast you find a big \nimbalance, a shortfall in the balance of payments with the Federal \nGovernment. In the South you find a big surplus. In the Midwest, an \neven bigger shortfall than the Northeast. The greatest--Illinois now \nranks 49th in its balance of payments with the Federal Government. The \nreal concentration of balance of payments deficits is in that old \nMidwest industrial area. And the West is a benefactor, always has been, \nfor a variety of reasons of which defense outlays are probably the most \nimportant. This is a zero-sum situation. Combining the regions, we find \nthat the Northeast-Midwest balance of payments deficit totals $690 \nbillion. And that is the exact windfall the South and West have enjoyed \nover the past 14 years.\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Texas often refers to ``people \nwho pull the wagon'' and ``people who ride in the wagon.'' Well, we \nhave States that pull the wagon and States that go along for the ride. \nMake no mistake. I am no fan of the block grant. But I must strenuously \nresist any attempt to raid my State of $4.6 billion, to decrease an \nallocation derived in large measure from New York's willingness to \n``put its money where its mouth is,'' particularly when the ``raiders'' \nrepresent States that are unwilling to spend their own resources on \ntheir own poor people.\n  Mr. President, in June 1990, during consideration of the housing \nbill, the senior Senator from Texas--then the junior Senator--offered \nan amendment to reallocate community development block grants [CDBG's] \non the basis of population. I said during the course of that debate, we \nput at risk the principle of federalism if we ever begin to insist on \nthis floor that any activity which has a disproportionate impact on one \nState or region as against another cannot be accepted. This floor saw \nthe terrible divisions on regionalism that led to the most awful trauma \nof our national existence, which we still have not overcome, still not \nput behind us--the Civil War.\n  There is a desk on this floor where a man was clubbed insensible, \nbeaten insensible, over regional issues.\n  All our intelligence says: Respond to need and be thoughtful and be \naccommodating and try to see that there is some rough balance. I spoke \nearlier of our having documented the imbalance and that we live with \nit. So might my colleagues from Sunbelt States.\n  Mr. President, I was not sure this bill could get any worse. But \nafter the votes on the Feinstein and Breaux amendments earlier today, \nit has. The race is on. We have dismantled the entitlement status of \nthe AFDC program. States no longer have an incentive to spend their own \nmoney on their own poor. Now, we have no real requirement that they \nspend their own money, either.\n  The race to which I refer is the race to the bottom. An article in \nlast Wednesday's Washington Post sums up nicely the brave new world we \nare about to enter. The article, by Barbara Vobejda, is entitled States \nWorry Generosity May Be Magnet for Welfare Migrants. Taxpayers and \nState legislators and Governors are determined to prevent their States \nfrom becoming welfare magnets. Set your benefits as low as possible to \nencourage current welfare recipients to move out and discourage welfare \nmigrants from moving in.\n  The article reports that many welfare recipients now receive one-way \nbus tickets from their caseworkers out of the States in which they \nreside. Perhaps, under the proposed block grant, that will become the \nbiggest welfare expenditure: one-way bus tickets out.\n  Mr. President, I find it interesting and revealing that those Members \nwhose States spend the least on their own poor people clamor the \nloudest for a more ``equitable'' distribution of the Federal block \ngrant and resist most vociferously any attempt to impose a serious \nState maintenance of effort.\n  In 1981, George Will wrote a column about the anti-Washington \nsentiment pervasive in public-land States in the West. He pointed out \nthat residents of these States were the beneficiaries of considerable \nFederal largesse, particularly in the form of water and power \nsubsidies. But these beneficiaries were budget cutters--somebody else's \nbudget, that is--through and through. Borrowing a line from that \neminent American historian Bernard DeVoto, he entitled his column Get \nOut and Give Us More Money. Does that line not wonderfully capture the \nmentality that has crossed the hundredth meridian heading East and has \npercolated up from the South? Get out and give us more money. That is \nthe wretched state of debate on this wretched bill.\n  The Senator from Nevada is here, and the Senator from New York is on \nthe other side. We have been alternating one side of the aisle to the \nother, although the different sides do not represent different views on \nthis amendment. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  I wonder if my friend from New York--I believe the Senator from \nNevada has been here for an hour and a half and has a rather brief \nstatement and then the Senator from New York, my distinguished friend, \nwill follow.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Sure.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me preface my comments by thanking the \nranking member for his courtesy in acknowledging that the Senator from \nNevada has been on the floor and to acknowledge the courtesy of his \ncolleague and our friend, the junior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Bob Kerrey and \nHollings be added as cosponsors to the Graham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to preface my comments by \ncommending my colleague and friend, the senior Senator from Florida, on \nwhat was truly a very thoughtful and very enlightening presentation, in \nterms of his efforts in developing the formula, the rationale and the \ncause for which he speaks, and that is to provide some sense of equity \nand fairness predicated on the basic proposition that children \neverywhere, irrespective of the States from which they come, are \nentitled to receive a fair and equitable allocation of Federal tax \ndollars providing for their benefit.\n  I enjoy, as I know all of my colleagues do, the erudition that is \ncontinually demonstrated on the floor by the senior Senator from New \nYork in explaining the theoretical underpinning and the origin of this \nvery complicated formula that we presently work with.\n  I say with great respect and deference to him that whatever the merit \nin its origin that formula may have had certainly can have no \ncontinuing validity when the very basis upon which we are changing the \nlaw converts an entitlement program to a block grant program that has a \ncap attached to it with a very, very minimal margin to accommodate the \ngrowth of States such as my own and others, whose Senators I am sure \nwill speak in behalf of this amendment, of 2.5 percent a year.\n  So I come to the floor this evening to strongly endorse and to \nsupport the Graham amendment, the children's fair share allocation \nproposal. This amendment will, in my judgment, ensure a more equitable \nFederal funding formula based on the number of children in poverty in \neach State with a small State minimum. The bill before us severely \npenalizes high-growth States by relying on 1994 funding levels for \nfiscal year 1996 and into future years.\n  I make it clear at the outset, Mr. President, that there is no \ndefender of the current welfare system. It serves neither the taxpayer \nnor the recipient. I want to identify myself as an advocate for change. \nThe welfare system in America has failed and we ought to change it in \nrather substantial ways.\n  But in doing so, we should ensure that there is equity in allocating \nFederal funds to States--Nevada and others--that will have serious \nwelfare problems compounded by the enactment of this piece of \nlegislation.\n  The Republican welfare proposal uses a block grant approach as a \nreplacement for the current system. As a former Governor, I very much \nunderstand the attraction of block grants for Governors in their \nStates. Quite often, block grants can be a better approach. I, for one, \nas a former Governor, recognize that there are circumstances in which \nincreased flexibility would have \n\n[[Page S 13361]]\n\nbeen immensely helpful in dealing with the problems of my State, which \nmay very well have differed from the problems of the State of the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair and of the prime sponsor of this \namendment, all of whom have served as chief executives of their \nrespective States.\n  But the notion that somehow block grants are a utopian answer to \nevery problem we have with the current welfare system is, in my \nopinion, disingenuous, and this is particularly true when high-growth \nStates, such as my own, will be left with much, much less resources to \ndeal with the problem of an expanding population.\n  If States are deprived of the funding necessary to do the job, all of \nthe block grant flexibility in the world will not matter a single whit \nbecause States will not be able to do the job, let alone do it better.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with nearly 30 of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle in writing to the majority leader to request his \nsupport for a bipartisan effort to address the funding formula in an \nequitable way. Although the Dole bill includes Senator Hutchison's \nFederal funding formula proposal, it is still, in my judgment, a \ngrossly inadequate approach which penalizes high-growth States.\n  The Republican leader's proposal hurts high-growth States like Nevada \nby capping Federal funding at the fiscal year 1994 level. High-growth \nStates like Nevada will receive less funding at the very time that \ntheir population is exploding. Nevada is one of 19 States under the \nDole-Hutchison Federal funding formula proposal which would be eligible \nto receive a very modest 2.5 percent annual adjustment to Federal \nfunding in the second and subsequent years of the block grant \nauthorization.\n  But, Mr. President, this adjustment does not come even remotely close \nto offsetting the damage caused to my State by reason of the fiscal \nyear 1994 funding cap. Nevada is the fastest growing State in America. \nI invite my colleagues' attention to this chart. It is dramatic. Beyond \nthe comprehension of those of us who have lived in Nevada, as I have, \nfor more than a half a century, if you look at the preceding decade, \n1984 to 1994, Nevada's population has grown by 59.1 percent.\n  If you look at the next fastest State in percentage of growth, that \nof Arizona, 33.7 percent. When I talk about the horrendous impact and \nconsequences of this formula, I am not speaking in the abstract, I am \nspeaking in the specific, and it will be devastating.\n  Nevada's population is projected to increase from 1995 to the year \n2000 by nearly another 15 percent from approximately 1.47 million to \napproximately 1.69 million. Again, Nevada leads the Nation in projected \npopulation growth for the remaining years of this decade.\n  Nevada's AFDC caseload increased 8 percent from fiscal year 1993 to \nfiscal year 1994, the sixth highest increase in the country. The \nnational average was only a 1.4 percent increase. And from fiscal year \n1992 to 1994, Nevada's welfare expenditures increased by nearly 22 \npercent, the fourth highest increase in the country, compared to the \nnational average of only 4 percent.\n  In the 5 years from 1989 to 1994, Nevada experienced a 35.7 percent \nincrease in the number of children under the age of 18 years, the \nhighest increase of any State in the country. Again, by comparison, the \nnational average is 6.1 percent.\n  Under the Republican welfare proposal, fast growing States like \nNevada will suffer a devastating impact. We cannot expect yesterday's \nfunding levels are going to come anywhere near meeting the needs of \nNevada citizens in the years ahead.\n  Under the Dole-Hutchison formula, Nevada would receive $36 million in \nfiscal year 1996. Nevada is already in the year of its implementation \nbehind its projected needs. For Nevada, a 2.5 percent growth increase \nover the preceding year's block grant does not come close to meeting \nits welfare assistance needs.\n  As a consequence, Nevada's State treasury and its taxpayers are \nplaced at risk of having to increase the difference occasioned by the \ncap imposed in this formula.\n  The children's fair share plan funding formula takes into \nconsideration the substantial population growth projections. It does \nthis by allocating Federal funds to States, based very simply on the \nnumber of children who are in poverty in each State.\n  Mr. President, what could be more fair than to base the allocation on \nthe number of children in poverty in each of the respective States?\n  Basing welfare allocations on the number of poor children served puts \nthe emphasis on where the priorities should be in this welfare debate, \nand that is on vulnerable, impoverished children throughout this \nNation, irrespective of where they may live.\n  Traditionally, the main goal of welfare cash assistance programs like \nAFDC has been to children who are impoverished, have a minimum standard \nof living. The need to meet that goal continues.\n  The National Center for Children in Poverty reports that children \nunder the age of 6 living in poverty in America has increased in the 5-\nyear period from 1987 to 1992 by 1 million--from 5 million to 6 \nmillion. In the 20-year period from 1972 to 1992, the number of our \nchildren living in poverty nearly doubled. This, Mr. President, is a \nmost disturbing trend and one that shows little chance of abeyance.\n  None of us want poor children in this country to be unable to count \non having a meal to eat and a place to sleep. If we cannot continue the \ncurrent entitlement status for the cash assistance program, we must \nprovide States sufficient funding on an equitable basis.\n  Nevada, each month, draws thousands of people from surrounding States \nwho come hoping to find jobs. In my own hometown of Las Vegas, 6,000 to \n7,000 people each month move into the greater metropolitan area of Las \nVegas. This population influx also brings a rapidly increasing number \nof children. Tragically and unfortunately, many of those children are \nchildren in poverty.\n  The 1995 Kids Count Data Book found that in 1992, Nevada had 6.4 \npercent of its children in extreme poverty, that they lived in families \nwhose income was below 50 percent of the national poverty level. \nAdditionally, 25 percent of Nevada's children lived in poor and near-\npoor families.\n  Rapid growth States, like Nevada, have always been hurt in receiving \ntheir appropriate share of Federal funds. Population increases and \nincreases in Federal funds have rarely gone hand-in-hand because of \nmany reasons. Maybe because the Federal Government was not efficient \nenough to make the sufficient adjustments.\n  But it is particularly unfair to hold a rapidly growing State, like \nNevada, to its 1994 Federal funding level as a baseline for future \nwelfare assistance funding. But this will happen, unless the Graham \namendment is adopted.\n  Think about the absurdity, for a moment, of using population figures \nfrom 1994 as the baseline for all future welfare assistance funding \nincreases. From day one, under the Dole bill, Nevada's children in \npoverty are punished. Under the Dole proposal, Nevada would receive $36 \nmillion each year from 1996 through 1998. Under the children's fair \nshare plan, Nevada could receive up to $72 million a year. But \nunderstand that the basic overall amount spent on welfare is not the \nissue here. In my opinion, it is the formula used to allocate that \namount.\n  States like New York and California do better under the Dole bill. \nFast-growing States like Nevada are seriously damaged.\n  The Hutchison ``dynamic growth'' proposal serves Nevada children no \nbetter. Once again, Nevada would be held, in 1996, to its 1994 level of \n$36 million. In 1997, Nevada would get $1 million more for a total of \n$37 million. In 1998, Nevada would get an additional $1 million more, \nagain for a total of $38 million. Yes, it is a funding increase. No, it \nis not based on meeting Nevada's population growth nor its needs.\n  I genuinely want to achieve a fair and bipartisan solution to this \ncritical issue. The children's fair share proposal, in my judgment, \nprovides that solution. If your State has a high number of children in \npoverty, your State receives a higher amount of Federal funding. If \nyour State has fewer children in poverty, your State receives a lesser \namount of Federal funding. The Federal funding follows the need. What \ncould be fairer than that?\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to think about the impoverished children \nin \n \n[[Page S 13362]]\n\nAmerica. Let us work together to ensure that those children, regardless \nof where they are living, are going to be provided adequate care on an \nequal basis. They depend upon us to care for them. We must not let them \ndown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have had an excellent debate. I know \nmy colleague from New York wishes to address this amendment, as well.\n  I wish to compliment the parties on both sides of this debate. I \nthink it has been an excellent debate. I note that my friend and \ncolleague from New Mexico is here. He has an amendment. The majority \nleader has indicated to us that he would like to dispose of that \ntonight. My guess is that it is a very important amendment dealing with \nfamily caps. We will have some good debate on that, as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to try and conclude debate on the Graham-Bumpers \namendment as soon as possible so we can go on to debate the Domenici \namendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment. I rise \nto oppose it on a number of grounds and bases.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I support welfare reform. We need \nwelfare reform. We need sweeping reform. We need workfare. But reform \ncannot come solely at the expense of New York, or New York and \nCalifornia, or at the expense of New York, California, and \nPennsylvania, or at the expense of any of those to whom this amendment \ndoes grievous harm. We are not just talking about States; we are \ntalking about harm to the families, to the children that this amendment \nwill devastate.\n  This amendment is not about reform. It is not about welfare formulas \nthat make sense. It is about taking money from poor children in certain \nStates. In many cases, these are the States that have done the most to \nhelp poor people. And now to penalize them as a result of that and to \nshift those dollars, without regard to the level of resources the \nStates are willing to commit on their own, but simply to say that we \nare going to grab more money, we are going to enrich certain States. \nThat's wrong and unacceptable. I am going to point out specifically \nsome of those areas that cause concern.\n  We have tried to be fair in accommodating the concerns of the Senator \nfrom Florida. This bill contains an $877 million supplemental growth \nformula that will benefit Florida and 18 other States anticipating \npopulation growth over the life of this bill. And that is fair and that \nis reasonable. They are going to have additional growth. Let us take \ncare of that.\n  Under the Dole-Hutchison formula, the State of Florida will receive \n$150 million more, over the next 5 years, than they would have received \nunder the Finance Committee's initial proposal. But let me tell you, \nthe amendment that is before us now, the amendment of the Senator from \nFlorida, is fundamentally unfair. Let me tell you what the real impact \nof this amendment would be.\n  No. 1, the amendment would reallocate more than $2 billion from 14 \nStates; 14 States would lose $2 billion, causing a half-million \nfamilies to lose welfare benefits. That is not welfare reform. If we \nwant to kill any chance of welfare reform, then adopt this amendment. \nIndeed maybe that is the basis and the genesis of this amendment--to \nkill reform. New York would lose $749 million in fiscal year 1996 \nalone. Let me tell you what it would be over 5 years, Mr. President: \n$4.5 billion.\n  That is just simply wrong. It is mean spirited, and we have not even \naccounted for the State of California. They have people. They have \nchildren. They have needs. They have been meeting those needs.\n  The loss there would be well over $5 billion. Those two States alone, \n20 million people in New York and 30 million in California--50 million \npeople--would account for three-quarters of the funds that were \nredistributed.\n  That is not what welfare reform should be about. Fairness, yes. But \nnot this kind of attempt to enrich oneself at the expense of others. \nThat is not what this country is about.\n  When there is a disaster, we all pitch in. We do not say, ``What is \nthe population of your State?'' We are there. If there is an \nearthquake, a fire, floods, devastation, we are there.\n  If it costs $6 billion, $8 billion, $9 billion to help the State of \nCalifornia, we do it. If it cost $4 billion or $5 billion to help a \nState, and the State was Florida, we were there. The Senators from New \nYork did not say, ``Well we did not get that portion. We did not get \nthat kind of disaster relief.''\n  That is what Federalism is about. I did not think it was about \nlooking at how we can enrich certain states, and then throwing in a \nbunch of additional States so that we can get votes. That is what this \nbill is about. There are more than a dozen States, 15 I believe, that \nare rewarded arbitrarily--nothing to do with need per se; just worked \ninto the formula so we can get more money to get more votes. Supposedly \nthis way we will get 30 votes because we have given each of these 15 \nStates more money.\n  Is that the way we will run this country? Is that what this \nlegislative body has become?\n  By the way, I have seen these kinds of amendments in the past. They \nare wrong. I do not care whether they come from the Republican side or \nthe Democratic side.\n  Today, there was an amendment offered by one of my colleagues. It \ncould have given New York more money. I voted against it. It would have \ndisadvantaged other States.\n  This is not about trying to be one up on somebody else. That may not \nbe what is intended, but that is what this amendment is. It is one-\nupmanship.\n  We can play that role. It does not take a great genius to figure out \na formula, and we could come up with such a formula, that would enrich \nmaybe 33 States and disadvantage some others. I do not think that is \nwhat we want to be about--arbitrarily rewarding some States.\n  Let me just make several points, and I am not going to take a great \ndeal more time, but I am going to say if one were to look at this chart \nwhich comes from the incredible work of the Northeast-Midwest \nCoalition, under the stewardship of the senior Senator from New York, \nSenator Moynihan, who for years and years and years has been a leader \nin talking about inequities affecting our region. Want to see some \ninequities? I will show you an inequity. If we want to look at what tax \nefforts are and take a look at the Northeast and Midwest from 1981 to \n1994 over a 14-year period of time, you will see there is a $690 \nbillion inequity relating to Federal allocable dollars spent in our \nregion.\n  If we want to change things around, if we want to get into who gets \nmore money, then look at the tax efforts, look at the taxes paid by our \nrespective citizens and our respective States and the amount of money \nthat we get back. We would be pretty well enriched.\n  Let me tell you again, in this work, Senator Moynihan has been a \npioneer in this effort. He has talked about this issue over the years, \nbut it bears repetition right here.\n  If we are going to get into the business of crafting formulas to \nenrich our particular State, fine. But it is a nasty business, and it \ndestroys what Federalism is about.\n  Why, then, we think we have an argument. Between fiscal year 1981 and \n1994 on a cumulative basis, if New York's percentage of fair, allocable \nFederal spending is equal to the Federal share of taxes paid, the State \nof New York would have received an additional $142 billion. Where is \nour money? We want $142 billion.\n  I did not know we were going to get into this business of saying, \n``Oh, no, we sent $142 billion down, more than what we got back.'' That \nis what this kind of amendment is doing. It is mischief-making.\n  Take a look at the State of Florida. On the other hand, if we had \nsaid, ``You get as much as you put in,'' the State of Florida would \nhave received $38.5 billion less. In other words, it has done better. \nIt got $38.5 billion more than it sent down to Washington.\n  Not bad. But now we are going to find a way to get more money for the \nState of Florida. Where do we take it from? We take it from New York, \nits taxpayers and, more importantly, the poor kids, the poor children, \nthe poor families. That is absolutely wrong. It is not acceptable.\n \n[[Page S 13363]]\n\n  Now, as I have said, we want meaningful welfare reform. And, by the \nway, reasonable people can disagree on the basis of reform. My \ndistinguished colleague and I agree that there has to be welfare \nreform. We may not agree on every part of this, but I tell you one \nthing: We all recognize when formulas or propositions--whether they \ncome from the Republican side or the Democratic side--are basically not \nfair.\n  You do not just enrich States so that you can get Senators from those \nStates, so you can say, ``Look, under my formula I will get the $20 \nmillion a year more with no rational basis.''\n  By the way, that is another concern, and I will speak to that when I \nget 2 minutes tomorrow morning, whereby if you have an 80 percent \nmaintenance of effort, and if the Graham amendment were enacted, New \nYork would be forced to contribute $500 million in welfare spending \nthan would get in its grant from the Federal Government. Incredible.\n  We had better protect our citizens. If there are areas where the \nformulas are inequitable and we can make them work better, we should \nattempt to do that, and we have attempted to do that. But we should not \nget into the business of advancing one's own interest for one's own \nState at the expense of another. I do not think that is what we should \nbe about. I do not think that is what this debate should be about.\n  I have to say there is a tremendous imbalance here, $690 billion over \n14 years, if we look at how much our region paid and how much it got \nback.\n  I want to thank my senior colleague and Senator, the distinguished \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan, who has made possible the \ngathering of so much of this information that we could present tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator from New York yield for a \nclarification.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You mentioned under the 80 percent maintenance of \neffort, New York would lose $500 million.\n  I think what you meant, Senator, was if this amendment passes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Exactly. I thank my colleague.\n  Under this amendment, if this amendment were adopted--the irony would \nbe that it would wind up that we would have to spend $1.84 billion and \nwe would only be getting $1.32 billion from the Federal side. In other \nwords, New York would have to contribute roughly $500 million more it \nwould receive from the Federal Government if Senator Graham's amendment \nwere to pass.\n  It would be devastating. We are not talking about devastating to a \nState, or to some organization, some institution. We are talking about \nover 300,000 families that would be impacted--people, live human \nbeings, who, in most cases, would have tremendous problems.\n  We are trying to find out how to mainstream them. Mainstreaming is \none thing. Workfare is one thing, and I support it wholeheartedly. But \nto impose a radical reallocation of dollars that will deny shelter or a \nmeal to people in my state is not what welfare reform should be about.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Domenici for pointing out what this \nimpact of this amendment would be, and I certainly want to add my \nsupport to the efforts of Senator Moynihan, my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from New York, in his opposition, to this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I simply thank my distinguished \nfriend and colleague for the forcefulness with which he has made an \nunmistakably accurate point.\n  I thank him for his generous personal references.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank both our colleagues from New York \nfor their statements. I note the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, \nwishes to make a statement. I will just mention to my colleague, \nSenator Domenici, has an important amendment he is prepared to discuss. \nAnd we have several other amendments we are supposed to, basically, \ndebate tonight and hopefully have for consideration and vote tomorrow.\n  So it is my hope we can conclude Senator Graham's debate with this \namendment, take up Senator Domenici's amendment, and then I know \nSenator Daschle has two amendments, Senator DeWine has an amendment, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Faircloth, and Senator Boxer, that we would \nalso like discuss this evening and have ready for a vote tomorrow.\n  We still have a lot of work to do tonight and it is my hope maybe we \ncan move forward with this debate as expeditiously as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if no one seeks recognition to speak on \nthe amendment, I would like to make a few comments in closing, \nrecognizing that there is some time reserved tomorrow morning for final \ncomments on this matter.\n  My comments this evening will be, first, to express my appreciation \nto all of the Senators who have participated in the debate on this \namendment on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of this issue. I \nrecognize that, whenever you are attempting to allocate not only a zero \nsum, a fixed amount of money, but what actually is a declining amount \nof money because of the decision to freeze 1994 allocations in place \nuntil the year 2000 with no adjustment for inflation, no adjustment for \ndemographic changes, no adjustment for economic changes, you are \ndealing with, effectively, a declining amount of dollars to attempt to \nallocate. That makes the issues of fairness even more difficult, but I \nsuggest even more urgent.\n  I would like to respond to some of the comments that were made. \nBefore doing so, Mr. President, I send to the desk a series of tables \nand other materials which were referenced in my comments, or comments \nof Senator Bumpers or Senator Bryan, in behalf of this amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent they be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the junior Senator from New York, Senator \nD'Amato, said he opposed this amendment because it had no relationship \nto need, that it was arbitrary and capricious. That is exactly the \npoint. What is more related to need than to allocate funds for poor \nchildren based on where poor children are in the year you are going to \ndistribute the money?\n  What this amendment states is that the fundamental basis for \nallocating funds will be where poor children are in the year of \ndistribution. If the State of Missouri represents 3 percent of the poor \nchildren in America in 1996, it will get 3 percent of the money. If it \nrepresents 2.9 percent of the poor children in 1997, it will get 2.9 \npercent of the money. That, to me, is a principle which is \nfundamentally as fair and straightforward as the reputation is of \nMissouri for a State that wants you to ``show me'' why you are \nproposing to do what you are proposing to do.\n  There has been a theme through some of the comments that have been \nmade that we are holding the world constant, and therefore we can \ncontinue to hold constant the way in which we have distributed money in \nthe past for the support of poor children. The fact is, we are engaged \nin reform--some people would say in revolution--of the welfare system. \nCould it be more paradoxical that we are fundamentally changing the \nobjectives of the system, the structure and administration of the \nsystem, the relationship of the States, the Federal Government, and the \nindividuals affected, yet we are going to continue to distribute the \nFederal money, 99 percent of it, based on the old allocation formula? I \nthink that belies our real commitment to reform.\n  What are some of the changes in this revolution in welfare? Those \nchanges include massive new mandates to the States to undertake job \ntraining and preparation, including placement services where necessary, \ntransportation services, and child care services for those persons who \nare trying to collect up the necessary personal capabilities to become \nindependent, employed persons in our society.\n  Those mandates have very serious implications to the States. The \nState of Texas is going to have to spend 84 percent of the Federal \nmoney that it will receive under this program in \n\n[[Page S 13364]]\norder to meet those mandates. Yet we are going to continue to \ndistribute money to the State of Texas as if those mandates did not \nexist because, in fact, those mandates did not exist when this basis of \nallocation of funds was developed.\n  We are going to distribute, over the next 5 years, $85 billion of \nFederal money--this is not State money, this is not money to which any \nlocality has a particular claim, this is money that belonged to all the \npeople of the United States and is paid by all the people of the United \nStates--we are going to distribute $85 billion to a status quo program, \nhow things were in 1994. We are going to distribute a shade less than \n$900 million based on a formula which will commence 3 years from now, \nthat will provide an increase to a handful of States based on growth \nand extreme poverty in terms of how far they fall below the national \naverage in their support for poor children.\n  It has been suggested that there is an unfairness in this adjustment, \nthat we are overly imposing on some States. Let me just look at this \nchart. The garnet bar represents what is in the amendment that is the \nbasis of this legislation, the Dole proposal. The gold bar represents \nthe modification in funding if the Graham-Bumpers amendment were \nadopted. Let us just look at New York and Arkansas. Under the Dole \nbill, New York will receive over $2,000 per poor child in 1996--over \n$2,000. Arkansas will receive less than $400 per poor child.\n  If this amendment, that has been described as overreaching and \nunfair, is adopted, what will happen? What will happen is that in 1996, \nNew York will have approximately $1,400 for every poor child, and \nArkansas, that egregious, greedy State of Arkansas, will jump up to \napproximately $550 per poor child. That is what happens when greed \ntakes over the system and Arkansas begins to move somewhat toward \nparity.\n  It will take another 3 years before Arkansas finally reaches New York \nin parity. Under the proposal that is in the current bill, it will take \nArkansas 177 years--177 years before Arkansas would be in parity with \nNew York, under the bill as proposed by the majority leader. Yet we are \nbeing accused of being overreaching.\n  It has been suggested that our amendment is inappropriate because of \nthe maintenance of effort provision that was in this bill. When we \nwrote this amendment there was zero maintenance of effort in this bill. \nThe maintenance of effort--that is what will be required of States in \norder to be eligible to participate--has been a work-in-progress over \nthe last several weeks.\n  We submit this, what we think is the fundamentally appropriate manner \nin which to allocate $85 billion of Federal funds over the next 5 years \nfor poor children, which is the radical idea. Let us put the money \nwhere the poor children are. When the Senate in its wisdom adopts this \namendment, then we will come back and look at the issue of what that \nsays in terms of appropriate modifications to a maintenance-of-effort \nprovision.\n  It has been suggested that there is some Machiavellian plot here, \nthat we are trying to defeat welfare reform. I want to state in the \nstrongest possible terms that I am a strong supporter of welfare \nreform. My State has two of the most successful welfare work projects \nin the country.\n  I spent a day recently working at the project in Pensacola which has \nput almost 600 people into productive work, which will have half of the \nwelfare population of Pensacola involved in a transition program in the \nnext few months, which already has approximately 25 to 30 percent \ninvolved, is serious about the business, and has learned what it is \ngoing to take in order to be successful.\n  So I take second place to no one in my commitment to seeing that \nthere is real welfare reform. But I would suggest that, first, in terms \nof what is in the interest of the vast number of States in America as \nseen on this map where all of the States in yellow will be better \nequipped to meet their responsibilities when the money is distributed \nbased on where poor children are, that we have a better chance of \nachieving real welfare reform under that allocation of funds than under \none which continues to impoverish a large number of States in America.\n  I believe that on this Senate floor it is going to be difficult--it \nmust be difficult for many Senators who are here tonight; they can read \nthe charts; they know what the implications of this are to their \nState--to vote for a bill, even one which has many provisions that they \nsupport which contains at its heart, at its core, such a cancerous \nunfairness in terms of how the Federal money will be distributed in \nterms of where the poor children, the poor children in their State, the \npoor children in America, live.\n  Finally, in terms of, is this a plot to sink welfare reform? In my \njudgment, this is not the plot. The plot is there, Mr. President. It is \nthere in the bill as authored by the majority leader. And it is there \nbecause there are not the resources available in that formula, in that \nbill, in order to meet the objective of having 25 percent of the \nwelfare beneficiaries in meaningful employment in 1996 and 50 percent \nin meaningful employment in the year 2000.\n  That is not Senator Graham's assessment. That is, among others, the \nassessment of the Congressional Budget Office, which has estimated that \nupwards of 40-plus States will not be able to meet the work \nrequirements in the legislation offered by the majority leader, in \nlarge part because they do not have the resources to pay for those \nthings that will be necessary to prepare people for work, including the \nappropriate child care for their dependent children while they are \npreparing themselves to work and during those initial weeks of \nemployment.\n  So there may be a plot here to sink welfare reform and to show that, \nin fact, it is unattainable, but that plot is contained in the \nlegislation which is the underlying proposal of the majority leader, \nnot in this proposal, which in fact would give all States an equal \nopportunity to use their creativity, imagination, and unleash what the \npresiding officer as a former Governor and I as a former Governor know \nto be the energy of States to meet a very serious national problem at \nthe local level.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the close attention of all of my colleagues \nto the implication of this amendment and urge tomorrow, when this is \nbefore us for a vote, their favorable consideration.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n[S12SE5-358]{S13364\n\n                                                           STATE-BY-STATE WELFARE ALLOCATIONS

Likewise, the analysis assumes no cost of     \n  related child care for those leaving welfare for work and those sanctioned.                                                                           \n\n  \n                                                                    ____\n             Graham-Bumpers Children's Fair Share Amendment\n\n       Principles: A formula based on fairness should be guided by \n     the following principles:\n       (1) Block grant funding should reflect need or the number \n     of persons in the individual states who need assistance;\n       (2) A state's access to federal funding should increase if \n     the number of people in need of assistance increases;\n       (3) States should not be permanently disadvantaged based \n     upon their policy choices and circumstances in 1994; and\n       (4) If requirements and penalties are to be imposed on \n     states, fairness dictates that all states have an equitable \n     and reasonable chance of reaching those goals.\n       S. 1120 fails to meet each and every test of fairness.\n\n\n             GRAHAM-BUMPERS CHILDREN'S FAIR SHARE PROPOSAL\n\n       The Graham-Bumpers Children's Fair Share proposal allocates \n     funding based on the number of poor children in each state. \n     In sharp contrast to S. 1120, the Graham-Bumpers amendment \n     meets all the principles of an improved and much more \n     equitable formula allocation.\n       The amendments is needs-based, adjusts for population and \n     demographic changes, treats all poor children equitably, does \n     not permanently disadvantage states based on previous year's \n     spending in a system that is being dismantled, and allows all \n     states a more equitable chance at achieving the work \n     requirements in S. 1120. The Graham-Bumpers Children's Fair \n     Share measure would establish a fair, equitable and level \n     playing field for poor children in America, regardless of \n     where they live. \n\n[[Page S 13367]]\n\n       Disparities in funding would be narrowed in the short-run \n     and eliminated over time--in sharp contrast to S. 1120.\n       Children's Fair Share Allocation Formula: The Children's \n     Fair Share formula would allocate funding based on a three-\n     year average of the number of children in poverty. This \n     information would come from the Bureau of the Census in its \n     annual estimate through sampling data. With the latest data \n     available, the Secretary would determine the state-by-state \n     allocations and publish the data in the Federal Register on \n     January 15 of every year.\n       Small State Minimum Allocation: For any State whose \n     allocation was less than 0.6%, the minimum allocation would \n     be set at the lesser of 0.6% of the total allocation or twice \n     the actual FY 1994 expenditure level.\n       Allocation Increase Ceiling: For all states except those \n     covered by the small state minimum allocation, the amount of \n     the allocation would be restricted to increase not more than \n     50% over FY 1994 expenditure levels in the first year and to \n     50% increases for every subsequent year.\n       Final Adjustment to Minimize Adverse Impact: The savings \n     from the ``allocation increase ceiling'' would exceed that \n     for ``small state minimum allocation''. The net effect of \n     these adjustments would be reallocated among the states who \n     receive less than their FY 1994 actual expenditures.\n       Implications for the Medicaid Debate: The importance of a \n     fair funding formula to states cannot be overstated.\n       With similar proposals to change the Medicaid program \n     expected later this year, how these block grants are \n     allocated among the states is absolutely critical. More than \n     four out of every 10 dollars that Washington sends to state \n     governments are Medicaid dollars. Medicaid is nearly five \n     times bigger than the federal role in welfare: $81 billion a \n     year versus $17 billion. If Congress ``reforms'' welfare by \n     locking in past spending patterns and inequities, that would \n     set a dangerous precedent for Medicaid.\n       The unfairness and inequity caused by the S. 1120 Formula\n\n       Under S. 1120, most states will receive a block grant \n     amount frozen at fiscal year 1994 levels through fiscal year \n     2000. Past inequities would be locked into place and future \n     demographic or economic changes would not be adjusted for by \n     S. 1120's funding formula.\n       A small number of states would qualify for an extremely \n     limited 2.5% annual adjustment in the second and subsequent \n     years of the block grant authorization. To qualify, states \n     must meet either of two tests:\n       Federal spending per poor person in the state must be below \n     the national average and population growth in the state is \n     above the national average; or,\n       Federal spending per poor person in the state in fiscal \n     year 1994 is below 35% of the national average.\n       S. 1120 Exacerbates and Makes Permanent Enormous \n     Disparities: A formula based largely on shares of 1994 \n     federal spending would result in large disparities between \n     states in federal funding per poor child. For example, under \n     S. 1120, Mississippi would receive $331 per poor child per \n     year while New York would receive $2,036 or over six times \n     more per poor child than Mississippi. Massachusetts would \n     receive $2,177 or at least five times more per poor child \n     than the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, South \n     Carolina and Texas. There is no justification for poor \n     children to be treated with less or more value by the federal \n     government.\n       Proponents of the bill will argue that some states will \n     qualify for 2.5% annual adjustments to address this \n     disparity. However, the bill fails to provide aid to nine \n     states (Kentucky, Oklahoma, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, \n     Nebraska, West Virginia, Kansas and North Dakota) with below \n     average federal funding per poor child.\n       Moreover, even for those who do qualify, the adjustment is \n     glacial and may fail to ever achieve parity. For example, it \n     is estimated that it will take Mississippi over 50 years to \n     reach parity.\n       No Policy Justification: There is no justification for \n     allocating future federal funds based on 1994 state spending. \n     The needs of states in the future, both in terms of \n     demographic and economic changes, will have no bearing on \n     spending in 1994. States should not be permanently \n     disadvantaged based upon their policy choices and \n     circumstances in 1994.\n       Penalizes Efficiency: Basing all future funding on 1994 \n     spending locks in historical inequities and inefficiencies. \n     In 1994, the national average monthly administrative expense \n     per case was $53.42, but New York and New Jersey had costs, \n     respectively, of $106.68 and $105.26, almost eight times as \n     high as West Virginia's cost of $13.34. Those states with \n     higher administrative costs in fiscal year 1994 would receive \n     block grant amounts reflecting their higher fiscal year 1994 \n     costs for the next five years.\n       Fails to Account for Population Growth: Initial disparities \n     would be further exacerbated by different rates of population \n     growth. Between 1995-2000, ten states are projected to grow \n     at least 8% while eight are projected to grow less than 1% or \n     experience a population decline. Among the 25 states \n     projected to have higher population growth, 17 would receive \n     initial allocations below the national average.\n       The initial disparities locked in by the Dole approach \n     would actually intensify as a result of these different rates \n     of anticipated population growth through the end of the \n     decade.\n       Proponents of the bill will argue that some states will \n     qualify for 2.5% annual adjustments to address this \n     disparity. However, the bill fails to provide six states \n     (Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, California and Delaware) \n     with projected above-average population growth with aid.\n       Loser States Double Disadvantaged: States that receive less \n     than their fair share of funding per poor child are the least \n     likely to meet the work requirements under S. 1120, which \n     leads to further funding sanctions. The additional cost of \n     the work program and associated child care in S. 1120 would \n     take up virtually all of the funding for those receiving less \n     than the national average funding per poor child.\n       The additional costs to Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee \n     and Texas are estimated to exceed 80% of federal funding to \n     those states in the year 2000 compared to less than 40% of \n     the\n      cost in states such as California and New York, Oregon and \n     Wisconsin. Ironically, those states receiving less than \n     their fair share of funding will most likely fail to meet \n     the work requirements, and thus, be subject to the 5% \n     penalty in S. 1120.\n       Growth States Often Double Disadvantaged: Most growth \n     states will be double disadvantaged. While population growth \n     will fail to be adequately accounted for in the federal \n     funding formula, growth states will have rapidly increasing \n     numbers of people needed to meet the participation \n     requirements. States such as Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, \n     Hawaii, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas will need to have three \n     or four times the number of people participating in work \n     program by 2000 than they do in 1994, despite no or very \n     little increasing in funding over the period.\n       Block Grant Formula Are ``Forever'': If the Dole formula is \n     adopted, we are creating something that will be difficult, if \n     not impossible, to change for a very long time. Example after \n     example can be cited of block grants that are being allocated \n     today based on funding levels to states over a decade ago.\n       No Lesson Learned: The General Accounting Office in a \n     report issued in February 1995 report entitled ``Block Grants \n     Characteristics, Experience and Lessons Learned'' wrote, ``. \n     . .because initial funding allocations [used in current block \n     grants] were based on prior categorical grants, they were not \n     necessarily equitable.'' The Dole approach would once again \n     fail to address these concerns.\n\n\n western governors' association: Resolution 95-001, passed unanimously \n                            on June 25, 1995\n\n       In formulating the block grant proposals for welfare and \n     Medicaid the Western Governors' Association strongly urges \n     Congress to account for [these] realities in order to \n     implement block grant funding in an equitable fashion:\n       (1) State population levels are growing at different rates, \n     and differences must be recognized in any block grant \n     formula.\n       (2) States have different benefit levels for both welfare \n     and Medicaid and the block grant should not reward states \n     that have been operating less efficiently and penalize states \n     that have been operating more efficiently.\n       (3) The need for welfare and Medicaid are related to the \n     business cycle, and the federal government should offer \n     assistance to states during down cycles that is timely and \n     responsive.\n       After selecting a block grant approach, the next logical \n     question is, ``How should the block grant be divided among \n     the states?'' The compromise reached by your committee was to \n     prorate funds based on historical patterns. In a static \n     world, that would be a perfect solution. However, as you \n     know, Texas has been and will likely continue to be a high \n     growth state. In the interest of fairness, I would urge you \n     to add a significant growth factor to the block grant that is \n     tied to population needs.--Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, \n     April 25, 1995.\n       This debate is about fairness and real change versus the \n     status quo . . . . Incredibly, the ``new and improved'' \n     formulas approved by the U.S. House do nothing to address the \n     migration of people within the United States and, in fact, \n     simply set arbitrary spending patterns in stone for the \n     foreseeable future.--Comptroller John Sharp of Texas, April \n     25, 1995.\n       It seems to me any welfare proposal should have a basic \n     principle to treat all poor children equitably, and not favor \n     any state's children at the expense of another's. . . . If \n     Congress is going to radically redesign its welfare laws and \n     block grant the money to the states, it needs to allocate \n     that money fairly. States shouldn't be penalized in 1996, or \n     rewarded for that matter, for spending practices of previous \n     years in a system being discarded. That borders on the absurd \n     and it contradicts the very intent of Congress doing away \n     with the system and all of its inherent flaws.--Gov. Lawton \n     Chiles of Florida, May 1, 1995.\n       If it's done strictly on prevous year's experience, that is \n     going to disproportionately punish the Southern States. . . . \n     Distributing the funds based on the percentage of population \n     in poverty, with some consideration of the state's tax base \n     would be much more equitable.--Gwen Williams, Medicaid \n     Commissioner for Alabama (quoted on May 22, 1995).\n       A poor child in Michigan would get twice as much as a child \n     in my state. That's not right. It's not fair. . . . Let's \n     make equal \n\n[[Page S 13368]]\n     protection of children the foundation for reform.--Gov. Lawton Chiles \n     of Florida, May 11, 1995.\n       When a lump sum distribution is made to the states, what \n     fraction of the total should each state receive? The best \n     approach is to base each state's share on the proportion of \n     that nation's poor who reside in the state. A much less \n     desirable approach is currently favored by the Republican \n     leadership in Congress and is reflected in the House bill. \n     This approach would block-grant funds based on current \n     federal spending, rewarding the states that currently spend \n     the most, instead of assisting those with the greatest \n     need.--Dr. John C. Goodman (Goldwater Institute, paper dated \n     July 1995).\n       If federal block grants to the states are based on current \n     federal outlays, the effect will be to permanently entrench \n     failed welfare policies in some states. . . . Equally \n     important, the philosophically inclined among us. . . . \n     should wonder why the Congress would enact a block grant \n     system which rewards and continues profligate spending at the \n     expense of states which have done far better at keeping costs \n     down.--Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona, April 26, 1995.\n       Block grant funding would be locked in, in spite of rapidly \n     changing patterns of need. This dissonance between need and \n     funding would produce devastating results over a five year \n     period.--Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and 39 other senators (in \n     a letter to Sens. Robert Packwood and Daniel Patrick Moynihan \n     on May 23, 1995).\n       Under the [Maternal Child Health Block Grant], funds \n     continue to be distributed primarily on the basis of funds \n     received in fiscal year 1981 under the previous categorical \n     programs. . . . We found that economic and demographic \n     changes are not adequately reflected in the current \n     allocation, resulting in problems of equity.--General \n     Accounting Office, February 1995.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to the debate over \nthe amendment to redistribute the limited funds in this block grant \nbased on the number of poor children in each State.\n  First let me say that I am pleased by the bipartisan nature of this \namendment. There are many areas in the debate where both Democrats and \nRepublicans can agree. We all agree that the current system does not \nwork. It does not put people to work. It does not give States enough \nflexibility to craft a system that will keep them working. We can agree \non what is wrong with the current system. What is much more difficult \nis finding some common ground on the best way to fix it.\n  President Clinton called on Congress to end welfare as we know it. \nYet here we are building a new system on the rotting foundations of a \nsystem that we all agree has failed.\n  Mr. President, welfare reform should be about protecting children and \nputting their parents to work. This bill is a step in the right \ndirection, but it uses a formula to distribute block grant funds that \nfails to give States the resources they need to accomplish these goals. \nThe children's fair share amendment gives States with high populations \nof poor children the resources they need to serve those children. It \nbases the funds a State receives on the number of needy people the \nState will be asked to serve. It is fair.\n  In Arkansas, 25 percent of children live in poverty. One in every \nfour children in my State lives below the poverty line.\n  Under the formula in this bill, Arkansas would get $375 per poor \nchild, while the national average is over $1,000 and some States \nreceive over $2,000 per poor child. This block grant is to be used for \ncash benefits, but it also pays for work programs and for child care so \nparents who find work can afford to keep working. It pays for \nadministrative costs. Arkansas needs to pay a program director and to \nbuy pens and paper just like every other state. Why should the Federal \nGovernment pay over $2,000 for each poor child in New York and \nMassachusetts and less than $400 per child in Arkansas and South \nCarolina?\n  I support this amendment, but I recognize that it still leaves large \ndisparities in spending per poor child between States. Under this \namendment, spending in Arkansas per poor child will rise from $375 to \n$563. In Massachusetts it will fall from $1,761 to $1,341. In New York, \nit will fall from $2,036 to $1,375. States that are getting more money \nper poor child now will still get more money per poor child should this \namendment pass. This formula doesn't call for complete equity, but it \ndoes move us a little closer to a distribution of Federal funds that is \nfair.\n  This debate is not about benefit levels. We should not lock States \ninto the policy decisions they made in years past. I applaud States \nthat can afford to spend more money on welfare. But, the Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility to treat children equally, regardless \nof where they live.\n  This formula is based on what is really at the heart of the debate on \nwelfare reform--poor children. And I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida as well \nas the Senator from Arkansas for their eloquent debate and the Senator \nfrom New York for giving the counter view. I think we have had \nexcellent debate on this amendment. I know my friend and colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, has an amendment that he wishes to \ndiscuss.\n  If no one else wishes to speak on the Graham amendment, Mr. \nPresident, I hope that we will have debate on the Domenici amendment, \nand I ask my other colleagues who have requested time to discuss their \namendments tonight. Senator Domenici has mentioned that he will not be \non the floor too long on this amendment. Other Senators that have \namendments listed in the unanimous-consent order, if they wish to \ndebate those tonight, I hope they will come to the floor in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I add that, if they think they \nwish not to do so, they would let us know.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished floor \nmanager would yield for a question. We are going to vote tomorrow, as I \nunderstand it. We are going to stack the votes on these amendments. I \njust wondered if there had been any kind of consent agreement about \nallowing the proponents and opponents 2 or 3 minutes before each vote \nto sort of recapitulate the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to respond to our colleague from \nArkansas, part of the unanimous-consent agreement would allow 10 \nminutes of debate to be equally divided between the Senators on this \namendment, and actually on the Graham amendment there will be 20 \nminutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n                           Amendment No. 2575\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I call up my printed amendment No. 2575 \nand ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, that will be the pending \nquestion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nMoynihan, Nunn, Breaux, and Kassebaum be added as original cosponsors \nof the Domenici amendment on a family cap.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a very serious issue. I do not \nthink we are going to take a lot of time tonight because I think the \nissue has been thoroughly discussed in various meetings, in \nconferences, and in caucuses, and clearly among various groups in our \ncountry, pro-life groups, pro-choice groups, proabortion groups, \nwelfare reform groups, and so on.\n  So I am probably only going to take 15 or 20 minutes at the most. I \ndo not want anyone to think that brevity has anything to do with the \nseriousness of this issue.\n  I want to talk a little bit about what I am trying to do and give the \nSenate my best perception of why I think it is the best thing we can do \nin a welfare reform bill that is attempting to experiment, innovate, \nand send a program that has failed back to the States so that they \nmight consider handling it differently and tailoring it to the needs of \ntheir States within the amount of money that is going to be allowed in \nwhatever formula we end up adopting.\n  So, as currently amended, the bill in front of us contains a \nprovision requiring States to impose a so-called family cap. This \nprovision says that, if a mother has a child while on welfare, the \nState cannot increase cash benefits to that mother for that child.\n  I want to stress that what we are saying to the States is, even if \nyou consider it to be the best thing to do, and even if you have some \nevidence that, working within a proposal that provides additional cash \nbenefits, you might prevent more teenagers from having children or \nwelfare mothers from having children, you cannot do it \n\n[[Page S 13369]]\nbecause, while we are busy here saying let us send these programs to \nthe States, we are busy in this bill saying, but we know best, the U.S. \nCongress knows best.\n  The Governors came to us and said, let us run the programs. We have \nnow said, Governors, you have to run it with State legislators. We \nvoted that in recently.\n  So out in the country Republicans have been acknowledging that we \nwant to send programs closer to home where those who are close to the \npeople can carry out the laws as they see them best for their people.\n  Why do we decide then, with all of that excellent rhetoric about \nsending programs closer to home, to Governors and legislators, why do \nwe think we are so wise that we say with reference to one of the most \nserious problems around--teenage pregnancies and welfare mothers that \nhave children--we know the way to fix that is to say if you are a \nwelfare mother and have a child, the State cannot give you any cash \nassistance? Mr. President, I am not wise enough to know whether they \nshould or whether they should not.\n  So my amendment is a very simple amendment. In fact, I think I could \ncall it after one of the most distinguished Republican Governors \naround, for I could call it the Engler amendment. It happens that he is \nnot a Senator, so we are going to call it the Domenici-Moynihan \namendment. It could be the Engler amendment, Governor Engler, because \nhe said without any question, testifying before the Budget Committee, \nwhich I happen to chair, that ``conservative strings are no better than \nliberal strings.'' Got it? He said, ``Conservative strings are no \nbetter than liberal strings.''\n  For what was he arguing? He was arguing for his State to have the \nauthority to determine whether there should be a family cap or not and \nthat they ought to be able to put a plan together on a yearly basis. \nThey do not even have to get that plan on for 5 years. We are sending \nthem a 5-year State entitlement, I say to my friend from New York. Each \nyear they are going to get for 5 years a State entitlement.\n  What Governor Engler was saying is, let us every year decide on a \nplan to use that money in the best interests of those who need welfare \nassistance. And, mind you, everyone should know that the Senator from \nNew Mexico is here arguing about this aspect of a growing disagreement \nin the Senate, but I want welfare reform. And I want it to be a 5-year \nprogram, not a program that people can have forever. And we are on the \nroad to doing that. It should not have been a lifestyle. It should have \nbeen a stopover point to get some assistance and training and get on \nwith trying to do for yourself.\n  So make no bones about that. That is what I want. And I believe the \nStates are apt to do a better job than we have done. Why? Because I \nthink they can experiment and innovate, and, frankly, I cannot \nunderstand, since that is the basis of all of this, why in the world we \nwould say that to them, but when it comes to one of the most serious \nproblems with reference to society today--unwed mothers and teenage \npregnancies--we know best. We know best. And we think in our wisdom \nthat if we say no cash benefits, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire in the chair, that somehow or another it will reduce \nthe number of children born to teenagers or mothers who happen to be on \nwelfare. And there is no empirical evidence that that is true.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. None.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. None. There is a bit, a smattering of evidence that \ncame out of the State of New Jersey because they tried this, and that \nsmattering of evidence was soon refuted by an in-depth study by Rutgers \nUniversity which ended up suggesting that probably it had no effect at \nall with reference to the numbers of pregnancies. As a matter of fact, \nI do not know why it took so long and two studies, one they did at the \nState level and one by Rutgers.\n  Can we really believe, with the problems teenagers are having and the \nsocietal mixup that they find themselves in, that cash benefits are \ngoing to keep them from getting pregnant? I cannot believe it. Frankly, \nthere is no evidence of that.\n  Let me tell you, there is a smattering of evidence--not a lot, I say \nto my friend from New York, but a little bit--that abortions have \nincreased, that abortions have increased.\n  Frankly, that is not too illogical either. If one is going to stand \nup and argue that by denying $284 or $320, just that notion out there \nwill keep them from getting pregnant and having babies out of wedlock \nor as welfare mothers, why would it not be logical to assume that if \nthey are pregnant somebody would say, ``You are not going to get any \nhelp. Why don't you have an abortion.''\n  If one might work, the other might work. I do not want the second \none. I do not want to be for a welfare program that I have to vote for \nand have on my conscience that I was part of a program to do some good \nand at the same time said to teenagers, ``Maybe you ought to get an \nabortion.'' I do not want to vote for that.\n  So some people ask me: Why do you offer this amendment? After all, \nthe bill before us says there can be some noncash--there can be; it is \npermissive--some noncash benefits that can be provided. Well, I want \nthem to be able to provide noncash benefits, but I want them to be able \nto provide cash benefits, not mandatory but that they can.\n  Now, Mr. President, from what I can tell, clearly we do not know what \nwe are talking about in terms of impact when we say, tell the States \nwhat to do and tell them not to give one penny to a welfare mother, \nteenager or otherwise, who has another child, when we stand up and say, \nwe do not want any more teenage pregnancies, we do not want any more \nwelfare mothers who have another child, and then to say, and if we just \ndo not give them any money, it will all stop.\n  Frankly, that is the state of the debate we are in, as I see it. I \nwould almost think that we would have been within our rights to say \nthey have to continue to support them. But I do not choose to do that.\n  My amendment is very simple and very neutral. If Governor Engler, who \nhas designed one of the best welfare programs in America--and, \nincidentally, one of the best Medicaid block grant programs on waivers \nand otherwise--if he chooses to say I have a program and I want some \ncash benefits to the second child of one of these situations that we \nreally pray to God would not be around, but if he says I would like to \ntry that for 2 or 3 years, why should we say no? Why should we say no? \nUnder the guise of what authority, what wisdom, what prerogative other \nthan we know best and it might sound good? It might sound good to say \nwe are not going to let them have any cash. That may really resonate \nout there very well. But I am not sure in the end that we would not be \nbetter off, since we are trying a program for 5 years and giving an \nentitlement, to decide that conservative strings are no better than \nliberal strings, to quote the distinguished Governor, Governor Engler, \nfrom the State of Michigan.\n  I know my friend--and he is my friend. I just saw him arrive in the \nChamber. The first time he started sitting at committee hearings I sat \nright by him in Banking, and I have great respect for him--and I just \nhappen on this one to disagree. I think we are going to have to vote on \nit, and then obviously the House has different opinions yet from what \nwe have.\n  I wish to just once again say that in New Jersey, the State that \npioneered the family cap, originally claimed through officials that \nthere was a reduction in out-of-wedlock births. Subsequent studies from \nRutgers University indicates that that cap had no significant effect on \nbirth rates among welfare mothers. More ominously, in May, New Jersey's \nwelfare officials announced that the abortion rate actually increased \n3.6 percent in 8 months after the New Jersey statutes barred additional \npayments to women on welfare.\n  Now, I am not vouching for these statistics. That is a small \npercentage and a short period of time. But it surely points up, Mr. \nPresident and fellow Senators, that we really do not know. If we really \ndo not know, it would seem to me we ought to err on the side of giving \nthe Governors and legislatures who have to otherwise put the program \ntogether this option.\n  If they want to put the family caps on, let them vote it in. If they \ndo not want to, let them have a plan that provides otherwise. And it \nwould seem to \n\n[[Page S 13370]]\nme that we will end up having done a far better job under the \ncircumstances for the poor people in this country, poor in many ways, \nnot only poor financially but poor of spirit, clearly, though many of \nthem do not like the situation they are in.\n  We ought to continue pushing for job training and employment \nopportunities and employment because that will build a better society \nfor them and that spirit that is so down might be lifted up and they \nmight have a chance.\n  Now, I urge that my colleagues resist putting strings back into this \nblock grant. And, finally, I point out there is no budgetary impact, no \nbudgetary savings attributed to the family cap provision. So I am not \nhere arguing for more money. I am merely arguing that with whatever \nmoney the States get, let them be able to pass judgment on this aspect \nof their program, which is very, very difficult for us to comprehend in \nterms of the human aspects of it.\n  And I hope I am not, by doing this, causing this bill any harm, this \nwelfare bill, because anybody that listened to me here tonight knows I \nwant to try this welfare reform. And I think there is room for the \nDomenici-Moynihan amendment as a part of this program as we send it \nback to the States to see if we cannot do better than the last 2 or 3 \nyears.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I could not have stated this case more emphatically, \nwith more clarity and more charity than the Senator from New Mexico. We \nare talking about children who do not have any control over when they \ncome into the world or in what circumstances.\n  I would want to make one point. It need not be made in the Senate \nChamber, but just for the record. There is a notion that somehow \nwelfare families are large. They are not. They are smaller than the \naverage, husband-and-wife family. The average number of children is \n1.9. They begin too early. They begin without the arrangements that \nneed to accompany, ought to accompany, the beginning of a family, a \nstable husband-wife relationship. Children born to these single women \nin poverty do poorly the rest of their lives, by and large. We know so \nlittle about why all this has happened.\n  There are efforts abroad to change this culture of dependency, to get \nthe mothers on welfare off the rolls and into work. We have heard one \nSenator after another describing the programs in place in their \nStates--Iowa, California, Georgia, Michigan--under the Family Support \nAct, in which States do what they think best and experiment.\n  But do not put the lives of children at risk in this way. Or at least \ndo not do it because the Federal Government says you have to. That \nwould be unpardonable. I fear that we are making a grave mistake by \nprohibiting benefits to children born into welfare families, but if it \nis to be done, far better that the Federal Government not impose the \nrequirement upon States which do not desire it. Therefore I very much \nhope that this amendment is approved tomorrow. I have every confidence \nthat it will be. Ask any of us--any of us--ask what if one of our \nchildren was in this situation? That could happen. We know what we \nwould say. These other children are our children, too.\n  I hope that the Senator's amendment will be adopted when it is \ndebated tomorrow morning. And, again, I note that there will be 10 \nminutes equally divided at that time. I thank the Chair.\n  I see the Senator from North Carolina is on the floor. He has an \namendment, as I believe.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I do rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my \nfriend and colleague from New Mexico. I do strongly disagree with the \napproach we have taken on welfare. And I strongly believe that it has \nbeen a total failure and it is time we do something about it.\n  We have to do something firm and strong. I have been saying, ever \nsince Congress began to debate the issue of welfare reform, that unless \nwe address illegitimacy, which is the root cause of welfare dependency, \nwe will not truly reform welfare. Only by taking away the perverse cash \nincentive to have children out of wedlock can we hope to slow the \nincrease in out-of-wedlock births and ultimately end welfare \ndependency.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us today has been strict, since it \nwas reported out of the Finance Committee, by the inclusion of a family \ncap provision. This prohibits the use of Federal funds to give higher \nwelfare benefits to women who have more children while already \nreceiving welfare. This is a sensible, commonsense step towards \nencouraging personal responsibility on the part of welfare recipients. \nAnd it is time that they accept personal responsibility. It would \nestablish the principle that it is irresponsible for unmarried women, \nalready on welfare, to have additional children and to expect the \ntaxpayers to pay for them.\n  Middle-class American families who want to have children plan, \nprepare, and save money because they understand the serious \nresponsibility involved in bringing children into this world. I think \nit is grossly unfair to ask these same people to send their hard-earned \ntax dollars--and tax dollars are earned--to support the reckless, \nirresponsible behavior of a woman who has children out of wedlock, \ncontinues to have them, and is expecting the American taxpayers to pay \nfor them. It is time they become responsible.\n  The State of New Jersey is the only State in the Nation which has \ninstituted a family cap policy denying an increase in cash welfare \nbenefits to mothers who have additional children while already \nreceiving welfare benefits. The evidence now available from New Jersey, \nI say to the Senator from New Mexico, as of this morning, shows that \nthe family cap resulted in a decline in births to women on aid to \nfamilies with dependent children by a 10-percent drop, but did not \nresult in any significant increase--0.2 percent maybe--in the abortion \nrate.\n  Information presented yesterday in Washington by Rudy Meyers of the \nNew Jersey Department of Human Services indicates that in the 16 months \nafter the cap was initiated, there was a 10-percent decrease in the \nrate of out-of-wedlock births. Clearly, the family cap was responsible \nfor this significant decline.\n  Critics claim that the policy has not caused a reduction in the \nnumber of illegitimate births. They claim that there is merely a delay \nin welfare mothers reporting births to the welfare office. This is not \nthe case. Under the family cap, AFDC mothers still have a strong \nfinancial incentive to notify the welfare bureaucracy of any additional \nbirths. The family cap limits only AFDC benefits. They still receive \nincreased food stamps and Medicaid benefits for each additional child \nborn. So AFDC mothers still have a monetary incentive to notify the \nwelfare bureaucracy of an additional child.\n  There has been concern that the family cap would reduce out-of-\nwedlock births by increasing abortions. However, the current data from \nNew Jersey indicates that it did not result in any significant increase \nin the rate of abortions among these women, but did result in fewer \nchildren being conceived.\n  The New Jersey family cap was based on the principle that the welfare \nsystem should reward responsible rather than irresponsible behavior. \nFew expected the modest limits on benefits to result in a significant \ndrop in births to welfare mothers.\n  The fact that New Jersey's limited experiment has surprisingly caused \na drop in illegitimate births and hence in welfare dependency, merely \nenhances the case for the policy that is now in this welfare bill.\n  Nevertheless, it is clear that this country must begin to address the \ncrisis of illegitimacy. Today, over one-third of all American children \nare born out of wedlock.\n  According to Senator Moynihan, the illegitimate birth rate will reach \n50 percent by 2003, if not much sooner. The rise of illegitimacy and \nthe collapse of marriage has a devastating effect on children and \nsociety. Even President Clinton has declared that the collapse of the \nfamily is a major factor driving up America's crime rate.\n  Halting the rapid rise of illegitimacy must be the paramount goal of \nwelfare reform. It is essential that any welfare \n\n[[Page S 13371]]\nreform legislation enacted by Congress send out a loud and very clear \nmessage that society does not condone the growth of out-of-wedlock \nchildbearing and that taxpayers will not continue to open-endedly fund \nsubsidies for illegitimacy which has characterized welfare in the past. \nThe New Jersey family cap policy shows that welfare mothers will \nrespond to this message.\n  I support such a policy at the Federal level, and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, with some reluctance, I rise in \nopposition to the amendment of my friend and colleague, Senator \nDomenici. First, let me make sure everyone is clear in what we have in \nthe Dole amendment. The Dole language does not tie the hands of \nGovernors to spend their own dollars. They can give cash benefits using \ntheir own money. If the states want to give additional cash assistance \nto welfare recipients who have additional children while on welfare, \nthey could do so. In addition, the state can even use Federal dollars \nto provide vouchers or noncash assistance. So I think maybe there might \nhave been some understanding as to what is actually in the proposal \nbefore us.\n  The Dole amendment says that there will be no additional Federal cash \nbenefits given to welfare mothers if they have additional children. In \nother words, we want to take the financial cash incentive away from \nwelfare mothers for having additional children.\n  Senator Faircloth mentioned, I think, the only real experiment we \nhave had on the family cap is in New Jersey. Let us just look at the \nNew Jersey experiment. I am not an expert on this case, but there has \nbeen significant homework done on New Jersey in a recent report by the \nHeritage Foundation: ``The Impact of New Jersey's Family Cap on Out-of-\nWedlock Births and Abortions.''\n  First, let me mention, I compliment my friend and colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Faircloth, because he has mentioned repeatedly \nthat illegitimacy and out-of-wedlock births are a big part of our \nwelfare problem, and he is right.\n  I want to compliment my friend and colleague from New Mexico, because \nhe also decried the facts of family breakup and the fact that so many \nkids are born out of wedlock. I happen to agree with him. It is a \nstaggering statistic when you find out that over one-third of America's \nbabies today are born in a single-parent home. They do not have the \nluxury of having a father and a mother. Those kids, those newborn \nbabies are starting life at a significant disadvantage. The probability \nthat they end up in welfare, the probability that they end up in crime \nor some other environment is much, much greater than those babies who \nare fortunate enough to be born into a family with both a father and a \nmother.\n  So we need to reduce the incidence of children born out of wedlock. I \ndo not think there is any doubt and I do not think anyone would contest \nthat fact. If one looks at the crime statistics clearly that is true.\n  Would we make a difference if we say under this legislation we are \ngoing to take away the cash incentive for welfare mothers who have \nadditional children? New Jersey tried it. What have been the results? I \nwill read from the Heritage Foundation's report. It is dated September \n6, 1995:\n\n       New Jersey is the only State in the Nation that instituted \n     a family cap policy: denying an increase in cash welfare \n     benefits to mothers having additional children while already \n     receiving welfare. The evidence currently available from New \n     Jersey indicates that the family cap has resulted in a \n     decline in births to women on AFDC but not an increase in the \n     abortion rate.\n\n  I will highlight a couple of other points that are in the report. It \nsays:\n\n       The cap appears to have caused an average decrease of 134 \n     births per month, or 10 percent.\n\n  So it has reduced the number of children born to welfare mothers.\n  Has that caused a corresponding increase in abortion? I happen to \nagree with my colleague from New Mexico, I do not want that to happen. \nI think that would be a terrible result if it does.\n  I will read from the report:\n\n       There has been a concern that family cap in national \n     welfare reform legislation would reduce out-of-wedlock births \n     by increasing abortions. However, the data currently \n     available from New Jersey indicate that while the \n     establishment of the family cap was followed by a clear and \n     significant decrease in the number of births to welfare \n     mothers, it did not result in any significant increase in the \n     rate of abortions among these women.\n\n  I will just read one additional line:\n\n       The difference between pre- and post-cap abortion rate is \n     extremely small and not statistically significant. Overall, \n     the available data indicate the family cap did not cause an \n     increase in either the abortion rate or the number of \n     abortions.\n\n  Again, I am not an expert in that. I do have confidence in the \nHeritage Foundation. I think they are a very reputable group. I read \nportions of this study into the Record for my colleagues' information.\n  Again, let me repeat what we have in the underlying Dole bill. It \nsays that no Federal cash benefits would be given to welfare mothers if \nthey have additional children. It does not prohibit States from giving \nadditional cash if they want to do so with their own money. The States \ncan do so if they want to do it.\n  States are given a block grant. With that Federal money, they can use \nsome of that money to provide noncash benefits. Maybe those benefits \nwould be in the form of food supplements, maybe in the form of \nadditional medical care, maybe in the form of day care assistance, \nwhatever. The State would have the option to do what they want with the \nvouchers but not cash; in other words, trying to take the additional \ncash incentive out of welfare.\n  I think the Dole compromise is a good one. Again, I want to \ncompliment my friend and colleague from North Carolina and also Senator \nDole for this provision and compliment as well my friend and colleague \nfrom New Mexico, because I understand his sincerity, I understand his \nconviction about not wanting to increase the number of abortions, and I \nappreciate that. But I hope, in the final analysis, that his amendment \nwill not be agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask Senator Nickles, who I \nassume is managing the bill, does he know whether the other amendments \nthat people were going to offer are ready?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will just respond to my colleague, I \nknow Senator DeWine wishes to discuss his amendment. He also wishes to \ndiscuss the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico briefly. I am not \nsure if Senator Faircloth wanted to discuss his amendment tonight.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And I think Senator Daschle has two amendments, and he \nmay wish to discuss his briefly as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. I do not want \nto exceed that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is not controlled.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand, but will the Chair advise me of that so I \nwill not waste too much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, just so we make it clear, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico is not telling anybody, any State, any program or \nputting together a State program, any legislator, individually or \ncollectively anywhere in America that they have to continue cash \nbenefits to a mother who is on welfare who has another child.\n  All I am suggesting is that while we are busy structuring a new \nprogram, we ought to take advice from people like Governor Engler, who \nhas led the way in terms of Medicaid reform at the local level, and \nwelfare reform, when he suggests that we ought to leave this up to the \nStates.\n  So all I am doing is adding to the voucher system--substituting for \nthat voucher system a permissive payment of cash benefits by the \nStates, if they choose that as part of their plan, and if they think \nthat is better in the overall prevention and assistance to welfare \nmothers who have another child.\n  I believe the argument is on the side of prudence, on the side of \nusing some rationale. Let us give the program a chance to work, and let \nus not dictate \n\n[[Page S 13372]]\nup here, as we are prone to do when we do not know the results.\n  I have great confidence in the Heritage Foundation. But I have in my \nhands the summary of a study done by Rutgers University. I believe it \nis right, and I believe it is the official study on the State of New \nJersey. It was a controlled case study, Mr. President, whereby for a \nperiod from August of 1993 through July of 1994, 2,999 AFDC mothers \nthat were subject to the family cap were evaluated, and the percentage \nof birth rate was 6.9 percent. And the AFDC mothers not subject to a \nfamily cap was 1,429, and the difference was two-tenths of 1 percent, \nwhich is not sufficient for any conclusion to be drawn.\n  Frankly, I am not surprised at that. But I think it clearly points \nout that there is some serious doubt about its efficacy with reference \nto this aspect of the results of the program. I am merely saying, once \nagain, why not give the States a chance? I would assume that New Jersey \ntried this and some other States want to try it--that is, putting the \nfamily cap on. I would assume that if it is so right, and so right for \nour country, and for the taxpayers, that most States would try it. I \njust would like to give them the option to do otherwise, if they \nchoose.\n  I also want to point out that this amendment is supported by the \nNational Council of Bishops, the National Conference of State \nLegislators, the U.S. Catholic Conference, the National Governors \nAssociation, the Women's Defense League Fund, and many others, \nconservative and liberal. I believe this is not a conservative or \nliberal issue. This is an issue of how are we going to be most wise and \nprudent as we deliver up for use this block grant money in an area that \nis strewn with heartache and problems and misery and waste. I believe \nthis is a better way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nDomenici's amendment. I think, as we debate welfare reform tonight and \nas we debate the amendment of my friend from New Mexico, we need to \nstep back a little bit from this whole welfare debate. We are a number \nof days into this now. It is rather late in the evening. But I think we \nneed to look at this from the big picture.\n  Mr. President, one of the main reasons that we are on the floor \ntonight debating meaningful, true welfare reform is because our current \nwelfare system simply does not work. We have decades of experience. We \nhave decades of experience and examples of what does not work. Quite \nfrankly, what we do not know is what does work. We are just now, in the \nlast several years, beginning to see more experimentation at the State \nlevel. And while some of the early returns are in, frankly, it is still \nvery difficult to see what works and what does not work.\n  I support this bill because I believe that all wisdom does not reside \nin this Capitol Building, in this U.S. Senate, in the House of \nRepresentatives. And I am convinced that the only way we are going to \ngenuinely reform welfare is to allow the States to truly be the \nlaboratories of democracy, and to allow them to experiment, and to make \nit so that no longer will they have to come, hat in hand, on bended \nknee, to a bureaucrat in Washington, DC, to see whether they can get a \nwaiver or an exemption, or if they can try something different--\nsomething that might even work, Mr. President. That is the background \nby which I approach this amendment.\n  Both sides of this particular debate on this amendment, I think, \nwould agree--and do agree--about the tremendous problem, the tragedy \nthat we have in this country today with the growing rate of \nillegitimacy. Senator Moynihan, who was on the floor a few minutes ago \nspeaking in favor of the Domenici amendment, is probably the foremost \nexperiment in the country on this issue. He forecasted, long before \nanyone else understood, the importance and significance of what the \ntrend lines really meant.\n  The tragedy today, Mr. President, is that in some of our major \ncities, two out of every three births are, in fact, illegitimate. On \nthe national average, we are approaching one out of three. None of us \nknow what the long-term consequences of this will be. But neither do we \nknow what to do about it. We have heard already, just in the short \namount of time we have debated this tonight, several different studies \nthat have been cited. I will cite one in a moment. But the fact is that \nwe do not have enough years of experience in New Jersey, or in any \nother State, to know what effect this family cap has. Does it increase \nabortions? Does it, in fact, cut down on the illegitimacy rate, without \nincreasing abortions? We have two studies, with contradictory results. \nThe jury--as we used to say when I was a county prosecutor in Greene \nCounty--is still out, deliberating. We do not know.\n  What kind of arrogance is it for this Congress and this Senate--I use \nthe word ``arrogance''--how arrogant would we be--when we do not know \nwhat works and what does not work, when we really do not know how to \nget at the issue of illegitimacy, certainly not from the Government's \npoint of view, if the Government can do anything about it--to then turn \naround and tell every State in the Union that this is what you have to \ndo; we now know best. And to put it on maybe a partisan point of view, \nnow that this side of the aisle is in control, we do not like your \nmandates, but we like our mandates. Arrogance.\n  I have been on this floor before talking about things where I thought \nthere should be Federal mandates and where I thought there should be \nuniformity. But I did so only when I felt, at least, the evidence was \noverwhelming that we knew what worked and what did not work and the \nstatistics just did not lie. In this case, we do not know what the \nstatistics show. We just do not know.\n  So this is one U.S. Senator who is not going to take a chance that \nthis action by this body of telling every single State of the Union \nwhat they have to do--I am not going to take the chance that it might \njust increase abortions, or it might not work at all. It might not have \nany impact. So I am voting with my friend and colleague from New \nMexico, and I think it is proper, as he has very well stated, to \nrestate what his amendment does.\n  It does not tell any of the States what to do. A State can impose a \ncap. A State can impose a very tough cap if they want to. They can \nimpose a cap as New Jersey has.\n  However, under Senator Domenici's amendment, we would simply say we \nare not going to tell you that you have to do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me close by reading from an article of the Sunday, \nJuly 2, 1995, Baltimore Sun. This references the Rutgers study that my \nfriend from New Mexico has already mentioned.\n  Let me directly quote from the article. ``A recent Rutgers University \nstudy indicates that New Jersey's family cap has had no impact on \nwelfare mothers.''\n  Later on in the story, this quote appears, again reading from the \nsame article: ``However, the 4 percent increase in the abortion rate \noccurred over a relatively short period of time.''\n  So the article points out you still cannot tell what the statistics \nreally mean.\n  I think we should err on the side of States. I think we should err on \nthe side of caution. I think we should err on the side of allowing the \nStates to truly be the laboratories of democracy.\n  I am convinced that this is the only way that we are going to in any \nway begin to deal with our welfare problem. Nobody knows all the \nanswers. We have suspicions about what we think might work.\n  In this bill, Mr. President, we should encourage more creativity, \nmore diversity, more taking of chances. Quite frankly, trying to run \nwelfare from this body and the other body and the bureaucrats in \nWashington, DC, has not worked. We ought to try something else, and \nsupport for the Domenici amendment really, when you strip everything \nelse away, is a statement that we want to turn this responsibility and \nthe creativity, opportunities, back to the individual States.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I thank my good friend for his \neloquent statement and for his support of the amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S 13373]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2672\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2672.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know that other Senators are waiting to \noffer amendments and so I will not take a long period of time, but I \nwant to talk about two amendments on which I hope we could find some \nresolution prior to the time of final passage.\n  The first has to do with the need for a State contingency fund. As I \nhave talked to our Governors, Republican and Democratic alike, the \nconcern they have expressed to me with unanimity is the issue of what \nhappens when circumstances beyond their control affect their own \nsituation within the State.\n  Perhaps the most illustrative example of their concern occurred \nearlier this decade during the recession that began in the late 1980's \nand went into the early 1990's. During that time, the AFDC caseload \ngrew by 1 million families. That represented, Mr. President, a 26 \npercent increase in the level of AFDC cases with which States had to \ncontend.\n  The level of monthly benefits increased by $337 million. That was a \n22 percent increase. The cumulative increase in the total benefit \npayments was $7.1 billion during the 36-month period between 1990 and \n1992.\n  Unfortunately, under the pending legislation, the Dole bill, there is \nno opportunity for States to deal with circumstances like that. The \nDole bill does provide a loan fund of $1.7 billion from which States \ncan borrow to deal with contingencies of this kind. But if the level of \nmonthly benefits rose $337 million, as it did in the early 90's, that \nwould amount to only 5 months of benefits. In a 36 month recession like \nthe one in the early 90's, you would have 31 months of recession for \nwhich States would have absolutely no resources at all.\n  Unfortunately, many Members are very concerned about the consequences \nof a situation like that. States could be facing economic downturns, \ndramatically increased unemployment levels, natural disasters, plant \nclosings--that is why there has to be a realization that States \nthemselves cannot be required to shoulder this entire burden. We have \nto ensure that families in similar circumstances, regardless of where \nthey may be, will receive some assistance.\n  What I am offering tonight with this amendment is a couple of things. \nFirst of all, we would change the amendment from a loan to a grant. We \nsimply recognize that in cases like this, a loan may not provide States \nwith the help they truly need.\n  So the grant, something I understand Governors on both sides of the \naisle feel they need, is much more prudent and much more practical in \nresponding to the circumstances we know will be faced by States at some \npoint in the future.\n  The difference between this amendment and what is currently found in \nthe Dole bill is that in our amendment, we recognize that States cannot \nbe held 100 percent accountable for circumstances beyond their control, \nnot only circumstances like natural disasters but the circumstances \nthat come once they borrow the money.\n\n  What happens if States are unable to repay a loan within the 3-year-\nperiod of time? Certainly in many recessions circumstances would not \nallow a State with very limited resources--that would be especially \ntrue in a State like South Dakota, where resources are not available--\nto repay the loan with interest in the period of time required.\n  So this recognizes, Mr. President, that there has to be a \npartnership. We recognize that because of recessions, huge natural \ndisasters, or other unanticipated circumstances, no matter what level \nof funding we provide to States for welfare in the future, there are \ngoing to be times when that level of funding simply is not going to be \nenough to cope with the extraordinary circumstances that these States \nmay have to deal with.\n  We require that States maintain at least a minimal effort--the level \nthey spent in 1994--if they are going to be eligible for the \ncontingency fund. In other words, they have to make a good-faith effort \nto deal with their own set of circumstances.\n  So, in essence, this is simply attempting to deal with the problem in \na much more meaningful way. We recognize the need for a partnership. We \nrecognize the responsibility of the Federal Government and States to \nwork together to ensure that we do not exacerbate the problem when we \nget into an unforeseen situation of some kind. We recognize that, in \nmany cases, smaller States in particular simply are not going to have \nthe means by which to borrow the money and pay it back with interest in \na very short timeframe.\n  So this assists States in a much more meaningful way. I hope our \ncolleagues recognize the need and recognize that, as Governors and \nState legislators have talked to us about their biggest concern \nregarding the transition that we will be undertaking as a result of the \npassage of this legislation, should it pass--the biggest concern they \nhave is how they are going to cope with unforeseen circumstances, and \nhow they are going to deal with all of the financial and economic \nramifications of this plan when, in cases of dire need such as a \nrecession, they do not have the resources or the ability to deal with \nthem.\n  So, this is a realistic approach to trying to deal with the problem \nin a better way, and I hope our colleagues see fit to support it \ntomorrow. I will have a lot more to say about it prior to the time we \nvote. I will return to this issue tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, on the other amendment, I now ask unanimous consent \nthat amendment No. 2672 be set aside and we call up amendment No. 2671. \nI am reading the top of my note here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that amendment \nNo. 2672 is the pending question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask that be laid aside and we call up amendment No. \n2671.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2671\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, with regard to this amendment, let me \nsimply say there is a realization, I think on both sides of the aisle, \nthat we have a special relationship with our tribal governments, and \nthat special relationship requires a special arrangement as situations \nlike this are addressed. It is very important that we recognize the \nissue of tribal sovereignty, and also the need for tribes to take \nresponsibility for addressing the serious problems that they face, both \nsocially and economically.\n  The Dole bill would require that funding be provided to tribes out of \nthe allocation given to each State. This amendment simply says we are \ngoing to set aside 3 percent of the resources allocated nationally \nbefore the money is given to the States. The allotment formula for \ndistributing money from the set-aside would be determined by the \nSecretary, but it would be based on the need for services and on data \ncommon to all tribes, to the extent that is possible.\n  We also allow tribes to borrow from the contingency loan fund. Tribes \nwould be able to borrow up to 10 percent of their grant allocation, and \nthe Secretary may waive the interest requirement or extend the time \nrepayment period at times when circumstances would warrant.\n  I do not know that there is any place in the country more deserving \nand more in need of special attention than reservations. The poverty \nrate for Indian children on reservations is three times the national \naverage, 60.3 percent. Per capita U.S. income is about $14,420. Per \ncapita income on the reservations is a mere $4,478. Mr. President, 36 \npercent of Indian children under 6 live in homes today without even a \ntelephone. In South Dakota, over half of all Indian children live in \npoverty. Mr. President, 63.8 percent of all children on AFDC in South \nDakota are Native American.\n   Shannon County, the location of Pine Ridge Reservation, is the \npoorest county in the country. Todd County, the location of the Rosebud \nReservation, is the fourth poorest county in the country.\n  Unemployment on reservations is four to seven times the national \naverage. In South Dakota, unemployment rates on the reservations range \nfrom 29 percent to 89 percent. There are a lot of reasons for that, no \ndifferent in South Dakota, perhaps, than other States. But the barriers \nto work are there. Serious problems that we have to address, problems \nhaving to do with the lack of \n\n[[Page S 13374]]\nskills, the lack of education--these are problems that I hope we can \nbegin to resolve much more effectively with meaningful welfare reform.\n  States have been running these programs for many years; tribes have \nnot. In many places tribes have attempted to work with States to create \nan infrastructure for running these programs. Frankly, in many places \nit does not exist yet. This is something in which tribes will need to \ninvest. Tribal programs run on a smaller level and, this will take some \noverhead. Additionally, we have not always had a proportionate level of \nassistance from the private sector. Less than one-tenth of 1 percent of \nCombined Federal Campaign contributions go to Indian programs. Less \nthan two-tenths of 1 percent of foundation grant money goes to support \ntribal human services.\n  So, Mr. President, we need to ensure that we get an adequate level of \nassistance from States and the Federal Government. And I am not talking \nnecessarily about only resources. We are talking about an \ninfrastructure. We are talking about ways with which to make the money \nthat we already spend work better, providing job skills and providing \ngood education, providing help, providing a workfare opportunity. \nCertainly there is a need for that.\n  There is ample precedent in current law for earmarking funds for \nnative Americans. I believe a set-aside under this legislation is \nappropriate.\n  We need to set this money aside for tribal governments. The Federal \nGovernment has a trust responsibility to assure appropriate funding. I \nbelieve this amendment will do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend and colleague, \nSenator Daschle, for sending his two amendments. I know Senator DeWine \nhas an amendment. Let me make a couple of brief comments concerning \nboth Daschle amendments.\n  One concerning the 3-percent set aside for Indian tribes--I might \nmention that for Indian welfare programs under the Dole bill we have a \nprovision but it would be allocated strictly on the ratio of AFDC \nnumbers. I am not sure exactly what the number is. I think it is \nsomething like not 3 percent but more like 1.7 percent. I will have \nthat figure more accurately in the morning. So we are talking about a \nlot of money.\n  I will certainly concur with the gist of my colleague's amendment, \nthat we have a lot of Indian welfare programs that are not working. I \nam not sure that money is necessarily the answer. My State happens to \nhave more Indian population than any State in the Nation. I have seen a \nlot of Indian welfare programs that have not worked, again not \nnecessarily because of a lack of money. But I will try to have those \nfacts and statistics for tomorrow for debate.\n  Also, I would like to make a brief comment concerning the first \namendment. That is the amendment calling for setting aside and \nappropriating money for contingency funds, that contingency fund being \nin the form of a grant, not in the form of a loan. Under the Dole \nprovision, we have over $1 billion set aside for loans that the States \ncould borrow from but they would have to pay it back within 3 years. \nUnder the Daschle amendment it would appropriate $5 billion over 7 \nyears for a contingency fund that says to States, if you have a higher \nunemployment rate than you did in 1994, you could qualify, and, if you \nhave more children receiving food stamps than you did in 1994, you \ncould qualify, and, if you are spending at least as much money as you \nare spending in 1994. In other words, a 100-percent maintenance of \neffort. Then you could qualify.\n  So it is kind of an idea that here is more money for more welfare. I \ndo not see that as reform. I understand the States might have some \nproblem.\n  It was also said that there would be distributed in the same formula \nthat we do with Medicaid, match their rates; therefore, for every \ndollar they spent the State would spend three. They would have an \nadditional dollar grant from the Federal Government, almost an \nincentive for the State to spend more money on welfare. I am afraid \nthat might increase our dependency on welfare, and maintain welfare as \na life cycle, not reverse it. Many of us are trying to reverse that. We \nare trying to break the welfare cycle, and reduce welfare dependency.\n  Mr. President, I know my friend and colleague from Ohio is supposed \nto preside over the floor, and I also know that he has an amendment \nthat he wishes to discuss briefly. Looking at the list, I also see that \nSenator Faircloth is on the floor and he has an amendment. I believe \nSenator Boxer has an amendment; all of which we are trying to have \ndiscussed this evening so we can have them voted on tomorrow.\n  So I will yield the floor in anticipation of the Senator from Ohio \nwho will bring up his amendment.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair what the pending \nbusiness is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When the Senator from Ohio calls his amendment \nup, it will be the pending business.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2518\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2518, the \ncaseload diversion amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2518.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the name of \nSenator Kohl as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the purpose of our amendment was to make \nsure the States tackle the underlying problem of the welfare system. \nToo often, welfare ends up being quicksand for people--quicksand \ninstead of a ladder of opportunity. The underlying legislation before \nus will help change this by creating a real work requirement that will \nhelp boost welfare clients into the economic mainstream of work and \nopportunity.\n  Mr. President, we need to help people get off of welfare. One very \nimportant way we can do this is by helping them avoid getting on \nwelfare in the first place. That brings me to the specific proposal \ncontained in my amendment.\n  This amendment will give States credit for making real reductions in \ntheir welfare caseload--not illusory reductions based on ordinary \nregular turnover, nor, for that matter, reductions based on changes in \nthe eligibility requirements. No. What we are talking about is real \nreduction in caseload.\n  Let me cite a statistic, Mr. President. Since 1988, over 14 million \nAmericans have left the AFDC rolls. That is the good news. Now for the \nbad news. Over the same period there has not been a reduction in the \nwelfare caseload. In fact, there has been a 30 percent increase in the \nnet welfare caseload. More people are coming on welfare every day than \nare getting off.\n  So it is clear that our problem is not just a problem of getting \npeople off welfare. We also have to slow the rate of those going on \nwelfare.\n  We have to make sure, Mr. President, that we keep our eye on the \nball, and the ball in this case is keeping people out of the culture of \nwelfare dependency and off welfare.\n  Under the bill, States will have to meet a very specific work \nrequirement, and that is good. But I think this policy will have an \nunintended side effect--a side effect that none of us will want. It is \na side effect I believe my amendment will cure.\n  Mr. President, if there is a work requirement, States obviously have \nan incentive to meet that requirement. If States face the threat of \nlosing Federal funding for failing to meet the work requirement, they \ncould easily fall into the trap of judging their welfare policies \nsolely by the criterion of whether or not they help meet the specific \nwork requirement.\n  What we have to remember is that the work requirement is not an end \nin \n\n[[Page S 13375]]\nand of itself. Our goal rather is to break the cycle of welfare \ndependency. We have found that helping people before they ever get on \nAFDC--through job training, job search assistance, rent subsidies, \ntransportation assistance, and other similar measures--all of these \nthings are cheaper to do. There are cheaper ways of doing this than \nsimply waiting for the person to fall off the economic cliff and become \na full-fledged welfare client.\n  One positive measure, Mr. President, some States have taken, a \nmeasure that we should encourage, is remedial action, early \nintervention to help people before they go on the welfare rolls. In the \nhealth care field we call this prevention. In welfare, as in health \ncare, it is both cost effective and the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, the last thing we want to do in welfare reform is to \ndiscourage this kind of prevention program. Just the contrary. We in \nthis Congress through this bill should try to encourage the States to \ndo this. But under the current bill, as currently written, States are \ngiven no incentive to make these efforts to help people. If anything, \nthere is a disincentive.\n  If a State makes an active, aggressive, successful effort to help \npeople stay off welfare, then the really tough welfare cases will make \nup an increasing larger and larger portion of the remaining welfare \ncaseload. That will in turn make the work requirement every year \ntougher and tougher to meet.\n  Under the bill, as currently written, without my amendment, there is \nan incentive to wait to help people--to wait until they are on welfare. \nThen the States can take action, get them off welfare, and get credit \nfor getting people off welfare.\n  Mr. President, if the States divert people from the welfare system, \nkeep them off, stop them from ever going on by helping them, the people \nwho stay on welfare will tend to be more hard-to-reach welfare clients. \nAnd that will make it more difficult for the States to meet the work \nrequirement.\n  That really is exactly the opposite, Mr. President, of what we should \nbe trying to do. My amendment would eliminate this purely perverse \nincentive.\n  My amendment would give States credit, credit toward meeting the work \nrequirement if they take steps to help before they go on welfare--and, \nin doing so, keep those people from falling into the welfare trap.\n  Helping citizens stay off welfare is just as important as making \nwelfare clients work, and just as important as getting people off \nwelfare. Indeed, the reason we want to make welfare clients work, of \ncourse, in the first place is to help them off of welfare. But--there \nis a very important provision in my amendment--we cannot allow this new \nincentive for caseload reduction to become an incentive for the States \nto ignore poverty, and to ignore the problem.\n  Under my amendment, a State will not--let me repeat--will not get \ncredit toward fulfilling the work requirement if that State reduces the \ncaseload by changing the eligibility standard.\n They get no credit for that. A State will get credit toward a work \nrequirement by reducing caseloads through prevention and early \nintervention programs that help people stay off welfare in the first \nplace.\n\n  Ignoring the problem of poverty will not make it go away. Arbitrarily \nkicking people off of relief is not a solution to welfare dependency. \nStates should not--let me repeat--not get credit under the work \nrequirement of this bill for changing their eligibility requirements.\n  Welfare reform block grants are designed to give States the \nflexibility they need to meet their responsibilities. They must not \nbecome an opportunity for the States to ignore their responsibilities. \nStates need to be rewarded for solving problems. Giving States credit \nfor real reductions in caseload will provide this reward.\n  I believe my amendment will yield another benefit. It will enable the \nStates to target their resources on the most difficult welfare cases, \nthe at-risk people who need very intensive training and counseling if \nthey are ever, ever going to get off welfare.\n  It will not do us any good as a society to pat ourselves on the back \nbecause people are leaving AFDC if at the very same time an even \ngreater number of people are getting on the welfare rolls and if the \nones getting on are an even tougher group to help than the ones who are \ngetting off.\n  The American people demand a much more fundamental and far-reaching \nsolution. They demand real reductions in the number of people who need \nwelfare. Two States, Mr. President, Wisconsin and Utah, have really led \nthe way with the kind of prevention programs that I have been talking \nabout. Other States, including my home State of Ohio, are starting to \nimplement this type of program, a prevention program, to help people \nbefore they literally drop off the cliff and go down into the abyss of \nwelfare, some of them never ever to climb out. As part of this welfare \nreform legislation, I believe we have to encourage States to take this \ntype of remedial action, to take this type of action that will in fact \nmake a difference in people's lives.\n  Reducing the number of people who need welfare in this country is \ngoing to be a very tough task, but it is absolutely necessary that we \ndo it. The issue must be faced. I believe it will be faced with all the \ncreativity at the disposal of the 50 States, the 50 laboratories of \ndemocracy.\n  How are States going to do it? There are probably as many ways of \ndoing it as there are States. There is no single best answer. That is \nthe key reason why we need to give the States flexibility to \nexperiment.\n  In Wisconsin, for example, the Work First Program, with its tough \nwork requirement, has reduced applications to the welfare system. That \nis a promising approach, reducing the number of out-of-wedlock births \nand getting rid of the disincentives to marriage.\n  The bottom line is simply this: We have to solve the problem and not \nignore it. States should be encouraged to take action and to take \naction early to keep people off welfare, to help them before they drop \ndown into that welfare pit.\n  This is the compassionate thing to do. It is also the cost-effective \nthing to do. That is why I am urging the adoption of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from North Carolina \nwill be next in line according to the unanimous-consent agreement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2608\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I call up my amendment 2608.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2608.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to offer an amendment to provide funding for abstinence \neducation.\n  It is a sad fact that our society is being destroyed by soaring out-\nof-wedlock birth rates. As Senator Moynihan has pointed out, in areas \nof some cities, illegitimacy rates are approaching 80 percent. \nPresident Clinton has warned us of the close link between family \ncollapse and crime, and he has warned us of the link between welfare \nand illegitimacy.\n  What we need is a policy which promotes responsible parenthood, a \npolicy which says to our children: Do not have a child until you are \nmarried; do not have a child until you and your husband have enough \neducation, work experience, and will be able to support that child \nyourself and not expect the taxpayers and the Federal Government to do \nso; do not have a child until you are old enough and mature enough to \nbe the best parent you are capable of being.\n  What my amendment would do is take a tiny portion of the enormous \namount of money that this bill spends on job training programs and put \nit toward a program which would actively and deliberately educate \nchildren to abstain from premarital sex.\n  Most liberal welfare programs funded by the Congress through the \nyears have \n\n[[Page S 13376]]\ntried to pick up the pieces after the child has already been born, and \nthey have failed miserably. Does it not make common sense to prevent \nout-of-wedlock births from occurring in the first place, those that \ntaxpayers are expected to support?\n  The fact is abstinence education programs work. This is a proven \nfact. Imagine if we saw nationwide the success we have seen in Atlanta \nwith abstinence education--a real miracle. In Atlanta, abstinence \neducation has reduced sexual activity among young teenagers by over 75 \npercent. The program in Atlanta is called Preventing Sexual \nInvolvement, and it is specifically targeted to inner-city children. \nThe results have been a reason for optimism and a new belief in what we \ncan do to change this whole sad subject of illegitimacy and social \ndecay in our inner cities.\n  The bottom line is that only 1 percent of the inner-city girls who \nparticipated in the program became sexually active compared to 15 \npercent of the same girls, the same communities not involved in the \nprogram. This kind of result, multiplied nationwide, literally could \nturn the country around, and that is not an exaggeration. It does work.\n  Senator after Senator has come to the floor and talked about the \nshame and failure of our welfare programs. Time and time again we hear \neveryone agree that welfare is broken. This is an opportunity and a \nchance to literally turn the issue around and vote to discourage the \nactivities which have caused the problem.\n  As currently written, the Dole bill will spend over $35 billion in \nthe next 5 years on job training and vocational education, but not one \nsingle penny to promote abstinence education. We will spend a fortune \ntrying to reduce welfare dependency, but not one penny trying to \nprevent the out-of-wedlock births that cause welfare dependency in the \nfirst place.\n  Again, the amendment that I have is simple. It provides $200 million \nper year for abstinence education. That amounts to about 3 cents out of \nevery dollar that this bill will spend on job training and vocational \neducation. We take that 3 cents and spend it on abstinence.\n  We have all talked about the crisis of illegitimacy and the collapse \nof the family. Here is an opportunity to do something about it with \nthis small amount of money that could make a difference, that could \nturn the problem around.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment in \naccordance with the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from North \nCarolina for his amendment and also for his bringing it at this late \nhour, as well as the Presiding Officer of the Senate for his offering \nhis amendment. I congratulate both Senators for the work they are doing \nand compliment them for their initiatives.\n  I believe that the last amendment that will be discussed tonight in \nthe Senate is the amendment to be offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2592\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and we take up amendment No. 2592.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I hope we will have bipartisan support for this amendment. Right now \nin the Dole bill we keep a separate federally means-tested program for \nabused, neglected and abandoned children. The title IV-E foster care \nsystem provides a refuge for children in abusive families, and the Dole \nbill continues this Federal policy. And I strongly agree with that. I \nam glad we do not put that into a block grant and leave these kids to \nfend for themselves because, Mr. President, I know how much you care \nabout kids. If we have to get a child out of an abusive home situation, \nwe want to give a little assistance to the foster family or the \nadopting parents.\n  Now, there is one group of children left out in the cold in the \ncurrent Dole bill. And that is legal immigrant children who have been \nbrought into this country completely in accordance with all the laws. \nUnfortunately, the way that the bill is now drawn, they would be \nineligible for Federal foster care and adoption assistance. Now, we \nknow that the Dole bill restricts benefits to legal immigrants, and \nthere are certain exemptions to that. Such things as immunizations, \nemergency medical care, and emergency disaster relief are exempted. I \nbelieve we should exempt foster care and adoption assistance.\n  Now, Mr. President, we know that children are placed into foster care \nbecause a judge determines that there is a serious risk of the child \nbeing hurt in the current home. So I know that my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle do not want to single out legal immigrant children \nand say that we are going to walk away from them. Under the current \nbill--and I hope it is just an oversight, Mr. President--legal \nimmigrant children would be made ineligible for title IV-E foster care \nor adoption assistance due to the fact that there is no exemption for \nit.\n  We know that title IV-E foster care and adoption assistance helps at-\nrisk children get placed in the homes where they will be safe from \nabuse and neglect. The adoption assistance is used to help families pay \nfor special needs that the children have. The payments assist adopting \nfamilies meet the cost incurred due to their new child's physical or \nemotional disability. Often, the child's disability is a direct result \nof abuse. Title IV--E foster care assistance helps pay for a child's \nroom and board whether it is in a group home or a family.\n  So, to sum up the point of my amendment, what we are saying is, those \nof us who support my amendment, we are very pleased that the Dole bill \ndoes keep a separate program for foster care and adoption assistance \nbut we need to make sure it goes to these legal immigrant children.\n  Mr. President, in the interest of time, let me say this to you. Just \nbecause we do not have the money available for these legal immigrant \nchildren who are abused and neglected and sometimes abandoned does not \nmean the problem will go away. I think you and I know what will happen. \nWe both come from local government. And the local people who are \ncompassionate, the local governments, will move in. And that could be a \nvery large unfunded mandate. For example, in Los Angeles, Los Angeles \nCounty there are an estimated 1,500 legal immigrant children currently \nin their system. And if they had to pick up the tab for all of those \nchildren, it would be very, very difficult. And you would find that, I \nam sure in your cities as well. So, again, I hope there will be strong \nbipartisan support to correct what I hope was a legislative oversight.\n  I feel very strongly the Senate should show its support for \nprotecting abused and neglected children by supporting this amendment. \nAnd I think we ought to think about it. A lot of our parents were legal \nimmigrants. And a lot of the people we know today are legal immigrants \nwho waited in line, were very patient, and came to this country. It \nseems to me since Senator Dole did find in his heart his other \nexemptions such as the ones I have mentioned--emergency medical \nservices, emergency disaster relief, school lunch, and child \nnutrition--I hope this was just an oversight. And that these young \nchildren would be able to go into a foster home, be adopted by a loving \nfamily and that those families could get the benefit of the program \nthat all other families get when they adopt children or take children \ninto foster homes.\n  I do not know, Mr. President, if it is necessary to ask for the yeas \nand nays now.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  In the interest of time, I will see you in the morning and have \nanother 5 minutes to explain this amendment. \n\n[[Page S 13377]]\n\n  I yield floor.\n                           Amendment No. 2542\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the welfare reform bill imposes upon the \nStates a 6-month time limitation for any individual to participate in a \nfood stamp work supplementation program. This amendment would replace \nthe 6-month limit with a 1-year limit. It would continue to allow an \nextension of this time limitation at the discretion of the Secretary.\n  Arizona's current cash-out of food stamps under its EMPOWER welfare \nprogram allows individuals to participate in subsidized employment for \n9-months with an option for a 3-month extension. There is no reason \nthat the State should have to make another special request to the \nSecretary in order to maintain this policy. This amendment would allow \nStates with such policies to continue their programs without \ndisruption.\n  Ideally, I would prefer that the States be able to plan their work \nsupplementation programs without being constrained by requirements \nimposed by the Federal Government. The States know best how to \nstructure their programs to help their citizens become employable. \nThus, my preference would be to eliminate the time limitation \naltogether.\n  However, I recognize that many of my colleagues are insisting upon a \ntime limitation for individuals under the program, and I am pleased \nthat we were able to come to an agreement that meets the needs of \nArizona and other States that wish to pursue similar policies. In the \nfuture, I plan to revisit this issue to allow States maximum \nflexibility to plan their work supplementation programs.\n  Mr. President, a primary objective of this bill is to encourage the \nStates to innovate. The best way to achieve this is to get out of their \nway. We should not impose requirements limiting the States' flexibility \nunless there is a compelling reason to do so. This amendment will give \nStates additional leeway to innovate in their work supplementation \nprograms and will thereby help them achieve their employment \nobjectives.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendments \nwere agreed to, en bloc, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  So, the motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                           amendment no. 2511\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution, amendment No. 2511. This resolution would state our \ncommitment to passing enterprise zone legislation in this session of \nCongress. I believe this commitment is crucial because, as we debate \nwelfare reform, we also must find ways to create the jobs necessary to \nrescue people from the welfare trap.\n  Enterprise zones are a crucial part of our effort to help poor people \nin this country. Too many Americans far too long have been trapped in \nlives of desperation. They have been left without the support of their \ncommunities, without meaningful lives and without hope of good jobs and \neconomic advancement.\n  Many of our urban centers in particular are saddled with high levels \nof poverty, high rates of welfare dependency, high crime rates, poor \nschools and joblessness. Indeed, Mr. President, half of the people who \nreside in our distressed urban areas live below the poverty line.\n  All of these factors add to the sense of hopelessness in distressed \nareas. All of them have been made worse by ill-conceived Federal \npolicies, including taxes that discourage investment, regulations that \npunish innovation and a welfare system that punishes work and fosters \ndependency.\n  One step toward restoring hope to our distressed areas, Mr. \nPresident, is the welfare reform measure we are debating today. But, as \nwe work to end welfare as we know it, we must give careful thought to \nwhat we want to have replace it. We must institute policies that will \nfurther our fundamental goal of providing Americans with the \nopportunity to get off of welfare and into decent jobs.\n  This requires pro-growth policies that will spawn greater economic \nactivity and job creation. This requires enterprise zones.\n  The concept of enterprise zones has been with us for some time. \nFormer Congressman Jack Kemp introduced legislation on the subject in \n1978. The Senate has endorsed and enacted the concept in one form or \nanother over the years.\n  We have endorsed the concept because it is clear that enterprise \nzones will spur investment, entrepreneurship, public spirit and the \ndevelopment of skills necessary for participation in our market \neconomy.\n  To give credit where it is due, President Clinton has instituted an \nenterprise zone program in an attempt to help distressed areas.\n  The Clinton plan sets up nine empowerment zones in which businesses \nquality for an employment tax credit and an increase in expending, and \n95 enterprise communities that quality for $280 million social services \nblock grants.\n  But the plan in my judgment provides for no significant tax \nincentives to spur investment entrepreneurship and job creation. And \nits social services block grants are based on the failed notion that \nGovernment can help create jobs and prosperity in America's inner \ncities.\n  We have spent over $5 trillion on social services, and our distressed \nareas have only grown worse. Why? Because Government cannot create \nwealth. The best it can do is unleash our citizens' drive and \ninitiative to succeed in the market economy.\n  The last time we freed up capital and the entrepreneurial spirit \nminority business--and the American economy--greatly benefitted. Under \nRonald Reagan's progrowth policies, from 1982 to 1987 the number of \nblack-owned firms increased by nearly 38 percent to a total of 425,000. \nDuring the same period Hispanic-owned firms surged by 83 percent, \naccording to the Wall Street Journal. Economically distressed areas \ncontain disproportionate numbers of minorities. Thus these figures show \nan undeniable increase in economic opportunity in those areas.\n  Unfortunately, in 1986 the capital gains tax rate was increased by 65 \npercent. And that huge increase brought us 4 straight years in which \nAmericans started fewer businesses each year than the year before. The \nresult, of course, was less job creation and less economic opportunity, \nparticularly among minorities in our distressed areas.\n  To reverse this dynamic, Senator Lieberman and I have coauthored the \nEnhanced Enterprise Zone Act of 1995. This act contains provisions, \ncalled for in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, designed to help \ndistressed areas.\n  It provides Federal tax incentives that expand access to capital, \nincrease the formation and expansion of small businesses and promote \ncommercial revitalization.\n  It includes regulatory reforms that allow localities to petition \nFederal agencies for waivers or modifications of regulations to improve \njob creation, community development and economic revitalization.\n  It includes home ownership incentives and grants to encourage \nresident management and ownership of public housing.\n  Finally, it includes a school reform pilot project to provide low \nincome parents with options for improved elementary and secondary \nschooling in the designated zones.\n  The bill recognizes that private enterprise, not Government, is the \nsource of economic and social development.\n\n[[Page S 13378]]\n\n  We know the program will work because 35 States and the District of \nColumbia already have enterprise zones that have produced over 663,000 \nnew jobs and $40 billion in capital investment. And the concept has \nbeen endorsed by the National Governors' Association, the Conference of \nBlack Mayors, the Council of Black State Legislators and the U.S. \nConference of Mayors.\n  Taken together, these incentives for investment, entrepreneurship, \nhome ownership and skill development will bring the economies in \ndistressed areas back to life. They will encourage full participation \nin our market economy and public interest in the local neighborhood. \nThe result will be economic growth and, more important, new jobs.\n  It is my hope that a positive vote on this resolution will put this \nSenate on record in favor of creating jobs and opportunity. The sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution I, with Senator Lieberman, am proposing will \nin my view spur us to enact legislation to strengthen enterprise zones. \nIn this way it will increase the chances for people in distressed areas \nto get off of welfare and into decent jobs. Strengthened enterprise \nzones will add to the hopes of our people, the vitality of our cities \nand the proper functioning of our economy.\n  I urge your support for this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an excellent article on \nthe Abraham-Lieberman enterprise zone bill by Mr. Stuart Anderson of \nthe Alexis de Tacqueville Institution appear in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Connecticut Post, Sept. 10, 1995]\n\n       Lieberman Bill Takes Right Approach to Helping Our Cities\n\n                          (By Stuart Anderson)\n\n       ``Poverty is the open-mouthed, relentless hell which yawns \n     beneath civilized society.'' Henry George wrote these words \n     in 1879 and they remain true today. Unfortunately, many of \n     the techniques we have tried to alleviate suffering and break \n     the cycle of poverty have fallen far short of their goals. \n     These programs--the core of the Great Society--not only have \n     failed to revitalize cities, they have likely made the \n     situation worse.\n       A new, more comprehensive approach is needed to renew the \n     blighted portions of America's cities. Past programs have \n     relied on cash payments to the poor, government job training, \n     and even government-provided jobs. The key, however, is to \n     create wealth in the inner city, and to understand that \n     wealth cannot be created by government but only by the \n     private sector.\n       This understanding of wealth creation is at the core of a \n     promising new bill introduced by Connecticut U.S. Sen. Joseph \n     I. Lieberman and Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich. The Enhanced \n     Enterprise Zone Act of 1995 would establish a host of \n     incentives and reforms that would be added to those Congress \n     approved in the nine Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise \n     Communities in 1993. That legislation got bogged down in \n     details and without reform cannot achieve the goals that so \n     many of us have for improving life in the inner cities.\n       The reforms in Abraham and Lieberman's bill fall into three \n     categories: tax incentives, regulatory reform and educational \n     initiatives.\n       First, on tax incentives, the bill would establish a zero \n     capital gains rate on the sale of any qualified investment \n     held five years or longer in the zone. It would allow \n     additional income deductions to purchase qualified stock in \n     companies located in an enterprise zone. The bill would \n     double what small business owners in these zones could \n     expense and would provide a limited tax credit for \n     renovations of low-income properties. These are the types of \n     incentives to encourage entrepreneurs to plant roots for the \n     long haul.\n       Second, the senators realize that regulations, not just \n     high tax burdens, inhibit job creation in the inner city. The \n     bill would allow local governments to request waivers and \n     modifications of environmental and other regulations that a \n     mayor finds to be counterproductive and hindering job growth. \n     Federal agencies could disapprove requests at their \n     discretion but powerful political pressure could be brought \n     to bear on the bureaucracy that might create fascinating \n     experiments at the local level. Another reform of federal \n     regulations, based upon Jack Kemp from his stay at the \n     federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, would \n     provide both incentives and grants for homeownership and \n     resident management of public housing, vacant and foreclosed \n     properties, and financially-distressed properties.\n       Third, the bill recognizes that lack of educational \n     opportunity can subject children to a life without a real \n     economic future. The legislation therefore would create in \n     the nine Empowerment Zones, two supplemental empowerment \n     zones, and in Washington, D.C., a pilot school choice \n     program. This would allow parents with a low income to send \n     their children to public or private schools of their \n     choosing. Such parents would receive a certificate that could \n     be used to pay a portion of tuition and transportation costs \n     for elementary and high school children.\n       Already the debate over affirmative action has grown \n     divisive, especially because many African-Americans believe \n     that what few opportunities are available in the inner cities \n     will be snatched away from them by changed federal policies \n     or new court rulings. But as the Democratic Leadership \n     Council's Progressive Policy Institute report on affirmative \n     action notes, ``For blacks trapped at the bottom of the \n     economic pyramid, the main obstacle is not vestigial \n     discrimination but the breakdown of critical social and \n     public institutions, chiefly family and schools. Can anyone \n     doubt that dramatically lifting their academic and \n     occupational skills would have a greater impact on their life \n     prospects than maintaining preferences that mostly benefit \n     middle-class blacks, Hispanics, and women?\n       Let's get beyond the divisiveness of affirmative action, \n     which courts are already ruling to be unconstitutional. \n     Instead, we should look toward constructive solutions that \n     are more appropriately premised on a commitment to limited \n     government, personal responsibility, and a free market \n     economy. The tax incentives, regulatory reform, and school \n     choice initiatives in the Abraham-Lieberman bill will help \n     unleash the power of countless individuals. And while in the \n     past we have ignored this truism at our peril, it should be \n     remembered that only individuals and businesses, not \n     governments, can create the wealth that will lift people out \n     of poverty.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Michigan in proposing this important statement of Senate support \nfor an enhanced enterprise zone effort.\n  From the time I came to the Senate in 1989, I have been proud to work \nwith people like Jack Kemp in advocating enterprise zones for America's \ntroubled neighborhoods. He has been a true visionary, not only on the \nsubject of enterprise zones, but on the whole question of what America \nmust do to redeem the promise of economic opportunity for all \nAmericans.\n  We made progress on the road toward empowering poor Americans and \nrevitalizing impoverished communities in 1993 when we passed \nlegislation creating empowerment zones and enterprise communities in \nmore than 100 neighborhoods across this country. While a handful of \nempowerment zones received fairly substantial incentives through the \n1993 legislation the enterprise zones received very little in the way \nof incentives. Still, when all is said and done, enactment of this \nlegislation was a fundamental change in urban policy. It was a \nrecognition that Government did not have all the answers to the ills of \npoverty in this country. It recognized that American businesses can and \nmust play a role in revitalizing poor neighborhoods. Indeed, American \nbusiness involvement is essential if we are to break the cycle of \npoverty, drug abuse, illiteracy, and unemployment.\n  The 1993 breakthrough was a good start but it did not go far enough. \nThat is why I have joined with the Senator from Michigan in announcing \nan Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act of 1995. The sense-of-the-Senate we are \nconsidering today recognizes the need for this Senate to consider an \nenhanced enterprise zone package.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13357-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I have noted in recent weeks commentary \nfrom some analysts and in some publications that the proposals for \ntreatment of municipal bond interest in the USA tax plan which I have \ncoauthored with Senator Nunn would possibly, severely penalize \nparticipants in the municipal bond market. As I have explicitly stated \nbefore, it is not, repeat not, the intention of this Senator that \nparticipants in the municipal bond markets--whether investors, issuers, \nor other people--be penalized by the USA tax concept. \n\n[[Page S 13379]]\n\n  In my judgment, the questions raised by analysts about reducing the \nsavings deduction by the amount of tax-exempt income can be resolved \nwhen the actual writing of tax reform legislation occurs in the future. \nIt is my intention during those deliberations to make sure that \nmunicipal bonds retain a preference.\n  It is important to recognize that if the USA tax plan were to be \nenacted it would include significant incentives for savings and \ninvestment--the unlimited savings allowance--which defers Federal \nincome taxes on any income saved or invested. As individuals change \ntheir behavior to save and invest more, the national savings pool will \nincrease. In addition, the USA tax removes the bias for companies to \nuse debt financing instead of equity financing. More companies may \nchoose equity financing. These changes in the business Tax Code may \nlower the demand for borrowing. Increasing the savings pool will lower \ninterest rates and the cost of capital. Lower interest rates will \nbenefit all Americans who have to borrow. Since States and \nmunicipalities are big borrowers because they issue large quantities of \nbonds, lower interest rates should significantly benefit them, separate \nand apart from the specific USA tax provisions dealing with the tax \ntreatment of municipal bonds.\n  I hope that this statement clarifies matters for participants in the \nmunicipal bond market who may fear that either the USA tax plan would \npenalize them, or will make issuance of municipal bonds for legitimate \ngovernmental purpose more expensive in the future. Neither of those \noutcomes is the intent of this Senator and I will do all I can to \ninsure that neither occurs.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like join my good friend from New \nMexico in trying to alleviate the fears of those concerned about the \nUSA tax proposal's treatment of municipal bonds. In crafting our \nproposal, we explicitly elected to retain a preference for investments \nin municipal bonds, and we did so primarily to preserve the ability of \nState and local governments to obtain capital for needed infrastructure \nimprovements. It was never our intention to undermine our country's \nmunicipal bond market.\n  As Senator Domenici pointed out, some analysts believe the manner in \nwhich our proposal is crafted could erode substantially the current tax \npreference for municipal bond investments. Others, including an \neditorial at the Bond buyer, take a much more optimistic view and \nequate our proposal as being far too generous in its treatment of \nmunicipal bonds. I believe the truth falls somewhere in between these \ntwo analyses.\n  In the USA proposal, we have essentially equalized the tax treatment \nof all investments, including those investments in municipal bonds. All \ninvestments under the USA proposal are tax- deferred. However, the USA \nproposal makes an important distinction about the tax treatment of the \nreturns from these investments. The returns from investments other than \nmunicipal bonds would not be tax exempt unless the returns are \nreinvested in their entirety. On the other hand, returns from municipal \nbonds would be tax exempt and could be spent or reinvested without \nfuture income tax consequences. I believe this is an equitable outcome \nregarding the tax treatment of municipal bonds. If another approach, \nconsistent with the overall goals of the USA proposal, especially \nrevenue neutrality, can be found in this area, I am more than willing \nto consider such proposals.\n  Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I would like to raise a \nfinal point. I find it very interesting about the absence of any \nconcern about the elimination of any, I repeat any, preference for \nmunicipal bonds under either the flat tax or the national sales tax \nproposals. I do not mind the criticism of our proposal. Constructive \ncriticism is useful and can work to improve our proposal, but it would \nbe refreshing to have an informed, factual comparison of all the tax \nreplacement proposals and their tax treatment of municipal bonds, \nrather than a Chicken Little approach often evident today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13378-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      MATCHING AWARDS FOR EDUCATION GRANTS TO AMERICORPS GRADUATES\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues an \nextremely exciting and momentous development in regard to the \nAmeriCorps Program. Today, eight of Rhode Island's colleges and \nuniversities are announcing that they have each agreed to match the \n$4,725 education grant for every Rhode Island AmeriCorps participant \nwho successfully completes AmeriCorps service and attends one of the \nparticipating Rhode Island institutions. As a result of this \ncommitment, the education benefit for successful AmeriCorps \nparticipation will be at least $9,450.\n  As one of the first proponents of national service and of linking \nsuccessful completion of service to an education benefit, I believe \nthis is a remarkable and praiseworthy commitment to the concept of \ncommunity service.\n  I take special pride in commending each of those institutions for \nthis superb commitment. They include: the University of Rhode Island, \nthe Community College of Rhode Island, Brown University, Bryant \nCollege, Johnson and Wales University, Salve Regina University, the \nRhode Island School of Design, and Providence College. I might add that \nseveral other institutions in Rhode Island are currently exploring this \nidea, and the number may well grow.\n  I also want to pay special tribute to Mr. Lawrence Fish, chief \nexecutive officer of Citizens Financial Group in Providence, RI, who, \nas chair of the Rhode Island Commission on National Service, \nspearheaded the effort that resulted in this truly historic \nachievement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13379-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13379-S13380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    FEDERAL EXPRESS HUB AT SUBIC BAY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Federal \nExpress Corp. on the opening last week of its new cargo hub at Subic \nBay in the Philippines. This is a very favorable development for \nconsumers of shipping services on both sides of the Pacific.\n  As many will remember, Federal Express had intended that its Subic \nBay hub be fully operational in July. Unfortunately, even though the \nUnited States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement clearly authorized \nFederal Express to do so, the Government of Japan refused to permit \nFederal Express to operate several flights from Japan which were \nintegral to its hub operation. In late July, Japan reversed its \nposition and thereby enabled the Subic Bay hub, the cornerstone of \nFederal Express' intra-Asian network, to become fully operational.\n  As a result of the Subic Bay hub operation, consumers will be able to \nrely on expanded intra-Asian and trans-Pacific service. However, \nconsumer choice will not be the only benefit. A recent article from the \nJournal of Commerce predicts this expanded service will come at a \nreduced cost to consumers. One economist estimates the price of intra-\nAsian shipping may drop by as much as 25 percent as a result of \ncompetition from Federal Express' intra-Asian network. I am confident \nthe Federal Express experience in Subic Bay will again prove U.S. air \ncarriers can compete effectively in any international market they have \na chance to serve.\n  With respect to the widespread benefits of the Subic Bay hub, the \nJournal of Commerce article points out a very interesting irony. By \nviolating the United States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement, the \nGovernment of Japan tried to prevent the Subic Bay hub from opening. \nYet, Japanese companies are among the first flocking to the Subic Bay \narea to set up operations so they can benefit from Federal Express' \nsuperior air delivery services. For example, the Japan International \nDevelopment Organization is planning a 450-acre industrial park in the \narea which will serve as a research and manufacturing center for 10 \nJapanese companies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Journal of Commerce \nto which I have referred be printed in the Record at the end of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on several occasions during the pendency \nof the United States/Japan cargo aviation dispute I cautioned that the \neconomic stakes in that dispute were very \n\n[[Page S 13380]]\nsignificant. A recent study by the Boeing Co. emphasizes the critical \nimportance of our firm stand during that dispute.\n  Boeing Company's recently released annual world cargo forecast \npredicts the highest air freight market growth over the next 20 years \nwill occur on Asian routes. Moreover, the study found international \nexpress delivery service grew 25 percent last year and it predicts the \nmarket will grow 18 percent a year for the next 20 years. That is why \nit was of critical importance that we safeguarded Federal Express' \nbeyond rights. Now, Federal Express is well-positioned to earn its fair \nshare of expanding Pacific rim business opportunities.\n  Later this month in Tokyo, our negotiators will attempt to secure a \nUnited States/Japan open skies agreement on cargo. I hope these talks \nresult in the fullest liberalization of cargo shipping rights possible. \nI am confident our cargo carriers can effectively compete with their \nJapanese counterparts if protectionist regulations are eliminated and \nmarket forces are allowed to work.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Journal of Commerce, Aug. 31, 1995]\n\n            FedEx Hub To Give Lift To Shippers, Philippines\n\n               (By William Armbruster and P.T. Bangsberg)\n\n       Subic Bay, once the jumping off point for the U.S. \n     military's cold war efforts in Asia, becomes key to Federal \n     Express Corp.'s expansion plans on Monday, providing a major \n     boost for the company, the local Philippine economy and both \n     Asian and North American shippers.\n       AsiaOne, FedEx's intra-Asian network, opens its new Asia \n     hub Sept. 4 at the former naval base. The operation, which \n     nearly sparked a trade war with Japan, is shaking up the \n     Asian market, making both regional and trans-Pacific \n     shipments easier, quicker and cheaper while spurring foreign \n     investment in the Philippines.\n       ``It's really going to expand opportunities for investment \n     in the Philippines,'' said Levi Richardson, director of the \n     U.S.-Philippine Business Committee in Washington.\n       AsiaOne, FedEx's intra-Asia network, ``will make the \n     Philippines very attractive as a regional hub for other \n     companies,'' Mr. Richardson said. ``A lot of small and medium \n     companies are looking at countries with a good \n     infrastructure. FedEx's investment is going to provide them \n     an opportunity to grow their business.''\n       Joseph Schwieterman, a transportation economist at DePaul \n     University in Chicago, said the new FedEx service will lead \n     to intense price competition.\n       ``I think you're going to see the price of intra-Asia \n     shipments drop as much as 25% as competition heats up,'' he \n     said, adding that AsiaOne also will provide overnight service \n     on some routes for the first time.\n       Much of the foreign investment thus far at Subic Bay, a \n     former U.S. naval base, has come from Taiwanese companies, \n     such as Acer Inc., ranked the world's seventh-largest brand \n     name personal computer vendor in 1994 by International Data \n     Corp. in Framingham, Mass.\n       ``The new FedEx service will be a great benefit for us by \n     cutting lead time inbound and speeding shipments outbound,'' \n     said\n      Kenny Wang, manager at Acer Information Products \n     (Philippines) Inc.\n       ``Having a direct flight into Subic from Taipel will cut \n     the time for delivery of components to one or two days from \n     two or three days when routed via Manila, and 10 days by \n     sea,'' Mr. Wang told The Journal of Commerce.\n       Cliff Deeds, a FedEx spokesman, said the carrier will have \n     a single cutoff time for pickups in the Asian markets served \n     by the new network, whereas shippers in the past faced \n     different cutoffs depending on where they were shipping their \n     goods. For those in Penang, a high-tech manufacturing center \n     off the northwest coast, they might have a 1 p.m. deadline \n     for shipments to Seoul, but a 2 p.m. cutoff for packages \n     going to Taipei.\n       Under the new FedEx network, the cutoff in Singapore will \n     be 4 p.m., for example, but at Subic Bay, it will be 10 p.m., \n     Mr. Deeds said.\n       ``I see FedEx being instrumental in bringing Asian markets \n     closer to the U.S.,'' said Raul Rabe, the Philippines' \n     ambassador to the United States.\n       The Subic Bay flights, connecting 11 Asian business \n     centers, will hook up with the carrier's expanded trans-\n     Pacific operation. Acer's Mr. Wang said he looks forward to \n     the new flight starting Sept. 4 from Osaka to Oakland, \n     Calif., where FedEx has a regional hub serving Silicon \n     Valley. ``We've been promised one-day service on that run,'' \n     he said.\n       Subic is Acer's first manufacturing site outside Taiwan. It \n     has earmarked $35 million over the next two years for \n     expansion, with officials expecting to double capacity of its \n     existing complex to 200,000 units by next year.\n       Acer will also add a global repair center at Subic ``to \n     take advantage of the abundant availability of high-quality \n     local engineering talent,'' said Managing Director Harvey \n     Chang.\n\n\n                     texas instruments greets move\n\n       Larry Horton, manager of logistics carrier management for \n     Texas Instruments, welcomed the new FedEx operation. ``It \n     will give us a lot more cargo flights,'' he said. ``We used \n     to have to rely on commercial carriers for intra-Asia \n     shipments.''\n       The semiconductor manufacturer has a large operation in the \n     Philippine city of Baguio and hopes FedEx will set up a small \n     feeder service linking it with Subic Bay, he said, adding \n     that the new hub will enable the company to feed its plants \n     in Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore.\n       ``It should help us. Cycle time should be improved. \n     Inventory reduction should take place,'' Mr. Horton said.\n\n\n                            another memphis\n\n       Joseph C. McCarty, FedEx's vice president for Asia, told a \n     conference in Washington this summer that the Subic Bay \n     operation will do for the Philippines what the carrier's main \n     hub in Memphis has done for that city, where more than 100 \n     companies have set up manufacturing operations to take \n     advantage of the carrier's overnight network.\n       Japanese companies are starting to move in. The Japan \n     International Development Organization is planning a 450-acre \n     industrial park that will serve as a research and \n     manufacturing center for 10 Japanese companies.\n       Subic, meanwhile, is promoting itself as an alternative \n     printing and distribution center in Asia, a field now \n     dominated by Hong Kong and Singapore.\n       Eric Montandon, manager at New Age Publications in Subic, \n     said the new FedEx service could help his firm. New Age is \n     essentially a printer, but also distributes newsletters, \n     advertising and other material within the region.\n       ``We were spun off and set up at Subic in anticipation of \n     good air connections,'' he told The Journal of Commerce. ``We \n     need the overnight service to Southeast Asia FedEx is now \n     promising.''\n       Current movement to Singapore can be two or even four days, \n     he said.\n       DHL Worldwide Express plans to set up its own intra-Asia \n     hub later this fall in Manila, but has had difficulty putting \n     all the pieces together. Nonetheless, spokesman Dave \n     Fonkalsrud said its traffic within the region was up 48% in \n     the first half of this year, reflecting the tremendous \n     potential in the world's fastest-growing area.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13379-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under \nthe U.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money \nthat has not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House \nand Senate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Monday, \nSeptember 11, stood at $4,962,944,077,933.57 or $18,839.42 for every \nman, woman, and child in America on a per capita basis.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13380-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13380-S13381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       MICKELSON WETLAND MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, nearly 2\\1/2\\ years have passed since \nSouth Dakota Gov. George S. Mickelson and eight distinguished South \nDakota businessmen were killed tragically when their small aircraft \ncrashed near Dubuque, IA. During this time, South Dakotans have grieved \ntogether over the loss of the crash victims. They are greatly missed.\n  Dealing with the loss of these prominent citizens has not been easy. \nYet, the people of South Dakota have been strong. They have channeled \ntheir sorrow into great displays of respect and affection for the crash \nvictims. Memorials have been built, statues erected, scholarships \nfunded, and schools renamed--all in honor of the nine who perished in \nthe fiery crash. I am proud of South Dakotans.\n  Last Saturday, September 9, a marsh near Estelline, SD, was dedicated \nin memory of Governor Mickelson, an avid geese hunter. Commissioned to \npaint an image of the Mickelson Wetland Memorial, Mark Anderson, a \nSouth Dakota wildlife artist, created a poignant image of the late \nGovernor \n\n[[Page S 13381]]\nand the marsh. These tributes are powerful. They are reminders of the \nadmiration and respect South Dakotans hold for the crash victims. They \nare reminders of the lives--not the deaths--of nine fellow South \nDakotans. They are reminders of how their lives gave our lives and our \nState meaning and fulfillment.\n  Kevin Woster of the Sioux Falls, SD, Argus Leader, recently wrote an \narticle describing the painting Mark Anderson completed of the wetland \nmemorial. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks. It is unfortunate that my \nschedule prevented my wife Harriet and me from being at last Saturday's \ndedication. Our thoughts and prayers certainly were with Linda \nMickelson and the families and friends of George Mickelson on that \nspecial day. The dedication of the marsh and Mark Anderson's work are a \nfitting tribute to a great South Dakotan who dedicated his life to a \nState and a people he loved.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Sioux Falls, SD, Argus Leader, Sept. 9, 1995]\n\n                   Mickelson Marsh's Dedication Today\n\n                           (By Kevin Woster)\n\n       Sioux Falls wildlife artist Mark Anderson will leave his \n     mark today on dedication ceremonies for a wetland memorial to \n     the late Gov. George Mickelson.\n       Anderson, 37, was commissioned by Mickelson friends to do a \n     painting of the wetland, including an image of Mickelson.\n       The painting shows the marsh 3 miles west of Estelline with \n     a flock of Canada geese hovering above the water.\n       That was the easy part for Anderson, who has been painting \n     wildlife for 15 years. But he struggled with Mickelson's \n     image.\n       ``It was really challenging, because this was the first \n     time I ever attempted a portrait,'' the self-taught artist \n     said.\n       ``And I wanted this one to be right.''\n       It turned out it wasn't right the first time around. When \n     Anderson showed the painting to Mickelson's wife, Linda, and \n     son, Mark, they thought the marsh and geese were perfect.\n       But the image of Mickelson wasn't quite right.\n       ``You hate to tell somebody that, but I was honest with him \n     and so was Mom,'' Mark Mickelson said.\n       ``He didn't have a very good print of Dad to work with in \n     the first place.''\n       So Linda Mickelson provided photographs that helped \n     Anderson more clearly capture her husband. And he finally \n     produced an almost-ghostly image of the late governor wearing \n     a baseball cap that reads ``Top Gov.''\n       Mickelson wore the hat at his annual governor's hunt and \n     other outdoor events.\n       ``When I brought it back, Mark said, `That's Dad.' And I \n     knew I had it,'' Anderson said.\n       Mark Mickelson agreed.\n       ``He nailed it the second time. It's quite a tribute to a \n     wildlife artist to do such a good job on a portrait.''\n       A small version of the painting is included in the brochure \n     for today's dedication.\n       And the Mickelson Wetland Memorial Committee paid for 175 \n     prints, which will be signed by Anderson and given to major \n     donors to the wetland project.\n       Committee members gave the original painting to Linda \n     Mickelson, Friday night.\n       Mark Mickelson said the painting reflects the essence of \n     the memorial.\n       ``He captured the spirit of the marsh,'' mark Mickelson \n     said.\n       ``And he captured the spirit of Dad's friends, who really \n     were the impetus behind the project.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13380-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13381-S13442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The text of the bill (S. 1124) bill to authorize appropriations for \nfiscal year 1996 for military activities of the Department of Defense, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes, as passed by the Senate on September 6, \n1995, is as follows:\n                                S. 1124\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Missile Defense Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 232. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and \n     cruise missiles is significant and growing, both \n     quantitatively and qualitatively.\n       (2) The deployment of effective Theater Missile Defense \n     systems can deny potential adversaries the option of \n     escalating a conflict by threatening or attacking United \n     States forces, coalition partners of the United States, or \n     allies of the United States with ballistic missiles armed \n     with weapons of mass destruction to offset the operational \n     and technical advantages of the United States and its \n     coalition partners and allies.\n       (3) The intelligence community of the United States has \n     estimated that (A) the missile proliferation trend is toward \n     longer range and more sophisticated ballistic missiles, (B) \n     North Korea may deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile \n     capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within 5 years, and (C) \n     although a new indigenously developed ballistic missile \n     threat to the continental United States is not forecast \n     within the next 10 years there is a danger that determined \n     countries will acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in \n     the near future and with little warning by means other than \n     indigenous development.\n       (4) The deployment by the United States and its allies of \n     effective defenses against ballistic missiles of all ranges, \n     as well as against cruise missiles, can reduce the incentives \n     for countries to acquire such missiles or to augment existing \n     missile capabilities.\n\n[[Page S 13389]]\n\n       (5) The Cold War distinction between strategic ballistic \n     missiles and nonstrategic ballistic missiles and, therefore, \n     the ABM Treaty's distinction between strategic defense and \n     nonstrategic defense, has changed because of technological \n     advancements and should be reviewed.\n       (6) The concept of mutual assured destruction, which was \n     one of the major philosophical rationales for the ABM Treaty, \n     is now questionable as a basis for stability in a multipolar \n     world in which the United States and the states of the former \n     Soviet Union are seeking to normalize relations and eliminate \n     Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (7) Theater and national missile defenses can contribute to \n     the maintenance of stability as missile threats proliferate \n     and as the United States and the former Soviet Union \n     significantly reduce the number of strategic nuclear forces \n     in their respective inventories.\n       (8) Although technology control regimes and other forms of \n     international arms control can contribute to \n     nonproliferation, such measures alone are inadequate for \n     dealing with missile proliferation, and should not be viewed \n     as alternatives to missile defenses and other active and \n     passive defenses.\n       (9) Due to limitations in the ABM Treaty which preclude \n     deployment of more than 100 ground-based ABM interceptors at \n     a single site, the United States is currently prohibited from \n     deploying a national missile defense system capable of \n     defending the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii \n     against even the most limited ballistic missile attacks.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) deploy as soon as possible affordable and operationally \n     effective theater missile defenses capable of countering \n     existing and emerging theater ballistic missiles;\n       (2)(A) develop for deployment a multiple-site national \n     missile defense system that: (i) is affordable and \n     operationally effective against limited, accidental, and \n     unauthorized ballistic missile attacks on the territory of \n     the United States, and (ii) can be augmented over time as the \n     threat changes to provide a layered defense against limited, \n     accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile threats;\n       (B) initiate negotiations with the Russian Federation as \n     necessary to provide for the national missile defense systems \n     specified in section 235; and\n       (C) consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of \n     withdrawing from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of the Treaty, subject to \n     consultations between the President and the Senate;\n       (3) ensure congressional review, prior to a decision to \n     deploy the system developed for deployment under paragraph \n     (2), of: (A) the affordability and operational effectiveness \n     of such a system; (B) the threat to be countered by such a \n     system; and (C) ABM Treaty considerations with respect to \n     such a system.\n       (4) improve existing cruise missile defenses and deploy as \n     soon as practical defenses that are affordable and \n     operationally effective against advanced cruise missiles;\n       (5) pursue a focused research and development program to \n     provide follow-on ballistic missile defense options;\n       (6) employ streamlined acquisition procedures to lower the \n     cost and accelerate the pace of developing and deploying \n     theater missile defenses, cruise missile defenses, and \n     national missile defenses;\n       (7) seek a cooperative transition to a regime that does not \n     feature mutual assured destruction and an offense-only form \n     of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability; and\n       (8) carry out the policies, programs, and requirements of \n     subtitle C of title II of this Act through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 234. THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Core Program.--To implement the policy \n     established in section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a top priority core theater missile defense program \n     consisting of the following systems:\n       (1) The Patriot PAC-3 system, with a first unit equipped \n     (FUE) in fiscal year 1998.\n       (2) The Navy Lower Tier (Area) system, with a user \n     operational evaluation system (UOES) capability in fiscal \n     year 1997 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       (3) The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, \n     with a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability \n     in fiscal year 1997 and an initial operational capability \n     (IOC) no later than fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) The Navy Upper Tier (Theater Wide) system, with a user \n     operational evaluation system (UOES) capability in fiscal \n     year 1999 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 2001.\n       (b) Interoperability and Support of Core Systems.--To \n     maximize effectiveness and flexibility, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall ensure that core theater missile defense \n     systems are interoperable and fully capable of exploiting \n     external sensor and battle management support from systems \n     such as the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), \n     the Army's Battlefield Integration Center (BIC), air and \n     space-based sensors including, in particular, the Space and \n     Missile Tracking System (SMTS).\n       (c) Termination of Programs.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall terminate the Boost Phase Interceptor (BPI) program.\n       (d) Follow-on Systems.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     develop an affordable development plan for follow-on theater \n     missile defense systems which leverages existing systems, \n     technologies, and programs, and focuses investments to \n     satisfy military requirements not met by the core program.\n       (2) Before adding new theater missile defense systems to \n     the core program from among the follow-on activities, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report describing--\n       (A) the requirements for the program and the specific \n     threats to be countered;\n       (B) how the new program will relate to, support, and \n     leverage off existing core programs;\n       (C) the planned acquisition strategy; and\n       (D) a preliminary estimate of total program cost and \n     budgetary impact.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than the date on which the \n     President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report detailing the Secretary's plans for \n     implementing the guidance specified in this section.\n       (2) For each deployment date for each system described in \n     subsection (a), the report required by paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 235. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) In General.--To implement the policy established in \n     section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall develop an \n     affordable and operationally effective national missile \n     defense system to counter a limited, accidental, or \n     unauthorized ballistic missile attack, and which is capable \n     of attaining initial operational capability (IOC) by the end \n     of 2003. Such system shall include the following:\n       (1) Ground-based interceptors capable of being deployed at \n     multiple sites, the locations and numbers of which are to be \n     determined so as to optimize the defensive coverage of the \n     continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks.\n       (2) Fixed ground-based radars and space-based sensors, \n     including the Space and Missile Tracking system, the mix, \n     siting and numbers of which are to be determined so as to \n     optimize sensor support and minimize total system cost.\n       (3) Battle management, command, control, and communications \n     (BM/C3).\n       (b) Interim Operational Capability.--To provide a hedge \n     against the emergence of near-term ballistic missile threats \n     against the United States and to support the development and \n     deployment of the objective system specified in subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of Defense shall develop an interim \n     national missile defense plan that would give the United \n     States the ability to field a limited operational capability \n     by the end of 1999 if required by the threat. In developing \n     this plan the Secretary shall make use of--\n       (1) developmental, or user operational evaluation system \n     (UOES) interceptors, radars, and battle management, command, \n     control, and communications (BM/C3), to the extent that such \n     use directly supports, and does not significantly increase \n     the cost of, the objective system specified in subsection \n     (a);\n       (2) one or more of the sites that will be used as \n     deployment locations for the objective system specified in \n     subsection (a);\n       (3) upgraded early warning radars; and\n       (4) space-based sensors.\n       (c) Use of Streamlined Acquisition Procedures.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall prescribe and use streamlined \n     acquisition procedures to--\n       (1) reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n     developing the national missile defense system specified in \n     subsection (a); and\n       (2) ensure that any interim national missile defense \n     capabilities developed pursuant to subsection (b) are \n     operationally effective and on a path to fulfill the \n     technical requirements and schedule of the objective system.\n       (d) Additional Cost Saving Measures.--In addition to the \n     procedures prescribed pursuant to subsection (c), the \n     Secretary of Defense shall employ cost saving measures that \n     do not decrease the operational effectiveness of the systems \n     specified in subsections (a) and (b), and which do not pose \n     unacceptable technical risk. The cost saving measures should \n     include the following:\n       (1) The use of existing facilities and infrastructure.\n       (2) The use, where appropriate, of existing or upgraded \n     systems and technologies, except that Minuteman boosters may \n     not be used as part of a National Missile Defense \n     architecture.\n       (3) Development of systems and components that do not rely \n     on a large and permanent infrastructure and are easily \n     transported, emplaced, and moved.\n       (e) Report on Plan for Deployment.--Not later than the date \n     on which the President submits the budget for fiscal year \n     1997 under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report containing the following matters:\n       (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this section. \n\n[[Page S 13390]]\n\n       (2) For each deployment date in subsections (a) and (b), \n     the report shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a) or (b). The report shall also describe the \n     specific threat to be countered and provide the Secretary's \n     assessment as to whether deployment is affordable and \n     operationally effective.\n       (3) An analysis of options for supplementing or modifying \n     the national missile defense architecture specified in \n     subsection (a) before attaining initial operational \n     capability, or evolving such architecture in a building block \n     manner after attaining initial operational capability, to \n     improve the cost-effectiveness or the operational \n     effectiveness of such system by adding one or a combination \n     of the following:\n       (A) Additional ground-based interceptors at existing or new \n     sites.\n       (B) Sea-based missile defense systems.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n\n     SEC. 236. CRUISE MISSILE DEFENSE INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense shall undertake \n     an initiative to coordinate and strengthen the cruise missile \n     defense programs, projects, and activities of the military \n     departments, the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to ensure that the \n     United States develops and deploys affordable and \n     operationally effective defenses against existing and future \n     cruise missile threats.\n       (b) Actions of the Secretary of Defense.--In carrying out \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that--\n       (1) to the extent practicable, the ballistic missile \n     defense and cruise missile defense efforts of the Department \n     of Defense are coordinated and mutually reinforcing;\n       (2) existing air defense systems are adequately upgraded to \n     provide an affordable and operationally effective defense \n     against existing and near-term cruise missile threats; and\n       (3) the Department of Defense undertakes a high priority \n     and well coordinated technology development program to \n     support the future deployment of systems that are affordable \n     and operationally effective against advanced cruise missiles, \n     including cruise missiles with low observable features.\n       (c) Implementation Plan.--Not later than the date on which \n     the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a detailed plan, in unclassified and classified \n     forms, as necessary, for carrying out this section. The plan \n     shall include an assessment of--\n       (1) the systems that currently have cruise missile defense \n     capabilities, and existing programs to improve these \n     capabilities;\n       (2) the technologies that could be deployed in the near- to \n     mid-term to provide significant advances over existing cruise \n     missile defense capabilities, and the investments that would \n     be required to ready the technologies for deployment;\n       (3) the cost and operational tradeoffs, if any, between \n     upgrading existing air and missile defense systems and \n     accelerating follow-on systems with significantly improved \n     capabilities against advanced cruise missiles; and\n       (4) the organizational and management changes that would \n     strengthen and further coordinate the cruise missile defense \n     efforts of the Department of Defense, including the \n     disadvantages, if any, of implementing such changes.\n\n     SEC. 237. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Article XIII of the ABM Treaty envisions ``possible \n     changes in the strategic situation which have a bearing on \n     the provisions of this treaty''.\n       (2) Articles XIII and XIV of the ABM Treaty establish means \n     for the Parties to amend the Treaty, and the Parties have \n     employed these means to amend the Treaty.\n       (3) Article XV of the ABM Treaty establishes the means for \n     a party to withdraw from the Treaty, upon 6 months notice, \n     ``if it decides that extraordinary events related to the \n     subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests''.\n       (4) The policies, programs, and requirements of subtitle C \n     of title II of this Act can be accomplished through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings and \n     policies provided in this subtitle, it is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) Given the fundamental responsibility of the Government \n     of the United States to protect the security of the United \n     States, the increasingly serious threat posed to the United \n     States by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n     and ballistic missile technology, and the effect this threat \n     could have on the options of the United States to act in a \n     time of crisis--\n       (A) it is in the vital national security interest of the \n     United States to defend itself from the threat of a limited, \n     accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile attack, \n     whatever its source; and\n       (B) the deployment of a national missile defense system, in \n     accord with section 233, to protect the territory of the \n     United States against a limited, accidental, or unauthorized \n     missile attack can strengthen strategic stability and \n     deterrence; and\n       (2)(A) the Senate should undertake a comprehensive review \n     of the continuing value and validity of the ABM Treaty with \n     the intent of providing additional policy guidance on the \n     future of the ABM Treaty during the second session of the One \n     Hundred Fourth Congress; and\n       (B) upon completion of the review, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, in consultation with the Committee on Armed \n     Services and other appropriate committees, should report its \n     findings to the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 238. PROHIBITION ON FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNATIONAL \n                   AGREEMENT CONCERNING THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE \n                   SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 234 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 provides that the ABM Treaty does not \n     apply to or limit research, development, testing, or \n     deployment of missile defense systems, system upgrades, or \n     system components that are designed to counter modern theater \n     ballistic missiles, regardless of the capabilities of such \n     missiles, unless those systems, system upgrades, or system \n     components are tested against or have demonstrated \n     capabilities to counter modern strategic ballistic missiles.\n       (2) Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1995 provides that the United States shall \n     not be bound by any international agreement that would \n     substantially modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is \n     entered into pursuant to the treaty making power of the \n     President under the Constitution.\n       (3) the demarcation standard described in subsection (b)(1) \n     is based upon current technology.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) unless a missile defense system, system upgrade, or \n     system component, including one that exploits data from \n     space-based or other external sensors, is flight tested \n     against a ballistic missile target that exceeds a range of \n     3,500 kilometers or a velocity of 5 kilometers per second, \n     such missile defense system, system upgrade, or system \n     component has not been tested in an ABM mode nor deemed to \n     have been given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic \n     missiles, and\n       (2) any international agreement that would limit the \n     research, development, testing, or deployment of missile \n     defense systems, system upgrades, or system components that \n     are designed to counter modern theater ballistic missiles in \n     a manner that would be more restrictive than the criteria in \n     paragraph (1) should be entered into only pursuant to the \n     treaty making powers of the President under the Constitution.\n       (c) Prohibition on Funding.--Funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available to the Department of Defense for \n     fiscal year 1996 may not be obligated or expended to \n     implement an agreement with any of the independent states of \n     the former Soviet Union entered into after January 1, 1995 \n     that would establish a demarcation between theater missile \n     defense systems and anti-ballistic missile systems for \n     purposes of the ABM Treaty or that would restrict the \n     performance, operation, or deployment of United States \n     theater missile defense systems except: (1) to the extent \n     provided in an Act enacted subsequent to this Act; (2) to \n     implement that portion of any such agreement that implements \n     the criteria in subsection (b)(1); or (3) to implement any \n     such agreement that is entered into pursuant to the treaty \n     making power of the President under the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 239.

MERITORIOUS AND VALOROUS SERVICE DURING VIETNAM \n                   ERA: REVIEW AND AWARDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Ia Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign, carried out by \n     the Armed Forces of the United States in the Ia Drang Valley \n     of Vietnam from October 23, 1965, to November 26, 1965, is \n     illustrative of the many battles which pitted forces of the \n     United States against North Vietnamese Army regulars and Viet \n     Cong in vicious fighting in which many members of the Armed \n     Forces displayed extraordinary heroism, sacrifice, and \n     bravery which has not yet been officially recognized through \n     award of appropriate decorations.\n       (2) Accounts of these battles published since the war ended \n     authoritatively document repeated acts of extraordinary \n     heroism, sacrifice, and bravery on the part of many members \n     of the Armed Forces who were engaged in these battles, many \n     of whom have never been officially recognized for those acts.\n       (3) In some of the battles United States military units \n     suffered substantial losses, in some cases a majority of the \n     strength of the units.\n       (4) The incidence of heavy casualties throughout the war \n     inhibited the timely collection of comprehensive and detailed \n     information to support recommendations for awards for the \n     acts of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery performed.\n       (5) Requests to the Secretaries of the military departments \n     for review of award recommendations for those acts have been \n     denied because of restrictions in law and regulations that \n     require timely filing of recommendations and documented \n     justification.\n       (6) Acts of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery performed in \n     combat by members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     deserve appropriate and timely recognition by the people of \n     the United States.\n       (7) It is appropriate to recognize military personnel for \n     acts of extraordinary heroism, sacrifice, or bravery that are \n     belatedly, but properly, documented by persons who witnessed \n     those acts.\n       (b) Waiver of Restrictions on Awards.--(1) Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, the Secretary of Defense or the \n     Secretary of the military department concerned may award or \n     upgrade a decoration to any person for an act, an \n     achievement, or service that the person performed in a \n     campaign while serving on active duty during the Vietnam era.\n       (2) Paragraph (1) applies to any decoration (including any \n     device in lieu of a decoration) that, during or after the \n     Vietnam era and before the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     was authorized by law or under regulations of the Department \n     of Defense or the military department concerned to be awarded \n     to a person for an act, an achievement, or service performed \n     by that person while serving on active duty.\n       (c) Review of Award Recommendations.--(1) The Secretary of \n     each military department shall review all recommendations for \n     awards for acts, achievements, or service described in \n     subsection (b)(1) that have been received by the Secretary \n     during the period of the review.\n       (2) The Secretaries shall begin the review within 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act and shall \n     complete the review within one year after such date.\n       (3) The Secretary may use the same process for carrying out \n     the review as the Secretary uses for reviewing other \n     recommendations for awarding decorations to members of the \n     armed force or armed forces under the Secretary's \n     jurisdiction for acts, achievements, or service.\n       (4)(A) Upon completing the review, the Secretary shall \n     submit a report on the review to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives.\n       (B) The report shall contain the following information on \n     each recommendation for award reviewed:\n       (i) A summary of the recommendation.\n       (ii) The findings resulting from the review.\n       (iii) The final action taken on the recommendation.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Vietnam era'' has the meaning given that \n     term in section 101(29) of title 38, United States Code.\n       (2) The term ``active duty'' has the meaning given such \n     term in section 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 543.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LIMITING THE PLACING OF \n                   UNITED STATES FORCES UNDER UNITED NATIONS \n                   COMMAND OR CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the President has made United Nations peace operations \n     a major component of the foreign and security policies of the \n     United States;\n       (2) the President has committed United States military \n     personnel under United Nations operational control to \n     missions in Haiti, Croatia, and Macedonia that could endanger \n     those personnel;\n       (3) the President has committed the United States to deploy \n     as many as 25,000 military personnel to Bosnia-Herzegovina as \n     peacekeepers under United Nations command and control in the \n     event that the parties to that conflict reach a peace \n     agreement;\n       (4) although the President has insisted that he will retain \n     command of United States forces at all times, in the past \n     this has meant administrative control of United States forces \n     only, while operational control has been ceded to United \n     Nations commanders, some of whom were foreign nationals;\n       (5) the experience of United States forces participating in \n     combined United States-United Nations operations in Somalia, \n     and in combined United Nations-NATO operations in the former \n     Yugoslavia, demonstrate that prerequisites for effective \n     military operations such as unity of command and clarity of \n     mission have not been met by United Nations command and \n     control arrangements; and\n       (6) despite the many deficiencies in the conduct of United \n     Nations peace operations, there may be occasions when it is \n     in the national security interests of the United States to \n     participate in such operations.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should consult closely with Congress \n     regarding any United Nations peace operation that could \n     involve United States combat forces, and that such \n     consultations should continue throughout the duration of such \n     activities;\n       (2) the President should consult with Congress prior to a \n     vote within the United Nations Security Council on any \n     resolution which would authorize, extend, or revise the \n     mandates for such activities;\n       (3) in view of the complexity of United Nations peace \n     operations and the difficulty of achieving unity of command \n     and expeditious decisionmaking, the United States should \n     participate in such operations only when it is clearly in the \n     national security interest to do so;\n       (4) United States combat forces should be under the \n     operational control of qualified commanders and should have \n     clear and effective command and control arrangements and \n     rules of engagement (which do not restrict their self-defense \n     in any way) and clear and unambiguous mission statements; and\n       (5) none of the Armed Forces of the United States should be \n     under the operational control of foreign nationals in United \n     Nations peace enforcement operations except in the most \n     extraordinary circumstances.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``United Nations peace enforcement \n     operations'' means any international peace enforcement or \n     similar activity that is authorized by the United Nations \n     Security Council under chapter VII of the Charter of the \n     United Nations; and\n       (2) the term ``United Nations peace operations'' means any \n     international peacekeeping, peacemaking, peace enforcement, \n     or similar activity that is authorized by the United Nations \n     Security Council under chapter VI or VII of the Charter of \n     the United Nations.\n\n     SEC. 1062. SENSE OF SENATE ON PROTECTION OF UNITED STATES \n                   FROM BALLISTIC MISSILE ATTACK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles presents a threat to the entire World.\n       (2) This threat was recognized by Secretary of Defense \n     William J. Perry in February 1995 in the Annual Report to the \n     President and the Congress which states that ``[b]eyond the \n     five declared nuclear weapons states, at least 20 other \n     nations have acquired or are attempting to acquire weapons of \n     mass destruction--nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons--\n     and the means to deliver them. In fact, in most areas where \n     United States forces could potentially be engaged on a large \n     scale, many of the most likely adversaries already possess \n     chemical and biological weapons. Moreover, some of these same \n     states appear determined to acquire nuclear weapons.''.\n       (3) At a summit in Moscow in May 1995, President Clinton \n     and President Yeltsin commented on this threat in a Joint \n     Statement which recognizes `` . . . the threat posed by \n     worldwide proliferation of missiles and missile technology \n     and the necessity of counteracting this threat . . . ''.\n       (4) At least 25 countries may be developing weapons of mass \n     destruction and the delivery systems for such weapons.\n       (5) At least 24 countries have chemical weapons programs in \n     various stages of research and development.\n       (6) Approximately 10 countries are believed to have \n     biological weapons programs in various stages of development.\n       (7) At least 10 countries are reportedly interested in the \n     development of nuclear weapons.\n       (8) Several countries recognize that weapons of mass \n     destruction and missiles increase their ability to deter, \n     coerce, or otherwise threaten the United States. Saddam \n     Hussein recognized this when he stated, on May 8, 1990, that \n     ``[o]ur missiles cannot reach Washington. If they could reach \n     Washington, we would strike it if the need arose.''.\n       (9) International regimes like the Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, and the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, while effective, cannot by \n     themselves halt the spread of weapons and technology. On \n     January 10, 1995, Director of Central Intelligence, James \n     Woolsey, said with regard to Russia that `` . . . we are \n     particularly concerned with the safety of nuclear, chemical, \n     and biological materials as well as highly enriched uranium \n     or plutonium, although I want to stress that this is \n\n[[Page S 13429]]\n     a global problem. For example, highly enriched uranium was recently \n     stolen from South Africa, and last month Czech authorities \n     recovered three kilograms of 87.8 percent-enriched HEU in the \n     Czech Republic--the largest seizure of near-weapons grade \n     material to date outside the Former Soviet Union.''.\n       (10) The possession of weapons of mass destruction and \n     missiles by developing countries threatens our friends, \n     allies, and forces abroad and will ultimately threaten the \n     United States directly. On August 11, 1994, Deputy Secretary \n     of Defense John Deutch said that ``[i]f the North Koreans \n     field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, Alaska, and parts of \n     Hawaii would potentially be at risk.''.\n       (11) The end of the Cold War has changed the strategic \n     environment facing and between the United States and Russia. \n     That the Clinton Administration believes the environment to \n     have changed was made clear by Secretary of Defense William \n     J. Perry on September 20, 1994, when he stated that ``[w]e \n     now have the opportunity to create a new relationship, based \n     not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but rather on \n     another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.''.\n       (12) The United States and Russia have the opportunity to \n     create a relationship based on trust rather than fear.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     all Americans should be protected from accidental, \n     intentional, or limited ballistic missile attack.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nlength of service awards to volunteers performing fire fighting or \nprevention services, emergency medical services, or ambulance services \nfrom the limitations applicable to certain deferred compensation plans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   volunteer firefighters legislation\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto exclude Length of Service Award Programs [LOSAP's] for volunteers \nperforming firefighting or prevention services, emergency medical \nservices, or ambulance services from section 457 of the \n\n[[Page S 13474]]\nInternal Revenue Code. In addition, the legislation would exempt \nLOSAP's from FICA and Medicare taxation. This corrective legislation \nwould support the vital role that volunteer firefighters and rescue \npersonnel play in small towns and rural areas across America.\n  I am very proud to say that I am a volunteer firefighter, and have \nbeen for about 30 years. And I was never more proud than to witness the \nefforts of the 1,500 or so volunteers who vigorously fought the recent \nfire we had on Long Island. There are approximately 150,000 volunteer \nfirefighters in about 37 States who receive nominal awards, averaging \n$250 per year, under LOSAP's from their governmental or tax-exempt fire \ndistricts. Volunteers earn awards under a LOSAP, on the basis of years \nof service, while performing volunteer services. However, not until \nafter retiring from volunteer service are volunteers actually disbursed \ncash from the LOSAP's. There are similar award programs for volunteers \nperforming other emergency medical services, such as rescue personnel \nand ambulance drivers.\n  These nonqualified plans are covered under Internal Revenue Code \nsection 457. Participants in these plans normally report for tax \npurposes any compensation deferred and any income attributable to the \namounts when it is actually received, similar to qualified pension \nplans. Under section 457, one requirement to delay taxation is to limit \nsuch deferred amounts to a percentage of compensation paid. Generally, \nmost volunteer firefighters and rescue personnel receive no regular \npay, or only nominal amounts to cover expenses. Section 457 is in the \ncode to prevent governmental and tax-exempt entities from setting aside \nexcessive amounts of tax-deferred income for highly compensated \nemployees, while at the same time being able to avoid the \nnondiscrimination rules that are applicable to qualified plans. \nVolunteers are far from being highly compensated, so the legislation \ndoes not undermine this policy.\n  However, applying the current limitations, on the amounts set aside \nas LOSAP's for retirement, may result in a tax liability for volunteers \nwith zero or minimal pay at the time the amounts vest with the \nvolunteer. This could result even though it may be years before the \nvolunteer will actually receive any funds.\n  This proposal would provide that the LOSAP's are excluded from the \nprovisions of section 457. The result would be deferral of taxation \nuntil the LOSAP awards are paid. It would also exempt the amounts \nawarded under LOSAP's from FICA and Medicare payroll taxes. The latter \nprovision is similar to other payroll tax exclusions permitted in the \ntax law, such as exempting Peace Corps allowances paid to volunteers, \nas well as other plans established by the Government for deferral of \ncompensation.\n  Mr. President, the proposal would foster volunteerism in the United \nStates. This is especially important because in many parts of the \ncountry it is not economically or geographically feasible to provide \nfire protection and emergency medical services through paid career \npersonnel.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this sensible legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1232\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to assure equitable coverage and treatment of \nemergency services under health plans; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n          THE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ACT OF 1995\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the \nAccess to Emergency Medical Services Act of 1995. This bill prohibits \nhealth plans from denying coverage and payment for emergency room \nvisits.\n  Currently, payment for emergency room services may be denied because \na patient does not have pre-authorization for treatment; the diagnosis \nafter reaching the emergency room determined the condition was not an \nemergency; or the health plan may not have a contract with the hospital \nrendering the emergency service. Denial of payment places a significant \nburden on the patient, who now has higher health care costs and is more \ncautious about seeking medical treatment. This is a significant health \nrisk. A patient thinks twice about going to an emergency room and \nreceiving emergency medical treatment for conditions that really pose a \nserious health problem.\n  Federal law requires physicians and hospitals to render emergency \nservices immediately for an injury or sudden illness. The law also \nrequires that emergency services not be delayed until the health \ninsurance status of a patient has been determined. However, too often \npatients are not receiving treatment until their health plan has given \nauthorization for services. This bill would prohibit health plans from \ndenying coverage and payment for services because of a lack of \nauthorization from the health plan. The bill also requires health plans \nto pay emergency physicians and hospital emergency departments for \nemergency services rendered in compliance with Federal law.\n  Most importantly, the Access to Emergency Medical Services Act \nprovides a uniform definition of emergency. This definition would base \npayment upon a patient's symptoms and not upon the doctor's diagnosis. \nTherefore, health plans could not deny coverage and payment for medical \nservices after a diagnosis is given. The State of Maryland has \nestablished a uniform definition of emergency, as have Virginia and \nArkansas. The Maryland law giving a uniform definition of emergency was \nenacted in 1993. Since the enactment of the bill, complaints to the \nMaryland Insurance Administration have decreased by 90 percent. In \n\n[[Page S 13475]]\naddition, patients are able to have urgent symptoms treated in the \nemergency rooms without any problems regarding pre-authorization from \nthe health plan. There has not been a denial of coverage or payment for \nservices even if the final diagnosis is different from the symptoms.\n  The Maryland law has proven to be cost-effective to patients and to \nthe health plans. Providing a uniform definition of emergency allows \npersons to be treated for their symptoms even if the final diagnosis \ndetermines the medical problem causing the symptoms was not an \nemergency. This policy is able to prevent much more serious health \nproblems. By not denying coverage and prohibiting persons from \nreceiving treatment in the emergency department, more serious illnesses \nare prevented or detected sooner. This will allow for medical treatment \nfor existing conditions that prevent the onset of a life threatening \nillness for which a person may have to be hospitalized. Let me give an \nexample. A person has chest pains but believes he is having a heart \nattack. The emergency room diagnosis determines that the person is not \nhaving a heart attack. However, if the person had not received \ntreatment for the chest pains, he could have later had a heart attack \nrequiring hospital admission. The cost for treatment in the emergency \ndepartment is less than if the person had to be admitted to the \nhospital for any length of time. The Access to Emergency Medical \nServices Act of 1995 saves money for patients and for health plans.\n  Health plans that deny emergency care coverage are taking a deadly \ntoll on American families. We, as lawmakers, have an obligation to \nprotect our constituents and end this very real problem. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Access to Emergency Medical Service Act of \n1995.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I firmly support the continuation \nof a strong, independent U.S. Information Agency. The USIA serves a \nvital purpose in telling America's story to the rest of the world. It \nserves the critical function of advancing public diplomacy, \nbroadcasting through its radios and Worldnet, enabling educational and \ncultural exchange programs, distributing information, and promoting a \nsense of shared cultural values. These programs not only serve our \nnational security interests. They also provide direct economic benefits \nand foster a climate where American businesses can develop overseas \nmarkets, producing jobs, and providing wages for American workers.\n  We must remember the important distinctions between the official type \nof diplomacy conducted by our State Department and what is known as \npublic diplomacy. The State Department conducts a quiet, often secret, \ndialog between countries with an emphasis placed on accommodation, \nnegotiation, and compromise. These are all important, since they \nnurture relationships between countries to achieve broader goals. \nPublic diplomacy such as that conducted by USIA seeks to foster direct \neconomic relationships, engages in democratic institution-building, and \nencourages mutual understanding and a shared sense of values.\n  A classic illustration of the parallel nature of the two types of \ndiplomacy occurred during the period when martial law was declared in \nPoland. At a time when private organizations, including the AFL-CIO, \nwere engaged in a massive effort to assist the Polish trade union \nSolidarnosc, the Reagan administration was taking steps to ease \neconomic sanctions that had been imposed on the Jaruzelski government. \nBecause of the arms-length distance between the government and the \nprivate sector, both could pursue their goals. This was true also in \nRussia, South Africa, the Philippines, and Chile. If this bill passes \nwithout the Lieberman amendment, such distance will disappear, and this \ntype of dual diplomacy will prove impossible. If USIA is folded into \nthe State Department, its public diplomacy functions will be severely \ndiminished, particularly in areas where democracy needs them the most \nin order to survive.\n  Another major reason for my support of a continued independent USIA \nstems from its programs of exchanges for emerging foreign and American \npolitical leaders. Over the years, these programs have brought young \nlocal and Federal officials to America for a first-hand look at our \nGovernment and how it works. More than 30 current heads of state had \ntheir first exposure to the people and institutions of the United \nStates through the USIA Exchange Program. Hundreds of cabinet \nministers, mayors, governors, and Members of Parliament around the \nworld formed their first opinions of America by coming here and meeting \npeople where they work and live.\n  Hundreds of other leading political figures both here and abroad have \ngained valuable international experience through USIA's support for \nprograms like that of the American Council of Young Political Leaders. \nTwenty-five Members of Congress and countless State and local officials \naround the Nation are alumni of these programs. All will testify to the \npositive impact of these programs.\n  The USIA's rule of law program is an example of its efforts in \nassisting developing democracies worldwide. This particular program has \nbeen actively engaged in the area of judicial reform in Romania, \nperhaps once the most oppressive of the former Communist regimes. \nThrough the posting of American judges at the Ministry of Justice for \nlong-term projects, programs to strengthen the Magistrates' Training \nInstitute, and ongoing support for the newly founded Magistrates' \nTraining Association, USIA has established itself as a leader in \nassisting Romania in its attempts to establish an independent \njudiciary. American judges and academics have traveled to Romania under \nthe auspices of USIA's Fulbright Program and have been posted to law \nschools throughout the country to teach and develop curricula and to \nwork with the judiciary on numerous issues of importance. Romanian \njudges have also visited the United States under the Agency's \nInternational Visitor Program for 30-day observation and consultation \ntrips to witness first hand the American judiciary and to gather \ninformation to assist in their judicial reform efforts.\n\n[[Page S 13478]]\n\n  The USIA also supports such projects as the American People \nAmbassador Program, a program of people to people international. This \nprogram arranges face-to-face professional, scientific, technical, and \ncommunity exchanges between Americans and their counterparts around the \nworld. Each one explores a different topic, but all share the personal \nexchange of information, ideas, goals, and experiences with leading \npublic and provide sector citizens of foreign countries.\n  One such program in my State is the torch of Birmingham Award \nProgram, which seeks to honor Russian companies and those in the Newly \nIndependent States who are succeeding despite difficult economic \nconditions. In September, over 400 Russian business and government \nleaders will be coming to Birmingham to participate in this event. They \nwill represent every imaginable segment of the Russian economy, and \nwill network with leading Alabama business, political, and community \nleaders. The USIA and its resources are essential to organizations like \nthe American People Ambassador Program which operate exchanges around \nthe world.\n  All of us are keenly aware of the budgetary constraints we face. But \nwe must not be short sighted by eliminating investments in our Nation's \nfuture and security. Who can say whether or not educational and \ncultural exchange programs will be maintained if they are placed in a \ndepartment with a significantly different mission, set of priorities, \nand official purpose?\n  The world remains just as dangerous as it has ever been. new threats \nhave replaced some of those which ended with the cold war. But they are \njust as real and threatening to international peace and stability. The \nworld looks to us for leadership--leadership with a strong voice. I \napplaud Senator Lieberman's efforts to ensure that America continues to \nhave that strong voice through an independent USIA, and look forward to \nworking with him on this issue when the State Department \nreauthorization bill is again brought before the Senate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13477-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  THE INCREASING AND IMPORTANT ROLE OF PRIVATE TRAINING FACILITIES IN \n                          WORK FORCE TRAINING\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues an industry that is growing almost unnoticed in this \ncountry, an industry that demonstrates the ability of the private \nsector to meet the challenges posed by our expanding and \ntechnologically advanced economy. I am speaking of the hundreds of \nprivate professional firms across the Nation that provide job training \nto American workers. Since the early 1980's, a new breed of high-\nquality private sector training providers have proliferated in response \nto the need of business and industry for highly skilled workers. This \nis especially true of providers who train people who train people in \nthe information-technology sector of the American economy.\n  Each year, American employers wisely spend billions of dollars to \ntrain and educate their employees. This training enhances the skills of \nthose workers and often enables them to assume new, more challenging \npositions. The training market in information technology alone--which \nis one of the fastest growing and most promising sectors of our \neconomy--totaled $2 billion in 1994, and almost all of this need was \nmet with private sector resources. Private professional firms have \ndeveloped extensive programs and nationwide networks to serve the huge \nand growing needs of large and small businesses in this field. Many of \nthese firms, although often small enterprises, work in partnerships \nwith large employers who demand that they provide only the highest \nquality training and who require that they teach skills that conform to \nindustry-based benchmarks and standards.\n  Today, training providers, which include both public education \ninstitutions and private training companies, are using skill standards \nas benchmarks to develop their courses and to prepare professional \nworkers for exams that will certify them as qualified to perform \ncertain high-skill jobs. Skill standards in this context are not rigid \ndefinitions of ``jobs,'' but rather a large comprehensive set of well \narticulated, competency-based skill statements that are industry driven \nand nationally recognized. By reflecting the true and detailed needs of \nthe workplace, and by being used in the hiring, promotion, and training \nof the work force, these become de facto standards at the national \nlevel, and they transcend national borders as do businesses in today's \nglobal economy. In short, private sector training providers in the \ninformation-technology field reflect developments in the marketplace \nand prepare individuals to handle the jobs of the future.\n  According to Training magazine, U.S. organizations with 100 employees \nor more spent $48 billion on training in 1993, and it is likely that \nthe total increased in 1994 and will again in 1995. Employers are \nrecognizing the need to train the individuals they hire in order to \nkeep pace with rapidly evolving technology and to remain competitive in \nthe global economy. Nowhere is training more important than in the \ninformation-technology industries, where technological innovations and \nproduct upgrades that require new or enhanced skills are coming to \nmarket everyday.\n  Within the information-technology industry it is clear that private \nsector training providers are one of the main resources to turn to for \ntraining. for example, most of the large American software companies \nuse what is known as a leveraged training mode, wherein independent \ntraining providers develop courses that teach individuals how to \noperate the application or\n systems of a given software company. In turn, the software company \nwill denote the training provider as one that is authorized to award \ncertification in the operation or maintenance of that company's \nproducts. This is just one of many examples of how corporations and \nsmaller businesses are using the resources of private training \nproviders.\n\n  Whether individuals are updating their skills to improve performance \non the job or are unemployed and seeking new skills, by completing \ntraining and receiving an industry recognized credential they are \nimproving their own career prospects as well as keeping the American \nwork force competitive.\n  These training centers must meet the demands of industry and of the \nmarket that will eventually employ their students; therefore they must \nprovide only the highest quality training. And while the information-\ntechnology market demands quality, it also demands more and more \nqualified individuals each year. For example, the software and \ncomputing industry grew at an annual rate of over 28 percent between \n1980 and 1992, while the GDP for that time averaged 2.4-percent growth. \nNot only is the number of jobs in this field increasing, but those jobs \npay wages that are significantly higher than wages in many other \nindustries. In addition, given that the information-technology \ncompanies have no geographic-specific resource requirements, they \ncontribute to the economy of virtually every State in the country.\n  Mr. President, it is quite apparent that the individuals with high-\ntechnology skills are in great demand throughout the Nation, and it is \napparent that the demand will only increase. Private training providers \nhave been rising to this challenge, and they have done so with \nentrepreneurial vigor and a commitment to quality. As the number of \npeople in need of training increases, and as the number of people that \norganizations intend to train outstrips their capability to train them \nin house, private sector providers of training services will become an \never more important part of the American economy.\n  It has been my pleasure today to recognize and share with my \ncolleagues the merits of this growing American industry.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13478-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13478-S13479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      UNLV'S WOMEN'S SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of the women's softball team at the University of Nevada-\nLas Vegas. This outstanding group of women and their coaching staff \nhave set a standard of excellence in 1995 which is worthy of merit.\n  The team results for the 1995 season are the best in the history of \nthe university. UNLV softball finished their season ranked fourth in \nthe Nation by both a USA Today poll and the NCAA. \n\n[[Page S 13479]]\nThis is the second straight year that the Rebels have finished in the \ntop five. They were the champions of various regional conferences and \ntournaments as well.\n  Individual players also received special awards for their \nperformances on the field. Five of the women were voted All-Americans, \nand others were selected for special recognition teams. Individual \nplayers were recognized by the Big West Conference for their athletic \ntalent in their respective positions.\n  Off the field, the players also achieved academically; six of the \nwomen were named Scholar-Athletes by UNLV, and four were given the same \nhonor by the Big West Conference. The women's softball coach, Shan \nMcDonald, was selected Big West Conference Coach of the Year; she is \nassisted by Carol Spanks and Jenny Conden.\n  The team will be honored at a tea hosted by UNLV President Carol \nHarter on Sunday, September 17 at 2 p.m. in the Tam Alumni Center. I am \npleased to congratulate the women's softball team for their outstanding \naccomplishments in the 1995 season.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13478-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  PBS' ``THE AMERICAN PROMISE'' AND THE WOMEN SELF-EMPLOYMENT PROJECT\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I call on all my colleagues \nto congratulate the producers of the new PBS documentary, ``The \nAmerican Promise.''\n  ``The American Promise'' chronicles the fact that grassroots \ndemocracy is still alive and well in this country.\n  I am particularly pleased that the producers have chosen to highlight \nthe Chicago Women Self-Employment Project [WSEP] which acts as a \nlending circle for microenterprises. This highly successful program \nhelps women through rotating access to capital.\n  Specifically designed to provide access to capital for low and \nmoderate income women in America's cities, WSEP has helped thousands. \nIn addition to its revolving loan fund, responsible for short-term \nloans of $100 to $25,000, WSEP provides entrepreneurial training and \ntechnical assistance. The training has proven indispensable as many \nparticipants come to WSEP with little or no formal business background.\n  WSEP participates as an intermediary in the Small Business \nAdministration's [SBA] Microloan Program. By doing so, it receives loan \nfunds to be re-lent to micro-businesses. In addition, it receives SBA \ngrants to provide technical assistance to its borrowers.\n  The results have been impressive. WSEP has helped start over 500 \nbusinesses. Of these, over 85 percent are still operating. Time and \ntime again WSEP has proven that access to capital and access to \ntraining is a formula for success.\n  More important than the numbers, however, is the impact WSEP has had \non women's lives. In one case, a woman who used to live on oatmeal and \nbarter for her rent now designs and sells upscale jewelry in Chicago, \nNew York and St. Louis.\n  Everyday WSEP makes a difference in the lives of its participants. \nBut that's only part of the story. Because WSEP stimulates private \ninvestment in America's cities, local economies benefit. As program \nparticipants succeed, they give back to the program, and back to the \ncommunity. Often, this comes in the form of new jobs. As many as 20 \npercent of WSEP businesses report hiring additional paid employees. \nThis, at a time when some urban neighborhoods have less than 1 percent \nprivate sector employment.\n  The United States Senate is currently poised to make widespread \nchanges in our welfare system. As we examine reform and what does and \ndoes not work, I think we could all benefit by studying the WSEP \nexample. It is a program that gets results. The project has been so \nsuccessful, I invited organizers to serve on my welfare reform advisory \npanel and authored an amendment which made permanent the Job \nOpportunities for Low Income individuals [JOLI] program. JOLI helps \ncreate job opportunities for welfare recipients and low income \nindividuals by giving federal grants to private non-profit corporations \nto make investments in local business enterprises that will result in \nthe creation of new jobs. SEP is positive proof that JOLI works.\n  The Women Self-Employment Project's approach is distinctly grassroots \nsuccess story. There is an old saying, give a man a fish, and he can \neat for a day, teach a man to fish and he can eat for a lifetime. WSEP \nprovides the fishing pole and the training. It makes success and self \nsufficiency possible.\n  The American Promise reminds us that positive efforts are not only \npossible, but successful. In so doing, it provides a beacon of hope for \nus all.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/12/senate-section/article/S13479-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         APPOINTMENT OF VARIOUS CHAIRMEN FOR THE 104TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.
