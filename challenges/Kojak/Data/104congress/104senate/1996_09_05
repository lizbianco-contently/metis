Forgive our pride \nthat takes the place of praise in our hearts. So often, we want to be \nadequate in our own strength, to be loved by You because of our self-\ngenerated goodness and to be admired by people because of our superior \nperformance. Pride pollutes everything; it stunts our spiritual growth, \ncreates tension in our relationships, and makes us people difficult for \nYou to bless. Most of all, our pride separates us from You, Dear \nFather. Life becomes bland, truth becomes relative, and values become \nvitiated. We lose that inner confidence of convictions rooted in the \nBible and Your revealed truth. Now in this quiet moment, we praise You \nthat You break the bubble of the illusion that with our own cleverness \nand cunning we can solve life's problems. You give us back our sense of \nhumor so that we can laugh at ourselves for thinking that we can make \nit on our own. We humble ourselves before You and ask to be filled with \nYour Spirit. Now, with our minds and hearts firmly planted on the Rock \nof Ages, we greet the ambiguities of this day with the absolutes of \nYour truth and guidance. In the name of our Savior and Lord. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9869-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

For the information of all Senators, this morning the \nSenate will begin 30 minutes of debate on two of the appropriations \nconference reports. At approximately 10 a.m., following the debate, the \nSenate will proceed to two consecutive rollcall votes, the first vote \nbeing on the adoption of the military construction appropriations \nconference report, to be followed by a vote on the D.C. appropriations \nconference report. After those votes, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill.\n  Last night, we were able to reach an agreement on a limitation of \namendments to that legislation, and I hope that any Senator with an \namendment on the list will offer the amendment early today so that we \ncan complete action on this very important appropriations bill. \nRollcall votes should be expected throughout the day and into the \nevening, if necessary.\n  I do point out that there were 38 amendments on the list that was \nworked out last night. I presume a number of them are place holders or \nwould be offered depending on whether other amendments are offered. I \nhope we will not go through that exercise too long today and we can get \non with the very serious amendments and vote on them so that we can \nmove on to other appropriations bills.\n  I want to emphasize beginning today that I want to work in good faith \nwith the Democratic leadership and with all of our colleagues to \ncomplete this appropriations bill and the remaining four. But in order \nto do that, it is going to take real cooperation. We have a limited \nnumber of days, and already I am getting the sneaking suspicion that \nthere is a slow rolling process already being planned by the delay, by \nthe lack of real progress yesterday, by the number of amendments. And \nif that is going to be the way things are handled, it is going to leave \nme with no option other than to take serious actions, including forcing \nvotes, which can be done, night sessions, even having to go into the \nweekend, or pulling down important bills.\n  Veterans and Housing and Urban Development, I do not think my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle want to be held responsible \nfor blocking or delaying unnecessarily consideration of a bill that \nfunds the veterans programs and the HUD programs. So let us start off \non a positive note. I think we struggled through that a little bit \nyesterday, but we are working together at this point.\n  We are going to continue to work to see if we can get an agreement on \nan Iraq resolution. There is a meeting at 10 o'clock on that. I hope we \ncan go forward in a positive way and get our work done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9869-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

There shall now be 20 minutes of debate on the \nconference report equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair very much. We have been \nworking very closely with my ranking member, Senator Reid, from Nevada. \nHe has one little duty to perform before he comes to the floor. I would \nhate to start without him here because we have worked so closely on \nthis piece of legislation.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum until he arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nconference report on the military construction appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1997.\n\n  Mr. President, the conference report is within the revised 602(b) \nbudget allocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  The conference agreement is $850 million over the President's budget \nrequest. This amount is the same as what will be authorized in the \narmed services conference report. This conference agreement is $1.2 \nbillion under the amounts approved by the conferees last year.\n  Mr. President, I believe the military construction budget is not \nbeing adequately funded. We have never recovered from the reductions \nthat were made in anticipation of the base realignments and closures.\n  I want to give the Pentagon fair warning. During this period of troop \nreductions and base closures throughout the United States and the \nworld, we should have been dramatically modernizing our defense \ninfrastructure.\n  It is no longer business as usual. We must address these mounting \ndeficiencies.\n  I would like to mention briefly some provisions in this conference \nagreement. First, the conferees approved $2.5 billion for \nimplementation of the base realignment and closure decisions. This \namount includes $1.2 billion for the 1995 round. There is also $776 \nmillion for environmental cleanup of these facilities. We have now \nfunded the majority of BRAC requirements. Now we must make sure these \nfunds are being correctly spent.\n  Mr. President, $4 billion of this appropriation is for housing the \nfamilies of our military. This is 41 percent of our appropriation. I am \nhappy to say this percentage is growing. It was 38 percent last year. \nWe must address the quality of life issues we have ignored for so long.\n  Also, we have created a new initiative which will start to relieve \nsome of the burden of providing adequate housing for our single \nsoldiers. It is like Secretary Perry's efforts for family housing.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement provides an additional $185 \nmillion for the National Guard. This includes additional funding for \nplanning and design. The Army National Guard especially needs this \nfunding to properly execute their construction program.\n  I am confident that the President will not veto this bill. This bill \nincludes funding for Incirlik, Turkey, where our Air Force has been \nflying the mission over the northern part of Iraq. Also, there is \nfunding for Aviano, Italy, where our Air Force and Marines fly missions \nover Bosnia. We must all support our troops at this critical time.\n  There is one issue my colleagues should be aware of. We have tied \nfunding for the Army programs overseas to the Army National Guard. For \nyears we have directed the Army to start supporting the Reserve \ncomponents. Each year they have chosen to ignore the direction of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, the appropriations conferees took a strong course of \naction on this issue. This year we have language which directs the Army \nto program $75 million for the Army National Guard. Officers within the \nArmy have suggested that it is only report language. They do not think \nthey need to follow our direction unless it is in bill language. What \nthey do not understand is that this body supports the citizen soldier. \nWe know that we will call on them if we ever have to face another major \nconflict. The Army has not figured this out. I want to put them on \nrecord. The Army is going to have a difficult time, until they start \nsupporting the Guard.\n  On a brighter note, we have included a sense of Congress which calls \nfor the Secretary of the Army to name a new administrative facility, at \nRedstone Arsenal, AL, the Howell Heflin Complex. This is a small \ntribute to one of the great Senators of our time. I wish my friend well \nand hope he enjoys his coming years.\n  Mr. President, this is good bill. It is a bill that meets the demands \nof our national security interests. I urge the Senate to approve the \nconference action on this issue.\n  I now yield the floor and ask for the comments of the ranking member \nof this committee who has just been a joy to work with. We have worked \non this a long time and, being very comfortable with the bill, I think \nit warrants passage. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to work closely with \nthe distinguished chairman on this measure. We have had an open, \nbipartisan approach to the problems of family housing, Reserve and \nGuard forces, and the other matters in the bill. We have not had any \nsignificant disagreements. I believe that this is a good product, and I \nhope that the Senate will support it overwhelmingly. I thank at this \ntime the majority staff director, Jim Morhard and his assistant Warren \nJohnson, for their work and cooperation with my staff, Dick D'Amato a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee assigned to me to work on this \nand other appropriations matters. B.G. Wright also of the \nAppropriations Committee, also has made a significant contribution. I \npublicly commend Peter Arapis and Jerry Reed of my personal staff who \nhave dedicated many hours to the completion of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Burns from Montana, \nin presenting this conference report on military construction for \nfiscal year 1997 before the Senate. Mr. President, I fully support the \nrecommendations in this bill. I compliment the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for \nhis excellent work and that of his staff.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee and I have again this year, enjoyed \nan open and productive working relationship in bringing the \nrecommendations in this bill to the Senate.\n  This bill, reported here today is $1.195 billion lower than last \nyear's appropriated amount, and is also $50 million lower than the \nconstruction bill proposed by the House of Representatives.\n  Again this year, our bill strives to improve the quality of life for \nthe Nation's military service members. This military construction bill \nemphasizes housing initiatives, both for families and improved housing \nfor single service members. It provides $4.1 billion for the \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of family housing, and to the \nHomeowner's Assistance Program.\n  I would like to be able to say that spending this $4.1 billion takes \ncare of all the housing needs of our military, but it does not come \nclose. We are going to have to continue working on that.\n  I add, Mr. President, in time of crisis, we rely heavily on the Guard \nand Reserve. During the gulf war crisis, we called upon the Guard and \nReserve to bear more than their share of the burden, especially based \non how we have funded them in the past. This year's administration \nrequest included no, I repeat, no major construction projects for the \nArmy National Guard. This practice is completely unacceptable. \nAdministration requests including no major construction projects for \nthe Army Guard mandates that we seriously review any Member request for\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\nits worthiness, and there are many worthy and badly needed projects, \nwithout which, our Reserve Forces could not continue to function. It \nsimply would be unfair to not give them some consideration simply \nbecause they have been ignored by the Pentagon.\n  The committee continues to support the NATO Security Investment \nProgram, however it is concerned that member nations are not properly \nhelping to defray construction program costs. The committee therefore \nurges the Secretary to seek increased contributions from our allies. A \nrequirement for preposition exists in Southwest Asia, however, we have \nno treaty relationships with our allies there. Although we should \nproceed with such projects, we should secure long-term bilateral \nagreements and assume full cost-sharing arrangements prior to the \ninitiation of any construction projects in the region.\n  The subcommittee has added certain needy projects to the \nadministrations request: $850 million was added to the budget that \nwould include $220 million for Guard and Reserve projects, and over \n$258 million in badly needed family housing.\n  I commend the chairman for taking the many requests from Senators to \ninclude projects in this bill. This is necessitated, annually, in large \npart, because the Department of Defense has again, as it has in the \npast, refused to adequately fund the construction projects for the \nNational Guard, requiring the subcommittee to review many worthy \nprojects suggested by Senators and the National Guard and to come up \nwith a fair and equitable solution to the problem.\n  To have people come and say, and there are only just a few, come and \nsay, ``The Pentagon did not request it, how possibly could we be \nseeking money here?'' We are doing it because it is the right thing to \ndo, the only thing to do, and Senator Burns and I greatly appreciate \nthe support the subcommittee has received in our support for the Guard \nand Reserve.\n  The administration requested only $7 million for Army National Guard \nconstruction, compared to $137 million appropriated in fiscal year \n1996, and that amount was well below the previous year's $188 million \nappropriation. This is a 95-percent reduction in only 1 year. This type \nof request is incomprehensible and irresponsible. To help try to \nbalance the scale, the subcommittee used strict criteria to evaluate \nmany worthy projects suggested by Members, and a strong effort was made \nto take all Members' interest into consideration. We could not fulfill \nall the requests, but we did our best.\n  While no Senator that I am aware of has been fully satisfied, I think \nthe result is as fair and equitable as possible, given the significant \nbudget constraints that we are working under.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee \nfor his fine work on this legislation. I again ask the Senate to \noverwhelmingly support this legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The pending military construction conference agreement \nprovides $9.982 billion in new budget authority and $3.140 in new \noutlays for military construction and family housing programs for the \nDepartment of Defense for fiscal year 1997.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the outlays for the 1997 program total \n$10.375 billion.\n  This legislation provides for construction by the Department of \nDefense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it \nprovides for family housing for the Active Forces of each of the U.S. \nmilitary services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and \nquality of life programs for our service men and women.\n  The conference report falls within the revised section 602(b) \nallocation for the Military Construction Subcommittee. I commend the \ndistinguished subcommittee chairman, the Senator from Montana, for \nbringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's revised \nallocation.\n  The bill provides important increases over the President's request \nfor 1997, and I urge the adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nrelationship of the conference report to the subcommittee's section \n602(b) allocation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  MILITARY CONSTRUCTION SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT \n                 [Fiscal year 1997, Dollars in millions]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Budget              \n                    Category                       authority    Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed..................................  ..........       7,204\n    H.R. 3517, conference report................       9,982       3,140\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.....................  ..........  ..........\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Adjusted bill total.......................       9,982      10,344\n                                                 =======================\nSenate subcommittee 602(b) allocation: Defense                          \n discretionary..................................       9,983      10,375\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n subcommittee 602(b) allocation: Defense                                \n discretionary..................................          -1         -31\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I wanted to take just a few moments to \ncommend Senators Conrad Burns and Harry Reid, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Military Construction Subcommittee. The conference report \nfor the fiscal year 1997 Military Construction Appropriations Act that \nhas been put before the Senate is an excellent product. It protects the \ninterests of the Senate, and more importantly, it addresses the needs \nof our men and women in uniform.\n  This conference agreement represents a compromise between the House \nand the Senate, and I am aware that many items of interest to Members \nof both the House and the Senate had to be scaled back or deferred. \nNonetheless, I am convinced that Chairman Burns and Senator Reid \nbrokered a good deal for the Senate.\n  I understand that there are several projects which were supported by \nthe Senate in both the appropriations and authorization processes that \nare funded in this conference agreement, but for which no funds are \nspecifically authorized in the conference report filed by the Armed \nServices Committee. I am hopeful that legislation will be enacted by \nthe end of this session which will clarify the position of the Congress \nthat these programs should be considered authorized and I will work to \nthat end.\n  Once again, I wanted to thank Senators Burns and Reid for their \nleadership on this matter and I urge all my colleagues to support this \nconference report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for several years now, I have tried to \nrestrain Congress' propensity to add hundreds of millions of dollars of \nunrequested, low-priority projects to the military construction \nbudgets. I have tried to amend the military construction bills when \nthey come before the Senate to strike these add-ons, but I have failed. \nI have tried to impose reasonable criteria for evaluating Members' \nrequests for add-ons, and although the Senate agreed to abide by these \ncriteria, there are still projects added that do not meet the criteria.\n  This year, Mr. President, is no different.\n  Since 1990, the Congress has added more than $6 billion to the \nmilitary construction accounts. That's almost $1 billion in pork-barrel \nspending every year. This bill increases the amount of waste by another \n$850 million. Where will we stop this endless pork-barrelling using \ntaxpayers dollars?\n  When the Senate passed the military construction bill for fiscal year \n1997, it contained $700 million in unrequested funding. The House added \n$900 million to the request for military construction, and I assumed \nthat a conference agreement would probably split the difference between \nthe bills. But I find, in reviewing this conference bill, that it \ncontains $850 million in unrequested funding. Apparently, in the \ninterest of protecting as many Senators' add-ons as possible, the \nSenate conferees decided to go more than halfway toward the House \nposition.\n  Mr. President, I am amazed to find that this bill even includes an \nadd-on for Arizona. But that add-on of $6.7 million is small potatoes \ncompared to the magnitude of the add-ons for some States.\n  There were 13 States that received more than $20 million in add-ons \nin this bill. Of those 13 States, 6 States received more than $30 \nmillion in add-ons, 3 received more than $40 million in add-ons. And \none State received a whopping $55 million in add-ons.\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take up the time of the Senate by \nlisting all the add-ons in this bill. The information is there in the \nconference report, for those who care to review it. I will only say \nthat I am shocked and saddened that, with the severe shortfalls in \nother high-priority military requirements, the Congress is wasting so \nmuch money on pork-barrel projects like these.\n  This is the same Congress that argued successfully for an $18 billion \nincrease in the defense budget over the past 2 years, principally \nbecause military modernization had been cut drastically by the Clinton \nadministration. That is why I am puzzled that we waste nearly $1 \nbillion of this year's $11 billion add-on for military construction \nprojects.\n\n  While the Defense authorization and appropriations bills this year \nprovide an additional $6 or $7 billion for procurement, this amount is \nonly about one-third of the $21 billion needed to meet General \nShalikashvili's target of $60 billion per year for procurement of \nmodern weapons systems. We still have a $14 or $15 billion shortfall in \nurgently needed modernization funding. Yet we are wasting $850 million \non unrequested, low-priority military construction projects. It just \ndoes not make sense to me.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned the criteria the Senate adopted 2 years \nago to evaluate Members' requests for military construction add-ons. I \nam somewhat gratified to learn that the close scrutiny focused on \nmilitary construction projects has succeeded in forcing at least some \ndegree of control on the process. The majority of the projects in this \nbill meet four of the five criteria established 2 years ago for Senate \nconsideration of unrequested military construction projects. The \nprojects are: mission essential; not inconsistent with BRAC; in the \nFYDP; and executable in fiscal year 1997.\n  But none of the projects meet the fifth criterion, which requires the \nadded funding to be offset by a reduction in some other Defense \naccount. And five of the projects in this bill, totalling $23.7 \nmillion, are not even authorized, although I suspect political pressure \nwill result in an authorization of each of them at some future time.\n  Mr. President, I know there are some very good aspects of this bill. \nIt does provide funding for high-priority quality of life projects, \nincluding child care centers and family housing projects. It includes a \nprovision which will give the Guard and Reserve components the \nopportunity to come to Congress with a long-term plan to meet their \nmilitary construction requirements. For these provisions, I applaud my \ncolleagues on the Military Construction Subcommittee.\n  But $850 million is a lot of taxpayer dollars to waste. How do we \nexplain to the American people why we need $11 billion more for Defense \nthis year, when we spend $850 million for projects that do little or \nnothing to contribute to our Nation's security?\n  I know this bill cannot now be amended, and my words will have little \neffect on the final vote on this bill. But I cannot stand aside and \nallow a bill laden with $850 million in pork-barrel spending to pass \nthe Senate without objection. I will vote against this bill, and I will \nurge the President to veto this measure when it comes to his desk.

Mr. President, I will vote today in opposition to the \nmilitary construction appropriations conference report. The conference \nreport adds $850 million to the President's budget request. Like its \nauthorization counterpart, virtually all of the projects added to the \nbudget request are the result of requests made by Members of the House \nand Senate.\n  I am gratified that some discipline has been adopted in this annual \nprocess in that added projects now meet what I consider to be minimal \nrequirements like meeting a national security requirement and being in \nthe Pentagon's 5-year plan. Nevertheless, I cannot support a process \nthat results in hundreds of millions of dollars being added to the \nmilitary construction budget based merely on Members requesting funding \nfor those projects.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as cochairman for the National Guard Caucus \nI rise to comment on the process of funding our Nation's military \nconstruction needs.\n  The Senate, in the past years, has voted to appropriate necessary \nmilitary construction funds to offset the neglect of administrations in \norder to make sure that the defense infrastructure would be adequately \nfunded.\n  The Senate this year was again forced by the Clinton administration \nto make sure that the defense infrastructure would be adequately \nfunded.\n  Active Force infrastructure has traditionally been adequately funded \nwith the Guard Forces traditionally underfunded. Why has it been this \nway, many have asked, and the answer which is whispered through the \nHalls of this building is that the Congressmen and Senators will take \ncare of it, and we have and we do and we will because we care about the \nwelfare and readiness of the National Guard and Air National Guard even \nif some administration officials do not.\n  The administration this year funded the Army Guard to the tune of $7 \nmillion, $7 million for the entire Army Guard infrastructure for all 50 \nStates and Puerto Rico; $7 million.\n  For the entire Army Guard Force. If the Senators here respect our \ncitizen soldiers, then they must rectify this shoddy treatment of those \nwho protect us. My colleagues on the committee have done just that and \nthey have done it with strict adherence to a rigorous set of standards \nfor these necessary quality of life and readiness projects.\n  The committee considered each of the programs added to this year's \nmilitary construction bill for its executability in fiscal year 1997, \nits being of the highest priority for the base commanders and National \nGuard tags, its inclusion in the FYDP, and its overall necessity to \nquality of life and readiness. Currently, this is the only venue we \nhave to maintain infrastructure readiness and essential and housing \nprojects which were designated as critical by each State's adjutant \ngeneral. I urge all Senators to support the men and women of the Guard \nand support the Guard's ability to carry out its missions.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 4 minutes, 15 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BURNS. Again, I thank my friend from Nevada for his support and \ncontribution to this subcommittee this year. We could not have put this \nbill together without him and his staff. He is backed by an able staff \nthat understands what is needed and how to get it done: Dick D'Amato, \nB.G. Wright, and Peter Arapis.\n  I also thank Jim Morhard on the committee staff, Julie Lapeyre in my \noffice, Warren Johnson, and Mazie Mattson.\n  Mr. President, I know of no other further debate on this conference \nreport. I think it is a fair and equitable conference agreement and I \nurge its approval by the Senate.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the conference report and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S9873]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I understand we have about 4 minutes left \non the debate on the MilCon appropriations conference report.

Under the previous report, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. \n3845, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3845) making appropriations for the government of the \n     District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole \n     or in part against revenues of said District for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes, \n     having met, after full and free conference, have agreed to \n     recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of August 1, 1996.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There shall now be 10 minutes for debate on \nthe conference report equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before this body \nthe conference report on the District of Columbia appropriations. \nNeedless to say, the city is having difficult times, and it is \nimportant that we expeditiously dispense with the conference report.\n  This report does not reflect my own views in each instance, nor the \nindividual views of the Senate conferees. It is the result of true \ncompromise with our colleagues in the House. The conference report \nprovides for Federal funding of slightly less than $719 million and \noverall spending of $5.1 billion within the District of Columbia.\n  I regret that, again, this year the conference report dictates to the \ncity how it will spend its own funds on controversial social issues. \nThe conference report continues current law on subjects of both \nabortion and the District's domestic partners legislation.\n  Unlike the Senate-passed appropriations bill, the conference report \nprovides that no funds, Federal or local, may be used to fund abortion \nexcept in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the mother would \nbe endangered. Likewise, no funds may be used to implement the domestic \npartners legislation adopted by the District 4 years ago.\n  I am pleased, however, that these were the only divisive issues in \nthe conference this year and that we are bringing the conference report \nbefore the Senate in early September rather than the following April, \nas last year.\n  The major budget differences between the House and Senate bills was \nthe inclusion in the House bill of a deficit cap of $40 million. Under \nthe consensus budget submitted to the Congress by the council, the \nfinancial authority and the Mayor, the deficit was projected to be some \n$99 million out of total spending of $5.108 billion in fiscal year \n1997.\n  The House bill permitted a deficit of only $40 million, leaving it to \nthe city to determine where the additional savings would be found. The \nconference report adopts a modification of the House proposal with a \ndeficit cap of $74 million for fiscal year 1997. This figure is roughly \nhalfway between the House and Senate versions and represents the \nsubstantial progress toward a balanced budget that was called for in \nlast year's legislation, establishing both the financial authority and \nthe District's current budget process.\n  While not explicitly addressed in this legislation, let me state my \nown view that the budget which will be developed for fiscal year 1998 \nshould also show substantial progress towards fiscal balance. While I \ncan only speak for myself, I believe the budget deficit for fiscal year \n1998 should be in the $30 million to $40 million range, not the over \n$90 million deficit projected in the current financial plan.\n  Let me briefly touch on two other issues. First, the conference \nreport largely adopts the city's consensus budget, and the architects \nof that budget--the council, the financial authority and the mayor--\nmust be commended for working together to draft it. That budget process \nwas sometimes bumpy, but no more so than our own.\n  Second, while we need to achieve a balance of this budget by fiscal \nyear 1999, that fiscal balance will be very tenuous until we provide \nthe District with help on issues outside the jurisdiction of the \nAppropriations Committee. My colleagues know that we cannot balance the \nFederal budget in the Appropriations Committee. That committee cannot \nbalance the District's budget for very long either.\n  Once we have worked with the city's elected officials and the \nfinancial authority to squeeze every last penny out of the budget, I \nbelieve we will be faced with problems in entitlements programs, such \nas Medicaid and pensions, that will require Federal assistance to \nsolve.\n\n  I thank my colleagues on the committee for their cooperation. Senator \nKohl, my ranking member, has been of great assistance, a great \ncooperator, as has Senator Campbell. I deeply appreciate the guidance \nand support from Senator Byrd and Chairman Hatfield. I am deeply sorry \nthat this marks the last appropriations bill I will manage during \nChairman Hatfield's tenure. I will miss his leadership. It has been \nextraordinary working with him, and he has been a comfort to me when I \nhave faced difficult issues.\n  Finally, I wish to recognize the excellent work of the staff of the \nsubcommittee: Terry Sauvain of the minority and Tim Leeth of the \nmajority. Had Tim delayed his departure to the control board a few \nweeks, he would have sat here and had all kinds of praise heaped upon \nhim for his almost two decades of service to Members of both sides of \nthe aisle. Instead, he will have to accept our thanks from afar.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, let me move on to the District of \nColumbia and its problems. The headlines have been speaking to us daily \nabout the difficulties. Before we recessed for August, we already \nrecognized that the city had water problems, and we appropriated in \nthis bill a million dollars to try to help solve that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I yield another 2 minutes to Senator \nJeffords.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my friend. Also, I would like to mention the \nproblems of the schools. We are well aware of them. The Senate tried to \naccommodate the problems with respect to the opening of schools, but we \nwere unable to do so by the close of this last session. We are working \nvery hard now, working with Senator Kohl and the House, to provide ways \nto fund the repairs to the schools without using Federal funds.\n  But I will also say, it is obvious we need to have the management of \nthe school system looked at and dealt with, as we have with the city \nitself. Second, we have to keep them separate from school reform, which \nis also essential and necessary. We have set up a process for doing \nthat. So I am hopeful by next year we will not have to stand here and \ndefend the serious problems that we have in the D.C. school system \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I request 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank you.\n\n[[Page S9874]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report for \nthe fiscal year 1997 District of Columbia appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, the conference report for the fiscal year 1997 \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill includes $718 million in \nFederal funds and $5.02 billion in District of Columbia funds. This \nfigure is $1 million more in Federal funds and $29 million less in \nDistrict of Columbia funds than in the original Senate version of this \nbill.\n  This conference report has my signature and my vote for final \npassage. The District's financial situation demands as much. But I do \nhave reservations: in particular, the inclusion of the Hose of \nRepresentatives' position on abortions and domestic partners. As you \nmay know the Senate version of the District of Columbia Appropriations \nbill, which passed unanimously, contained language allowing the city to \nuse non-Federal dollars to fund certain abortion services and domestic \npartner benefits. Use of Federal moneys to provide these services was \nprohibited, but the District could use its own money. For its part, the \nHouse of Representatives; version of the bill prohibited the use of all \nfunds, including District Funds, in support of these services.\n  We have been here before. This is not a new debate. In fact, the \nHouse position represents current law. But as a proponent of a woman's \nright to choose, I oppose that position both on substantive grounds and \nbecause it is too broad an incursion into home rule. On the issue of \ndomestic partners, again we should show some measure of restraint when \nit comes to an issue on which the local electorate--through its duly \nelected officials--has spoken.\n  Mr. President, I compliment the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nJeffords, and thank him for his hard work in representing the views of \nthe Senate in conference. The House conferees were tough, but fair, \nnegotiators. They, too, deserve thanks for their cooperation.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to adopt the conference report on behalf \nof all those who visit, live, and work in the Nation's Capital.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9873-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I advised our conference at our \npolicy luncheon on Wednesday that that would be my intent.\n  I just do not see how we can get our work done in the next 30 days if \nwe do not have any votes late on Wednesday night, if we do not have any \nvotes all day on Monday, if we do not have any votes on Tuesday \nmorning. I am perfectly willing to do most of this without votes, but I \nhave to do what is necessary to try to keep our attention and get \nfocused on the work and try to produce results. But this is a fair \nagreement, and I appreciate that. That is the way we need to continue \nto try to work. As the Democratic leader and I have talked, we will \njust take it one step at a time. This is one more positive step. As to \nwhat we have to do on Monday night, that will be determined by what \nhappens today, tonight, and in the morning. If we make progress, we \nhave good cooperation, it may be that we will not need recorded votes \non Monday night. But we will continue to work, and as soon as we make a \nfinal determination with regard to Monday night, we will notify all \nSenators so they can plan what time to come back in here. I have urged \nour colleagues to be back in here by sundown on Monday so that we can \nget work done. I hope that we will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest of the majority leader? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9874-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 2053\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report H.R. 3666.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3666) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     for sundry independent agencies, boards, commissions, \n     corporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 1997.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one final question in that I see the leader \nis still here. He has an amendment at the desk, and it is obviously one \nthat there is a great deal of interest in on all sides. I wonder if he \nis ready to lay down his amendment. If we could do that here in the \nnext few minutes and get a time agreement, that would help us get \nmoving on what obviously is an amendment with a lot of interest.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would not be able to lay it down until \n11 o'clock, but I think I could lay it down within the next 15 minutes. \nI have a couple of conflicts that I need to address, but I will be \nready to do that in the not too distant future.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that will be fine. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have amendments the managers can act on \nin the meantime, and we will be ready to go around 11 o'clock.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have made good progress on the bill so \nfar. As the majority and minority leader discussed, we do have one \nmajor amendment, the veterans health care amendment, the veterans \nentitlement amendment, to be proposed by the minority leader. We were \nhoping to get a time agreement on that.\n\n  As I look down the list, there are a number of amendments relevant to \nthe VA-HUD bill, and I ask Senators to come to the floor. Some of these \nI still hope can be worked out by agreement and taken without a vote. A \ncouple people on our side of the aisle have suggested that they want \nvotes but would be willing to take very short time agreements on them. \nFor the most part, we hope to be able to finish those.\n  There are quite a few amendments that are not relevant to the VA-HUD \nbill. I hope they can be held for bills which are related to the \nsubject matter. There are some on both sides. Nobody has a monopoly on \nthose. But if we are to continue the very important work of the many \nagencies that are included in this bill, we really do need to get this \nmeasure passed, sent to conference, worked out, and sent to the \nPresident. As I have stated on previous occasions, lifting the ceiling \non the Ginny Mae loans will permit the sale of mortgages from the \nVeterans' Administration and FHA which otherwise would come to a halt.\n  There is a matter, a very important matter, with continuing the \navailability of flood insurance that is dealt with in this measure. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides not to put in amendments which more \nappropriately belong on other measures or which are likely to lead to \nextensive discussions. We are open, ready for business, and we would \nlike to get this resolved in the daylight. It would be a real pleasure \nto pass one in the light of day, and if we work cooperatively, we have \na chance of doing that today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I share the goal of the Senator from Missouri to move \nin a well-paced way on this bill. I wonder, while we are waiting for \nthe Democratic leader to come to offer his veterans medical care \namendment, if we could have a quorum call and let us look at some of \nthe amendments that maybe we could zip trip through once there is \nconcurrence. Maybe while we are waiting for the Democratic leader to \ncome we could actually dispose of some of those amendments.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have three amendments, I think, that have \nbeen cleared on both sides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5187\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. BOND. First, I send an amendment on behalf of Senator Hollings to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II of the bill, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS.\n\n       Section 102(a)(6)(D) of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5302(a)(6)(D)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in clause (iv), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in clause (v), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new clause:\n       ``(vi) has entered into a local cooperation agreement with \n     a metropolitan city that received assistance under section \n     106 because of such classification, and has elected under \n     paragraph (4) to have its population included with the \n     population of the county for the purposes of qualifying as an \n     urban county, except that to qualify as an urban county under \n     this clause, the county must--\n       ``(I) have a combined population of not less than 210,000, \n     excluding any metropolitan city located in the county that is \n     not relinquishing its metropolitan city classification, \n     according to the 1990 decennial census of the Bureau of the \n     Census of the Department of Commerce;\n       ``(II) including any metropolitan cities located in the \n     county, have had a decrease in population of 10,061 from 1992 \n     to 1994, according to the estimates of the Bureau of the \n     Census of the Department of Commerce; and\n       ``(III) have had a Federal naval installation that was more \n     than 100 years old closed by action of the Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission appointed for 1993 under the Base \n     Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, directly resulting in a \n     loss of employment by more than 7,000 Federal Government \n     civilian employees and more than 15,000 active duty military \n     personnel, which naval installation was located within 1 mile \n     of an enterprise community designated by the Secretary \n     pursuant to section 1391 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986, which enterprise community has a population of not less \n     than 20,000, according to the 1990 decennial census of the \n     Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce.''.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which will \npermit Charleston County and the city of North Charleston, SC, to \nimprove coordination and to increase their capacity in building a more \nviable urban community. This legislation will assist both the city and \ncounty in providing affordable housing and suitable living environments \nand by expanding economic opportunities for a number of the county's \nlow- to moderate-income citizens. Charleston County contains two \nentitled cities: the city of Charleston and the city of North \nCharleston. With the population of these two cities excluded, the \ncounty has too small a population to qualify for a CDBG entitlement. \nTwo recent developments, the BRAC decision to close the Charleston \nNaval Base and Shipyard and the designation of an area adjacent to the \ncity of North Charleston as an enterprise community, have increased the \nneed for coordinated planning and development by the county and the \ncity of North Charleston. That Charleston County is not entitled and \nhas to compete with other communities in the State for CDBG funds has \nhindered the area's ability to do the meaningful long-range planning \nrequired to recover from base closure and to respond to the opportunity \nprovided by the enterprise community designation.\n  The city of North Charleston has entered into a cooperative agreement \nwith Charleston County to relinquish its entitlement to allow the \ncounty to qualify. This will not only enable the county to expand \ncapacity building in the two neighborhoods that were designated as \nenterprise communities, but will enhance the capacity of the entire \nregion to respond to the myriad problems and opportunities created by \nclosure of the Charleston Naval Base and Shipyard. This amendment is \nbudget neutral and breaks no new ground; it merely follows precedent \nset by numerous other communities across the nation that have found a \ncooperative, coordinated approach to community development eliminates \nduplication and directs more of their dollars to the intended \nbeneficiaries. I urge its acceptance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is a measure dealing with the \navailability of CDBG funding in the city of Charleston. It makes \nchanges in the boundaries of the city.\n  This has been cleared on both sides by the authorizing committee, and \nat a time when the city of Charleston once again is facing the \npotential disastrous impact of hurricanes, we think this is a very \nworthwhile change, and urge its adoption.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this side not only has no objection to \nthe amendment, we concur with it. It allows Charleston County and the \ncity of North Charleston, SC, to merge for purposes of CDBG \nconsideration. We think it will make the agency more effective and \nefficient. We support the Hollings amendment and really wish the people \nof Charleston Godspeed as they face Hurricane Fran.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5187) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5188\n\n  Mr. BOND. Next, on behalf of Senator Bennett, I send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Bennett, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5188.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 27, line 19, strike ``$969,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$969,464,442.\n       On page 29, line 5, strike the period, and insert a colon \n     and the following: ``Provided further, That of the total \n     amount provided under this head, the Secretary shall provide \n     $755,573 to the Utah Housing Finance Agency, in lieu of \n     amounts lost to such agency in bond refinancings during 1994, \n     for its use in accordance with the immediately preceding \n     proviso.''\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in the early 1980's, a period of \nextraordinarily high interest rates, it was necessary for Congress to \nappropriate additional money to HUD for its section 8 program for new \nprojects just then coming on line, to cover the high cost of financing. \nThe ``financing adjustment factor'' or its acronym ``FAF'' was an \nadditional amount of rent subsidy under the section 8 program that \nenabled thousands of privately owned apartments to be built and \noccupied by very low income families, elderly, and disabled persons.\n  Even with tax exempt bonds issued by State and local housing finance \nagencies [HFA's], interest rates were so high as to require the \nadditional FAF subsidy. In my State of Utah, the HFA issued bonds in \n1982 and 1983 to finance the FHA insured mortgage loans for 16 \nmultifamily projects assisted with project-based section 8 rent \nsubsidies and the extra FAF subsidy. It is clear that without FAF, the \nprojects would not have been built and some 600 units of housing for \nvery-low-income people would not have been available.\n  One of the conditions of FAF was that the HFA's had to agree to \nrefund their bonds when interest rates fell. The purpose of the \nrefunding was to reduce mortgage debt service paid by HUD through the \nextra-high rent subsidies. Here was a program designed to provide \nassistance while it was needed and then to end the subsidy when it was \nno longer needed.\n  The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1988 provided that \nState HFA's were entitled to receive 50 percent of the savings \ngenerated by the refunding of the bonds, but the HFA's were required to \nuse their share of the savings to provide housing assistance to persons \nbelow 50 percent of the area median income.\n  In 1991, HUD and the Utah HFA entered into an agreement that provided \nfor a mechanism where HUD would continue paying the high rent subsidies \nto the project owner, and for a trustee to collect the savings not \nneeded to pay the new lower bond debt and to split it between HUD and \nthe Utah HFA. The format of the agreement between HUD and the Utah HFA \nwas commonly called a trustee sweep and,\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\nalthough it is the only agreement of its kind the Utah HFA has entered \ninto, it was commonly used by HUD and other HFA's. The agreement \nbetween HUD and the Utah HFA provided that the HFA could be reimbursed \nfor money it spent to assist very low income families.\n  The agreement between HUD and the Utah HFA also contained a clause in \nwhich both HUD and the HFA agreed to not consent to or encourage any of \nthe project owners to refinance their mortgage held by the Utah HFA.\n  In 1992 and 1993, at the first date it could contractually do so, at \nHUD's request, the Utah Housing Finance Agency refunded its bonds and \nfulfilled its obligation that had been set out 10 years earlier. The \nstage was set for the Utah HFA to spend its own funds to help very low-\nincome families with their housing needs, relying on the agreement with \nHUD that the HFA would be reimbursed for its outlay of money.\n  The Utah HFA, relying on its agreement with HUD, spent its own funds \non CHAMP, a nationally recognized homeownership program that has \nenabled hundreds of very low-income families, many of them single \nparents, to purchase inexpensive homes with CHAMP's downpayment and \nclosing cost assistance. These hard working, but low-paid families now \nhave what for many is their only chance of raising their children in \nthe stable environment of the American Dream, a single-family home. \nUtah HFA spent its funds with the certainty that it would be reimbursed \nby the FAF savings from its agreement with HUD.\n  In October 1994, HUD, in breach of the agreement with the Utah HFA, \nconsented to the request of six project owners enabling them to \nrefinance their projects. The owners obtained new mortgage loans and \nprepaid the Utah HFA loans in full. Five of the six developments are \ncontinuing to receive the additional FAF rent subsidy.\n  The owners' refinancing was only possible by maintaining the section \n8 contract rents at the very high subsidy levels, including that \nportion which was from the FAF. The owners will maintain the same or \nhigher monthly debt service payments, because their new loans have a \nlower rate than the original loans, but with a much shorter term. HUD \nchose not to reduce the contract rents, but instead chose to consent to \nthe refinancing, and appears to have breached its agreements with the \nUtah HFA. The result of this tragedy is that the project owners will \nbenefit from taxpayer money originally intended to finance high-\ninterest debt, and more recently, very low-income people under the \nMcKinney Homeless Assistance Act. The owners will enjoy the \ndevelopments free from debt at about the same time the section 8 HAP \ncontracts expire. It is possible the owners will convert the \ndevelopments to market rentals at that time, and reap an extraordinary \nwindfall at the expense of the public, as a result of HUD's decision to \nmaintain the high contract rents allocations to the development.\n  Sadly, HUD could have prevented this from happening but it did not. \nHUD is the section 8 HAP contract administrator for the Utah projects. \nThe Utah HFA plays no role in the HAP contracts.\n  The HAP contacts require HUD's prior written consent to a \nrefinancing, and HUD, through the Denver regional office, gave that \nconsent, and perhaps even encouraged the refinancing by entering into \nan amendment of the HAP contract which provides for the sharing of the \ncontract rent savings with the owner, even though HUD agreed not to \nencourage or consent to a voluntary repayment.\n  Numerous documents, statutes, agreements, and good sense show that \nthe owners were not entitled to these moneys. The HUD decisionmakers \nstood behind one phrase in the HUD 1987 statute, in the face of \noverwhelming conflicts with other defensible documentation. The HUD \ndecisionmakers allowed form over substance to rule their decision.\n  The HAP contracts, the Utah HFA bond indentures and official \nstatements, the agreements between the owners and the agency, the \nCongressional Record, FAF appropriations, and the agreement between HUD \nand the Utah HFA all point to the simple fact that HUD was obligated to \npay contract rents only to the extent necessary to maintain the \nfinancial viability of the developments. Nothing should have convinced \nHUD to donate these moneys to the owners of the developments.\n  HUD's action in this matter frustrates the public purpose of the \nMcKinney Act, and the original FAF appropriations.\n  Accordingly, I have been working with HUD to see if a solution could \nbe arranged which satisfies all parties. Back when Secretary Cisneros \ncame before the committee I submitted questions regarding this matter. \nI continued to work with HUD and the result is the amendment I am \nproposing today. In fact, this amendment was drafted by HUD. I have \ngone about resolving this matter with the utmost care, involving the \nall parties in what, I believe, is an equitable solution.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this deals with a problem the State of Utah \nhas had, its Housing Finance Agency, with HUD. It is $755,000 that is \nin dispute. We believe this amendment is necessary to resolve the \nmatter. As I understand it, HUD has no objection to this. I ask for the \nimmediate adoption of the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this side has no objection to the \namendment. It does correct a problem created by HUD for the State, for \nthe Utah Housing Finance Agency. It goes back to Senator Bennett's \npredecessor, Senator Garn, who was ranking on the committee. We are \nhappy it is finally resolved, and urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5188) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5189\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of amounts made available under the Act \n to investigate or prosecute under the Fair Housing Act any otherwise \n   lawful activity engaged in by one or more persons solely for the \n purpose of achieving or preventing action by a government official or \n             entity, or a court of competent jurisdiction)\n\n  Mr. BOND. On behalf of Senator Faircloth, I send to the desk an \namendment which repeats the provisions carried in last year's \nappropriations measures regarding free speech and the Fair Housing Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Faircloth, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5189.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in title II of the bill, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 2   . FAIR HOUSING AND FREE SPEECH.\n\n       None of the amounts made available under this Act may be \n     used during fiscal year 1997 to investigate or prosecute \n     under the Fair Housing Act any otherwise lawful activity \n     engaged in by one or more persons, including the filing or \n     maintaining of a nonfrivolous legal action, that is engaged \n     in solely for the purpose of achieving or preventing action \n     by a government official or entity, or a court of competent \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nH.R. 3666 that will bring fairness and common sense to the way in which \nour Nation's housing policies are carried out. As you know Mr. \nPresident, I introduced a bill last August, the Fair Housing Reform and \nFreedom of Speech Act of 1995 that would overturn the Supreme Court \nruling in City of Edmonds versus Oxford House.\n  In that case, a home for 10 to 12 recovering addicts and alcoholics \nwas located in a single family neighborhood. The city told Oxford House \nthat they would have to apply for and receive zoning approval since the \nhome would have violated the city's local zoning code that placed \nlimits on the number of unrelated persons living together.\n  Rather than going through the governmental process, Oxford House \nfiled a claim with the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nsaying that they were above the zoning process. HUD investigated the \nindividuals and\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\ncity officials who had objected to the placement of this home. \nRegrettably, the Supreme Court ruled that these individuals had \nviolated the Fair Housing Act.\n  In the past, HUD has prosecuted people under the Fair Housing Act who \nhave protested group homes coming into their neighborhoods. One of the \nmost notable of these cases was the incident involving three residents \nin Berkeley, CA. HUD eventually dropped their suit because of the \npublic's outrage. HUD has told us that they have discontinued this \npractice. I hope they have--but this amendment makes sure that they do.\n  The Congress clearly intended an exemption from the Fair Housing Act \nregarding the number of unrelated occupants living together. In fact, \nthe Fair Housing Act expressly authorizes ``any reasonable local, State \nor Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants \npermitted to occupy a dwelling.'' (Title 42, U.S. Code, Section \n3607(b)(1)).\n  However, HUD, saying that it has authority from the Fair Housing Act, \nhas repeatedly intimidated people in the past who spoke out with \npossible prosecution. HUD's actions have been blatant violations of \nthese individuals' rights to freedom of speech. Anybody has the right \nto speak their mind in opposition to something and seek legal action \nagainst what they believe is an injustice. HUD is trying to use its \nauthority as a weapon to silence legitimate free speech.\n  My amendment will make some delineation of the parameters of the Fair \nHousing Act. We need to preserve this act to prevent real \ndiscrimination in housing, but we should not be using this act to \npursue agendas that silence individuals rights to free speech.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I urge my colleagues' support of this \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we also concur with the amendment. I \nhave been informed Secretary Cisneros has agreed to the amendment. \nSenator Sarbanes, the ranking member of the Banking Committee does, and \nso do I, because what this does is prohibit HUD from suing people or \ngroups protesting HUD activities. It was based on suits HUD brought \nagainst groups protesting group homes. HUD accused them of Fair Housing \nAct violations. It was a really needless and heavyhanded intrusion on \ncitizens' rights to organize about their own neighborhoods, something I \nmost enthusiastically support.\n  I support the Faircloth amendment and so do the appropriate people on \nmy side of the aisle. Therefore, we urge the adoption of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5189) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have several more amendments that have \ncome to us. We will take a few moments to discuss those. If my \ncolleague has no further comments, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we have the basic agreement for a \ntime on the Daschle amendment on the VA amendment. I propose that there \nbe 4 hours equally divided on this amendment with one-half hour on the \nminority side allocated to Senator Byrd, that there be no second \ndegrees, and at the end of that time a vote occur on or in relation to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that agreement is acceptable on this \nside. I think we can accommodate that schedule. I know Senator Byrd \nwanted to have some time, and this will accommodate his interests. So I \nhope that we can agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I just ask the managers of the bill, if \nwe spend 4 hours on this amendment--and there are a dozen amendments \npending, or something like that--it certainly is our hope we could \nfinish the bill today. If we are going to spend 4 hours on one \namendment, that does not make that look very likely. I do not \nunderstand why it would take 4 hours. I do not understand why it would \ntake more than an hour.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we could take 10 or 20 hours, too. We are \ntrying to accommodate the majority. The amendment has 25 cosponsors. I \ncannot recall exactly how many of our cosponsors have indicated an \ninterest in talking, but I have assurances that the Senator from West \nVirginia would like 30 minutes alone. We will continue to work as we \ndid last night to come up with a finite list, but I thought it was a \nconcession to the majority to limit this to 4 hours, 2 hours on a side.\n  So if that is not acceptable, we can just begin without a time \nagreement and maybe we can do it in less time. Maybe it will take twice \nas long, but that is up to the majority.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Also, does the request say ``up to 4 hours''?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We will always be able to yield back time. So that \nimplication is always part of the agreement. But if 4 hours is \nunacceptable, perhaps we ought to begin the debate and see how long it \ntakes.\n  Mr. President, I object to the agreement. I object to the agreement, \nand we will just begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was not going to object. The Senator \nfrom South Dakota can object if he wants to. I think 4 hours is too \nlong. I think if we have an interest in passing this bill, we need to \nmove forward on several amendments and we need to move forward \nexpeditiously. Four hours on one amendment does not seem appropriate if \nthat is our goal and objective to finish.\n  If people want to string it out, I do not doubt we could spend all \nday on an amendment and probably spend all day on several amendments, \nbut that does not finish the bill and does not get the work done.\n  We happen to have five appropriations bills that we need to finish \njust through the Senate. Again, this Senator is not going to object to \nthe request. But I think all Senators are going to have to realize, if \nthey have an amendment on the list and they really desire to bring it \nup--and I know there are some amendments on there that people do not \nintend to offer, and I hope that is the case--we need to shorten our \nsights, make speeches maybe later in the evening or something, but move \nforward expeditiously on these amendments, vote on the amendments and \ndispose of them.\n  I shall not object to the unaminous-consent.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, but I \nwill not ask that it be read at this time. I will simply begin the \ndebate and we will offer the amendment at a later time, several hours \nfrom now probably.\n  Mr. President, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \napproximately 2,785 children of Vietnam veterans suffer from spina \nbifida, a serious birth defect that requires lifelong care. That has \nalready been established. A March report from the National Academy of \nSciences suggests that a connection between these children's \ndisabilities and their parents' exposure to agent orange in Vietnam is \na very real and growing problem.\n  Today, along with 25 of my colleagues, I am offering an amendment to \nacknowledge the Federal Government's share of responsibility for these \nchildren's care. Spina bifida occurs when the spinal cord does not \nclose fully early in pregnancy. It is a complex disability. It requires \ncoordinated care for many medical specialists, including neurosurgeons, \nneurologists, orthopedists, pediatricians, internists in adult years, \npsychologists, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers.\n  Children with spina bifida often go through a series of operations in \nearly\n\n[[Page S9879]]\n\nchildhood followed by special care, therapy and treatment throughout \ntheir lives. Many are wheelchair bound. Others can walk with \nassistance. There is a high survival rate. But these victims of this \nhorrendous disease face daily challenges few of us will ever fully \ncomprehend.\n  Picture a 10-year-old child leaving for school in a specially \nequipped schoolbus, but only after first running through an obstacle \ncourse known to most of us as a house, to get from her bed to the \nelectric wheelchair that takes her to a bathroom where she is learning \nto control continence through a catheter, and on through a house \ndesigned to accommodate the special needs of someone living with a \ndisability.\n  During the day, this fifth grader must attend many classes with her \npeers but also must spend part of the day in special education classes \nto overcome learning disabilities that are often associated with spina \nbifida and to go to physical therapy to ensure continued mobility and \ndevelopment.\n  After school, the child is picked up by her mother, who had to take \nthe afternoon off, in a special transport van to go to a hospital for \nher biannual checkup with a multidisciplinary team. She may have \nbladder therapies, a renal ultrasound or urologic tests. She may be \nchecked for seizures or scoliosis. She and her parents will be taught \nself-care skills for bowel management, intermittent catheterization and \nintervention for urinary tract infections, all this in addition to \nregular pediatric checkups.\n  Before leaving, she is referred to her psychiatrist the following \nweek to discuss depression and socialization issues. Her nurse asks her \nabout her latex allergy, which is a common secondary condition, and \nreminds her to avoid bandages, balloons and other products containing \nlatex.\n  Later, at home, the family sits down to a low-fat meal to keep weight \nproblems at bay as she does her homework, practices transfer techniques \nto move her between wheelchair and bed, and finally goes to sleep.\n  Fortunately, these kids are tough. Depending on severity, many are \nable to live very full and productive lives, though not a day goes by \nthat they are not reminded of their disability.\n  Mr. President, the National Academy of Sciences announced in March \nnew findings that suggest evidence of a link between exposure to agent \norange and the presence of spina bifida in Vietnam veterans' children. \nThe report was required by the Agent Orange Act of 1991 that was Public \nLaw 102-4.\n  The first National Academy of Sciences report published in 1993, as \nmany of our colleagues recall, created a four-tiered classification \nsystem for health problems associated with agent orange exposure.\n  Category 1 was sufficient evidence of an association. Evidence in \nthis category is sufficient to conclude without any question that there \nis a positive association.\n  Category 2 is the limited/suggestive evidence of association. In this \ncategory evidence suggests the association, but there is an inability \nto rule out, with confidence, confounding, chance or bias, so there is \nnot unequivocal, absolute, conclusive proof that the connection exists.\n  Category 3 is inadequate or insufficient evidence to determine \nwhether an association exists. That is a category where available \nstudies are insufficient to permit a conclusion about the presence or \nabsence of an association.\n  And category 4, the limited/suggestive evidence of no association \nwhatsoever, where studies are mutually consistent in not showing a \npositive association between any level of exposure and the presence of \na condition.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs provides disability compensation \nto Vietnam veterans suffering from conditions in the first and second \ncategories. The National Academy of Sciences has now placed for the \nfirst time spina bifida in the second category of diseases for which \nthere is the limited/suggestive evidence of the association.\n\n  Mr. President, the law requires that in cases where the evidence for \nan association is equal to or outweighs the evidence against the \nassociation, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs resolve the benefit of \nthe doubt in favor of the veteran and provide the disability \ncompensation. That is consistent with the law providing presumptive \ndisability compensation to veterans of all previous wars. The Agent \nOrange Act of 1991 gave the authority to the Secretary to make these \ndecisions based upon the neutral, scientific and very respected \nNational Academy of Science reports which are required in the law that \nI mentioned earlier.\n  This amendment is required because the Secretary does not have the \nauthority to provide for compensation to veterans' children. While \nbirth defects in their children has been many veterans' biggest \nconcern, we have never before faced a situation where we now have very \nreal, tangible evidence, based upon National Academy of Sciences' \ninformation, and the tremendous work and effort done by many others who \ncontributed to this report. The Agent Orange Act did anticipate this \nsituation and specifically asked the National Academy of Sciences to \ninvestigate the connection between exposure and reproductive effects \nand birth defects in veterans' children.\n  In March, I submitted for the Record a statement supporting these \nfindings and raising the issues that needed to be addressed. So, as \nrequired by the 1991 law, the Department of Veterans Affairs reviewed \nthe National Academy of Sciences report. In May, the President \nannounced, among other things, his intention to pursue legislation that \nwould provide an appropriate remedy for these veterans and their \nchildren.\n  Again, let me emphasize, in this category 2, the National Academy of \nSciences has concluded that there is more evidence to suggest the \nconnection than there is lack of evidence to suggest that there is no \nconnection. So there is a strong degree of evidence, statistically \nsignificant scientific evidence, that has brought the National Academy \nof Sciences, for the first time, to the conclusion that they reached \nearlier this year and has brought the Secretary and the President to \nthe conclusion they have reached.\n  So the time now has come, Mr. President, for us to respond, as we \nhave responded at each and every one of the junctures that we have \nfaced during this very difficult period for many victims of Agent \nOrange. This amendment addresses this situation in what I view to be a \nvery reasonable way. It is sensitive to the needs of the children and \nour responsibility to them, but at the same time it is cognizant of the \nfact that these children are not veterans. That must be taken into \naccount, as well.\n  This amendment would provide comprehensive health care, vocational \nrehabilitation, and a monthly stipend to eligible children. \nEligibility, of course, is a very important factor to be considered \nhere. The veteran must have served in Vietnam and must now be in a \nsituation where they are experiencing or have clearly become victims of \nthe spina bifida disease.\n  Health care would be provided by or through the Veterans' \nAdministration. We anticipate that most of the care would be provided \nvia contract by experienced spina bifida care providers. It would \nprovide for up to 4 years of vocational training, and monthly payments \nof $200, $700, or $1,200 would be provided, depending on the level of \ndisability. The proposal reflects months of efforts by the \nadministration, by others, including Senators Kerrey and Rockefeller, \nCongressman Lane Evans, veterans service organizations, and groups \nrepresenting persons with spina bifida.\n  It is fully offset with a noncontroversial provision included in both \nthe Democratic and Republican reconciliation bills last year. It \nrequires that veterans wishing to file liability claims against the VA \nshow negligence, as is done in the private sector, to be entitled to \nbenefits for whatever claims may be derived as a result of the filing \nby the veteran. Currently, a veteran may file for service connection \nfor any injury occurring in a VA facility without showing whether it \nresulted from negligence or an accident. So, both the budgets of the \nRepublicans and the Democrats included a provision to clarify the \nresponsibility of the VA in cases of claims involving veterans who file \nthat may not at all be related to negligence on the part of the VA. \nThat clarification creates a surplus from which part of the funds to be \npaid out in this amendment will be derived.\n\n  Savings from the provision come from averting future cases--no \nbenefits are cut. Excess savings are directed to\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\ndeficit reduction, allowing the VA and the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nto count these savings toward future responsibilities in the next \nreconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, the VA-HUD appropriations bill is certainly the most \nappropriate vehicle for this, 20 years later. It seems to me that after \nevery one of the debates and all of the cases that we have had to make \non this floor and in the House of Representatives on behalf of veterans \nwho have been exposed to an unusual set of circumstances that go all \nthe way back to the early 1970's, where mysterious diseases have \noccurred and ultimately have been found to be related to their exposure \nin Vietnam--obviously, each and every one of those cases involving yet \nadditional evidence has led to a debate that dealt with the appropriate \nway with which to respond to this additional evidence. We now have the \nevidence of yet another unfortunate effect of that military service. We \nhave the evidence. We have the law on our side. And now we have the \nappropriate solution.\n  Given the limited amount of time left this year and the proposal by \nthe majority leader for moving the schedule between now and the end of \nthis month, there is likely no other opportunity for us to address this \nissue in the remaining days of this legislative session.\n  Mr. President, some would argue that we should not legislate on an \nappropriations bill, but they are oftentimes the ones who have \nsupported legislation on an appropriations bill on prior occasions \nduring this Congress. In fact, on March 16, 1995, the vote was 42-57 to \nallow legislating on an appropriations bill. On that day, the practice \nbecame something that would now be considered to be appropriate, given \nthe circumstances of that vote and the ruling by the Chair and the \ncommitment on the part of the body to overrule the Chair on that \noccasion. So the precedent has been set. Legislating on appropriations \nis now something that is not out of order, and no points of order can \nbe brought on that particular issue.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, has very strong support from the \nAmerican Legion, from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, from the Vietnam \nVeterans of America, from a real leader in this whole effort now for \nalmost 25 years, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt--who has probably experienced the \neffects of agent orange on his family more graphically and \nunfortunately than perhaps anybody else in the country, given the fact \nthat his son was exposed and died of his exposure to agent orange and \nhis grandson is suffering from a learning disability they believe to be \nrelated to his son's exposure--the Spina Bifida Association of America, \nthe Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the American Association \nof University Affiliated Programs for Persons with Developmental \nDisabilities, and, of course, the administration.\n  Mr. President, we have to make a commitment to these children. They \nmay not be large in number, but those 2,000 children are every bit as \nmuch victims of those circumstances faced by our soldiers in Vietnam as \nthe soldiers were themselves. We placed their parents, men and women, \nin harm's way in service to their country. We asked them to risk their \nlives and their health so that others could remain free. We did not, \nhowever, ask them to give their children's lives and health. We told \nthem that we would take care of them and their families when they \nreturn, whether they were injured or not. Some of those injuries were \nimmediately apparent, but others have revealed themselves over time. We \nbear the responsibility for the consequences of our actions and our \npolicies, for the injuries suffered by those veterans, even those \nunforeseen, and even those in their children. This amendment does it as \nbest we can under these circumstances. I urge its adoption.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, before the minority leader leaves, there are \na number of things I would like to clarify with him. What is the basis \nof the number of children who have spina bifida, who are children or \noffspring--and I suppose now many are grown into adulthood--what is the \nbasis of that number?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The basis of the number is simply the number we have \nbeen able to calculate of those children of agent orange veterans who \nwere exposed to agent orange and who are now victims of spina bifida. \nSo you have a very limited population. That population is first limited \nby the number of Vietnam veterans in Vietnam exposed to agent orange \nand, second, to those children of veterans who fall into that category.\n  Mr. BOND. They have not actually counted this number. This is an \nestimate, is it not?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is as hard a count as the VA currently has.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand this is just an estimate based on an \nassumption from a study that if there is a connection, this number of \noffspring of veterans would have spina bifida, is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am told by staff that this is the best estimate the \nCongressional Budget Office has been able to derive in consultation \nwith the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. BOND. But it is an estimate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is an estimate.\n  Mr. BOND. Based on a study of a small number of people where there \nwere slightly larger incidence of spina bifida in this study than in \nthe normal population, is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is not correct. The distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee misstates, I think, the report by the National Academy of \nSciences. The National Academy of Sciences has indicated that, in the \ncategory 2 determination, there is a greater association of spina \nbifida victims in cases involving veterans affected by agent orange \nthan in the nonexposed population. That is, there is a greater \nlikelihood that spina bifida has occurred as a result of that exposure \nthan there is not.\n  Mr. BOND. That is an estimate based on one study. You are \nextrapolating from that study?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, the law requires us to base it on the National \nAcademy of Sciences' report, which is based on several studies. The \nNational Academy of Sciences is required, under the law of 1991, to \nreview the scientific literature and evidence to provide us with an \nassessment of the health-related difficulties that may be in evidence \nas a result of exposure in Vietnam, including those especially related \nto children. In accordance with the law, the National Academy of \nSciences has now said that spina bifida is one disease where a clear \nassociation can be drawn.\n  In working with the National Academy of Sciences, the Congressional \nBudget Office, and the VA, there has been an estimate provided, for \nbudgetary purposes, of the number of children who would be directly \naffected. That estimate is the one I gave earlier. That is only an \nestimate, but it is the best estimate, given the circumstances and the \nstudies that have now been done.\n  I don't believe it is a very significant matter for us to be debating \nthe question as to whether it is 2,500, or 2,800, or 3,200. The \nestimate was made the way CBO estimates are normally made. The real \nquestion is: What do you do when you have a veteran exposed to agent \norange, who now has a child with spina bifida? What the law says is \nthat we give the veteran and his or her family the benefit of the \ndoubt. In following through with the law, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs has done just that.\n  Mr. BOND. Well, Mr. President, I might say to the distinguished \nminority leader, this is one of the problems we get when there is a \nlegislative matter on which there have been no hearings in the Senate. \nWe are attempting to determine the basis of that assumption here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  This should properly be done in a Veterans' Affairs Committee \nhearing. As I understand what the minority leader says in his \narguments--and none of us have any question about the pain and \ndifficulty that a family with a child born with spina bifida goes \nthrough. What we are asking is whether there is a reasonable basis in \nfact. Now, as I understand it, all of these assumptions are based on \nsomething called the ranch-hand study, is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is not correct.\n  Mr. BOND. What is the basis of it then, the study, the basis of the \nassumptions that you are making?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The basis of the assumptions is, as I said earlier, that \nthe law requires the National Academy of\n\n[[Page S9881]]\n\nSciences to review all of the outstanding information, all of the \nscientific data that is available currently, including but not limited \nto the Ranch Hand study, assess that data and make a determination \nbased upon that assessment as to whether an association exists. By law, \nthey are required to do that. By law, they have.\n  Having done that, by law, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the \nPresident, and 26 of us in the Senate--as well as more in the House--\nare now responding. The law required that we give the benefit of the \ndoubt to the veteran. Now, there have been those who have historically \nopposed that presumptive disability compensation in the law. But it is \nthe law. What we are now saying is that the law must extend to the \nchildren, as it has been extended to agent orange victims in the past, \nover the objections, I might add, of a few of my colleagues. Again, \nPublic Law 102-4 has been passed; it is the law, and it is our \nresponsibility to live up to our commitments.\n  I might also add, in response to the distinguished chairman's comment \nabout a hearing, the National Academy of Sciences' report linking agent \norange exposure to spina bifida was issued in March. The President \nannounced his commitment to a legislative solution in May. The request \nfor committee hearings on the NAS findings was issued 2\\1/2\\ months ago \nand was never answered--over 2\\1/2\\ months ago. We never had any \ncommitment to a hearing. Now, there is a hearing scheduled for sometime \nthis month, but not on the exploration of issues dealing with this \namendment. There has been ample time and notification to deal with this \nissue. There has been absolutely no response.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Wyoming has a very busy \nschedule, and I don't, in any way, imply that he is not interested and \nhas not been personally kind to me in many of the requests that I have \nmade of him. But on this issue I think the record speaks for itself. \nThere has not been committee attention given to this issue this entire \nyear. Now, suddenly scheduling an unrelated hearing--unrelated \nhearing--2 weeks before adjournment is not going to allow us to address \nthis issue. We know what the law says, and we know what the National \nAcademy of Sciences' report has concluded. We know that there is an \nassociation.\n  All we are simply doing here is saying let's make sure that the VA \nhas the ability to follow through with what the law requires in \nproviding the benefits to veterans and their families under these very, \nvery difficult circumstances, albeit very limited, perhaps to as few as \n2,500 cases.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me ask the minority leader when the \nlegislation to provide this was introduced. When did you introduce \nlegislation to provide these benefits?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we introduced the legislation this \nsummer, sometime in July.\n  Mr. BOND. Well, since we went out of session in August, and it was \nintroduced in the latter part of July, it would not be unreasonable \nthat legislative hearings could not be held on a bill which had not \nbeen introduced, is it?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, Mr. President, I just say that, obviously, you \ndon't need a bill to hold hearings on something that was already \nannounced all the way back last March. Last March, the National Academy \nof Sciences made their announcement and the Secretary and the President \nmade their decisions in May. I would think that alone would trigger \nhearings and some response on the part of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. That was not done.\n  So, obviously, our only recourse was to follow through with the \nlegislation that we introduced.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I will have further remarks later. But \nsince the distinguished minority leader is here, I will say that I \npersonally know of his deep, deep interest in agent orange issues. The \nSenator from South Dakota and I have been bandying that about for many \na year. We will continue to do so, because I continue to insist--and \nthe law insists--that we stick with sound medical and scientific \nevidence, period.\n  We do not deal with these issues on the basis of emotion or fear. \nThis makes it very difficult because there is no sound medical or \nscientific evidence that dioxin does anything related to birth defects \nexcept for one study of a highly exposed group called the ``ranch-hand \nstudy.''\n  Remember, too, that there was a civil suit against the producers and \nmanufacturers of herbicides containing dioxin. It was to be the \ngreatest class action of all time. It was to destroy huge corporations \nin America and bring them to their knees for producing this substance. \nWhat happened to that suit? It was settled for less than $200 million. \nThe judge recommended that the plaintiffs settle because there wouldn't \nbe any way they could prove through the testimony what they had to \nprove to show sound medical and scientific evidence linking dioxin to \nwhat had happened to the plaintiff class. They settled for an amount \nthat would amount to a few thousand dollars each for members of the \nclass, perhaps $6,000, $7,000, or $8,000 each. And that settlement \nreally was the beginning of what has come to pass with regard to an \nissue that never seems to go away.\n  But I commend my friend, Tom Daschle. He is a fighter for veterans. I \nam a veteran, too. I do not enjoy getting into these things. I chair \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  But to my knowledge there has never been a request for a hearing on \nthis bill because this bill didn't come before the U.S. Senate until \nJuly 29, and we went out days after that. I do not hold many hearings \non bills that I do not have before me. This bill was presented July 29.\n  The amendment speaks of the law and what we do to follow the law. The \nlaw requires us to say, for each disease reviewed by the Academy, ``the \nextent that available scientific data permit meaningful determinations, \nA, whether a statistical association with herbicide exposure exists \ntaking into account the strength''--the word is ``strength''--``of the \nscientific evidence of the appropriateness of the statistical and \nepidemiological method used to detect association.''\n  There is no ``strength'' in the report that the minority leader \ncites. It was a subject of ``bias, confusion, and confounding,'' \naccording to the Institute of Medicine. And I shall quote that later in \nmy remarks.\n  The second part of it was the increased risk of the disease among \nthose exposed to herbicide during service in the Republic of Vietnam \nduring the Vietnam era; and, C, ``whether there exists a plausible \nbiological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship between \nherbicide exposure and the disease.''\n  That is the law. So it was not something that the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee was escaping. But I certainly wanted the record to be so \ntotally clear on what the subject is because there is no solid, strong \ndata to support any plausible biological mechanism.\n  I have cited the law. I shall have more to say later. But this is the \nfirst time--I hope the leader will listen to my remarks. And I see the \nranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is on the floor. I \nhope that he will become involved in the debate, if that is \nappropriate, and I think it is. This will be the very first time that \nwe have ever extended any form of entitlement to a dependent class \nbased on the health of the dependant, rather than the disability or \ndeath of the parent. I have no idea where this precedent would take us, \nbut I can tell you that in our reconciliation instructions there are \nnot many places to get the funding needed to pay for it.\n  So I hope that every single Member who is sponsoring this amendment \nwill tell us where we are going to get the money because we are already \ncommitted to using the Gardner decision money for other purposes. I \nhope that will be heard again and again and again as we get into \ntalking about reprogramming or doing this, or doing that--that we have \nallocated the Gardner decision money. Gardner was a decision which \ncould be described by a nonlawyer as ``bone headed.'' Nevertheless, we \nwill correct that, and we have allocated those resources. They are \ngone.\n\n  So if this passes, and the Veterans' Committee is then called upon to \nmeet it's reconciliation instructions, then I am going to have to, as \nchairman and with my good colleague from West Virginia as ranking, sit \ndown and decide\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\nwhere we are going to get the money. I know there will be an argument \nabout reprogramming and stuff that no one will understand. But that is \nthe issue. That is one of the issues.\n  The other issue is when you link the word ``veteran'' and innocent, \ndisabled children you have to wade through a lot of emotion as well as \nfacts. They have linked those words here. And it will be my purpose to \ntry to show that the people who were in Vietnam and exposed were \ntreated very fairly and always on the basis of sound medical and \nscientific evidence.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, going back to the basic questions and \nassumptions, again I note the difficulty we have as we are asked on an \nappropriations bill to approve legislation to establish a new \nentitlement program.\n  Did I understand the minority leader to say that he believes it is \nentirely appropriate for an appropriations bill to include a new \nentitlement program which has not been the subject of hearings in an \nauthorizing committee, and which the chairman of the authorizing \ncommittee opposes on an appropriations bill? Is this the new procedure \nwe follow?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I remind my dear friend that he voted to \ncause this to be the new procedure in March 1995. He voted to overrule \nthe Chair when the Chair ruled that you could not legislate on an \nappropriations bill. He was one of those who said no; that we think now \nthat appropriations bills are appropriate vehicles with which to \nlegislate. So he set the precedent. We are simply saying we are willing \nto live now with that precedent. With respect to this case, I thank him \nfor doing so. But he was the one who did it. I do not think this is \nnecessarily a good practice. But in this case I am very grateful to him \nfor having voted for it so I can offer this amendment and not be called \non a point of order.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there will be a point of order. Who knows? \nThere may be several of them.\n  But let me ask the minority leader if he does not agree that there \nare instances of legislation on appropriations bills where the \nauthorizing committee has agreed that it is appropriate to make changes \nwhich could not be made in the normal course of business and whether it \nhas not been the agreement of the leadership that on this \nappropriations cycle we would only include legislation which had the \napproval of the authorizing committees? Was the minority leader not \ninvolved in that leadership discussion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was certainly not involved in any discussion of that \nkind. That is news to me.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am sorry that the word has not gotten \naround. I was under the impression that the full leadership of this \nbody had said that we were not going to attempt a broad range of \nauthorizing activities where the authorizing committee objected. \nCertainly in this instance I think there are many questions which \nlegitimately should be resolved before the authorizing committee.\n  I wonder if the minority leader is familiar with the testimony which \nwas produced in the House by the principal investigator on the one \nstudy, a ``ranch-hand study,'' which examined the possibility of a link \nbetween dioxin and offspring with spina bifida, and the fact this \ninvestigator testified before the House appropriations committee \nconcluded in his testimony by saying that ``The Institute of Medicine \nhas recently interpreted available evidence on spina bifida and \nexposure to herbicide as `suggestive of an association' but `limited \nbecause chance bias and confounding could not be ruled out with \nconfidence' the results of our study of ranch hand veterans and \ncomparisons were apparently important to the Institute of Medicine in \nreaching their conclusion. However, it is my opinion that the \naccumulated evidence does not yet establish that there is a cause-and-\neffect relationship between herbicide exposure and spina bifida \ntoday.''\n\n  Is the Senator familiar with that testimony?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I sure am. I appreciate the fact that the Senator from \nMissouri has raised the question because it confirms really what the \nNational Academy of Sciences also says. It says that the evidence today \ndoes not suggest a direct, unequivocal cause-and-effect relationship--\nand the law specifically does not require one. All the National Academy \nof Sciences says is that there is more evidence to suggest that there \nis a relationship than there is evidence to suggest that there is not.\n  The National Academy of Sciences is that body to which we turn for \nthe best assessment as to what the relationship is so that the \nSecretary and we may determine what our actions ought to be based upon \nthe available scientific data. Based upon that and only that, we are \nconcluding once more, as we have done on so many occasions, that the \npresumption must go to the veteran--not to the Government, not to the \nchemical companies, not to anybody else but to the veteran.\n  We have to assume that if there is some doubt and if the weight of \nevidence suggests that there is more data in favor of the relationship \nthan there is not, the benefit of the doubt ought to go to the veteran \nand his family. We have done that on compensation. We have done that on \nmedical care. And now we are doing it on a very narrow focus: spina \nbifida today in children of victims of agent orange in the first place.\n  That is what we are saying. As the Senator from Missouri knows, we \ndebate the same issue with respect to tobacco constantly--you have \nSenators here who raise the issue of tobacco, and there is a debate \nabout how much data suggests a direct link. But you still have \ncompanies that suggest there is no link. I am one who does not agree \nwith that. But yet we base our policy on the linkage that exists, the \noverwhelming evidence that does exist that there is a connection \nbetween exposure and a disease. So we are doing now with agent orange \nonce more--providing a link based upon the scientific link that we have \ndescribed in the law itself and that is supported by evidence from the \nCenters for Disease Control studies, the ranch hand study, and other \nevidence.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the legal link is merely that there are \nsuggestions, there is not evidence, and this is one of the facts that \nwould be brought out were there to be a hearing. Perhaps the minority \nleader could tell us what kind of services the potential beneficiaries \nof this amendment are now receiving. Are they now receiving federally \nsupported care? Are they receiving privately supported care?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I can tell the Senator from Missouri that they are not \nreceiving any assistance today from the VA.\n  Mr. BOND. That is not the question. Are they receiving Federal \nassistance in any form?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That would depend, of course, on what their \ncircumstances are. If they are Medicaid eligible, they might be \neligible for a small amount of assistance in health from Medicaid, but \nthere is virtually no assistance, as the Senator knows, through \nMedicaid for the number of different obstacles that I described in my \nearlier remarks that a child faces as they have to address the many \ncomplications outside of just the health complications for which they \nmust endure every day. There is no assistance there.\n  So I cannot tell the Senator today how much Medicaid assistance they \nmay be getting, how much assistance they may be getting through AFDC. \nThat is not the issue. The issue is, what is the VA doing? And the \nanswer to that question is zero, nothing. They cannot do anything. That \nis the purpose of this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we have now seen why this is such a \ndifficult question, because there is no arguing with the fact that \nindividuals suffering from disabling diseases, particularly such as \nspina bifida, which is a congenital birth defect, which, in most severe \ncases, can cause paralysis, deserve our compassion. There are some \nstudies underway which have shown that one of the causes of spina \nbifida is a lack of folic acid. This is a disease, this is a defect \nwhich deserves our greatest attention because it is a debilitating, \ntruly awful disability, and the compassion with which the minority \nleader speaks is justifiable.\n\n  We all have compassion for these people, but we are considering an \nappropriations bill today. It is the most tortuous reasoning to say, \nwhen the\n\n[[Page S9883]]\n\nminority leader has waited until July 29 to introduce a piece of \nlegislation, and then without hearings in the relevant authorizing \ncommittee expects without the hearings and over the objection of the \nauthorizing committee which wishes to explore what is clearly \nquestionable scientific evidence on which any findings should be based, \nthat this should be put in an appropriations bill. This would be an \nentitlement program stuck on an appropriations bill. As the chairman of \nthe Veterans Committee has already pointed out, the so-called offset \nhas already been used for the entitlement.\n  The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee marked up a bill just prior to \nthe August recess. No Member raised the issue and, as I said, the \nSenate Veterans Affairs Committee has held no hearings on it.\n  There are many issues which need to be considered regarding the \nprovision of benefits to children with spina bifida. They have not been \ndiscussed and debated in a normal legislative process. A view expressed \nby the Disabled American Veterans executive director, David Gorman, in \na May 1996 letter to the VA Secretary said:\n\n       Because the basis of [these children's] entitlement is \n     dissimilar to both the conventional direct and derivative \n     eligibility for VA programs, benefits for them would appear \n     to be beyond the parameters of traditional VA benefits, and \n     more properly under the scope of other compensatory programs. \n     Benefits for these children might be more appropriately \n     included under authority and appropriations for military \n     claims.\n\n  Similarly, the Vietnam Veterans of America wrote to the Secretary in \nApril stating:\n\n       We urge you to specifically request the VA task force seek \n     outside expertise from both governmental and nongovernmental \n     entities on these issues. VVA aims to ensure that the \n     appropriate questions are being considered and addressed by \n     policymakers in the VA and Congress.\n\n  The Vietnam Veterans Association raised a number of questions which \nneed answering such as how many veterans' families are affected by \nspina bifida. We have only an estimate based on a flawed study which \nled to the assumption for the numbers which the minority leader gave. \nAnd the minority leader has been unable to tell us what governmental or \nnongovernmental services might already be available to these veterans \nand families and what agencies should be tasked with providing health \ncare and compensation.\n  The Veterans' Administration does not even know how many offspring of \nveterans of Vietnam are actually affected by this terrible disease, \ntheir ages, their degree of disability, or the extent to which they are \nalready receiving Federal assistance, nor does the VA have any firm \nestimate on the cost of care and compensation.\n  These are very important issues. These are truly critically important \nissues to the families affected. They deserve the attention and \ndeliberation of this body but, I suggest, through the normal \nlegislative process. The views of the veterans service organizations \ncertainly should be taken into consideration on this important issue. \nTheir views--and there are views on both sides--deserve the proper \nforum of hearings in the authorizing committee. As I noted, some of the \norganizations do support and some do not support the Daschle amendment.\n  There are much greater problems with this, and the minority leader \nbrushed them off. But the amendment sets several precedents. First, to \nmy knowledge, expanding entitlements on an appropriations bill has not \nbeen done--to my knowledge.\n  If there is ever an instance in which the American people can see why \nthe Federal Government is spinning out of control, it is when on the \nbasis of limited scientific evidence, not hard scientific evidence, \nwithout hearings, without legislative consideration of all points of \nview, without even knowing how many people are affected and what other \nbenefits are available, a brandnew entitlement program is set up; it is \nset in motion without consideration of its impact.\n  When young people ask us how did the Federal Government spending get \nout of control, this is probably one small example. It is an example, \nwhere there are people who have a severe birth defect. We are concerned \nabout them. But we are setting up a Government program without reliable \nscientific knowledge on what the cause is or how it is going to be \ndealt with. Are we dealing with all of the children of veterans who \ndeserve this kind of help? What about the children of gulf war veterans \nwho suffer from heart-wrenching disabilities, possibly as a result of \ntheir parents' service? This amendment opens up a whole host of \nquestions which deserve to be considered through the normal legislative \nprocess.\n  But let us be clear about the scientific basis. Has there been a \nscientifically established link between exposure to agent orange and \nspina bifida in offspring? The answer is no. There has been only \n``limited/suggestive evidence'' of an association based on a single \nstudy. The author of that study says: Do not rely on it. The cause of \nspina bifida is unknown. Work is going forward on the folic acid \napproach.\n  The VA's task force report on agent orange, issued in May in response \nto the National Academy of Sciences/Institute of Medicine update on \nagent orange, said ``Most of the studies cited did not show \nstatistically significant differences. Notwithstanding these scientific \nquestions, sufficient data exist of a possible association that the \ntask force concluded that spina bifida meets the liberal standards set \nforth in Public Law 102-4,'' the Agent Orange Act of 1991.\n  The task force report also said:\n\n       The Task Force believes the legal standard governing the \n     finding of a ``positive association'' under P.L. 102-4 is an \n     imperfect framework for analyzing the relevant scientific \n     evidence and, further, raises a risk that VA's findings of a \n     ``positive association'' may be misinterpreted to mean more \n     than they do. The Task Force is concerned that VA's finding \n     of a ``positive association'' under the liberal standard of \n     P.L. 102-4 may be misconstrued as reflecting a scientific \n     judgment that a causal association exists between herbicide \n     exposure and a particular disease. The Task Force emphasizes \n     that its conclusions made for the limited purposes of P.L. \n     102-4 do not reflect a judgment that a particular health \n     outcome has been shown to be caused by, or in some cases even \n     definitely associated with, herbicide exposure under the \n     standards ordinarily governing such conclusions for purposes \n     of scientific inquiry and medical care.\n\n  The NAS looked at one study referred to as the ``Ranch Hand'' study. \nThe author of this so-called Ranch Hand study said his own findings did \nnot support a conclusion of linkage between herbicide and spina bifida. \nHe said before a House hearing earlier this year: ``It is my opinion \nthat the accumulated evidence does not yet establish that there is a \ncause-and-effect relationship between herbicide exposure and spina \nbifida.'' The NAS noted that the studies relative to spina bifida had \n``methodological limitations such as small sample size and possible \nrecall bias'' which mean that further study is required.\n  And finally, there is at least one study which would seem to \ncontradict an association between herbicide exposure and spina bifida. \nAn herbicide production plant exploded in the town of Seveso, Italy, \nwith residents exposed to substantial quantities of herbicide. A study \non the frequency of birth defects in Seveso failed to demonstrate any \nincreased risk of birth defects.\n  Let us be clear about the impact of this amendment on other veterans \nentitlements. Because the so-called Gardner decision is being used to \noffset this new entitlement, the effect is that the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, in meeting its reconciliation instructions next year, will \nbe forced to cut veterans entitlements in other areas to pay for this \nentitlement.\n  I should also add that the benefits which would be authorized to \nveterans' offspring in some cases would exceed compensation benefits \ncurrently provided to service-connected veterans. One must question \nwhether this is fair and appropriate.\n  And finally, Mr. President, while the costs of compensation would be \noffset in this amendment by reducing benefits related to the ``Gardner \ndecision,'' there is no provision to cover medical costs. VA would be \nrequired to provide comprehensive health care benefits--at an estimated \ncost of at least $14 million a year. VA would have to absorb these \nadditional costs--at a time when VA's medical care budget, as requested \nby the President and recommended by the committee, is estimated to \ncover only those veterans currently served by the VA medical system. We \nwould have to take away health care from those who are already served \nto meet these new benefits.\n\n[[Page S9884]]\n\n  It seems to me, to expand medical benefits to an additional \npopulation will mean the care of those veterans--the vast majority of \nwhom are service-connected disabled or very low income--will be put at \nrisk.\n  And I should also add that the medical benefits which would be \nauthorized are more generous that VA's current authorities for medical \ncare to veterans. These issues deserve close study and debate. That, I \nthink, can only occur in the authorizing committee in an appropriate \nlegislative consideration.\n\n  I think it is highly inappropriate to play election year politics \nwith such an important issue as this one. I think we have normal \nlegislative procedures which should be followed to determine whether \nthere is any scientific evidence suggesting that we should provide this \nentitlement, this expanded entitlement. Trying to place it on an \nappropriations measure is, I think, inappropriate and totally \nunwarranted.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nminority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be very brief because I note the distinguished \nranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee has been here for \nsome time and wants to be heard on the matter. Let me just respond to \nthree issues raised by the distinguished Senator from Missouri.\n  First of all, as to the matter of the offset, let me emphasize, \nGardner has not been used. Gardner has not been used. That is, the \noffset has not been allocated. The reason it has not been allocated is \nthat we have not passed a reconciliation bill. No reconciliation bill \nhas passed which delineates its usage. So, clearly, that funding has \nnot been allocated. It is available. I do not think there is any \nquestion about that. I ask my colleagues to show me where, in what \nreconciliation bill, we have delineated the utilization of Gardner.\n  Second, let us not debate Ranch Hand all over again. The Ranch Hand \nStudy and many other studies were debated, and we made our decisions \nbased upon the evidence available in 1991. We passed the Agent Orange \nAct overwhelmingly, virtually unanimously, in 1991. That battle was \nfought 5 years ago--beginning even longer ago. That law, now on the \nbooks 5 years, simply says when there is a positive association, when \nthere is a connection that has been made by the National Academy of \nSciences, that connection be recognized by the VA and be dealt with; we \nhave dealt with all of the other diseases that have now been officially \nconnected.\n  There are a number of those diseases that fall in category 1 and \ncategory 2. Chloracne is in that category. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is in \nthat category. Soft-tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, porphyria \ncutanea tarda, multiple myeloma, respiratory cancers of the lung, \nlarynx and trachea, prostate cancer, acute and sub-acute peripheral \nneuropathy--all of those are in categories 1 and 2. If we do not act on \nthis amendment in a favorable way, the only category 1 or 2 disease \nthat will not be on the list officially recognized will be spina \nbifida.\n  We will be saying spina bifida is different than all the diseases I \nhave just listed here. We are going to say that we are going to not \nabide by the law, not abide by the guidance given by the National \nAcademy of Sciences. We are going to say we know better than the \nNational Academy of Sciences. We are going to say that even though we \nasked for evidence related to birth defects, we are not interested in \nfacing the consequences of that evidence.\n  I hope we do not make that mistake. I hope we do what we have done in \nevery one of these other cases. With respect to every one of these \ndiseases, we have acknowledged the connection, we have made the \ncommitment to our veterans experiencing these diseases. The time to do \nit for spina bifida is this morning, is today. Let us get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am really amazed to listen to the \ndebate across the aisle, and the fervor, really, the fervor about an \namendment which would actually end up saving a lot of money; a debate \nin which they are determined that these kids with spina bifida are not \ngoing to have any help. There is a real determination about this. This \nis not just a mild philosophical discussion. There is a sense of \noutrage that spina bifida kids could get this kind of help.\n\n  I find that interesting. Maybe they could get some help from the 15-\npercent tax cut. I don't know.\n  The Senator from Missouri used the phrase ``spinning out of control'' \nover costs that will come, in 1997, to $3.179 million for medical \ncare--spinning out of control. Actually, the Senator from Missouri said \n$14 million. He is wrong. It is $3.179 million for medical care. \nSpinning out of control.\n  This is very interesting. I say to my esteemed chairman that we have \nnever done anything on Gardner. He talked about correcting Gardner. He \nis wrong about that. We have never corrected Gardner. Some said it \ncould be done. It has not been done. That is a statement that is \ninaccurate, and my colleagues who are listening, and their staffs, I \nhope they will understand that.\n  The Senator from Missouri was talking about Gardner, using Gardner \nmoney to take away from veterans benefits. You cannot use Gardner money \nfor veterans benefits. Gardner money is not a cash benefit for \nveterans. It has only to do with potential Government liability. It is \nnot a source of funding for veterans benefits, another mistake by the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  ``Normal legislative process''--sacred all of a sudden--``normal \nlegislative process.'' Some of us feel very strongly about Persian Gulf \nwar veterans and some of the mysterious illnesses which are occurring \nin tens of thousands of people across this country. No, nobody has been \nable to really prove anything to this point, but there is no normal \nlegislative process.\n  In fact, there was no interest on the part of the majority in even \ntaking up this matter over the past 2 years in the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. This is a subject which has gotten a great deal of \nattention, but not in the Veterans' Committee.\n  I, in fact, as the ranking member, held--it was not even a hearing, \nit was kind of a meeting, about the Persian Gulf war illnesses--and was \nchewed out up and down for doing something that would never again be \nallowed in the Veterans' Committee, for trying to come to the rescue of \nPersian Gulf war veterans.\n  Incidentally, some of those veterans have kids who, in a sense, \nalthough the word ``entitlement'' is not exactly true, we have already \nestablished that the Department of Veterans Affairs will allow medical \nexaminations for the deformed children of some of these Persian Gulf \nwar veterans, and there are a lot of them. That has been established. \nThat is now being done. That is now in the law. They will be carefully \nexamined by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  But there is not any normal legislative process because there is no \ninterest. There is no interest in the deformed children. There is no \ninterest in these Persian Gulf war mystery illnesses, which are no \nmystery to me. I don't care if anybody has proved it. You cannot take a \n20-year-old, send him to the Persian Gulf, and do what they did over \nthere--which I will not get into now--and the Defense Department denied \nall of it until they had to admit that when they blew up a group of \nchemical bombs, maybe one of the divisions had been exposed a little \nbit. But that was just a minor thing, according to the Department of \nDefense, and they said if they had to do it all over again, they would \ndo it exactly the same way. That is what the head of health for the \nDepartment of Defense said, a very sensitive position.\n  So what the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Wyoming have \nto understand, which I thought they would, is that war has changed. We \nare not talking about missiles. We are not talking about neutron bombs. \nWe are not talking about hand-to-hand combat. We are not talking about \ntank warfare. We are talking about what started back in the First World \nWar with mustard gas, in a very small sense, and we were unprepared for \nthat. And then the atomic experimentation, which we carried out as a \ncountry, and we were unprepared for that. Thousands of soldiers were \nradiated, and the Government refused to do anything about it. It said, \n``You can't prove it.''\n\n  Then along comes agent orange. They say it is just incidental if you \nare\n\n[[Page S9885]]\n\ngetting cancer or anything of that sort. You happened to have been in \nVietnam in an agent-orange-exposed area. We do not seem to be able to \nshow that we can prove this is enough, although I think we could there. \nAdmiral Zumwalt, and a lot of other people, were pretty firm on that.\n  War is changing, and I hope the other side is noticing that. We are \ngetting into the century of toxins, of chemicals. We do not have the \nbig Russian bear anymore. We have the little horrendous dictators like \nSaddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi. They build their little bombs, and \ntheir little bombs are not filled with explosives, they are filled with \nchemicals and toxins that will destroy peoples' nervous systems.\n  ``Spinning out of control,'' ``normal legislative process,'' ``first \ntime we've ever had an entitlement''--the world is changing, I say to \nmy colleagues; war is changing, and it would be a good thing to take \nnotice of.\n  I would like to have a hearing on this subject, the changing nature \nof war, but we will not have one. We will not have one this month. We \nwill not have one next month if we are in session, I guarantee you \nthat, because the chairman will not do it. No, I am sorry, the Gardner \namendment was not corrected. And, yes, there are some of us over here \nwho do want to help children, some of us over here who do have a bias \ntoward children. If evidence is, by and large, 50-50, we will lean \ntoward the children, particularly in the case of spina bifida. All of \nthat, unfortunately, was just a prelude to my remarks. I felt a need to \nrespond.\n  Incidentally, if the Senator from Wyoming is so unhappy about the \nprecedent which was set in the agent orange decision by the Congress in \nthe Vietnam war, then why doesn't he introduce legislation to repeal \nit? He talks about it all the time. Why not then introduce legislation \nto repeal it and count the votes? If that was wrong, if the proof was \nnot sufficient, then introduce legislation to repeal it.\n  I applaud the Democratic leader and his amendment to provide help and \nmonetary support to veterans' children with spina bifida. I am going to \ntalk about it. This is a tragedy that cries out for normal legislative \nprocess, and if you can't get it, then faster action.\n  It also cries out for acceptance of Government responsibility. \nSpinning out of control--spinning out of control, $3 million in 1997 \nfor medical care for spina bifida children born to Vietnam veterans. I \nmean, you have about 1,500 to 4,000 of these spina bifida babies being \nborn each year, but the number is going down because of improved \nmaternal diet. It has been going down for the last decade.\n  There are many arguments against, as the Senator from Missouri \npointed out, amending an appropriations bill in this way. The minority \nleader made the same argument, and those are arguments I would be \ngenerally inclined to support. Being the junior Senator to the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, those are arguments I would almost be bound \nto support.\n  But here is one Senator from West Virginia who is willing to give a \ngreat deal of leeway and the benefit of the doubt when a compelling \nneed comes about, to meet our responsibility to a class in our society \ncalled children. That is what we are doing by this amendment of the \nminority leader.\n  A little background. Under the agent orange law that we enacted in \n1991, the Government assumed responsibility for health outcomes. If \nsomebody does not like it, repeal it if they can, but that is what we \ndid under the law. We assumed responsibility for health outcomes of \nthat particular war, the Vietnam war, where there was at least a \npositive association of the war with the disease.\n  That law required the VA to contract with the National Academy of \nSciences--and here we are doing the same thing on this. The National \nAcademy of Sciences was charged with reviewing ongoing research on \nillnesses resulting from agent orange exposure in Vietnam. I seriously \ndoubt there are many Senators on either side of the aisle who really \nquestioned whether there is a relationship between agent orange and \ncancer, and the other different perils that it caused.\n  In March of this year, the National Academy of Sciences found limited \nor suggestive evidence for connecting service in Vietnam with a number \nof additional diseases, including spina bifida, in children of those \nwho served in Vietnam. Creating a new entitlement for dependents? Yes. \nBecause when you get into this kind of toxic stuff, dependents are \naffected, like they were in the Persian Gulf war through the chemical \ncombinations and toxins that were used there. Dependents are affected. \nReproductive activities are affected. Women are affected. Kids are \naffected. Have you seen the pictures? Have you visited the kids? Has \nanybody on that side of the aisle visited the kids, visited the \nfamilies, talked with them? I do not know.\n  But this is extremely important. It is the National Academy of \nSciences that made this finding, Mr. President, not the Congress, not \nthe Veterans' Committee, not the House, not the Senate, not the \nPresident, not the VA. The National Academy of Sciences.\n  The President immediately established a task force within the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to make recommendations to him based \nupon what the NAS--the National Academy of Sciences--had reported. The \nVA task force recommended, among other things, the enactment of \nlegislation that is now provided by the Democratic leader's amendment. \nEverything sounds pretty much in order to me.\n  On May 28, President Clinton announced that the Government would meet \nits responsibility to the children of Vietnam veterans. We did it with \nagent orange. Nobody has tried to repeal that that I am aware of. Now \nwe have a new classification, new evidences, dependents, children \nshowing up with problems. And the President said that he would send the \nCongress legislation to take care of Vietnam veterans' children who \ndevelop spina bifida.\n  The decision for the Government to take responsibility for children \nof veterans exposed to these environmental hazards--toxic hazards of \nwar--is precedent setting. It surely is. It absolutely is, because the \nnature of war is changing. It is not without controversy, as is clear \non the floor this morning, but it is what I call a leadership decision. \nAnd I applaud the President for making that decision.\n  The hazards of war are changing. It is so obvious. It is so obvious, \nMr. President. It seems so obvious, but evidently it is not. Witness \nthe great difficulty that the Government has had in discovering the \ncauses of the vast array of illnesses that have followed service in the \nPersian Gulf war. The injuries of that war in the great majority of \ncases have not resulted, once again, from guns or missiles, but rather \nfrom environmental or other toxic exposures.\n  Once again, we have not had a chance to have a hearing on this. The \nnormal legislative process was not followed, which is the reason that \nthe minority leader and some of us have had to resort to approaches of \nthis sort. There are new types of dangers that our soldiers will \nincreasingly face in future conflicts. That is assured. That is why, as \nchair and now ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I \nmade and am making a significant effort to oversee the Government \nefforts regarding environmental exposures to our military men and \nwomen. And it has not been a pretty sight.\n\n  The Defense Department, in one of the greatest stonewalls of all \ntime, but in keeping with their record going all the way back to the \nFirst World War, denies any responsibility for anything happening to \nthe soldiers that they are responsible for.\n  Part of the bargain in the Vietnam war, and also the Persian Gulf \nwar--but here we are talking about Vietnam with these children--yes, \nthe soldiers, men and women, signed up and went over to serve, but it \nwas not part of the bargain that the children which they might have \nupon return from service, who might potentially be affected, would be \npart of this deal. These children were not sent to Vietnam. They did \nnot sign up for the risks of service. There seems to be benefit-of-the-\ndoubt type evidence that they were harmed, however.\n  So the question comes again, do we favor the $3 million expenditure \nin 1997 for medical care for the horrible consequences they suffered--\nor do we ignore them, ignore them because it is a new type of \nentitlement or it has not followed the legislative process? I mean, \nthis is a stunning difference between the two sides of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S9886]]\n\n  The question before us today is whether the Government owes \nresponsibility to children born to those who served in an earlier war, \nchildren born with a disabling condition called spina bifida. Now let \nus talk a little bit about the problem.\n  Mr. President, the problem can be immensely horrible, and it is in \nthe case of spina bifida. It is not brought on by any action by the \nchildren. It is not brought on by any action by the parents. These are \ntruly innocent victims. My colleagues may not want to hear some of the \nhorrendous problems these children face, but they are going to, because \nwe all need to understand a little bit about the nature of what is at \nstake here.\n  Spina bifida, SB, means ``split spine.'' It is a defect of the neural \ntube, the embryonic structure that evolves into the brain and the \nspinal cord. It results from the failure of the spine to close properly \nin the first month of pregnancy.\n  There are three types of spina bifida, the most common of which is \nocculta, which is not disabling and is not included in the amendment \nbefore us.\n  What is covered in the proposed amendment are the two much more \nsevere forms of spina bifida. In these forms, a cyst holding the spinal \ncord membranes, nerve roots of the spinal cord, or the cord itself, \nusually malformed, pokes through an open part of the spine; or there \nmay be, in fact, no cyst, but only a fully exposed section of the \nspinal cord and the nerves.\n  Affected babies are at a high risk of infection until the back is \nclosed surgically, and varying degrees of other problems remain even if \nthe surgery is successful. Estimates of the number of children born \nwith spina bifida range from 1,500 to 4,000 each year. As I indicated \nbefore, that number is going down as maternal diet and pregnancy \ntesting are improving. All of this has been declining over the last \ndecade.\n\n  The types of problems that these children develop vary, sometimes \nsignificantly, depending on the particular spinal nerves that are \ninvolved. But their conditions are serious, often severely disabling, \nand for all, lifelong. Curable? No. Lifelong? Yes.\n  Now, there are three primary areas of disabling function: The central \nnervous system, which is the brain and the spinal cord; the urologic \nsystem, which are the kidneys and the bladder; and the musculoskeletal \nsystem, which are the bones and muscles. Common primary medical \nproblems include hydrocephalus, which occurs when the cerebrospinal \nfluid is unable to drain normally and fluid collects around the brain, \nresulting in an enlarged head; serious bladder problems due to lack of \nmuscle control--urinary tract infections are very common, and kidney \nproblems can result; bowel control problems; orthopedic conditions, \nincluding partial or complete paralysis, depending on where the defect \nshows on the spinal cord; and a variety of problems involving \ndislocated joints, misshapen bones, bowed legs, and foot deformities.\n  It is not a lot of fun. It is also very common for these children to \ndevelop a whole host of secondary medical problems as a result of this, \nincluding obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, bone fractures, \nseizures, eye disorders--due to pressure on the optic nerve--and a \nlife-threatening latex allergy.\n  In addition, learning disabilities are a constant and lifelong \nreality for children with spina bifida. Now, remember, we have had \nlearning through the school systems as it has been over the past couple \nof centuries; and we are now, after the deregulation of the \ntelecommunication industry, entering into a whole new age where \nchildren are going to be expected to be able to handle much more \ncomplex learning procedures through computers and all the rest. So \nlearning disabilities are going to be a horrible, lifelong reality for \nchildren with spina bifida, as they already are. Poor short-term \nmemory, lack of organizational skills, lack of eye-hand coordination, \nneeds for special education and other kinds of support are common.\n  Finally, there are a plethora of social development and psychological \nproblems which plague these children for all their lives. Put yourself \nin the condition that I have just described for the last 7 or 8 \nminutes. I invite my colleagues to put their children in that \ncondition. We have all seen spina bifida kids. We all know what they \nlook like, what happens. We all know the love they get from their \nparents, but we all know what a fundamentally incurable, horrible \ncondition it is. I, as one Senator, want to say that I am willing to \ngive these children a huge benefit of the doubt as we did in the agent \norange bill.\n  I turn to the controversy of determining the cause of these problems. \nNow, looking at the science and the law, opponents of providing health \ncare to spina bifida children will honestly and genuinely argue that \nthe scientific evidence of the connection between service in Vietnam \nand spina bifida is either lacking or flawed, or both. And for sure, \nthere are those who argue against caring for any Vietnam veterans for \nagent orange exposure.\n  But, Mr. President, I believe we in Congress are particularly ill-\nsuited to be the determiners of what is and what is not ``good \nscience.'' Those are debates and discussions best left to the \nscientists themselves, not to politicians. But the determination is \ngreat to replace scientific review with political debate and bias.\n  The fact is that with only a few exceptions, the maladies previously \nidentified by the National Academy of Sciences as statistically \nconnected with service in Vietnam can also be statistically related to \nother causes, as well.\n  The scientific proof, as I understand it, is not an open-and-shut \ncase with regard to those earlier diseases and illness findings. I \nreadily acknowledge it is not an open-and-shut case regarding spina \nbifida.\n  However, Mr. President, this is, in fact, exactly what the 1991 agent \norange law intended. We, as a Nation, decided then that we would give \nthe benefit of the doubt to those who served our country in Vietnam. \nWhat we decided then was to task the NAS with the scientific \ndetermination as to the strength of the evidence of connection of a \ndisease or illness. No more and no less.\n\n  Based upon those NAS findings, we directed the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to make a determination of whether there was a ``positive \nassociation''--meaning at least 50 percent of the credible evidence \nsupported a conclusion that a health outcome was related to Vietnam \nservice. In fulfilling their job, the NAS established in 1993 four \ncategories of the association of health outcomes. The minority leader \nreferred to these. One, sufficient evidence of association. Two, \nlimited or suggestive evidence. Three, inadequate or insufficient \nevidence. Four, limited or suggested evidence of no association.\n  It was in the second category, ``limited or suggestive evidence,'' \nthat the NAS earlier this year placed spina bifida in its report--for \nthe first time. It is based upon this NAS finding that the VA task \nforce concluded there was sufficient evidence to establish a positive \nassociation of military service and spina bifida.\n  The question then becomes whether ``limited or suggested evidence of \nan association''--which the task force described as ``several studies \n[that] suggest apparent increases in risk in offspring of Vietnam \nveterans''--whether that is sufficient to support the Government's \nassuming financial responsibility.\n  That is an appropriate question for debate, but one we have already \nanswered in this body and in this Congress and in the law, by enactment \nof the 1991 agent orange law. What this amendment does today is fully \nin accordance with that law.\n  Now, the legislation proposed by the Democratic leader, and as \nsuggested by the Department of Veterans Affairs, would establish a \nhealth care program for children with spina bifida, and a three-tiered \ncompensation program paying either $200, $700, or $1,200 a month, \ndepending on the degree of disability. The compensation program would \nnot, as I understand it, entail new costs, since it is offset by \nsavings of other veterans' programs, and the health program's small \ncost would be absorbed in the VA medical care account.\n  Because no one knows for sure how many children will qualify for the \nhealth care or monetary benefits, the costs are uncertain. Estimates \nrange from 700 to 3,000 spina bifida children of a parent who served in \nVietnam and\n\n[[Page S9887]]\n\nwhere this positive association was established.\n  CBO has informally advised--and they speak for us--that about 2,785 \nchildren probably would be eligible to participate--2,785 children--at \na total cost of perhaps $4 million annually for health care. This is a \nreal, real, budget buster. This is, in fact, a very small amount of \nmoney, when one considers that lifetime health care costs for those who \nhave spina bifida range from $294,000--which comes from the Centers for \nDisease Control--to over $750,000--and that comes from the Spina Bifida \nAssociation--per child for comprehensive health care. But since many of \nthe health care costs are in the early years of life, and the proposed \namendment is not retroactive, the health care costs would be much, much \nless than these estimates.\n  The monetary portion of the benefit is intended to offset the varied \nexpenses that these children and their families face other than direct \nhealth care. One can well imagine that this would include such things \nas special education and training, lost wages or work limitations, or \nindependent living needs. It is not very hard to imagine that. Under \nthe Democratic leader's amendment, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nwould establish, by regulation, three levels of disability, \ncorresponding to the three tiers of payments intended to supplement \nother funds available to these children from either public or private \nsources.\n  Again, CBO estimates that the compensation and vocational costs of \nthe amendment would be fully offset and would, in fact, result in a net \nsavings of $4.2 million in 1997 and $525 million through 2002.\n  So I conclude, Mr. President, that the question we will answer today \nis whether we will honor the commitment we have often stated to our men \nand women in uniform. I am sure somebody will stand up and take that \none apart with all kinds of anger, rage, and whatever else. But that is \nwhat we have committed to do. That is the mission statement above the \ndoor at the Department of Veterans Affairs office building.\n  We are dealing with a new kind of precedent-setting entitlement, yes, \nbecause we have moved into a new era of warfare. I am sorry, but in the \nPersian Gulf, there are kids that are born with deformities. There is \nsomething called ``burning semen,'' what some Persian Gulf veterans' \nwives have called ``shooting fire,'' which nobody wants to talk about; \nwherein the soldier, be it a male, who served up front in the Persian \nGulf war, when he is having sexual relations with his wife and some \nsperm maybe hits her in the leg, an enormous red welt develops. We have \nnever had to talk about things like that before, but we do now because \nit is different now.\n  Some of these kids from the Persian Gulf war are being born deformed. \nHave we done anything to really help them? No. Has the Defense \nDepartment admitted anything is wrong whatsoever? No, of course not, \nnot since World War One have they ever done that.\n  Now we are dealing with spina bifida, coming from the Vietnam war. \nPositive association was established, leaning toward the child, toward \nthe veteran was established, by law, in 1991. So we will have this \nquestion answered today. There are those who want to go by normal \nlegislative procedure, which would not happen, and who are, for \nwhatever reason, incredibly reluctant to help children in a situation \nin which money would be saved by so doing.\n  Spina bifida is horrible. I repeat, it is horrible. My wife and I \nhave four children. None of them has that. I thank God that none of \nthem do. I am overwhelmed with caring. One man I met on the subway \nyesterday whose child has spina bifida talked to me about her. It has \nnothing to do with Vietnam, but he talked about just the problems of \nthat.\n  So I come very close to my ending here. In that 1991 law, Mr. \nPresident, we decided that the scientific test of our commitment would \nnot be a 100 percent, totally black or white, test of cause and effect. \nWe decided that as a matter of law. It was not intended to be an \nabsolute test of cause and effect. It was intentionally balanced in \nfavor of our soldiers, which now includes their offspring, because the \nworld and wars have changed.\n  Those we have directed to make these decisions now tell us that there \nis evidence--albeit limited or suggestive evidence--of the causal \nconnection for spina bifida in children and the service of their \nparents in Vietnam. As I understand it, the evidence is considered \nclose to a 50-50 proposition; that is, the causal connection is as \nlikely as not.\n  In such cases, I am totally comfortable with giving a strong \npresumption in favor of the children of American service members, at \nleast until such time as scientific evidence suggests a more positive \nassociation--or a less positive one, a negligible one, or a \nnonassociation.\n  This is not an area of absolutes. But if I am to err, Mr. President, \nas I often have and surely will in the future, I choose to err on the \nside of assuming a responsibility, of assuming a benefit of the doubt, \nof assuming the care of the children of the war.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I thank the \nSenator from West Virginia for his very personal, very eloquent, and \nvery powerful statement. The Senator from Wyoming, the chairman on this \ncommittee, has been gracious enough to let me speak.\n  Mr. President, I am proud and honored to be a cosponsor of this \nimportant and historic amendment introduced by the distinguished and \nable Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. This amendment would enable \nthe VA to extend health care and other benefits, including a monthly \nstipend, to Vietnam veterans' children suffering from spina bifida, a \nserious, disabling neural tube birth defect that requires lifelong \ncare.\n  While I recognize that this amendment is unprecedented in that it \nwould authorize the VA for the first time to provide health care and \nrelated benefits to children of veterans, there is no question in my \nmind that it is fully justified. The humane and courageous decision of \nthe President and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Brown to request that \nspina bifida in the offspring of Vietnam veterans be considered \nservice-connected was based on a National Academy of Sciences [NAS] \nstudy released in March 1996 that found evidence suggesting a link \nbetween veterans' exposure to agent orange and the occurrence of spina \nbifida in their children.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that NAS used the same \nscientific criteria to conclude that there is a credible link between \nparental exposure to agent orange and the occurrence of spina bifida in \ntheir offspring as it had previously used in a 1993 NAS study that \nfound a connection between veterans' exposure to agent orange and the \nincidence of respiratory cancers and multiple myeloma. Since Vietnam \nveterans suffering from these diseases already are receiving VA \nbenefits based on the NAS findings and a subsequent determination that \nthese conditions are presumptively service-connected, it is only fair \nthat spina bifida-afflicted children of Vietnam veterans should also be \nprovided with appropriate VA benefits.\n  Moreover, I would like to underscore the fact that both the 1993 and \n1996 NAS studies were mandated by the Agent Orange Act of 1991, which \npassed the Senate 99 to 0. That act also stipulated that reproductive \ndisorders and birth defects must be accorded special attention to \nascertain whether or not compensation is warranted. The 1996 NAS report \nleaves little doubt about the wisdom of focusing on birth defects and \nthat at least for the innocent and tragic victims of spina bifida there \nis little doubt that compensation is warranted.\n  Vietnam veterans have long been concerned that their military service \njeopardized the health of their children and some of their worst fears \nnow appear to have been confirmed. Some of the children of American \nsoldiers exposed to agent orange are now paying a terrible price. \nMoreover, the cost of caring for a child with spina bifida can \ndevastate a family financially. There is no question that the Federal \nGovernment has a moral responsibility to help veterans whose children \nsuffer from spina bifida meet their children's health care and other \nspecial needs.\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\nThese children are innocent victims of the Vietnam war. The least we \ncan do is to provide them with the benefits they need and clearly \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, again, I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthis amendment. I count as one of my blessings all of the teaching that \nthe Vietnam vets, and really the veterans community, have done in \nMinnesota. They have really been my teachers. I want to say that I have \nimmersed myself in issues important to them. I have tried to do my very \nbest. I am really proud of a lot of my work, in the main, not because \nof me, but because----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that he might \nneed to adjust his microphone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The microphone seems to be going on and off. Let me \ntry this. Can the Chair hear me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe that this amendment is very \nimportant. Again, it comes from work with Vietnam vets and their \nfamilies and others in the veterans community.\n  I thank Secretary Brown for his humane recommendation that spina \nbifida in the offspring of Vietnam vets be considered service \nconnected. I know it is based on the National Academy of Sciences \nstudy.\n  Mr. President, if you think about it, these children really are \ninnocent victims of the Vietnam war. If I had to err, I would rather \nerr on this side. I do not believe this is a huge appropriation of \nresources. I believe this is the right thing for us to do.\n  I think, at least to me--sometimes I do not feel like people in our \ncountry realize this--it has been amazing how many veterans and their \nfamilies fall between the cracks and still do not get the kind of \nhealth care that they truly deserve. In this particular case there are \njust too many families who have this struggle, too many children of \nVietnam vets, too many children, I say again, who are innocent victims \nof this war, too many children who need our help, and I think this \namendment is a very important step in the direction of providing \nassistance to families, to Vietnam vets, and to the children of Vietnam \nvets. I believe that this help is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I have met too many Vietnam vets who have struggled--\nsome of whom have died--because of exposure to agent orange. It is, I \nthink, the least we can do to provide this assistance to their \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues on both sides will give \nthis amendment introduced by the minority leader very strong support. I \nknow in very good faith my friend--I consider Senator Simpson really to \nbe a friend, somebody for whom I have tremendous respect--is in \ndisagreement. But from my own heart, I think it is the right thing to \ndo. I think we can help children. I think we can help families. I think \nit is part of our commitment to Vietnam vets. I think they deserve the \nassistance.\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota. I have \nworked with him on various issues having to do with Parkinson's \ndisease, mental health, and veterans' issues. He is a member of the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee. I have come to very much appreciate \nthe things he has debated, and to have a better understanding of him \nthroughout. I think respect for each other is what the Senate is about. \nWe can have serious partisan differences. Senator Rockefeller and I \nhave more serious partisan differences than most two people on the \nfloor. But that need not interfere with our ability to legislate.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, again I want to commend Senator Bond for his work. He \nhas done yeoman work on this issue. Senator Daschle, as I say, and I \nhave been batting this one around longer than you would believe because \nSenator Daschle believes deeply that, whether we are going to find \nanything or not, we must keep looking for something with regard to a \nlinkage of dioxin and disease. I wish it were that easy. It is not.\n  In the beginning of my remarks I stated that if there was something \nthere before to establish such a link, there would have been a lot of \nplaintiffs who would have never settled the case when they were having \na great old time suing everybody that ever introduced herbicides \ncontaining dioxin. You may be assured of that. Attorneys in the class \naction would have never turned around and gone backward if they had \nknown there was any possible way to prove this tie because it would be \njackpot day for trial attorneys on that one, and the jackpot day did \nnot come. Such a link has not been proven, and the only group that has \nany credibility in this about exposure is the Ranch Hand study.\n  So no wonder the proponents of the amendment say ignore the Ranch \nHand study when it does not support their cause. Those were the people \nwho bathed in it, put it in the barrels, unloaded it, kicked it out of \nthe aircraft, and there is no more serious difficulty with that cohort \nof people than with people who were nonveterans and not in Vietnam. I \ndo not know how many times we have to say that. There have been no \nincrease in birth defects in that group.\n\n  Again, the Ranch Hand study is the people most exposed. But there is \none thing, or two or three things that I would like to say in response \nto my friend from West Virginia. The Senator from West Virginia and the \nSenator from South Dakota keep saying to us in a litany, a mantra, that \nthe NAS study shows that 50 percent of the studies show an association \nand 50 percent of them do not show an association. That is not so, my \ncolleagues. All of the studies examined for the first report of the \nInstitute of Medicine in 1993 were deemed not to have sufficient \nevidence to show an association with birth defects. All of them for \n1993. After 1993, one new study was put forward by the NAS--the Ranch \nHand study. Proponents have grasped the NAS classification of this \nstudy as having limited/suggestive value as a proof of association. But \nthat study, according to its own principal investigator, who testified \nat a hearing in the House, shows no association whatsoever.\n  The other disturbing thing to me is that we continue to hear the use \nof ``emotion, fear, guilt,'' suggesting that somehow we don't want to \ndo something for these children. This is a horrible disease. To me it \nis more than talk. I have been involved in fundraising for spina \nbifida. I have been out there raising money for this disease in \ntributes to others where I participated for fundraising activities long \nbefore this issue ever came before this body. I do not need anyone to \ncheck my credentials on how I care about these people. It is a horrible \ndisease. It is not even worth talking about in trying to say that \nsomehow those who are opposed to this amendment are less caring or are \npoised to do ugly things to the most fragile in our society. I am \ndisgusted by that kind of argument. You can go ahead and continue to \nmake it, and I will continue to be disgusted by it. That type of \noutrage is the type of debate that is presented. We are not talking \nabout a 15-percent tax cut. We are not talking about partisanship. In \nmy experience there are many partisans in this body, but the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is one of the best. I do it, too. But this does not \nhave anything to do with who cares for children. It does not have \nanything to do with who values the kids. It does not have anything to \ndo with who cares more. We all care just as much for our fellow human \nbeings as anyone from West Virginia or Wyoming or New York. We are all \nhere as caring individuals.\n  So the continuing use of ``emotion, fear, guilt'' is not attractive \nto this Senator. Every one of us knows the problems of spina bifida. \nEvery single one of us should, or certainly will, after this debate.\n  Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, we do a lot for the people \nwith spina bifida. Maybe the VA does not do anything for people with \nspina bifida, but the Government does. So how many duplicative programs \nare you going to have, or are you just going to have an appeal to \nemotion and then a press release about what you did for veterans? I am \na veteran. I am very proud to be a veteran. Some of the most \nunbelievable arguments on the other side--I am not relating this to the \nSenator from West Virginia or the Senator from South Dakota--come\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\nfrom the people who have not even been in the Civil Air Patrol. I must \nsay I get a belly full of that one, too.\n  Let us tell our colleagues what we do for people in this kind of \nhorrible extremity. Anyone under 21 falls under the Early Periodic \nScreening and Diagnostic Testing Program, the EPSD Program of Medicare, \nfor those in extremity, the horror stories, the wretched, the beat up, \nthe people we hear talked about here as if only some of us cared about \nthose people. Under Medicaid, this program provides for everything that \na medical professional deems necessary for treatment and \nrehabilitation--everything. When the child reaches 21, then the State \ndetermines what will be covered above and beyond the Federal minimum \nstandards. Those standards are inpatient, outpatient, nursing home, \nhome health aid, drugs, x rays, medical doctors, nurse practitioner \nvisits, and dental. All of that is provided to people who are in need \nas a result of the disease, the horrible disease of spina \nbifida. Therefore, this amendment is redundant, but that fact is never \nmentioned.\n\n  And then there is a final point which nobody seems to pick up, but I \nhave to keep throwing it out. The Shriners--the Ancient Order of Nobles \nof the Mystic Shrine--is a Masonic organization, and even though these \norganizations are sometimes held in some different lights than they \nwere 50 years ago, let me tell you what the Shriners do, ladies and \ngentlemen. They have a string of hospitals that are solely for crippled \nchildren. And do you know what? They will provide free care for every \nsingle child with spina bifida in the United States, period. No \nGovernment bucks. No grants. No nothing. This is their job, to provide \nthis care for people who cannot afford to do anything and to do it free \nof charge, no questions asked. And they want me to express that to my \ncolleagues one more time. That point apparently has not been heard in \nthis debate, and is often shuffled to the bottom.\n  There are people who do things in America because they love other \npeople and not because they love them more. Because we all are that \nway. We are a compassionate nation. I do not know anybody in this body, \nDemocrat or Republican, who sits around at night figuring out how to do \nless for children, do less for seniors, do less for the disenfranchised \nor the powerless or the minorities in our country. I do not know \nanybody. That is ugly, ugly stuff that does not fit. It does not fit.\n  Now, there was a comment earlier that if we are upset about the agent \norange legislation, we should repeal it. No way. I would not repeal it. \nIt gave the NAS some excellent direction. I voted for it. \nUnfortunately, in this case it did not fulfill its promise. \nUnfortunately emotion and fear and guilt overwhelmed sound medicine and \nscience one more time.\n  There was comment that there had been no interest in Persian Gulf \ninjuries and on activities relating to that war. That is not so. That \nis in total error. With me as chairman of the committee and Senator \nRockefeller as ranking member, we have not maybe legislated on the \nthings that he would have legislated if he were chairman, but that is \ncalled seniority and it is called who is in charge. If that changes \nnext time, I am certain that I will not be present for the activity, \nbut if my friend from West Virginia is chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, he will have a whole new agenda and a busy one at \nthat. But I can tell you the Congress has legislated--oh, we have, \nindeed--with the Persian Gulf. We have enacted benefits upon benefits. \nWe have enacted health care. We have enacted research and all of those \nprograms are now on the books, ongoing, and you cannot say that this \nCongress or this chairman has not been vitally involved in the process. \nWe have done what we had to do.\n  Now, we have another little item which has come to the attention of \nall of us, I hope, a letter dated August 29 received September 3 with \nthe yearly progress report of the ongoing Ranch-Hand study. It went to \nthe committee, but I think it should be in your hands and we will see \nthat it is in the hands of the Members before the vote. You want to \nlook at it if you can cut through the emotion, the fear and the stuff \nthat goes with this issue. As I say, I have been here 18 years, and it \nis tough enough when you mention the word ``veteran,'' but when you \nmention the word ``veteran'' and ``innocent disabled children,'' then \nthe engines are fully cranked. But there is not any way to pay for this \none if we have to go back to reconciliation and redo our work. And I \nwant every single sponsor of this amendment to tell me where we should \nget the money if we lose the money that we had in here for \nreconciliation because of the use of the Gardner decision here. I \nreally want to hear that. Maybe you could give me book, page, and hymn \nnumber as to where you are going to get the scratch to do this and pay \nfor 214 million bucks over 6 years.\n  But let us get back to the real issue raised by the legislation that \nI voted for and very proudly too. That legislation was filled with \nlanguage that talked about:\n\n       Sound medical and scientific evidence. . . . \n     Scientific evidence and reasoning. . . . Statistical \n     association. . . . Strength of the evidence. . . . The \n     increased risk of the disease. . . . The plausible \n     biological mechanisms. . . . The causal relationships.\n\n  This is the language of the bill.\n\n       All other sound medical and scientific information. . . . \n     Statistically significant. . . . Capable of replication. . . \n     . Withstand peer review.\n\n  They did not do any of that here. None of it. None of it. I think \nthat there may have been simply a professional lapse by NAS in a very \ncomplicated task which they clearly took very seriously, and I do not \ndenigrate that in any way. But I can tell you what the law says. I can \nread that very clearly.\n  But in the Ranch-Hand study update that we just received, and which \nwill be on your desks, listen to this sentence:\n\n       The data provides little or no support for the theory that \n     paternal exposure to Agent Orange and its dioxin containment \n     is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes.\n\n  That is in pretty good English. What it really means is they did not \nfind a thing in the Ranch Hand study, not a thing that would cause an \nadverse reproductive outcome. Those are the Ranch-Hand persons. They \nkeep saying, look at the Ranch-Hand study because the Ranch-Hand study \nwas the guys that took the real hits. But the Ranch Hand study found \nthere is no real difference of any statistical order.\n  Then remember what we have done for these veterans who think that \ndioxin may have been the cause of their diseases. We have provided \nservice upon service upon service to them. When I came here, we were \nproviding $20 billion for veterans and today it is $40 billion, and \nthere are 3 million fewer veterans. To have somebody say to me that we \ndo not provide for our veterans is just not so. So I hope that you will \nlook at your report from the Ranch-Hand study. I think it would be \nimportant.\n  And let me just say that I have set a hearing for this, and the \nreason I set a hearing is because a bill came in. And I guess the \nreason the bill came in is because of frustration. But you cannot have \na hearing based on frustration. The bill came in July 29. Then we left \nhere. So I set a hearing for September 18 and was ready to go ahead \nwith it but the ranking member told me he cannot be here then. My \nfriend from West Virginia could not be here for that date. So I said \nwe'll set another date.\n  So to say that I am not receptive and helpful and cooperative is just \nnot so.\n  We have had the normal legislative process. It is called a bill is \n``considered.'' We could get that chart that they hand out to the \nschool kids. You put in a bill and it is referred to a committee. Then \nyou have hearings. However, we have had nothing on this measure--\nnothing. I will have that hearing and it will be done at a time \nmutually convenient with my friend from West Virginia. To think the \nstatement is made we are not interested in taking up the issue and that \nwe have ignored, or not paid proper attention to the Persian Gulf \nveterans--it is not so. And that we have no interest in children--boy, \nthat one has to go somewhere else for some other debate.\n  So, we will have the hearing. Hopefully, it will match the time of my \ncolleague, my good friend from West Virginia. I tried to accommodate \nhim. If I cannot, I am going to have the hearing anyway. In fact, there \ncame a time a few months ago where he had a hearing. He just called it. \nSo I showed up. I thought that would be interesting, that I might join \nin the fun.\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\n  So those are things that happen when you have the type of activity \nwhere you have a breakdown in staff, which happens here often--\njealousies, pettiness, all the things which go with the human condition \nhere as well as out in the local community. We do not do things any \ndifferently here than you do in your hometown. I have often said, \npeople who are looking to us for perfection are often people who do not \nhave any perfection in their own lives, so they try to say, ``You do \nit. Mine is a mess, so we expect perfection out of you.'' They will \nnever get perfection out of here, and that is the joy of legislating \nand that is why the country works.\n  I am willing to give children the benefit of the doubt. Who is not? I \nam willing to give veterans the benefit of the doubt. Who is not? Who \nhas not? For Heaven's sake, yes, Congress is poorly suited to evaluate \nwhat is good science. But scientists are not, and that is why we should \nleave it with them. With only a few exceptions, this is surely an \nextraordinary venture for us, to open a new entitlement program at a \ntime when everybody in this country knows that the entitlements are \nsimply sucking us away. When you provide this kind of thing for people, \nlike you do with any other entitlement, it is automatic. And it has to \nbe paid. If you do not pay it, you get sued by the recipient.\n  So we do nothing about entitlements, and there will be nothing done \nbetween now and November 5, in this country, by any of us here or by \neither Presidential candidate that will have a single thing to do with \nthe one thing that is just draining the core out of America, and that \nis Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Federal retirement, and \ninterest on the national debt. And the saddest irony is those who talk \nall day long about the kids and the veterans and all the rest will \nfind, in the year 2012, according to the bipartisan committee report of \nSenator Kerrey and Senator Danforth, there will be nothing left for \ntransportation, education, defense or any other thing--WIC, WIN, Head \nStart or any other thing you want or really lust for or must have, \nbecause all the resources will have been used by those five items I \njust described: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Federal \nretirement, interest on the national debt. That is your legacy.\n  Then what will we do with the poor? The kids? The veterans? You tell \nme. Because we cannot even stop the COLA. We cannot even cut down a \ncost-of-living-allowance for a senior citizen who lives in Sun City \nwith a cabin in the mountains and a couple of homes and a couple of \ncars. We cannot even get the COLA reduced for those people. We cannot \neven ``affluence test\" them, because it is a violation of America.\n  I will be waiting for that debate. I shall report on it from the \nbanks of the Ishawooa Creek, and the Bobcat Ranch, southwest of Cody, \nWY--when I finish alerting the young people as to what is going to \nhappen to them, that is.\n  That is why I wear this tie. This is for young people. A young man \ncame up the other day. He was 18. He had his hat on backward, kind of a \nmouth-breathing exercise. He said, ``What is going to happen to us? Who \nspeaks for us?''\n\n  ``Well,'' I said, ``why don't you speak for yourselves? We gave you \nthe right to vote and only 15 percent of you use it. Don't come \nwhimpering around to me.'' He said, ``OK.'' So then he put his cap on \ncorrectly and went, breathing the vapors, in the other direction. That \nis why I wear this tie. Because I tell people between 18 and 40, this \ntie, with chickens on it, if they do not get off their fannies and do \nsomething about it, they will be picking grit with the chickens when \nthey are 65.\n  We will see how that works. I intend to get involved with groups, \nyoung, third millennium, and others, because if you really, really care \nabout the poor and the disenfranchised and the seniors and the \nveterans, then get off your fanny and do something with the issues that \nare eating our lunch instead of just tapping around the edges, fearful \nof what may happen if you act.\n  Well, as I say, it is very difficult to enter a debate like this \nbecause there are some words that lead to immediate emotion and the \nvoting of taxpayer money without any further thought when they are \nuttered within this Chamber. Those words include ``veterans,'' and \n``innocent disabled children.'' Now there is a way to combine them in \none amendment. If this amendment is to be decided on the basis of the \nemotions evoked by these words, we can cease right here and save the \nSenate's time. And it is too bad there is not a time agreement on this \namendment. My remarks, I told them, would be about 30 minutes, because \nI have a hunch there will be a lot of people who will come in here. \nMaybe not. But, if the Senate is actually willing to look at this issue \nclosely and honestly, and with absolute facts, then there are issues \nthat must be raised.\n  First of all is the fact that this amendment, to an appropriations \nbill, mind you, would create a brandnew program with brandnew benefits \nfor a new population of previously unserved beneficiaries. Whatever the \nmerits of the proposal, it is clearly an attempt to enact authorizing \nlegislation on an appropriations bill and is, therefore, out of order. \nI think that will be presented by my friend from Missouri. I will not \nbe so bold as to suggest this amendment would be the first time the \nSenate has approved authorizing legislation on an appropriations bill, \nbut we should ask ourselves if this is the proper legislative process \nfor creating new entitlements.\n  If it is, then, I earnestly suggest the Senate would consider \neliminating the authorizing committees altogether. We would save the \ntaxpayers the cost of funding committee operations and save our \ncolleagues the time and effort that we know takes place as we do our \nwork, in what is oftentimes a tedious process.\n  I can understand how, in some cases, a Senator might want to \ncircumvent the committee process, bring an amendment directly to the \nfloor of the Senate. He might do so in absolute frustration. I \nunderstand that one. That is, if an authorizing committee bottled up an \nimportant measure, never giving it a hearing, never giving proponents a \nchance to make their case. But, if this proposal has never seen the \nlight of day, if it has never been debated, if Senators with an \ninterest in the issue have never had a chance to even listen to or \nparticipate in a discussion on the merits of the proposal, the fault \ncannot be with the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The bill was \nintroduced July 29. As I say, within days of introduction we recessed \nto allow the Presidential nominating conventions to take place. Now, \nhaving returned with bags hardly unpacked, we find before us an \namendment creating a huge precedent-setting new entitlement. If this \nproposal has never seen the light of day, it is not because it has been \nforgotten in some committee's ``hold'' box. This amendment has not seen \nthe legislative light of day because not enough time has elapsed for \nthe legislative sun to even rise.\n  This amendment creates a new entitlement and the constraints of the \nBudget Act apply. I note the amendment's budget neutrality is obtained \nby reversing the Supreme Court's Gardner decision. I mentioned that \nbefore. That may seem like esoterica of the first order to you, but, \nwithout going into detail, that decision expanded an existing veterans' \nbenefit in a way that was never intended by the Congress.\n  But I also note the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution, which is \nstill in effect, includes savings from the reversal in Gardner and the \nassumptions behind the reconciliation instructions for the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs. That is what it is. The savings from reversing \nGardner are the foundation of the veterans committee bill that we will \nreport out, if we are called upon to achieve $5.271 billion in 6 years \nsavings needed to comply with the budget resolution.\n  If those savings are used instead to pay for this bill, they will not \nbe available to the committee. That means we would have to do something \nelse to reduce veterans' benefits.\n  The amendment's use of Gardner savings is not an offset, I say to my \ncolleagues. It merely shifts the responsibility of finding an offset \noff the back of the amendment and into the lap of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. Period.\n  Costs of the amendment will not be borne by some abstract bookkeeping \naccount. The costs will be borne by yet unidentified beneficiaries of \nwhatever program the Veterans' Committee is\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\nforced to attack to compensate for this amendment's use of Gardner's \nappeal.\n  All the groups are not for this amendment. I have heard nothing from \nthe DAV, the Disabled American Veterans. You would think you would hear \nfrom them. You know what they are thinking: This is going to take money \naway from disabled veterans to give to dependents of veterans. We have \nnever done that with this kind of an entitlement, ever. They know that.\n  So do the Paralyzed Veterans of America. You have not seen anything \nfrom them. They do not dare speak out, but they are not aboard here in \nthe letters of support, because they know there will be one population \nthat will really be hammered in this process, and that is those who are \ndisabled; veterans who are disabled, not the children of veterans who \nare disabled.\n  This amendment is rooted in a study did not prove anything and whose \nsignificance is reduced by confusion and bias and confounding.\n  This amendment is wholly premature. Yes, the administration has \nproposed legislation on this subject. That was received July 25 when it \nwas slipped under the Veterans' Committee door. So, there was not much \nopportunity to look at this one.\n  I think we should have more than 4 or 5 legislative days in the light \nof day before reaching the Senate floor. But the objections to this \namendment are not limited to procedural questions of jurisdiction and \nprocess.\n  I also believe the amendment is fundamentally flawed on the merits. \nSure, there are a lot of unresolved questions to be resolved in a calm \nand reflective manner before the Senate goes forward with such an \nexpensive and expansive program, but the amendment hangs or predicates \nitself on several assumptions.\n  First is that exposure to herbicide causes spina bifida, a serious \ndefect in the exposed father's children.\n  Second, that Vietnam veterans were, in fact, exposed, and every \nsingle link in that chain of reasoning is subject to dispute. This is \nthe kind of thing that is best resolved through the complete \nlegislative process: introduce the bill, solicit evidence, comments, \nhold hearings, seek review of experts and interested parties on both \nsides, hold a markup, consider amendments, and then bring the bill to \nthe floor.\n  This amendment has short circuited that process. That is what we do \nhere, and as a legislator who has been doing this stuff for 30 years, \nwho appreciates beautifully the wisdom of the legislative process, I am \ngreatly saddened by that. In 30 years, I have never been an \nadministrator, never wanted to be President, never wanted to do \nanything but legislate. If you are doing it right, it is very dry work. \nIt is not about emotion, it is not about press releases; it is about \nhard work. But I can't change that.\n  We will have to compress the entire legislative process into a few \nminutes, so here it is. Here we go. It will not take long.\n  Does a father's exposure to herbicides cause spina bifida in his \nchildren? There is very little evidence to support that assertion even \nthough, as a result of all the furor over the years surrounding agent \norange, the bookshelves have literally groaned under the weight of \nstudies of the health effects of herbicides, but few, if any, of those \nstudies have ever pointed to spina bifida.\n  Were Vietnam veterans generally exposed to a material amount of agent \norange? Whatever evidence, or lack of evidence, for association between \nexposure and disease, the only actual empirical evidence of exposure \nthat is available to us does not support the theory that Vietnam \nveterans were generally exposed to agent orange.\n\n  Look at these charts--two of them--which depict measured blood dioxin \nlevels found in two population samples. This upper chart shows a level \nfound in a sample of 646 Vietnam veterans. The lower chart shows the \nlevels found in a control group of 97 veterans who did not serve in \nVietnam.\n  In each case, the vertical scale is the percentage of the sample \npopulation; the horizontal scale is the specific dioxin, TCDD, measured \nin parts per trillion, ppt.\n  In both groups, veterans who served in Vietnam and veterans who did \nnot serve in Vietnam, the percentage of subjects begins to rise at a \nmeasured dioxin level of 2 ppt, peaks at about 3 and tails off into \nscattered individuals--that is what these symbols are, individuals, not \ngroups--at about 10 parts per trillion.\n  By the way, these levels are consistent with measured blood dioxin \nlevels for the general American population, which are in the same range \nof 0 to 20 parts per trillion.\n  So there it is. ``ND'' means nondetectable. Then you see this rise, \nthen down, and after that, there is no effect at all up into 20 parts \nper trillion--nothing. This is the veteran population who were in \nVietnam, and this is non-Vietnam veterans, and the charts are exactly \nthe same--exactly the same. That is the kind of data you never consider \nwhen you are just using emotion. Those are studies from the CDC.\n  In short, based upon those samples, Vietnam and non-Vietnam veterans \ncannot be distinguished from each other on the basis of the measured \ndioxin levels in their blood, and neither group can be distinguished \nfrom the American population.\n  So the only evidence available to us, based on measured blood levels \nof dioxin in veterans, is not consistent with the hypothesis that \nservice in Vietnam exposed most veterans to material amounts of agent \norange.\n  Yes, I know, that is difficult. I am sure someone will be coming here \nto get in the fray, and I will be waiting for that.\n  Let me show you a second chart showing measured dioxin levels in \nseveral different populations. This chart depicts blood dioxin levels \nof numerous populations and compares the level found in Vietnam \nveterans, presumed to be exposed, with the levels found in populations \nknown--known--to have been exposed.\n  So let's look at that. We are not guessing here. We are going to talk \nabout populations known to be exposed. The horizontal scale is blood \ndioxin levels in parts per trillion. The top group depicts the measured \nblood dioxin levels for Vietnam ground troops with high, low, and \nmedium opportunities for exposure, as well as the measured level of the \ncontrol group known not to have been exposed.\n  All these groups have identical, and low, levels of blood dioxin. \nThat finding is consistent with the hypothesis that Vietnam veterans do \nnot have material exposure to agent orange. The level for the control \ngroup and the exposed group are the same. Let's go to the next little \nchart. We find a group of bars down there depicting the measured dioxin \nlevels in a control group and in four categories of the Ranch Handers. \nNow Ranch Handers, a cohort of about 2,700 people, if I recall, 2,300, \nare the Air Force personnel who did the actual agent orange spraying.\n  Of course, that would be the group we used in our studies. And why \nnot? We knew what they were doing. I point out that you should know \nwhat they were doing. They were mixing it, loading it, labeling it, \nspraying it, kicking it out of the helicopters with an open lid, and \ncleaning it up. That is who they are.\n  For the control group and the Ranch Hand officers the measured blood \ndioxin levels are rather low. And their level is about equal to the \nlevel found in the ground troops. But the levels for the enlisted Ranch \nHand personnel are elevated, a finding which you would expect for \npeople who actually mixed, loaded, sprayed and cleaned up the agent \norange.\n  A little lower on the chart we find the third grouping of measured \nblood dioxin levels. These are levels measured in workers with known \noccupational exposures to dioxin. They are measurements for a group of \nGerman industrial workers and New Zealand agricultural sprayers. Then \nthere are the levels found in the most exposed quintile, as the phrase \nis used in graphs, of an occupational study conducted by the U.S. \nNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. That study broke \nits subjects down into five quintiles with progressively greater \nopportunity for exposure.\n  The measured blood dioxin level increases proportionately with \nexposure, as one would expect. Except for the lowest exposure NIOSH \ngroup, that is the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health \nsubjects, all occupationally exposed groups have measured blood dioxin \nlevels higher than both Ranch Handers and Vietnam veterans.\n\n[[Page S9892]]\n\n  Then finally--and you have heard mention of this extraordinary \ndisaster--the bottom bar shows the measured blood dioxin levels for \nresidents of Seveso, Italy, a town heavily exposed to dioxin as a \nresult of a horrible accident where they were exposed to dioxin as a \nresult of an industrial accident.\n  The chart shows that the blood levels for Seveso residents who \ndeveloped chloracne, which is a known effect of dioxin--no one argues \nthat--are higher than the blood levels of those who did not. And we \nwould certainly expect that. I ask my colleagues to note that the scale \nof this chart is exponential above 100 parts per trillion--off the \nchart, if you will. And the chart documents the fact that Seveso \nresidents have measured dioxin blood levels which are thousands of \ntimes higher than that found in any Vietnam veterans, Ranch Handers or \nnon-Ranch-Handers.\n  And this is the reason for the chart. All of the followup studies of \nthe individuals whose blood serum dioxin level are documented on the \nchart do not report any increased rates of spina bifida in the children \nof these heavily exposed individuals. Remember that these are people, \nindividuals with documented heavy exposure to dioxin. In the case of \nthe Seveso residents with chloracne, the measured blood dioxin levels \nare over 10,000 times greater than that for Vietnam veterans.\n  If spina bifida were associated with exposure, we would find \nincreased rates of spina bifida in these populations. And there is \nnone. And the greatest increases would be in the population with the \nhighest measured blood dioxin levels. And there are none.\n  In fact, the only group with any increase in the rate for spina \nbifida is in the Ranch Hand group. And as we will see, the principal \ninvestigator of the Ranch Hand study has testified before this Congress \nthat limitations in that study mean that this finding should not be \nused to draw conclusions about birth defects. That is what the \nprincipal investigator said. That testimony I will be glad to present \nto my colleagues.\n  The documented higher dioxin levels for enlisted Ranch Handers--\ncompared to other Vietnam veterans--also means that even if someday \nthere were to be a valid study showing adverse effects in these Ranch \nHanders, those conclusions may not be applicable to the Vietnam \npopulation as a whole.\n  This would be especially true if the proposed application of such a \nstudy would be to support the creation of a new entitlement applicable \nto all Vietnam veterans. I noted earlier, the Ranch Hand study is not \nsuch a study according to its principal investigator.\n\n  So both of those charts are based on actual measurements. Both are \ntaken from the 1996 update of the Institute of Medicine, the IOM, agent \norange report. I will be glad to share this with anyone who may wish to \nhave it. This update is the foundation for both Secretary Brown's \nprostate cancer decision and Senator Daschle's spina bifida amendment. \nAnd where did they come from? They originated with the CDC and they \ncame from the IOM, the Institute of Medicine. This is the same report \nthat has been relied upon by the very capable minority leader. We are \nusing this same thing.\n  In enacting the old Public Law 102-4, which I was involved in, the \nCongress enacted a three-part standard for determining if there was an \n``association.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that portion of the statute be \nprinted in the Record. I have previously spoken about it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (d) Scientific Determinations Concerning Disease.--(1) For \n     each disease reviewed, the Academy shall determine (to the \n     extent that available scientific data permit meaningful \n     determinations)--\n       (A) whether a statistical association with herbicide \n     exposure exists, taking into account the strength of the \n     scientific evidence and the appropriateness of the \n     statistical and epidemiological methods used to detect the \n     association;\n       (B) the increased risk of the disease among those exposed \n     to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam \n     during the Vietnam era; and\n       (C) whether there exists a plausible biological mechanism \n     or other evidence of a causal relationship between herbicide \n     exposure and the disease.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The statute talked about statistical association, \nincreased risk and casual relationship. So that is where we are. The \nIOM, the Institute of Medicine, said there is ``limited suggestive \nevidence'' of an association between exposure of a father and spina \nbifida. That is largely based on the Air Force Ranch Hand study. The \nstudy found that three Ranch Hand children were born with spina bifida.\n  Do not stop there. The same study also found that the total rate for \nbirth defects in Ranch Handers is comparable to that of the control \ngroup. How is that possible? Well, it is quite logical, because when \nstatisticians break aggregate or average data down into its component \nparts, individual values start to spread out away from the norm. So it \nis with the Ranch Hand children.\n  For example, while the Ranch Hand spina bifida value is high, the \nRanch Hand cleft palate value is low--zero in fact. The low value for \ncleft palate does not mean that agent orange prevents cleft palate any \nmore than the high value for spina bifida means that agent orange \ncauses that birth defect or even there is an association between the \ntwo.\n  I remember an old phrase that said, ``If you torture data long enough \nwith statistics, they will eventually confess.'' And that is what has \nhappened here. If you torture data long enough with statistics, \neventually it will confess.\n  One other thing with a thought experiment. I think I will shorten my \nremarks in the interest of moving on through this day. But we could go \non and make all sorts of comparisons about the health of the House \nMembers and the Senate Members and whether they have this or have that. \nWe could all find that they have more kidney disease, more heart \ndisease in one body or another, and you could play with that stuff all \nday and all night. You are going to find those differences. But we are \ntrying to use sound medical and scientific evidence because that is \nwhat the law says.\n  There is a name for this scientific sin of combing raw data until you \nfind data skewed in the direction you want to go and then formulating a \nhypothesis on that finding. That is called ``data mining.'' And using \nthe Ranch Hand study as the basis for forming a conclusion, rather than \nusing the findings as the basis for forming a hypothesis for testing, \nis to commit the sin of data mining.\n  I think you want to remember that the principal investigator for this \nstudy, Dr. Joel Michalek, testified before a House committee that his \nfindings did not support the conclusion that there is a linkage between \nspina bifida and agent orange. That is it. That is the only evidence we \nhave. We are ignoring that?\n  The academic reviewers for the journal Epidemiology drew no attention \nto, or conclusions from, the birth defect findings when they published \nthe Ranch Hand study.\n  The IOM said this, ``any positive conclusion is vulnerable to chance, \nbias and confounding.'' And so all I can do is present my colleagues \nwith the facts. Others can come to present the emotion. And they will \nbe here. And I will continue to try to present the facts. There is not \none of us here--and certainly not this Senator--that does not care \nabout people who have spina bifida or care about Admiral Zumwalt's son, \na tragic thing. And that dear and remarkable American feels that agent \norange is the destruction of that fine young man. And that may well be. \nNo one--no one--cares less for those people. I hope we can keep that \nout of debate. When we come to the debate, bring facts. Everyone is \nentitled to their own opinion, but nobody is entitled to their own \nfacts.\n\n  There have been thousands of studies of veterans, farmers, \nagriculture workers, and industrial workers who either were or are \npresumed to have been exposed to herbicides or their component \nchemicals, and all of those studies--every single one of them --provide \nlittle support for the theory that Agent Orange causes spina bifida. \nDioxin does cause chloracne, and that is why we have made it a \npresumptive disease. It may cause other things, and that is why we made \nother diseases presumptive diseases.\n  But the use of the Ranch Hand study to support making birth defects \npresumptive, as is being done today, is to use the study for a purpose \ndisavowed\n\n[[Page S9893]]\n\nby its principal investigator. That has to be at least heavy in your \nconsideration.\n  With that, I see my colleagues have fled or have absented themselves \nfrom the Chamber, so I probably should fill the void, but I think the \nword should go out we are certainly ready to proceed with the debate or \nyield back time. I am ready to do that, but I do not wish to cut off \nanyone in the debate, either the minority or the majority side. So \nrather than have a quorum call, I shall proceed. However, let the word \ngo out through the network that if anyone wishes to debate this issue \nfurther they should present themselves. If not, we can conclude the \ndebate and go to the procedural motion that will be made by the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Again, I want to reiterate that we really do some good things for \npeople who have this disease. I have cited that. But I think one of the \nmost unique is the private sector, the remarkable group known as the \nShriners, those fellows you see in the parade with the fez--older now, \nbut just as caring and loving of their fellow man and woman, and \nespecially children. They provide care for any child in this Nation \nwith spina bifida, and especially if you cannot afford to pay. In fact, \nthat is really the requirement. They will treat that child only if the \nparents can afford to pay nothing. There is never any reimbursement. \nThose remarkable people support those hospitals, and you do, too. I \nwant that clearly said.\n  We are always talking about, what can the private sector do? How can \nthey begin to take the burden off Medicare and Medicaid? This is one \nway. We put a redundant program together just so we can not say that \nthe VA has not done anything for these victims. Even though others are \nserving them, we still want the VA to do it. That is how we get to a $6 \ntrillion debt within the next few years--a $5.2 trillion debt--even if \nwe balance the budget. Under all these horrible proposals described by \nsome of my brethren, the budget will be balanced in the year 2002, but \nthe debt will be $6.2 trillion.\n  Half the American people believe that we all got together and \nbalanced the budget, and that may be so. That would mean the deficit \nwill be gone; whether it is $160 billion or $200 billion, just pick \nyour figure. But, Members, the debt of the United States will have \nmarched on like ``Old Man River.'' That is why everybody is asleep. The \ndebt, after balancing the budget in the year 2002, the debt will then \nhave gone to 6.2 trillion bucks. Why is that? Is that the ghost of \nRonald Reagan doing that? Is that Clinton doing that? No. Right here. \nThis is where we do it--Democrats and Republicans do it. We do it to \nget reelected.\n  You just saddle this new group of human beings with a burden that \nthey can never, never tolerate and do it for the best reasons--the \nchildren, the veterans, the seniors. No affluence testing, no \nmeasurement of what you put in and what you get out, no measurement of \nyour net worth. That game is going to end--not in my time, but it will \nend--because there is no way it can be sustained.\n  It is as if we are talking about messing with the deck chairs on the \nTitanic, which has been partially lifted and then returned to the \ndepth, which is about where we are with the debt. There is no way to \narrange these deck chairs unless you do something with Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, Federal retirement and the national debt \ninterest, period.\n\n  So maybe we can hear less about those who care less--if I hear that \nagain, I will be wanting to toddle right over here from my office--or \nthat somehow one party cares more than another about human beings. That \nis pure balderdash. It is ugly. It is crude. It does not fit, because I \ndo not know anybody in the Democratic Party or the Republican Party \nthat is interested in doing a number on anyone of the lesser of \nsociety. We are interested in trying to do something to see that there \nis something left for those people in 10 or 20 years. If that is cruel, \nI am proud to join that pack, because I think that is the greatest \nabrogation of responsibility for our generation, to just leave a \ntattered pile of IOU's for a bunch of young people who apparently are \nnot paying attention or who know that there will not be anything in the \ntill for them anyway.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Daschle, today as a cosponsor of the Agent Orange \nBenefits Act Amendment of 1996. I find myself year after year after \nyear giving voice to those Vietnam veterans who still are suffering as \na result of their service in Vietnam. Thirty years ago agent orange was \nsprayed in Vietnam--30 years ago--and we are still debating the bias of \neach individual analyzing the evidence of its health impact on the \nveterans and their children. The families who suffer deserve our \ncooperation. It is time to stop debating and move forward.\n  This amendment does just that. It takes another crucial step forward \nin repaying our debt to those who have served their country. In some \ncases, that is a dear debt, indeed.\n  The legacy of Vietnam has cast its dark shadow on many aspects of our \ndaily lives, changed the way many of us think and view war. Today we \nseek to address the shadow that has been cast over some children of \nVietnam veterans.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we are proposing today would extend \nhealth care and related benefits to children of Vietnam veterans who \nsuffer from spina bifida, a serious neural tube birth defect that \nrequires life-long care--provided, of course, the children were \nconceived after the veterans began their service in Vietnam. These \nchildren have become the next innocent victims, victims in a long line, \nwho are suffering from the effect of agent orange.\n  Senator Daschle, Senator Rockefeller, I and many others have worked \nfor the past decade to try to bring to a fair and just resolution the \nquestions surrounding agent orange and the effects it has had on the \nmen and women who faithfully served this country. In 1991, we \ncoauthored the agent orange Act of 1991 which required the Institute of \nMedicine--part of the National Academy of Sciences--to conduct a \nscientific review of all evidence pertaining to the connection between \nexposure to agent orange and other herbicides used in Vietnam and \nsubsequent occurrence of health-related conditions. As a result of this \nlaw, a report was issued by the National Academy of Sciences in March \n1993 and it was to be followed by biennial updates for the next 10 \nyears.\n  The first report published by the National Academy of Sciences in \n1993 created four categories to classify the level of association \nbetween certain health conditions and exposure to agent orange. \nCategory I contains conditions for which there is sufficient evidence \nof an association. Category II contains conditions for which there is \nlimited or suggestive evidence of an association. After 1993, the VA \nprovided compensation for all conditions contained in categories I and \nII. Conditions for which there is inadequate or insufficient evidence \nto determine whether an association exists were placed in category III \nand compensation was not provided for them.\n  When the latest of the NAS biennial updates was issued in March of \nthis year, it cited new evidence supporting the link between exposure \nto agent orange and the occurrence of spina bifida in children of \nveterans who served in Vietnam. The NAS panel moved ``spina bifida in \noffspring'' from category III into category II, based on the results of \nthree epidemiological studies which suggest that a father's exposure to \nherbicides may put his children at a greater risk of being born with \nspina bifida. The Ranch Hand Study, which examined a group of veterans \nwho were directly involved with spraying 19 million gallons of chemical \ndefoliant in Vietnam during the war, was the largest of these studies. \nOver the past 2 years the results of the Ranch Hand study have been \nreanalyzed by the U.S. Air Force, and this new analysis reinforced \nevidence of a connection between agent orange exposure and spina\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\nbifida in offspring that had been found in other studies. This \nultimately led to the committee's conclusion that there is limited or \nsuggestive evidence of an association. I ask unanimous consent to place \nan article in the Record that discusses at length the basis of these \nfindings.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the Journal of the American Medical Association, Apr. 10, 1996]\n\n New IOM Report Links Agent Orange Exposure to Risk of Birth Defect in \n                         Vietnam Vets' Children\n\n                          (By Joan Stephenson)\n\n       New Evidence reveals a tentative link between exposure to \n     chemical defoliants that were used in the Vietnam War and an \n     increased risk of spina bifida in veterans' children, \n     according to a recently issued report by the National Academy \n     of Sciences' Institute of Medicine (IOM).\n       The congressionally mandated report, Veterans and Agent \n     Orange: Update 1996, is the second in a series of biennial \n     reassessments of the health effects of Agent Orange and other \n     herbicides. In addition to noting limited or suggestive \n     evidence of an increased risk of the birth defect in exposed \n     veterans' children, it said that new studies confirm the 1994 \n     report's finding that there is sufficient evidence that \n     exposure to these chemicals is linked with soft tissue \n     sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and \n     chloracne.\n       The report also described ``limited or suggestive'' \n     evidence, based on studies of occupational exposure to \n     herbicides or dioxin outside of Vietnam, that exposure may be \n     linked with acute, transient peripheral neuropathy. However, \n     a link between chornic peripheral neuropathy and exposure to \n     these chemicals was not supported by the overall data.\n\n\n                           Thousands Exposed\n\n       United States military forces sprayed nearly 19 million \n     gallons of herbicides, including more than 11 million gallons \n     of Agent Orange, over Vietnam between 1962 and 1971, to strip \n     vegetation that helped conceal enemy troops. Thousands of US \n     troops were exposed to varying doses of these chemicals, \n     which were sprayed from airplanes and helicopters, from boats \n     and ground vehicles, and by soldiers wearing equipment \n     mounted on their backs.\n       After a 1969 report that concluded that one of the chief \n     chemicals used in Agent Orange could cause birth defects in \n     laboratory animals, use of Agent Orange was halted in 1970. \n     All herbicide spraying in Vietnam ended by 1971.\n       ``Since that time, some of the 3 million Americans who \n     served in the Vietnam War have wondered whether their \n     exposure to herbicides may have caused them to develop \n     cancer, or caused their children to have birth defects,'' \n     said David Tollerud, MD, MPH, of the University of Pittsburgh \n     (Pa) School of Medicine, at a press briefing. To address \n     these concerns, Congress passed the Agent Orange Act of 1991, \n     authorizing the National Academy of Sciences to review \n     studies concerning the health effects of herbicide exposure \n     and to reevaluate the evidence every 2 years for 10 years as \n     new evidence accumulates, noted Tollerud, chair of the IOM \n     committee that produced the report.\n       As in the first IOM report, the diseases were classified \n     into four categories according to the strength of evidence \n     (or lack thereof) linking health effects with herbicide \n     exposure.\n       The top category includes conditions for which there is \n     ``sufficient evidence'' of a positive association with \n     exposure to herbicides of dioxin (a trace contaminant of \n     herbicides). The second classification involves diseases in \n     which ``limited or suggestive evidence'' suggests such an \n     association--meaning that at least one high-quality \n     epidemiologic study has found a link, but that the evidence \n     is not conclusive enough to rule out chance or study bias \n     influencing the results. The other two categories involve \n     conditions for which there is ``inadequate or insufficient \n     evidence'' to determine whether a link exists, or ``limited \n     or suggestive evidence of no association.''\n\n\n                          operation ranch hand\n\n       The finding of ``limited or suggestive'' evidence of an \n     increased risk of spina bifida in children fathered by \n     veterans exposed to herbicides was based on three \n     epidemiologic studies, the largest of which involved a \n     reanalysis of a group of nearly 900 Operation Ranch Hand \n     veterans who were directly involved in the handling and \n     spraying of herbicides in Vietnam.\n       In the Ranch Hand study, researchers found three cases of \n     spina bifida (plus one case of another neural tube defect, \n     anencephaly) among 792 liveborn infants, compared with no \n     cases occurring in a comparable group of children fathered by \n     nonexposed veterans, for a rate of nearly four cases per \n     1,000 births. The rate of spina bifida in the general \n     population is about five cases per 10,000 births.\n       Two other epidemiologic studies reviewed by the committee--\n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vietnam \n     Experience Study and the CDC Birth Defects Study--also \n     suggest an association between herbicide exposure and \n     increased risk of spina bifida in children. But the report \n     noted that while all three studies were of relatively high \n     quality, methodologic limitations such as small sample size \n     and possible recall bias mean that further study is required \n     to confirm this apparent link.\n       Based on several occupational studies outside of Vietnam, \n     the report also added acute, transient peripheral neuropathy \n     lasting weeks, months, or longer to the list of health \n     effects for which there is limited or suggestive evidence of \n     an association with herbicide exposure.\n       Other diseases classified in this category in the first IOM \n     report included prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and \n     respiratory cancers (of the lung, larynx, or trachea), and \n     the new report reconfirmed those findings. Studies completed \n     since the first report resulted in a reclassification of the \n     evidence linking porphyria cutanea tarda and herbicide \n     exposure from ``sufficient'' to ``suggestive.'' New studies \n     also prompted the committee to downgrade the classification \n     of skin cancer from ``suggestive'' to ``insufficient evidence \n     of an association.''\n\n\n                         A Question of Exposure\n\n       Unlike the other findings of the IOM report, the \n     conclusions about an apparent link between spina bifida and \n     herbicide exposure were based on studies of Vietnam veterans. \n     However, most of the evidence reviewed by the committee about \n     possible health effects from exposure to the herbicides used \n     in Vietnam came from studies of people who were exposed to \n     these chemicals either on the job or in industrial accidents.\n       Tollerud noted that a severe lack of information about the \n     exposure levels of individual troops hindered the IOM \n     committee's ability to assess the herbicide-related health \n     risks faced by Vietnam veterans.\n       ``Except for particular groups, such as those involved in \n     Operation Ranch Hand and other groups directly involved in \n     spraying operations, information on the extent of herbicide \n     exposure among veterans is virtually nonexistent--and this \n     limits how far we can interpret data [from studies of \n     nonveterans] with respect to the veterans themselves,'' he \n     said.\n       The majority of experts on the IOM committee agreed that \n     it's not currently possible to quantify the degree of risk to \n     Vietnam veterans from exposure to herbicides and dioxin. \n     However, two committee members, Bryan Langholz, PhD, and \n     Malcolm Pike, PhD, both of the University of Southern \n     California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine, said that \n     studies indicate that measuring trace levels of dioxin, which \n     lingers in the body for years, and extrapolating backward \n     could provide a useful measure of a veteran's original \n     exposure.\n       If this method provides such a valid estimate--an \n     assumption that many experts on the committee dispute--\n     studies that measure blood levels of the chemical in Vietnam \n     veterans would suggest that most veterans, particularly those \n     who did not participate in herbicide spraying, were not \n     exposed to very high levels of the chemicals, said Langholz.\n       Scientists hope that ongoing and future research efforts \n     will help reduce some of the uncertainty about exposure \n     levels of veterans. One possibility is the development of \n     historical exposure reconstruction models, which involves \n     combining existing data on such factors as the paths flown by \n     airplanes involved in herbicide spraying with information on \n     specific troop movements and meteorological conditions when \n     spraying occurred, to determine levels of exposure of \n     veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs and the IOM are \n     working together to solicit research proposals for such \n     studies, said Tollerud.\n       Another area that still needs to be addressed is the \n     possible health effects of herbicide exposure in the women \n     who served in the Vietnam War, particularly potential \n     reproductive effects and diseases that are usually or only \n     seen in women, such as breast cancer and cancers of the \n     female reproductive organs. The Department of Veterans \n     Affairs is currently identifying and enrolling such women in \n     studies to examine this issue.\n       ``We hope that by the time the review process comes around \n     in 2 years that there will be new information to address the \n     gaps in knowledge that we now have about [herbicide-related] \n     health effects in these women,'' said Tollerud.\n       Prepublication copies of Veterans and Agent Orange: Update \n     1996 are available from the National Academy Press by \n     telephone (800) 624-6242 or (202) 334-3313 (Washington, DC, \n     metropolitan area). The report's executive summary is \n     available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nap.edu/nap/\n online/veterans/.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as mandated by the 1991 \nlaw, initiated a comprehensive review of the 1996 NAS report and made \nconsequent policy recommendations to the President. Subsequently, in \nMay, President Clinton announced that the administration would propose \nlegislation to aid Vietnam veterans' children who suffer from the \ndisease spina bifida.\n  Our amendment fulfills that commitment by recognizing and accepting \nresponsibility for one of the serious health care needs of veterans' \nfamilies that the preponderance of evidence suggests stems from the \ntragic effects of agent orange.\n  Since 1985, Vietnam veterans have been eligible for free health care \nfrom\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\nthe Veterans Administration for conditions that are related to exposure \nto agent orange. Veterans' disability compensation has been awarded to \nveterans affected by several agent orange-related illnesses including \nnon-Hodgkins lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, \nchloracne, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, and, most recently, \nprostate cancers and acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy.\n  There are those who will stand before us today and argue that there \nis not enough credible evidence to make a positive association between \nexposure of a veteran to agent orange and the occurrence of spina \nbifida in that veteran's children, and that, accordingly, there are not \nsufficient grounds to add it to the list of conditions I have just \nmentioned. I will say again today what I said first back in May 1988, \nand repeated just last month:\n\n       It is offensive to veterans to tell them that there is not \n     enough ``scientific evidence'' to justify compensation . . . \n     The evidence is in their own bodies, and even worse, in the \n     bodies of their children.\n\n  Both the President and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Jesse \nBrown, have asked that spina bifida in veterans' offspring be \nconsidered service connected. If we do not act on this proposal today, \nwe may not be able to do so this Congress. It will be pushed aside \nbecause of the tight schedule due to the election cycle this year. For \n30 years many issues surrounding Vietnam have been put aside to be \ndealt with another day by different people. Mr. President, we cannot \nlet this continue--we must act today and allow the pain to be eased for \nthe children and their families who are suffering. This bill will grant \nthe VA the necessary means to finally start providing needed care to \nthese children who carry the scars of a war they never saw or fought.\n  I know that there is still controversy about the effects of agent \norange. There may always be controversy, just as there may always be \ncontroversy about the Vietnam war itself. We as adults know that most \nfrustrating of all this world's realities: there are some things we as \nhuman beings can never know for certain and which, therefore, always \nwill be controversial. But we must set aside the controversy--or put it \nbehind us--to enable suffering children to receive the care and \ntreatment they need when responsible, intelligent people acting in good \nfaith can look back and discern the source of that suffering.\n  This is not just a theoretical concern to me, Mr. President. There \nare real human beings in my State of Massachusetts who are among the \nAmerican veterans and family members whose lives have been effected by \nspina bifida.\n  I want to compliment the Democratic leader for his tenacious, \nexemplary leadership on this difficult issue. He has struggled \nvaliantly to secure fair treatment for those who sacrificed so greatly \nfor our Nation by their service in Vietnam. I thank him for permitting \nme to join him in bringing this amendment before the Senate today.\n  I also want to commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Rockefeller, the former chairman of the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee who now serves as its ranking Democrat. I hope the veterans \nof our Nation, those who served in Vietnam and those who served in \nother conflicts, realize what kind of friend--but, more importantly, \nwhat kind of effective advocate--they have in Jay Rockefeller. His work \nand the work of his staff on this legislation were crucial, and I \nexpress my appreciation to them.\n  Mr. President, we must not permit our inaction or our lack of \nabsolute certitude to make some of the children of our Vietnam veterans \nthe last victims of the Vietnam war. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am a co-sponsor of the amendment offered \nby the distinguished Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle. This \namendment, which is supported by the Vietnam Veterans of America and \nthe American Legion, attempts to address a very painful legacy of the \nVietnam conflict. It provides comprehensive health care and a very \nmodest monetary allowance to the children of Vietnam veterans who \nsuffer from spina bifida as a result of their fathers' exposure to the \nchemical defoliant Agent Orange during the the Vietnam conflict over \ntwenty years ago.\n  Mr. President, the history of Agent Orange exposure has been sad, \neven shameful. After the Vietnam conflict, as veterans suffered, \nadministration after administration failed to aggressively investigate \nthe cause of their illnesses. Now, some twenty-two years after the end \nof the conflict, additional medical conditions are still being linked \nto exposure to Agent Orange. Just this spring, prostate cancer and \nperipheral neuropathy were added to the list.\n  For twenty-two years, the genetic legacy of Agent Orange exposure has \nbeen denied, although reproductive disorders and birth defects in their \nchildren have been among the Vietnam veterans' greatest Agent Orange-\nrelated health concerns. A congressionally-required National Academy of \nSciences report of March, 1996, cited new evidence of a link between \nAgent Orange exposure and the occurrence of spina bifida in the \nchildren of exposed veterans. While not conclusive, the evidence \npersuaded the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to propose legislation to \nprovide for these unfortunate children.\n\n  This amendment is necessary because, while the Department of Veterans \nAffairs has recommended that spina bifida in Vietnam veterans' children \nbe recognized as service-connected, the VA does not have the authority \nto extend health care or other benefits to children of veterans. \nSeparate legislation authorizing this service connection, which Senator \nDaschle introduced in July with my support, is unlikely to be passed in \nthe limited time remaining in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, spina bifida is a crippling birth defect caused by the \nimproper development of the vertebrae or spinal cord, resulting in \nvarying degrees of paralysis of the lower limbs. The damage is \npermanent and incurable. Treatment includes surgery, medication, \nphysiotherapy, and the use of assistive devices like braces, crutches, \nor wheelchairs. These are not conditions that are outgrown; spina \nbifida victims must learn to control and live with these dysfunctions. \nOngoing therapy, medical care, and/or surgical treatments are necessary \nto prevent and manage complications throughout an individual's life.\n  These children are the hidden victims of the Vietnam conflict. They \nare the sad legacy of war, an uncounted and unwanted cost of conflict. \nAs a nation, as a Congress, we spend hundreds of billions of dollars \npreparing for and conducting military operations. We are profligate \nspenders on the front end of a military operation--nothing is too good \nfor the troops, and you can't have too much of a good thing.\n  But when it comes to the tail end of a military operation, the \naftermath of conflict, we become parsimonious and begrudging. We \nprovided for the veterans of the Vietnam conflict, but only after years \nof study and review. We have been even slower to address these \nsecondary casualties, the children with spina bifida.\n  Mr. President, there is considerable reluctance to admit to the \ndelayed costs of conflict, let alone to plan and budget for these \ncosts. If we required veterans' health care and compensation to be \nincluded in our cost estimates before we began a military operation, we \nmight think twice about committing our troops. And if we acknowledge \nthe potential effect of military operations and the exposure to \nhazardous materials on the next generation, as I believe we should, \nthese cost estimates can only rise.\n  I am glad that, finally, the government is meeting its responsibility \nto provide for the Vietnam veterans children with spina bifida. They \nare casualties of war as surely as if they were hit by a bullet. I am \nonly sorry that it took so very long, and that we cannot do more.\n\n  In the Vietnam conflict, there was agent orange. In the Persian Gulf, \nthere now exists the possibility that U.S. troops were exposed to \nchemical warfare agents, which can also cause birth defects. I offered \nan amendment to the Defense authorization bill that would have provided \nhealth care for the children of Persian Gulf veterans who have birth \ndefects or catastrophic illnesses while research is conducted to \ninvestigate the possible link between these childrens' conditions and \ntheir parents' possible exposure to chemical warfare agents or other \nhazardous materials.\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\n  I asked that these poor children and their families be given the \nbenefit of the doubt, that they not face the same long and difficult \nroad traveled by the Vietnam veterans and their children. Some argued \nthat I have attempted to set a bad precedent in providing health care \nbefore the science has been conducted to prove the link between cause \nand effect. Well, I would rather be accused of an excess of compassion \nthan its dearth. It has been 5 years, and no research has been \nconducted. Under $30 million a year is needed to care for these \nchildren, and to provide relief to these families. Of the hundreds of \nbillions spent each year on the military establishment, I do not find \n$30 million an excessive amount to treat the smallest and weakest of \nour military families. Similarly, the price tag associated with \nproviding for the children with spina bifida is modest. It is not an \neconomic hardship to address our responsibility to these children.\n\n  Before each conflict, we talk about what national security interests \nare at stake. Mr. President, if our children, our future generation, \nare not our most vital national security interest, then what have we \nfought for? Hazardous exposures have long been associated with the \nbattlefield, but now that science can confirm that such exposures \naffect our children and our future, we must not shirk from \nacknowledging our responsibility. In the Gospel of Mark, we are \nreminded of the Lord's words: ``suffer the little children to come unto \nme, and forbid them not: for such is the kingdom of God.'' Senator \nDaschle has offered an amendment that would address the health care \nneeds of the children who are the innocent victims of the Vietnam \nconflict, and in doing so, he brings us all a little closer to the \nkingdom of God. I commend Senator Daschle for his compassion and his \neffort on the behalf of these children. I am a cosponsor of this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle. \nI am proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, many statements have been made here on the Senate \nfloor over the years about the need to honor the debt we owe our \nNation's veterans. If there ever was a nonpartisan issue, it is the \nneed to keep the promises we made to those who sacrificed by defending \nthis great Nation and the principles it stands for.\n  We have a long and proud history of compensating our veterans for \ninjuries and wounds they sustained in combat situations. Millions of \nveterans have had to endure sickness, disability, and even paralysis as \na result of their military service and we must continue to ensure that \nthere is adequate funding for research as well as for the facilities \nand medical care needed to care for these men and women.\n  During the course of the Vietnam war, thousands of our service \npersonnel who returned from Southeast Asia were stricken with ailments \nassociated with exposure to the chemical herbicide known as agent \norange. After years of pressure from veterans organizations and \ndistinguished Americans such as Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, Jr., the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Government finally began to \nprovide health care and other important benefits to veterans suffering \nfrom exposure to agent orange.\n  That is why Vietnam veterans have been eligible for free VA health \ncare for agent orange-related conditions since 1985 and that is why \ndisability compensation has been provided to Vietnam veterans for \nailments that are believed to be directly related to exposure to agent \norange such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and respiratory cancers.\n  Today, I join the distinguished minority leader in offering the U.S. \nSenate an opportunity to make another down payment on that often talked \nabout debt that we owe our veterans. The amendment that we are offering \ntoday will extend health care and related benefits, including a monthly \nmonetary allowance, to the children of Vietnam veterans suffering from \nspina bifida.\n  Spina bifida is a neural tube birth defect that requires lifelong \ncare. As has already been pointed out, a recent report from the \nNational Academy of Sciences has provided new evidence demonstrating a \nlink between the occurrence of spina bifida in the children of veterans \nto a veteran's exposure to agent orange and other toxic herbicides in \nVietnam. In light of the empirical data that does indeed demonstrate a \ncorrelation, I believe it is the Federal Government's responsibility to \nensure that these children receive the necessary medical care to treat \nthis ailment.\n  We will surely hear criticism today on the Senate floor that this \nlegislation will create another entitlement program that the Government \ncannot afford. Mr. President, this Nation made a decision long ago that \nour courageous service members were entitled to certain benefits, most \nimportantly access to quality medical care for health problems that \narise as either a direct or indirect result of their service to this \ncountry. We are talking about innocent children here, who have been \nstricken with a serious, disabling condition as a result of their \nfather's service in Vietnam. Is there definitive proof of this? No. Is \nthere a strong likelihood that this is the case? Yes, and so long as \nthe evidence suggests such a correlation exists, we must continue to \nfulfill our obligation to our veterans and their families.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation is fully funded with a cost \noffset. By reforming the Gardner decision--a move that even the major \nveterans organizations recognize needs to be made --this legislation is \nfully paid for with additional savings being dedicated to reducing the \nFederal budget deficit.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has the strong backing of a number of \norganizations, including the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars, the American Legion, the Spina Bifida Association of \nAmerica, and the Clinton administration. I want to commend the \nDemocratic leader for his longstanding leadership on this and other \nissues important to our Nation's veterans. Our veterans have fulfilled \ntheir commitment to this Nation, and we must fulfill our commitment to \nthem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President. I rise today to discuss the amendment \noffered by the minority leader to the VA/HUD appropriation bill. This \namendment would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide \ncomprehensive medical care, vocational training benefits, and \ncompensation benefits for certain children of Vietnam veterans who are \nborn with spina bifida.\n  The proponents of the amendment offer an emotional argument. I am \nvery concerned about those who suffer from this condition. I recognize \nthat these children and their families face many challenges and \nfinancial burdens.\n  The issue before us, however, is not whether spina bifida is or isn't \na horrible condition. No Senator would argue otherwise. I am confident \nthat each of us has compassion for the children and their families. As \na veteran myself, I have been an ardent supporter of our Armed Forces \nand veterans. I have voted in favor of benefits for all veterans, \nincluding those exposed to agent orange and Persian Gulf war veterans.\n  What this body must determine, is what legislation is appropriate at \nthis time. I do have concerns about this amendment, as it is offered on \nthis appropriations measure.\n  Historically, benefits for dependents of veterans have been based on \nthe death or disability of the veteran. This amendment would, for the \nfirst time, authorize VA to provide benefits to a person not a veteran \nbased on a possible relationship between that individual's disability \nand a veteran's service. The committee of jurisdiction should carefully \nconsider such an unprecedented extension. However, no such hearings \nhave occurred to fully examine the consequences of extending benefits. \nTherefore, I consider this amendment to be premature.\n  Under this amendment, children of veterans would be provided \ncomprehensive medical care. The Veterans' Affairs Committee recently \napproved an extensive overhaul of eligibility rules and priorities for \nhealth care. Under that legislation, veterans would be enrolled into \nthe VA health care system, with a cap on total health care \nexpenditures. The extension of medical care to dependents of veterans \nwill result in a decrease of medical care to veterans.\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\n  Next, the amendment provides for vocational training benefits and for \ncompensation. Under the proposed framework, the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs would pay a monthly stipend, based on the level of disability. \nThese benefits would not be paid out of discretionary funds, but, as a \nnew entitlement program, are considered mandatory spending. Because it \nwould affect direct spending, a spending offset will be required. \nAgain, the Veterans' Affairs Committee would be required to pay for \nthis new entitlement to dependents of veterans, of unknown costs, by \nreducing benefits established for veterans. I believe that creating a \nnew entitlement on this appropriation measure is inappropriate.\n  Finally, I have reservations regarding the underlying merits of the \nstudy on which the amendment is based. In short, the science is \ninconclusive. The Institute of Medicine stated the study shows limited/\nsuggestive evidence of an association between exposure to herbicides \nand spina bifida. The principal investigator of the primary study on \nthis issue testified earlier this year before a House committee that \nthe study is inadequate to establish a cause and effect relationship. \nThe VA task force that reviewed the Institute of Medicine report noted \nthat scientific questions remain. Because scientific questions remain, \nit would be prudent to further study and resolve all open issues before \nembarking on a new entitlement program that would take away from \nexisting veterans' benefits.\n  Mr. President, because this amendment is premature, is inappropriate \nfor an appropriation bill, and is based on inconclusive science, I will \nnot vote to amend the VA-HUD appropriations bill as proposed by the \namendment. Again, I emphasize my support for veterans, my concern and \ncare for the children with spina bifida and their families. I am sure \nthe Congress will continue to review this issue and address the open \nquestions in a more appropriate forum.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Daschle's \namendment. I join such groups as the American Legion, Vietnam Veterans \nof America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans in \nsupporting this effort initiated by the President and spearheaded in \nthe Senate by the minority leader.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment seeks to help the innocent victims of a \nwar fought long ago. Just as there are lingering psychological wounds \nfrom the war, there are veterans and their families who struggle with \nthe lingering physical impacts every day. This amendment will provide \nhealth care and benefits to children of Vietnam veterans who suffer \nfrom spina bifida, believed to be caused by their fathers being sprayed \nwith agent orange.\n  I have a long record of fighting for our Nation's veterans. I have \nfought for adequate health care and benefits funding as both the chair \nand ranking member of the VA-HUD Subcommittee.\n  I've fought to ensure vets receive quality of service and effective \nand accessible VA facilities. I also worked to make sure the VA \nprovided the services especially appropriate for women veterans.\n  I am determined that we never forget America's veterans. They fought \nto protect Western civilization, preserve freedom, and defend \ndemocratic governments. They fought overseas to protect those of us at \nhome.\n  I am determined that promises made must be promises kept. We must say \nthanks to vets with concrete actions, not just flowery rhetoric. Medals \nare nice, but the Nation has a responsibility to help veterans who \nrisked their lives and returned home to find their lives and the lives \nof their children changed forever.\n  The minority's leader's amendment reminds us that many Vietnam vets \nwere exposed to agent orange. A March 1996 National Academy of Sciences \nreport noted that exposure to that substance may cause spina bifida in \nveterans' children.\n  The VA estimates that up to 2,000 children of Vietnam era veterans \nmay be impacted. This amendment ensures that they would be provided \nappropriate health care and monthly benefits.\n  And furthermore, this amendment is paid for. The minority leader's \namendment includes an offset that more than covers the anticipated cost \nof these expanded benefits.\n  While some would say this is an issue that can wait, and calls for \nfurther study, I say we really should not wait. We must not forget that \nspina bifida is an incurable disease that isn't going away for those \naffected. Those kids cannot wait one more year, for one more study. It \nmay be easy for some of us to forget the war, or not to quite remember \nthe war. For all of those who like to go into parades and talk about \nwhat they want to do to help the veterans, I believe that for many \nveterans who served in Vietnam, one of the ways we can show our respect \nis to make sure that children who have birth defects because of what \ntheir fathers were exposed to in Vietnam are protected. That is what \nthe vets would like. They fought a war. We can call it a war. We should \ncall it a war, and we should remember that. Yes, they want the GI \nbenefits and, yes, they appreciate the VA medical care. But I know of \nno Vietnam vet that would not be proud of the fact that we looked out \nfor their children.\n  There is concern about the study. Some say the linkage between agent \norange and spina bifida for children of the vets is too skimpy. But I \nwant to bring out the fact that the law that was passed related to \nagent orange says that there only need be a positive association, not a \ndefinitively determined cause and effect.\n  So the National Academy of Sciences shows that there is a positive \nassociation between agent orange and these children who have spina \nbifida. That is what Senator Daschle is standing on. We support him. We \nare supported by the VA and so many other groups. I hope when the \nDemocratic leader offers his amendment, it is one of those that passes \n99 to 0. We really don't need to make the children of Vietnam veterans \nsubject of a heated debate on the floor. That outlines my thoughts in \nthe area. If there is substantial debate, I anticipate that I may \nparticipate even further on this. I hope my colleagues will give this \nvery serious consideration.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are waiting for somebody to offer an \namendment. We have heard that people are on the way. We would like to \nget the amendments offered. We have a limited list. If there are any \nwho have amendments on which a vote might be needed, we ask them to \ncontact the floor and come forward. We would like to move forward. I \nhope we can get time agreements and finish up the bill this evening. \nBut at this juncture we are depending upon the Members who wish to \noffer amendments. I invite any and all of them to come forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, earlier today we were worrying about \nwhether we could get a 4-hour time agreement to limit debate on the \namendment that the minority leader is going to offer. There was a good \ncouple of hours, 2\\1/2\\ hours, of debate, and the amendment has not \nbeen offered. We are open to do business.\n  If anybody has arguments for or against it, I would invite him or her \nto come present those arguments. I understand the minority leader is \ntemporarily involved in another hearing and has not been able to \npresent his amendment. There is no amendment pending.\n  We welcome anyone who wants to discuss the bill or discuss amendments \nwhich they will offer. This is the prime time of day when we ought to \nbe doing the business of the Senate. This is the third day we have been \non this bill. The ranking member and I have been here, ready and \nwilling to move forward. We are running short of time in this \nlegislative session, and we have this and a number of other very \nimportant measures to conclude.\n  So I make an earnest plea to people on both sides of the aisle who \nwant to talk about this bill, or particular issues, to come forward and \ndo so, please. Let us use the time of the Senate productively. We are \nhere. We are ready. We are waiting to do business. We welcome such \nviews and such enlightenment as our colleagues would wish to share with \nus.\n\n[[Page S9898]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Senate will soon be asked to ratify \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. The intent of this treaty is to \nimplement a worldwide ban on the production, possession, and use of \nchemical weapons, which is something we would all agree to; if it were \nsomething that was enforceable or verifiable, that we would be a party \nto. However, most of the experts I have talked to--people like Caspar \nWeinberger, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, William Clark, I even had a \nconversation with Dick Cheney--have serious questions as to whether or \nnot this is in the best interests of the United States.\n  The problem we have, one of many problems, but the major problem we \nhave with the CWC, the Chemical Weapons Convention, is that it does not \ninclude those countries that pose the greatest threat to our Nation's \nsecurity. I am talking about Libya and Iraq, North Korea, Syria. They \nare not a part of this. Even if they were a part, I would not believe \nthey would actually live up to their commitment. But, again, they are \nnot. Some countries have signed onto the treaty but they have not \nratified it. We seem to be acting as if all those countries that have \nsigned the treaty ultimately will ratify it. I do not believe that is \nthe case.\n  Even in the case of Russia, if they did, the Senator from North \nCarolina here can remember, back in 1990, when the Russians and the \nUnited States, then the Soviet Union and the United States, had a \nbilateral destruction agreement, yet the Russians have not lived up to \nit--not because they do not want to, necessarily; because they say they \ncannot afford to. In fact, they said if you in the United States expect \nus in Russia to live up to the bilateral destruction agreement of 1990, \nit will cost you approximately $3.3 billion. I do not anticipate there \nwill be a lot of support for that.\n  They keep saying 160 countries have signed the treaty. This is fine, \nbut they are the wrong countries. We do not have a problem, a threat of \nchemical warfare with Great Britain, with France, with Sweden, with \nthese countries. It is the countries who are not a part of this that \npose the threat.\n  The compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention is not \nverifiable. Countries like China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia \nhave signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, but our ability to verify \ntheir compliance is doubtful at best. I think the best quote I can give \nis from the former CIA Director James Woolsey, who was the CIA Director \nunder Democratic Presidents. He said:\n\n       The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an \n     intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have \n     high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, \n     especially on a small scale.\n\n  The U.N. inspectors, after the agreement was reached with Iraq back \nin 1991, have had all kinds of opportunities to look for chemical \nweapons in Iraq, yet many have gone undetected. So we will be asked to \nratify this. I serve notice now I will be among the leaders in \nopposition to that ratification. I feel it is very similar to the \nratification of the START II agreement. The START II agreement was an \nagreement that would force us back into a posture that we found \nourselves in in 1972 with the ABM Treaty, which was with, at that time, \nthe Soviet Union. It does not do any good for us to downgrade our \nnuclear capability, as was the case there, if we have 25 to 30 nations \nwho are building a nuclear capability, who have weapons of mass \ndestruction, who are working on the missile means of delivering them. I \nsee a parallel here, an analogous situation.\n\n  What good does it do for us to agree to destroy all of our chemical \ncapability if we are allowing those rogue nations that pose the \ngreatest threat to the United States to still be able to have theirs?\n  I think one of the phoniest arguments, though, is on terrorism. I \nhope no one will give much credence to that. The President and his \nadministration contradicted themselves the other day when the President \nwas trying to lead us into this notion that, if we ratify the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, somehow it will make it more difficult for \nterrorists. He said:\n\n       If the Chemical Weapons Convention were in force today, it \n     would be much more difficult for terrorists to acquire \n     chemical weapons.\n\n  Then a short while after that, in a response, Warren Christopher \nsaid:\n\n       It is difficult to predict what impact the CWC will have on \n     actual terrorist use of chemical weapons, as the CWC was not \n     designed to deal with this threat.\n\n  He was exactly right.\n  So I hope we are not lulled into a false sense of security by \nratifying a convention that is not verifiable and that is not \nparticipated in by those parties and those countries that pose the \ngreatest threat to the United States.\n  I come from Oklahoma, and if a terrorist was able to get enough \nexplosive power to blow up the Murrah Federal Office Building to the \nextent it happened there, I can assure you that the terrorists will \nalso be able to get chemical weapons.\n  So, Madam President, I hope my colleagues share my concern about \nthis, the harmful impact of the chemical weapons convention on our \nNation's security, and will join me in opposing the ratification of \nthis flawed agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I especially appreciate the Senator's comments, because \nthere is so much confusion, so many extravagant statements have been \nmade, Madam President, about how much good this convention will do, \nthis treaty.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, Senator Sam Ervin, my first colleague from \nNorth Carolina when I came to the Senate--a pretty good constitutional \nlawyer--used to comment that the United States had never lost a war or \nwon a treaty, meaning that we got short shrift by accepting so many \ntreaties that didn't do the country any good.\n  But the thing that bothers me, I say to my colleague, and I am sure \nit does to him, is that so many--even in this Chamber, I am sorry to \nsay--are willing to disregard the fact that the White House has \nstonewalled about allowing the Senate to have documents that the Senate \nis entitled to have with respect to this treaty. They refused, in some \ncases, they have obfuscated, they have made all sorts of excuses, and I \nam happy that the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott, has talked \nto Mr. Panetta, and there is some indication that these documents are \ngoing to be made available to the Senate.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding that as chairman of the \nappropriate committee, you made a request sometime ago for all of these \ndocuments in order for us to deliberate this, to debate this, to \ndetermine whether or not this was in the best interest of our Nation's \nsecurity. Have you received any response so far to your request?\n  Mr. HELMS. Half hearted responses in a few cases. In large measure, \nthe administration has stonewalled the matter and refused to release \nthe actual documents.\n  The intelligence community of our Government unanimously say that \nthis treaty has many aspects that are perilous to the security of the \nUnited States.\n  But in any case, I thank the Senator for his comments and for his \nrole in trying to protect the people of this country from a treaty or a \nconvention that is unwise, as in this case. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator, too.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Therefore, it is open to amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5191\n\n       (Purpose: To increase funding for drug elimination grants)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for himself, \n     Mr. Bond, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. McCain and Mr. Coverdell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5191.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       ``Of the amount made available under this heading, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, $20,000,000 shall \n     be available for grants to entities managing or operating \n     public housing developments, Federally-assisted multifamily-\n     housing developments, or other multifamily-housing \n     developments for low-income families supported by non-Federal \n     governmental entities or similar housing developments \n     supported by private sources, to reimburse local law \n     enforcement entities for additional police presence in and \n     around such housing developments; to provide or augment such \n     security services by other entities or employees of the \n     recipient agency; to assist in the investigation and/or \n     prosecution of drug related criminal activity in and around \n     such developments; and to provide assistance for the \n     development of capital improvements at such developments \n     directly relating to the security of such developments: \n     Provided, That such grants shall be made on a competitive \n     basis as specified in section 102 of the HUD Reform Act.''\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I believe the pending amendment has been \napproved on both sides.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, if I may interrupt, with respect to my \ncolleague from North Carolina, I think there was one additional change \nthat had been suggested by the minority side. I have not seen whether \nthat was incorporated.\n  Mr. HELMS. I think it already has been.\n  Mr. BOND. On behalf of my ranking member, I want to be sure that has \nbeen incorporated. They have worked very closely with us. We appreciate \ntheir cooperation, and we particularly appreciate your work on this. I \napologize for interrupting. I wanted to make sure that change had been \nmade in the amendment submitted to the desk.\n  Mr. HELMS. It is certainly no problem. I suppose we are talking about \non page 39, after line 10 * * * ``developments supported by'', \ninserting the words ``nonprofit private sources''. Is that it?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is the amendment that was submitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I was going to make a few comments in \nsupport of the amendment, and I suggest that we await the arrival of \nthe ranking member before actually moving to adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, and I have a few remarks.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from North Carolina has some comments, as I \nwill, on this measure. We do want to wait for the ranking member before \nmoving to acceptance of the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment will markedly \nincrease efforts to eliminate the scourge of drugs and crime in public \nhousing project by increasing funding by $20 million for local housing \nauthorities to stimulate the fight against drugs.\n  These programs help curb crime within public housing neighborhoods by \nproviding funds to housing authorities that can be used to employ more \nlaw enforcement or security personnel, to establish voluntary tenant \npatrols and to sponsor programs designed to reduce illegal drug use in \nand around public housing developments.\n  Most public housing residents are law-abiding citizens who deserve to \nlive in a community free of crime, drugs, and fear. Unfortunately, this \nis not the reality for many public housing tenants who instead are \nfaced with daily assaults by drug dealers and criminals who not only \nrob them of their freedom, but also rob them of their dignity.\n  Many public housing projects are incubators for crime and drug \ndealing. Children sell and use drugs and, even worse, children shoot \nother children. This violence spreads throughout our cities and \njeopardizes all citizens.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am chairman, held a \nhearing recently on international drug trafficking and its effect on \nlocal communities. Among the witnesses were two law-enforcement \nofficers from my home State and a member of the ``blood'' gang, who \ndescribed the effects of street-level drug dealing in detail. One thing \nthat was clear after their testimony was that we have seen only the tip \nof the iceberg.\n\n  While there is no one solution to the problem of illegal drug use, it \nis clear that any long-term solution must empower the residents to take \nback their streets and enable them to live safely in their homes.\n  The epidemic of drug use among juveniles has been confirmed by recent \nstatistics which show that since 1992, teenage drug use in general has \nincreased by 105 percent, marijuana use by 141 percent, and cocaine use \nby 166 percent. Drug abuse and the crime it spawns are rampant in \npublic housing projects. The war against drug use and drug-related \ncrime in public housing communities must be fought and won in the \nneighborhoods themselves. Enhanced law enforcement is critical to \nprevailing in the war on drugs. Towards that end, the additional funds \nprovided by this amendment will allow local housing authorities to hire \nmore cops and security guards to protect their residents.\n  Recently, there have been a number of stories that have documented \nthe crime that occurs in these neighborhoods. Here are just a few \nexamples:\n\n       March 30, 1996--``Already this month, two young men have \n     been shot and killed in Durham's public housing communities, \n     one in front of a crowd of young children.'' (The News & \n     Observer)\n       July 24, 1996--``There is evidence that increased \n     trafficking along the U.S. 64 corridor from Raleigh is \noccurring, and that public housing is a target for drug dealers.'' (The \nNews & Observer)\n\n  August 17, 1996--``When Durham police found 18-year-old Germaine \nDeMarco Ansley shot and bleeding to death in Few Gardens last month, \nthey knew there must be a witness in the crowd gathered around his \nbody, but no one at the public housing complex would talk.'' (The News \n& Observer)\n\n  It's time to stand up with the folks who live in these communities \nand help them to rid themselves of the fear and crime in their \nneighborhoods.\n  Experience has shown that the residents themselves--who are most \ndirectly affected by drugs and drug-related crime--can do a lot to turn \nthe tide against drugs when given the opportunity.\n  The success of the drug elimination grants is rooted in the fact that \npeople who live in public housing are encouraged to save their own \nneighborhoods. And maybe, just maybe, we can prevent a few murders, \nstop a few drug deals, and give children the opportunity to grow up in \na safe environment.\n  Mr. President, this program is effective, and it is working well in \nmy home State of North Carolina as well as across the Nation. Through \nthe use of this grant the following areas have shown marked success: \nThe Durham Housing Authority reported that in 1994, there were 33 drug-\nrelated evictions in Durham public housing. The Charlotte Housing \nAuthority reported that in 1994, the crime rate fell by 8.7 percent \noverall, and by 12.4 percent in the target neighborhoods when the drug \nelimination program was implemented. There were 104 drug arrests and 26 \ndrug-related convictions.\n\n[[Page S9900]]\n\n  The Greensboro Housing Authority reported that in 1993--the first \nyear of administering a Police Neighborhood Resource Center at the \nHampton Homes Development--violent crime dropped by more than 40 \npercent. Similar statistics have been shown across the Nation \nindicating the effectiveness of combating the war on both drugs and \ncrime.\n  Mr. President, with these programs in place, local housing \nauthorities and residents are doing their part to rid cities of drugs \nand their terrible consequences. I urge Senators to support this \namendment, which will be offset by reductions taken from general \nadministrative expenses, that will increase funding for this necessary \nand successful drug-fighting venture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I would like to comment on the \namendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina. And as we do, I \nsincerely hope that the people of North Carolina are spared any damage \nfrom Hurricane Fran. We know your cousins in South Carolina are bracing \nfor some pretty heavy weather. And as another coastal State, we know \nwhat these things mean. So I just, in a spirit of cordiality and \ncollegiality, want the people to know in the Carolina's that we, in \nMaryland, are worried about them and are thinking about them.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator is most thoughtful. Of course, on behalf of \nthe people of North Carolina, I thank her. I will say that the \nsoutheastern part of North Carolina and northeastern part of South \nCarolina, the people in both areas, as the saying goes, are living on a \ndiet of finger nails right now. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We are very happy about the fact that this subcommittee \nthat has so many wonderful agencies in it also funds emergency \nmanagement. And right now, Senator Bond and I, in trying to decide how \nFEMA will meet its obligations, are also on those diets of finger \nnails, or any other one that might work, I might add.\n  Madam President, I think the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina indeed has merit. The whole idea of getting drugs out of \npublic housing has been something that we have supported for many \nyears. When I chaired this subcommittee I had the good fortune of \nworking with the Vice Presidential nominee, Mr. Jack Kemp, who was the \nSecretary of HUD, and now Mr. Cisneros, on a focused approach to get \ndrugs out of public housing. It was always our belief that public \nhousing should be a steppingstone to a better life and not to be an \nincubator for drug dealers.\n  In the course of watching this effort develop, we were aware that \nthere were certain gaps in the program. What were those gaps? That \noften the grand program to get drugs out of public housing was limited \nonly to public housing, those horrendous, horrific high-rise public \nhousing projects that often were tools of neighborhood destabilization \nrather than tools of empowerment.\n  But also we saw something else, that where the Federal Government has \nsubsidized housing in other areas, that they too have presented \nproblems. In my own home State of Maryland, there was a project called \nRiverdale in a suburban area. And it was owned by the private sector. \nWe thought, oh, gosh, this was going to be terrific. Get rid of all the \nissues in public housing. But what did we see? A scurrilous landlord \nwho did not do maintenance, who did not work with the county in being \nable to screen the residents, did not use the section 8 subsidies to \nmodernize, keep the building fit for duty.\n  Guess what? It took on all of the trappings of the negative aspects \nof public housing, became poorly maintained, with neighborhood \ndestabilization, and became an incubator of crime.\n  There were no funds to help the local police department or whoever to \nreally deal with this. I think that is wrong. And what I like about the \nHelms amendment is that it will include those entities that are \nFederally assisted, multifamily housing developments or other \nmultifamily housing developments for low-income families, supported by \nnon-Federal entities.\n\n  That means that we will be able to make sure that whatever the \nFederal Government is involved with, we are going to make sure it is \nfit for duty, and fit for duty not only in terms of maintaining the \nphysical structure, but, through the work of Senator Bond and myself, \nSenator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes here, we now have something called \n``one strike, you're out,''--``one strike, you're out''--which means \nthat if you have been arrested for a criminal act, you were not going \nto stay in public housing or section 8.\n  We are not going to subsidize criminal behavior if we are on the \nwatch. We are going to get them out so that the poor people who want to \nsee Federal help as a tool to be able to empower themselves to a better \nlife--we want to help them, but we do not want to subsidize people who \nare part of the problem. We want to help people become part of the \nsolution. That is why we like the conceptual framework of the Helms \namendment.\n  I must say, I have pause about creating an earmark in CDBG. The \nreason I like CDBG, otherwise known as community development block \ngrant money, is because community development block grant money was to \nbe a block grant, maximum flexibility, minimum micromanagement by the \nFederal Government, so that local governments could best decide how to \nmeet their needs. The rural needs of Maine are very different than the \nbustling metropolis of Baltimore City in the Baltimore-Washington \ncorridor. Who could do what?\n  So at this time I do not think we should fuss about budget over that. \nI am going to support the Helms amendment here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. I will be happy to adopt it just on a voice vote. I understand \nthe leadership from the other side of the aisle is considering the \nvote.\n\n  First of all, to Senator Helms, I congratulate him on his thought--\nand his staff--behind this. I think it is about time we start really \nthinking about how, when the Federal Government spends its money, the \ntaxpayers feel satisfied, and we should be creating opportunities, \nopportunities for the poor to help themselves. I believe now with our \nstrong, no nonsense zero tolerance one-strike-you-are-out approach \ncombined with the grant program and the initiative of the Helms \namendment, that we can start making sure anything that the Federal \nGovernment is involved in in neighborhoods is not a tool of \nneighborhood stabilization, but a tool of empowerment.\n  I look forward to supporting this amendment by whichever vehicle is \nbest to move it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my ranking member for her very \nstrong and supportive words. I heartily concur with them. I extend my \nparticular thanks to the Senator from North Carolina who gave us a \nreality check and really brought back to our attention the fact that \ncrime, lawlessness, and insecurity, fear for personal safety, is a \ngrave problem that affects everybody who lives in many of these \nassisted housing projects.\n  By targeting these funds for assistance for law enforcement agencies, \nI think the Helms amendment is going to go a long way toward improving \nsafety and security for families and for the individuals in assisted \nhousing. This is different from some of the programs that we already \nhave. Many of the drug elimination grants are grants for a broad scale \nof activities. They are generally limited to Federal housing \nactivities.\n  This amendment says that the CDBG funds can be used not only for \nfederally assisted multifamily housing developments but for other \nmultifamily housing developments for low-income families supported by \nnon-Federal Government entities or similar housing developments \nsupported by nonprofit private sources. So this gives us an opportunity \nto provide assistance not just to a federally assisted housing program \nbut to a State, a city, or a private not-for-profit entity with a \nmultifamily-housing development. These are the people who are most at \nrisk. These are the people who have the most to lose if a foothold for \ncrime, for drug activities, gets into one of these developments.\n\n[[Page S9901]]\n\n  My colleague from Maryland points out a very important fact that a \nlot of people seem to overlook. It was Congress that said one strike \nand you are out. I think that kind of get tough with the people who \nhave shown they do not deserve to receive taxpayer-supported housing \nassistance is a very large step in the right direction.\n  I have talked to an awful lot of residents in my State who have \nexpressed fear or concern for their public safety, and if we can tell \nthem that if one of their neighbors is convicted of a crime of drug use \nthat they are out, they will feel better. With the funds available \nunder the Helms amendment to include extra policing and extra drug/law \nenforcement efforts, we can take another significant step toward \nensuring that these developments and the people who live in them--the \nfamilies, the individuals, the elderly in many instances who right now \nare often held hostage in their own apartments, their own homes--these \npeople will be safer.\n  Incidentally, we spoke yesterday about the repeated efforts that we \nhave made in this subcommittee, in the authorizing committees, to let \nthe local housing authorities designate some housing as elderly only, \nor some as disabled only, or some as mixed, because there have been \ngrave problems all across the country--in many of those units, \ncertainly some in my State--where there is a mixture of disabled and \nelderly in the same housing. The elderly are very fearful, in some \ninstances because of criminal behavior.\n\n  Along with the one-strike-you-are-out policy and the additional \nresources available under the Helms amendment, I think we are going to \ntake some significant steps toward assuring these people of safety in \ntheir own homes. That, along with food and shelter is certainly one of \nthe most basic and compelling needs we ought to provide to those of our \ncitizens who need our assistance.\n  I commend the Senator from North Carolina for giving us a boost, \ngetting us started on this right track. I thank my colleague from \nMaryland who, as always, made improvements on it. I expect shortly we \nwill either move to formal passage or adopt this amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Needless to say, I am so grateful to both managers of this \nbill for their kind comments about the amendment.\n  Just to be sure that the amendment is modified as agreed to with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, I send a modification to the desk \nand ask that the amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. Without objection, \nthe amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 5191) is modified, as follows:\n\n       On page 39, after line 10, insert the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``Of the amount made available under this heading, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, $20,000,000 shall \n     be available for grants to entities managing or operating \n     public housing developments, Federally-assisted multifamily-\n     housing developments, or other multifamily-housing \n     developments for low-income families supported by non-Federal \n     governmental entities or similar housing developments \n     supported by non-profits private sources, to reimburse local \n     law enforcement entities for additional police presence in \n     and around such housing developments; to provide or augment \n     such security services by other entities or employees of the \n     recipient agency; to assist in the investigation and/or \n     prosecution of drug related criminal activity in and around \n     such developments; and to provide assistance for the \n     development of capital improvements at such developments \n     directly relating to the security of such developments: \n     Provided, That such grants shall be made on a competitive \n     basis as specified in section 102 of the HUD Reform Act.''\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask the Senator from North Carolina, is that adequate \nnonprofit clarification?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond, Senator \nCoverdell, Senator Faircloth, and Senator McCain be identified as \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I \nhave enjoyed listening to the remarks of the Senators from Maryland, \nMissouri, and North Carolina about the importance of the amendment.\n  I bring a little bit of a unique personal experience to this. The \nfirst public housing was erected in my home city of Atlanta, GA, in the \nearly 1930's, and dedicated by President Roosevelt. Today, there is \nmore public housing in my capital city than any other city in America, \nsave one, per capita.\n  To reinforce the importance of this amendment, let me say there have \nbeen numerous revelations of late with regard to drug activities in \nthese projects. It is even suspected in our housing projects that drugs \nare being sold with impunity and have become the hub of a distribution \nsystem.\n  I have said many times that one of the great changes in the current \ndrug epidemic that we are experiencing is the age of the audience \ninfected. It has moved from age 16, 17, and 18 to 8, 11, 12, and 13. \nMany of these youngsters in these housing projects are being recruited \nsystematically into becoming instruments of drug transactions \nthemselves. It is an absolute tragedy.\n  One of the other ramifications, Mr. President, is that when these \ngangs begin to set up these instruments of distribution in housing \nprojects and they come upon a disagreement, it is not unusual for the \nresolution to be a shootout. Very recently, in one of these drug-\nrelated shoot outs, an 8-year-old girl, Kimberly Session, was shot, and \ntwo of her friends were wounded, as she was playing at McDaniel-Glenn \npublic housing project. Absolutely innocent--just out playing in her \nneighborhood. They are not even safe in their home.\n  Four-year-old Monica Rose Mae Carr was shot as a drug-related gang \npumped 40 rounds into an apartment unit, striking her in the heart as \nshe lay asleep.\n  In Atlanta public housing two-thirds of those affected by the drug \ncrisis in the housing projects are women and children, 97 percent \nAfrican American. In an analysis of the effect of violent crime, half \nof Atlanta's low-rise public housing units, the violent crime rate is \n60 percent higher than the immediate neighborhood that surrounds it--\nall related to drug distribution, drug transaction, and drug gangs.\n  So in Atlanta, we are experiencing the cost and effect of rampant \ndrug violations in crime and use in our housing projects. So I come to \nthe floor briefly to echo support for the amendment offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina. It is well targeted, well-meaning, and it \nwill have a very positive effect on a lot of our young people, not only \nin Atlanta, but throughout the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know that the Democratic leader has no \nreservations about a vote occurring. The majority leader is testifying \nand would like a short quorum call. I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I believe we should notify Members that a vote will be forthcoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Agent Orange Benefits\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I salute the minority leader, Tom \nDaschle, for sponsoring the Agent Orange Benefits Act of 1996 which \ncreates the benefits package for the children of Vietnam veterans who \nsuffer from spina bifida, a congenital disease that requires lifelong \nmedical care. Approximately 2,700 of our citizens would be eligible for \nthe benefits conferred by this amendment.\n  Mr. President, you would think that legislation which help the sick \nchildren of our soldiers--children who have developed debilitating \nmedical problems as a result of their parents' service in the Armed \nForces who sacrificed to preserve the freedom and independent way of \nlife that we all enjoy--that such a thing would be free of controversy. \nHowever, some of my colleagues are holding up this amendment. And quite \nfrankly I think those reasons can only be characterized as puzzling. \nWhile I respect those who oppose this legislation on procedural \ngrounds, I point out\n\n[[Page S9902]]\n\nthat what is being proposed in this amendment is not unprecedented. It \nis consistent with our overarching responsibility to legislate in the \npublic interest that this amendment is put forward today.\n  The opposition's argument that the scientific evidence does not \nclearly establish a link between dioxin and other herbicides and spina \nbifida is particularly troubling. While it may be true that earlier \nstudies did not show a nexus between spina bifida and agent orange, the \nmost recent National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine study, \nentitled, ``Veterans and Agent Orange; Update 1996,'' suggests more \nthan a casual nexus between the horrible condition of spina bifida and \nthe use of agent orange. Based on that study, which was commissioned by \nthe Veterans' Administration in 1991, Veterans Administration Secretary \nJesse Brown moved to provide presumptive compensation to the children \nof Vietnam veterans who are suffering from spina bifida.\n  Arguments that the Government does not have irrefutable proof and \nscientific certainty of the link between dioxin and herbicide and spina \nbifida beg the issue. It is a scientific fact, as the most recent NAS \nstudy confirms, that there is more than a casual connection between \nagent orange and spina bifida. Given this fact, I believe it is \nprudent--not to mention compassionate--that we err on the side of the \ninnocent children who have been stricken with this horrible disease.\n  Furthermore, arguments regarding the proliferation and the cost of \nentitlement I think only serve to obfuscate or cloud the issue and fail \nto address the issue at hand, which is our responsibility to the \nchildren of those who bravely served our country during the Vietnam \nwar.\n  I would like to point out--you have heard me make this argument \nbefore--that the truth is in America no one goes without help. Everyone \ngets helped. Every child with spina bifida who has been a victim of \nthis situation will get health care treatment one way or the other. The \nonly question is who will pay for it. Whether or not it is a family \nthat is required to pay for the cost associated with the lifelong \nhealth care associated with this horrible illness, or whether or not it \nis the insurance companies which, of course, means that all of us who \nhave private insurance pay more--whether or not it will be the \nratepayers who pay--the insurance company bills will be made higher \nbecause, as you know, for those who are insured it does not cover the \nuniverse of people in this country who will need health care.\n\n  So here is really an efficient way of addressing these health care \ncosts for which there has been a causal connection as demonstrated by \nthe NAS study and, frankly, by common sense and observation.\n  The fact that we have so many people with spina bifida, which is \nshowing up among the children of Vietnam veterans who were exposed to \nagent orange, ought to compel us to give the benefit of the doubt to \nthose children and to the servicemen and women who served our country \nand deserve better than to be called upon to be put in jeopardy if they \nare not going to be able to pay for their children's health care \nbecause of their service.\n  Most important, the opposition places process over what I think is \nour duty, whether it is fairness, or whether it is our obligation or \ncompassion, and does nothing to improve the well-being of innocent \nchildren who have been stricken by this disease.\n  I believe that we have a responsibility to care for the health of \nthose who served in our Nation's armed services, particularly those who \nanswered the Nation's call to duty in defense of democracy in a \nmilitary conflict.\n  When our men and women joined the military we promised to give them \nthe best training, the finest equipment, and to care for them and their \nfamilies should they become casualties of war. Passage of this \namendment is simply an acknowledgment of that commitment. While these \nbrave men and women sacrificed for our community as a whole, it seems \nto me that it is our duty to keep our promise to them and to provide \nsome means for the kind of support and medical expenses associated with \nthis devastating disease.\n  We have a contract with our veterans--a contract that is both \nirrevocable and inviolate. If we break this contract we send a \ndisturbing message to our men and women in uniform that America is \ngiving lip service to their sacrifice and to their service and that we \ncannot be counted on to honor the commitment should there be a \nsituation occur such as the birth of a child with a debilitating \ndisease; that is, to care for them or their dependents should they \nbecome disabled as a result of their service to our Nation, and it \nought to be something for which there is unanimous support by our \ncitizens and society. I can think of nothing that would more adversely \naffect and impact the morale of those now serving in our Armed Forces \nthan to turn our back on them for the condition of their sick children.\n  Mr. President, our responsibility and obligation to our veterans was \nbest articulated by the most favorite of the favorite sons and \ndaughters of my State of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, who in his second \ninaugural address said: ``To care for him who shall have borne the \nbattle, and for his widow and his orphan * * *'' Today, of course, we \nwould acknowledge the contribution and participation of the men and \nwomen in our military in the defense of our country. That change \nnotwithstanding, President Lincoln's words are as valid today as when \nthey were first 131 years ago. In the spirit of our obligation ``To \ncare for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his \norphan,'' or his children I think is embodied in Senator Daschle's \namendment. I hope that we will recognize those arguments, \nnotwithstanding the overarching responsibility that we have in this \nsituation to support this legislation. It is sensible for us to do so. \nIt is the important thing for us to do, and certainly it is in keeping \nwith our inviolate commitment to the veterans.\n\n  So I rise in strong support of the amendment, and I hope that our \ncolleagues will support it as well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the role.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5191\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is Amendment 5191 offered \nby the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we are ready to go to a rollcall \nvote.\n  Mr. BOND. But before I ask for the yeas and nays, I will advise my \ncolleagues that while we have been at work here our colleague, Senator \nAbraham and his wife, Jane, are the proud parents of a healthy baby \nboy. We offer them our congratulations and our very best wishes.\n  On the Helms amendment, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question \nnow is on agreeing to amendment No. 5191, as modified. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] \nand the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 271 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n\n[[Page S9903]]\n\n\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Hatfield\n     Murkowski\n       \n  The amendment (No. 5191), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move tolay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5192\n\n (Purpose: To require that health plans provide coverage for a minimum \nhospital stay for a mother and child following the birth of the child, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], for himself, \n     Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Frist, and others, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5192.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with the \nNewborns Act. It is an attempt to require at least 48 hours for a \nchildbirth.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5193 To Amendment No. 5192\n\n (Purpose: To require that health plans provide coverage for a minimum \nhospital stay for a mother and child following the birth of the child, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have expressed \nconcern regarding a provision in the amendment just sent to the desk \nwhich appears to have a conflict in it. I wish to offer a second-degree \namendment at this time to clarify the intent of the legislation. \nSpecifically, language was added to the section on postdelivery care to \nclarify that it is the attending provider, in consultation with the \nmother, that determines the appropriate location for followup services \nin combination with an earlier discharge which is less than 48 hours. \nIt is confusing as initially written because the amendment appears to \ngive the mother the option of demanding home care regardless of the \nattending provider's assessment of their individual needs.\n  This decision is most appropriately made in cooperation with the \nprovider and the mother. Therefore my second-degree amendment strikes \nthe language which appears to conflict with this intent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator intend to offer this \namendment at this point?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for himself and Mr. \n     Bradley, proposes an amendment numbered 5193 to amendment No. \n     5192.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me just briefly close by saying one other thing that \nthis second-degree amendment does. The amendment guards against \nmonetary incentives directed at discharging mothers and babies before \nthe attending provider feels it is appropriate. Specifically, my \nsecond-degree amendment provides language sought by health plans to \nprovide that nothing in this bill interferes with rate negotiators \nbetween a plan and a provider.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I welcome the second-degree amendment by \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee. I do think he clarifies my \nown intent in the original amendment. I believe that it is important. \nIt adds to the purpose of the original amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I have offered and that has been second-\ndegreed by the distinguished Senator from Tennessee I think is a very \nimportant amendment. His is offered on behalf of himself and me. I \noffered mine on behalf of myself and him, as well as the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator Kassebaum, the ranking member \nSenator Kennedy, Senator DeWine, Senator Murray.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all 52 cosponsors of this \namendment be listed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Cosponsors\n\n       The following Senators have cosponsored the Newborns' and \n     Mothers' Health Protection Act as of September 5, 1996.\n       Bill Bradley.\n       Nancy Kassebaum.\n       Bill Frist.\n       Jay Rockefeller.\n       Barbara Boxer.\n       Barbara Mikulski.\n       Paul Sarbanes.\n       Patty Murray.\n       Mike DeWine.\n       Harry Reid.\n       Claiborne Pell.\n       Edward Kennedy.\n       Paul Simon.\n       Paul Wellstone.\n       Carol Moseley-Braun.\n       Richard Bryan.\n       Wendell Ford.\n       Frank Lautenberg.\n       Daniel Inouye.\n       Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n       Robert Kerrey.\n       Mitch McConnell.\n       Carl Levin.\n       Jesse Helms.\n       Charles Grassley.\n       Pete Domenici.\n       John Kerry.\n       Olympia Snowe.\n       Alan Simpson.\n       Patrick Leahy.\n       John Glenn.\n       Charles Robb.\n       Ted Stevens.\n       Diane Feinstein.\n       Joe Biden.\n       Rod Grams.\n       Alfonse D'Amato.\n       Ernest Hollings.\n       Kay Bailey-Hutchison.\n       Herb Kohl.\n       Bob Graham.\n       John Warner.\n       Pat Moynihan.\n       Chris Dodd.\n       John Breaux.\n       Larry Pressler.\n       Arlen Specter.\n       Bill Cohen.\n       James Inhofe.\n       Max Baucus.\n       Byron Dorgan.\n       Ron Wyden.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Of these cosponsors, 19 are Republican. So this is a \nbipartisan amendment and a bipartisan bill. What the bill does is very \nsimple. It says that insurers are required to allow 48 hours, up to 48 \nhours, for a woman in the hospital after giving birth and requires \ninsurers to allow up to 96 hours if that birth is a Caesarean section.\n  If the mother and her doctor choose to leave the hospital in less \nthan 24 hours, less than 48 hours, she is permitted to do so. There is \nnothing in this bill that says that she cannot leave earlier. Followup \ncare will be provided if she leaves earlier.\n  Mr. President, why is this amendment needed? Why are we offering this \namendment? The answer is because all of us, I am sure, have received \nreports of women in our respective States being required to leave a \nhospital prior to 48 hours, in some cases prior to 24 hours. In \nCalifornia, for example, in 1994, for 1 in 6 babies that were born, the \nmother had to leave the hospital in less than 24 hours. That is for \n90,000 births.\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\n  The problem here is that some illnesses do not develop until the \nsecond day. If the mother were in the hospital, they would be able to \ndetect it and deal with it. A good example is jaundice, which does not \nreally develop until the second day. Heart defects are another. What \nhappens is that the mother is pushed out of the hospital. She goes home \nafter 12, 14 hours, 16 hours, 26 hours. In the second day jaundice is \ndetected, or worse, a heart defect, and the mother is rushed back to \nthe hospital at a much greater cost.\n  In New Hampshire, for example, there was the study that showed that \nwomen who leave the hospital in less than 48 hours have a 50-percent \nincreased risk of readmission to the hospital, a 70-percent increase in \nrisk to be readmitted at the emergency room. So in the long run, by \nsaying that someone has to leave in 24 hours, you are really saying it \nis going to cost more, it is going to cost more because the readmission \nand the treating of the more serious illness could have been avoided \nhad she been in the hospital when it was first detected.\n  So, Mr. President, the need here is very clear. It is kind of common \nsense. I mean, my distinguished cosponsor on this bill, Senator Frist, \nrefers to a safe haven of time, 48 hours. That is why it is needed. Who \nsupports this amendment and this bill? It is supported by the American \nMedical Association. The American Academy of Pediatrics supports this. \nThe College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports this.\n  In fact, the Academy of Pediatrics, their recommended guideline is 48 \nhours. Gynecologists and obstetricians, 48 hours is the guideline they \nset. That is how we arrived at this number. Why 48 hours? Because the \ndoctors in question recommended that. The obstetricians and \ngynecologists stated that, if we keep the 24-hour limit, ``it could be \nthe equivalent of a large uncontrolled, uninformed experiment on women \nand babies.''\n  We all want to reduce health care costs. We can do so without \njeopardizing the health of mothers and their newborns. Again, who makes \nthe decision? That is really the question here. We believe that the \nperson who makes the decision should be the doctor and the mother, that \nthe decision should not be made by an accountant in a distant office \nseeking cost savings and forcing women out of hospitals within 12 to 14 \nhours after they have given birth to their child.\n  This is the basic question: Who makes the decision? We have stories \nall across the land of doctors who have been put under great financial \npressure to discharge in 24 hours or less or they will be dropped from \nhealth plans.\n  So, Mr. President, this is needed because there is a clear health \nproblem with women who are discharged too early. The 48-hour and 96-\nhour for Caesarean section limits were set pursuant to the guidelines \nof the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists.\n  A number of States have already acted on this. Twenty-eight States \nhave passed laws requiring a 48-hour limit. Why, then, do we need a \nnational law, people ask. You need a national law obviously for the \nother States that have not passed it, but even if all of them passed \nit, you would still have many in a State that would be unaffected by \nthe State law.\n\n  For example, we need a Federal law to get at the so-called ERISA \nplans, the self-insured plans, the plans of large companies like \nBoeing, IBM, 3M, Dupont, and others. They would not be affected by a \nState law because they are self-insuring ERISA, controlled by Federal \nlaw.\n  There is also another problem, at least in my State of New Jersey. \nThere is a State law that says you have 48 hours, but the law says the \nState has no authority to regulate insurance companies that are \nheadquartered in a different State, Mr. President. So there are large \nnumbers of people who are not covered then, of course, in States like \nKansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York. You might have a \n48-hour law in a particular State, but you might have a hospital in \nanother State, and when you gave birth to the child in a hospital in \nanother State, you would not be covered by the 48 hours and you would \nbe pushed out of the hospital in 24 hours.\n  That, not coincidentally, would have been the case in my own family \nwhen our daughter was born. The birth was delivered across the line in \nNew York--24 hours, you are out.\n  We need this national law in order to make sure women have 48 hours \nto stay in a hospital. There are some places, for example, in Kansas, \n40 percent of the companies--only 40 percent--would be subject to \nregulation under just a State law. In some States, 75 percent of the \nwomen are uncovered because State laws do not and cannot reach them as \nthey are now written.\n  Now, Mr. President, this is an issue that came to my attention \nbecause I had several letters from women who had been subjected to this \nrigid 24-hour-and-you're-out policy. Drive-through deliveries is what \nthey are called. There was an article about it, after this came to my \nattention, in Good Housekeeping magazine, and someone, the author of \nthe article, put a little box in the article that said if you care \nabout this issue, write to Senator Bradley.\n  Mr. President, I have received, since that article appeared about a \nyear and a half ago, more mail than I have received on any one issue, \nwith the exception of interest and dividend withholding, in my entire \n18 years. I received over 85,000 pieces of mail from women and families \nof women in this country who have been pushed out of the hospital in \nless than 24 hours. Now, I do not intend to read a long list of these \nletters--85,000 is a long time. We want to move this amendment as \nquickly as possible. Let me share two with you.\n  The McCloskeys, who live outside Philadelphia, write:\n\n       Our daughter Shannon was discharged from the hospital \n     approximately 27 hours after birth. After only 8 hours at \n     home, she went into seizures and we had to rush her back to \n     the emergency room. She was diagnosed with streptococcus. The \n     timing of our arrival at the hospital was critical, and we \n     feared for her life. The doctor told us that if we had \n     arrived at the hospital 15 minutes later, she would have been \n     dead.\n\n  Linda Dunn of Knoxville, TN, writes:\n\n       We almost lost my grandson, Brantley, because of an early \n     hospital release. Brantley was one month premature and was \n     born via a Caesarean section. In spite of this, he was \n     released with his mother only 36 hours after the birth. \n     Within 20 minutes of arriving home, Brantley choked, quit \n     breathing, and was rushed to Children's Hospital in \n     Knoxville, where he was placed in neonatal intensive care and \n     noted as having ``a serious, life-threatening episode.'' The \n     frightening part of the scenario was that if I had not been \n     trained in infant resuscitation at my prior job, the baby \n     would simply be dead.\n\n  Mr. President, if the baby were in the hospital, the baby would not \nhave been even risking death. In the first 48 hours when some baby \nstarted to turn sort of a greenish color and jaundiced, it would be \nrecognized and dealt with immediately. You are a first-time mother and \nyou have a child, you are forced out of the hospital, you do not know \nquite what to do and you arrive home with the baby. In the first 24 \nhours you have a life-threatening health problem; you do not have \nanybody to turn to. Mr. President, that is why we need this bill.\n  I might also say that there were people who say you will not get any \nsupport from the insurance industry or HMO's, that they are the bad \nguys here. Mr. President, that is not necessarily so. We have letters \nof endorsement for this bill from one of the largest HMO's in the \ncountry, Kaiser Permanente. We have an endorsement from the HIP plan of \nNew York-New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, this bill has 52 cosponsors, 33 who are Democrat, 19 \nwho are Republican. This passed out of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee 14 to 2. In the House, the leader on this legislation is a \nRepublican, Gerald Solomon, with George Miller as his No. 1 helper in \nthis effort. They have over 150 cosponsors.\n  It is time to do this amendment. It is time to do it now. I hope we \nwill pass it on this bill and that we will send it to conference and \nhopefully the conference will hold this amendment, say to those \nhundreds of thousands of women out there who are going to give birth in \nthe next 6 months that you are not going to be rushed out of the \nhospital. You will have a little time to take care of the health \nproblem of your child if it should develop. You will have\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\na little time to gather yourself after an exhausting delivery. You will \nhave a little time to get you and your baby off to a right start, a \nhealthy start, because the U.S. Senate saw fit on this bill at this \ntime to say that 48 hours is not too much to require an insurance \ncompany to give you after giving birth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to thank Senator Bradley. This issue was called to \nmy attention by someone reading Good Housekeeping who asked me why \neverybody was writing to Bradley. I contacted Senator Bradley and \nwanted to know more about what he was talking about because I was \nhearing about this and found it hard to believe. You hear so many \nrumors today, so many people are upset about HMO's--much of it \nlegitimate, some of it not legitimate--that you hear these horror \nstories.\n  Quite frankly, when I first heard this back in my home State, I \nreally did not believe that some HMO's and insurance companies were \nactually doing this. I did not think it was a joke, but I thought it \nwas a clear misunderstanding on the part of the people who were saying \nthis was happening--24 hours and you are out.\n  This is, quite frankly, very scary. The potential danger is real. \nThink back, those of you women and men on this floor when you were \nyoung parents, to the first child you had and think back to when you \nbrought that child home. I know this is a distant memory for some of \nus, myself included, but remember how it was. You brought that baby \nhome, and when your wife turned and handed the baby to you, your first \nconcern was maybe, ``Is it going to break?'' Or, ``I don't know what I \nam going to do here, I'm not sure.'' Then your wife, no matter how \ninstinctively good a mother she is, used to go, in the first couple \ndays the baby was home, and literally lean over the crib to make sure \nthe baby was breathing. How many of you actually leaned over the crib \nand stuck your ear down to see if you could literally hear the baby \nbreathing? The reason I point that out is the baby was healthy. Your \nchildren were, 99 percent of the time, healthy and nothing was wrong. \nBut the point is, you didn't know. There are so many young mothers. The \ntragedy is that there are teenagers giving birth to children. The \ntragedy is that there are thousands of unwed mothers out there. What do \nthey do when they go home--you may say that maybe they shouldn't be in \nthat position, but they are--without anybody even having an opportunity \nto instruct them on how to deal with the baby, what to look for? These \nare very basic little things, just basic things.\n\n  So I contacted the Delaware Medical Association and other doctors in \nDelaware. I wanted to know what their view on this was before I \ncosponsored Senator Bradley's bill. I was pleasantly surprised when the \nleading pediatricians and ob/gyn's showed up at a meeting I held and \nthey unanimously supported the Bradley proposal. It was unanimous. \nUsually, you get some kind of heat when the Government is going to \nindicate that something must be done or when the Government is going to \ndictate something. In this case, it would dictate that an insurance \ncompany can't throw you out in 48 hours or 24 hours if the doctor says \nno. But here you had all these doctors, who are no fans of Government \nintervention, every one of them saying this is important. I will not \ntake the time now to recount what they said because we want to move \nalong. But, they gave me specific story after story, incident after \nincident, in just that one long breakfast meeting, of specific cases \nthey had personally handled. This was 21 or 22 pediatricians and \nobstetricians. It amazed me. The intensity of their political views and \nthe variation of their views was wide.\n  So the only real mystery to me is, why in the devil is it taking us \nso long to pass this? That is the real mystery. The mystery to me is no \nlonger if it is needed; the mystery is no longer that enough Members of \nCongress want it; the mystery to me is, who is stopping it? Why? Who is \nstopping this? Why isn't it done already?\n  Now, you know the fact of the matter is that this is not the usual \nvehicle to pass this. I understand my friend from New Jersey concluded \nthat he is getting all kinds of promises that we can bring this up and \nwill have a chance to vote on it. I have not had a chance to speak to \nhim about this point, but I assume the reason he is attaching it here \nis that his patience is running a little thin. He wants to make sure \nthat before we go out of session we get a chance to act on something \nthat clearly a majority of people want. So the biggest mystery to me is \nnot why it is needed, not why it is important, not why do doctors \nsupport it, not why do mothers support it, but why hasn't it been done?\n  Now, I know that speed was not what my colleague was known for on the \ncourt--I am only joking, Senator. I want to make it clear that he could \ngo to his left and right and he could do everything on the court. He is \na Hall of Famer. But the fact of the matter is, the reason it is not \nbeing done is not for the lack of my friend's pushing it. Although I \nimagine we are going to hear that this is not the vehicle--the HUD \nappropriations bill--to put this on, we are running out of runway and \nrunning out of time. A lot of women and a lot of children are at risk. \nSome would say, oh, what difference does it make to wait another month? \nIn another month we are out of here, which means waiting until next \nyear, and waiting until next year means the end of the next year. So \nthe health and safety of hundreds of thousands of women and children \nare at risk here. It is a really basic proposition.\n  Let me conclude by reiterating one point. A lot of my colleagues and \nindividuals have asked me about this. And because they have not focused \non it, I suspect, they did not understand one of the first points the \nSenator made when he took the floor, and that is, why don't they do it \nat the State level? Why not get this done at the State level? The \nSenator explained ERISA. The bottom line of this is that, in Delaware, \nonly about 15 percent of the people with health insurance would be \naffected by a State law that my State is passing. My State is passing a \nlaw saying leave it to the doctor to decide. Notwithstanding that, \nthose State legislators have come to me and said, we need a national \nlaw, because even with the State acting, and acting promptly, only 15 \npercent--15 percent--of the people with health insurance would be \npositively affected by the State law. To put it another way, the other \n85 percent are out. They are out, without Federal legislation.\n\n  I see Congressman Solomon on the floor. I thank him for his \nleadership. I thank Senator Bradley on this side for calling my \nattention to this and making me realize that this was not some \nexaggerated criticism of HMO's--which I honestly thought was the case \nwhen I first heard it in my State, that this was one of these horror \nstories that had been blown out of proportion. It is real, it is \ngenuine, and the bottom line is that this will make a difference in the \nlives of mothers and their children. We should not wait any longer.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the bill before us, the Newborns' and \nMothers' Health Protection Act of 1996, does one very simple thing. I \nrefer to it as a ``safe haven.'' It guarantees a safe haven for care of \nmothers and their newborn infants during the immediate postdelivery \nperiod. That period of time is 48 hours after delivery, that \npostdelivery period. I have been very aware of the potential for having \nGovernment get too involved, but it does this without excessive \ninterference by the Government in the health care system.\n  As background, maternity care today--many people don't know this--is \nthe most frequent reason for hospitalization today. Hospital stays of \n24 hours or less have indeed become the norm in many parts of the \ncountry for those routine, uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. Sometimes \nhospitalizations are as short as 12 hours and even 6 hours. However, \nadopting this approach of a 6-hour discharge, or even a 12-hour \ndischarge, to the general population, and not being able to predict \nevery time which child will have a ventricular arterial contraction or \na defect, it has not proven to be uniformly successful.\n  This bill ensures appropriate coverage. Let me make it clear. It does \nnot mean 48 hours for everybody in the hospital. People can still be \ndischarged\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\nat 12 hours or 24 hours. What this bill says is that the insurance \ncompany does not decide when you are discharged, but it is you, the \nmother, in consultation with the physician. The physician and mother \ndecide, the two of them, not an insurance company.\n  Why has all of this become an issue today in 1996 when it was not an \nissue 8 or 10 years ago? Over the last several years, we have seen how \nthese progressively shortened hospital stays have, in some cases, hurt \nnew mothers and their infants. These cases that will be referred to \nhave been brought to the attention of physicians, have been brought to \nthe attention of the American people, and have been brought to the \nattention of the U.S. Congress. Problems for both the mothers as well \nas the infants--either one of them--can simply occur with too early a \ndischarge.\n\n  Today with the evolution of care in our rapidly changing health care \nsystem there are certain dynamics which can and do raise their heads \nthat encourage too early discharge overruling the mother and overruling \nwhat the physician regards as being in the best interests of that child \nor that mother. The decision for discharge should remain with the \nhealth care provider in consultation with the mother.\n  Changes in maternity stay have occurred over the last 2 decades. We \nonly need to look back at older brothers and sisters and see how long \nthey were in the hospital, or how long we were kept in the hospital and \ncompare it to today. Mothers used to stay in the hospital routinely for \n5 days or more. At the same time--remember this is not that long ago--\ninfants were frequently isolated from mothers and brought to them only \nat nursing time. And mothers were heavily sedated during birth. And \nfathers very, very rarely were present at the delivery of their infants \nand children.\n  Over time--again it has been over the last 30 years--this type of \ndelivery environment was recognized as being abnormal and unacceptable \nto many people--to parents who asked for more, and who won more \nappropriate care for this most natural of all events; that is birth. \nBut increasing emphasis was placed on returning home as soon as \npossible. Many people wanted to get back home.\n  This legislation does not discourage innovation, creativity, new \nenvironments in which this delivery can be carried out; this birthing \ncan be carried out. Alternatives to hospital delivery have become \navailable. We now have birthing centers under the supervision of other \ntypes of health care providers, not just physicians, but midwives. All \nof this experience which has occurred in the last 20 years has taught \nus much about what is necessary, what is not necessary, what is safe, \nand what is not safe for the delivery during a normal pregnancy. \nMidwives carefully screen their mothers for such deliveries, prepare \nthe parents for this experience, and visit their patients shortly after \ndischarge.\n  And in this framework of carefully-crafted policy mothers and their \nnewborns are frequently ready--yes, ready--to return home as early as 6 \nhours after delivery. But then on the flip side insurers--again not all \ninsurers--but insurers seeing these results have been attracted by the \nsuccessful outcomes and by the opportunity to decrease costs and free \nup funds which can be utilized elsewhere in the system--all of that can \nbe a laudable goal. But an overvigorous institution of a policy of \nearly discharge without enough attention paid to potential consequences \nwhen this approach is inappropriately applied has resulted in the \nsituation in which we find ourselves today.\n  Health care providers--that is physicians and midwives--frequently \nfeel undue pressure to discharge a mother and her infant before they \nbelieve it is in the best interest of their patients. We just simply \ncannot let that happen. I concluded that in this limited situation in \nwhich there has been excess interference in the exercise of a \nphysician's best interest of the patient, a physician's responsibility \nfor his or her patient, Federal legislation is justified.\n  Very quickly, what does this bill do? Number one, as I said, it \nprovides a safe haven of time during which those making the decision \nabout discharge are those most directly involved--the mother--and the \nhealth care provider. Many times I will hear from my medical colleagues \nwho will tell me that sometime in that 48- or 96-hour period a health \ncare provider will receive a phone call, and say, ``We need to \nencourage your patient to leave earlier.'' Then you may think it is in \nthe best interest of that patient. That is simply unsatisfactory today.\n  No. 2, this bill guarantees that in those cases where the provider in \nconsultation with the mother decides that a mother and her newborn can \nsafely leave the hospital before 48 hours, that the insurer, if they \nsay they are in the business of covering maternity benefits during that \n48-hour period, will provide coverage for these timely postdelivery \ncare situations.\n\n  That is very important because some people come, and say, ``You are \nforcing people to stay in the hospital for 48 hours.'' We are not. The \nprovider and the mother decide about discharge. If it is before 48 \nhours, timely care must be given by that insurance company.\n  No. 3, this bill guarantees that there will no longer be undue \npressure in the form of a monetary incentive to either the mother or \nthe health care provider to discharge in less than 48 hours.\n  This bill does not do several things. Again, to understand the bill \nfully, we need to look at those things.\n  First, this bill does not require a mother and her newborn to stay \nany fixed time in the hospital.\n  Second, this bill does not require that a mother go to a hospital to \ndeliver her infant. It allows other types of environments. It allows \ninnovation within our changing health care system.\n  Third, it does not preempt laws or regulations passed by any State \nthat provide already as much or more protection for the mother and her \ninfant than is provided in this bill.\n  Many mothers are ready for early discharge, and many health care \nsystems have the appropriate safeguards in place for this to occur, but \nnot all, and that is why we need this legislation. With time more will \nprovide appropriate prenatal preparation and follow up. However, now \nand in the future, it should always be the health care provider in \nconsultation with the mother who will decide when the mother is ready \nto go home with her newborn child and to what environment.\n  The amendment before the Senate guarantees this period of time which \nI call a safe haven for this decisionmaking process to be carried out. \nIt is the best and the only way to support the successful transition \nfor mother with child to mother caring for child.\n  What will be appropriate for health care in the 21st century? There \nis no way for us to predict now and, thus, in this bill we have the \nflexibility to allow innovative solutions to the problems that may face \nus in the future. It is not a rigid bill.\n  Professional organizations such as the American College of Obstetrics \nand Gynecology and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed the \nbill. Some managed care plans have endorsed the bill as well. The \nNational Association for Home Care has endorsed the bill. The American \nMedical Association supports the bill and their comment is basically \nthat this bill does not dictate medical practice nor lock medical care \ninto statute. It restores the clinical autonomy of doctors and their \npatients to make the best decision about health care for women and \ntheir newborns. It provides flexibility for early discharge when both \nthe mother and physician agree on an abbreviated stay.\n  It is also endorsed by the American Nurses Association, the \nAssociation of Women's Health, Obstetrics and Gynecologic Nurses, the \nMarch of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation, the Consortium for Citizens \nwith Disabilities, the American Association for University Affiliated \nPrograms, and a number of other organizations.\n  Mr. President, I opened by saying that I am not a fan of big \nGovernment intruding into our health care. But in very specific \nsituations--situations where the care of patients is being restricted \nin many ways I think to the detriment of society--there is a point for \nGovernment to stand up. At the same time we must guard against a one-\nsize-fits-all health care system, or to use the Federal Government to \nmicromanage those difficult cost-benefit tradeoffs that every health \ncare plan must make.\n\n[[Page S9907]]\n\n  However, I do believe that there are times when it is appropriate for \nGovernment to provide guidance by setting national rules. This is one \nof those times. The challenge is to do so in a way that protects the \nindividual but still allows the necessary flexibility for the system to \nrespond appropriately and in a timely manner to a rapidly changing \nhealth care environment.\n  This bill does exactly that. Therefore, I urge all of my Senate \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important and timely piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I only want to ask a question. I am not \ngoing to speak.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. After this amendment is \ndisposed of, is there some pending business by order or what will be \nthe pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After the Bradley and Frist amendment is \ndisposed of, the bill will be open for further amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is there a time agreement on the amendment that is \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And do I understand then a Senator taking the floor and \ngetting recognized with an amendment would be the pending business \nafter the disposition of this amendment? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to state to the Senate that when this \nmatter is disposed of, I do intend with the aid and assistance of my \nable friend, Senator Wellstone, to call up the compromise Domenici-\nWellstone mental health coverage issue as an amendment if possible yet \ntoday before we finish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that after this amendment is \ndisposed of, the Domenici-Wellstone amendment be next in line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does the Senator know I asked unanimous consent that \nour amendment be brought up?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I had to reserve the right to object in behalf of \nthe leadership because the manager deserves an opportunity to pass \njudgment on whether that should be granted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I see.\n  Mr. President, I will just take a moment. I certainly thank Senator \nBradley and Senator Frist and other Senators for their leadership, and \nI am very proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I just want to \nmake four points. The first one is the point the Senator from Delaware, \n[Mr. Biden] made.\n  I come from a State where very simple legislation has now been passed \nwith overwhelming support. The problem is, as with so many of the self-\ninsured plans, that people because of ERISA are just not covered at \nall. In Minnesota I think it is about only 40 percent of the people, \nactually a quite smaller percentage in Delaware. So we really have to \ndo this at the Federal level to provide this protection for women, \ntheir husbands and their children.\n\n  My second point, an alarming one, is that too many health plans are \nrefusing to provide the postpartum coverage both women and their \nphysicians feel is necessary. Senator Domenici and I are going to talk \nabout mental health. That is another example where too often in the \nplans you find discrimination or you sort of find a point where some of \nthe limits set are arbitrary. That is exactly what is going on here. \nThis is really an effort to deal with what some people call the drive-\nthrough deliveries.\n  I think this amendment is long overdue. It is not that often we can \npass an amendment or a piece of legislation which so clearly connects \nto people's lives--women's lives, children's lives, husbands' lives, \nfamilies' lives.\n  This is an extremely important amendment.\n  Again, point one is that we do need to do this at the Federal level \nto provide this coverage to people in the United States.\n  My second point is that we do have these drive-through deliveries.\n  Three, as referred to by my colleague from Tennessee, nobody is \nmandating that a mother stay in the hospital 48 hours. My daughter, \nMarcia, had a boy several months ago and in a day was more than ready \nto go home. But what I am worried about is the bottom line becomes the \nonly line, and what you have is people discharged out of the hospital \nwhen they should not be and when they are in need of more assistance or \nwhen their babies are in need of more assistance. So I think it is \nextremely important on those grounds.\n  And the final point, which is different, is that I think this \namendment and the fine work that was done in the House of \nRepresentatives speaks to a broader question. We are not going to get \nto it today, but I really do think that what is going on in the country \nis a major concentration of power in health care. The fact that there \nhave not been a lot of changes taking place in the 104th Congress does \nnot mean that there are not major changes taking place all around the \ncountry.\n  These are rough figures; I am just speaking from memory here, but \nsomething like the nine largest insurance plans control over 60 percent \nof the managed care plans in our country today. I am not trying to make \nany conspiracy argument, but what I am trying to say is when you move \ntoward this kind of concentration of power and you find situations when \nwomen and their babies are leaving the hospitals, really forced to \nleave the hospitals because they do not have the necessary coverage \nwhere they should be there that extra day, that points to a larger set \nof problems, and I think we need to legislatively figure out how to \nbuild more accountability into the system, how to make sure some of the \ncare givers are involved in setting some of these standards, how to \nmake sure that there is more consumer protection, how to make sure that \nwhile we move forward with cost cutting or cost containment, all of \nwhich we need to do, the bottom line is not the only line because when \nit comes to the health of a mother and her newborn or when it comes to \nthe concerns of families, there is nothing more precious than good \nhealth.\n  That is what this amendment speaks to in a very dramatic and very \ndirect way, and I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment. I believe it is a major step toward insuring health for \nnewborn babies and for their mothers. For the last few decades, we have \nmade great progress in medical care, pregnancy and childbirth. I have \nhad the occasion, as my wife has, to see this firsthand. My wife, Fran, \nhad our eight children over a pretty widely spaced period of time. We \nhave had children in the 1960's and 1970's, the 1980's, and the 1990's. \nSo we have seen a lot of changes.\n  The progress during this period of time has certainly been \nmeasurable. In 1968, for example, when our first child, Patrick, was \nborn, there was relatively little in the way of prenatal education for \nthe mother. Since then, with each new child, we have seen some truly \nremarkable improvements: Prenatal child birthing courses now for both \nparents, ultrasound, fetal monitoring during labor to detect problems, \nbirthing rooms which have done a lot to make the whole process much \neasier and certainly much more humane. Fran and I have watched all of \nthese innovations as they were introduced, refined and perfected, and \nwe can both testify that as a result of these improvements today's \nmothers are better prepared to deal with their pregnancies in a healthy \nway and better prepared to give birth.\n  All that being said, we still have a long way to go if we want to \nmake sure new mothers and their babies get the care they need. This \namendment addresses one of the key areas in which we need to make \nsubstantial improvements. We can no longer ignore the fact that today's \nnew mothers and\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\ntheir babies are often being moved out of hospitals far faster than a \nreal concern for their health would allow. This is being done without \nany real consideration for what else needs to be done to compensate for \nthat quick movement out of the hospital, what kind of additional care \nthe mother and child need if the hospital stays are shorter and \nshorter, and shorter. Often, as we have already heard in the Chamber \ntoday, the mother and the baby are moved out of hospitals just 24 hours \nafter the child is born, in some cases even less than that.\n  If you talk to doctors, as I have, they will tell you that they are \nunder a tremendous amount of pressure to keep the new mothers moving \nout the hospital door. The pressure is coming on the doctors, coming on \nthe mothers. It is coming on the hospitals. I think it is wrong. I \nthink it is unconscionable. This is a decision, as Dr. Frist said just \na moment ago, that should be made between the mother and the \ndoctor. That is who should be involved in this decision. It is a \ndecision that should be based on the best interests of the mother and \nthe child. It should not, frankly, be a business decision.\n\n  When our son Patrick was born in 1968, my wife, Fran, stayed in the \nhospital with him for almost 5 days. That was standard operating \nprocedure in Hamilton, OH, in 1968. When our last child, Anna, was born \nin 1992, Fran stayed in the hospital for 36 hours, about a day and a \nhalf.\n  This trend is not bad in and of itself. In some cases, a mother might \nwant to leave the hospital sooner rather than later. For example, back \nin January 1987, my wife Fran had just given birth to our son Mark, \nwhen a blizzard threatened to hit. In fact, she gave birth between two \nblizzards--one had come, then we went to the hospital, then we were \nworrying about the second one coming. So for her the choice was clear: \neither leave the hospital after a day and a half, or risk being stuck \nthere for up to a week. Fran chose to take Mark home. That is what she \ndid. The blizzard came just a few hours after we got home.\n  But it is not, therefore, a question of mandating hospital stays. \nGovernment should not be in the business of doing this. All we are \ntrying to do with this amendment is to make sure it is the mothers and \ntheir doctors who are making this important choice, a choice that \naffects the health of the mother and the child.\n  It is also important that we not look at the number of hours mothers \nspend in the hospital as if it were an isolated issue or an isolated \nproblem. I think we need to pay greater attention to the overall issue \nof postnatal care. The way my wife Fran likes to put it, it is time to \nmake the same kind of investment in improving postnatal care as we have \ninvested in prenatal care in recent years.\n  Let me tell another story which I think illustrates this. Last year, \nour daughter Jill gave birth to our second grandchild. At 10:55 p.m. on \na Wednesday, the birth took place. At 2 a.m., Thursday morning, just \nabout 3 hours later, Jill was being taught how to bathe the baby and \nother necessary information. At 7:30 that morning, they started \nmarching Jill through three or four separate videos on child care. And \nby noon on Friday, she and the baby were out the hospital door. Jill, \nat least, was exhausted.\n  We all realize the doctors and nurses who take care of our young \nmothers and their babies are the best in the world. They are true \nprofessionals with the best combination of competence and compassion. \nBut they have an incredibly long checklist--that is literally what it \nis today--a long checklist of things that they have to teach the new \nmother. Frankly, they do not have enough time to teach it in. Sometimes \nwe forget the new mother needs some time to rest, too, especially after \nan exhausting labor, during which she may well have missed a night's \nsleep. Longer hospital stays very well may be an answer to these \nproblems.\n  But, in addition to that, we have to look at the overall issue, the \noverall issue of postnatal care. Frankly, there ought to be more \nfollowup care for the mothers and their babies. As we heard in \ntestimony in our committee, and as my daughter-in-law Karen just \nexperienced when she had her baby, the enlightened insurance companies, \nthe enlightened HMO's, are now building into the policy, building into \nthe plan, this type of postnatal care, because the fact is that most \ndoctors do not require a followup visit for a week or two. Frankly, as \nparents, sometimes it is hard to take a new baby out before then. We, \ntherefore, need to consider the importance of followup in-home visits. \nThis kind of followup care can make a huge difference, a huge \ndifference in the welfare of the child.\n\n  We had an experience, I think, that would shed a little light on this \nas well. Our youngest child, Anna, was born 5 weeks early, but she \nappeared to be healthy and had no medical problems. My wife, Fran, and \nour daughter Anna, were sent home after 36 hours. But after a few days, \nAnna began to look slightly yellowish. Fran and I really were not \nworried. We knew it was common for breast-fed babies to become slightly \njaundiced. Fran was watching her, and about the fifth day she took her \nto the doctor. It turned out Anna's bilirubin level was dangerously \nhigh. Even as experienced and educated parents--seven other children--\nwe had not noticed the change and had not noticed how fast the change \nwas occurring. If Fran had not taken her in when she did, there could \nhave been medical complications. This whole incident was particularly \nscary for us. We felt we knew the danger signals, but we obviously \nmissed them.\n  This is a case of a mother and father who had seven children, who had \nbeen through this before. If it was tough for us, can you imagine how \ndifficult it must be for a young mother, with no experience at all, to \ndetect some of these medical problems? Therefore, we need to do more in \nthis area. In fact, when we were considering this legislation in the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, some of my colleagues and I added \nthe provision requiring a study of post partum care. I think this study \nis very important and is, in fact, included in the pending amendment.\n  Let me conclude by saying that today we are making, I think, a very \ngood beginning. It is a very good beginning to deal with a problem that \nI have seen firsthand, a problem I have discussed with doctors and a \nproblem that I have discussed with other constituents.\n  So, I commend my colleague from New Jersey, my colleague from \nTennessee, and the other cosponsors of this amendment for the work they \nhave done, the work they have done to refine the amendment and the work \nthey have done to bring it to the floor of the Senate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Bradley \namendment. I want to say to my colleague before he leaves the floor, I \nam going to miss him from this Senate. This is a perfect example. This \nis a Senator who understands what makes a difference in the lives of \nreal people and goes after these issues with great skill.\n  I am so delighted to rise as, I think, the first Senator here who has \never actually given birth to testify that this is a very important \namendment. I believe it will save lives. I believe it will spare \nfamilies a great deal of heartache.\n  I will explain that. First of all, it is just incomprehensible to me \nthat there would be a one-size-fits-all prescription being put out by \nso many of the HMO's today, when, in fact, each particular case is \ndifferent from the one before. Not all women have an easy time giving \nbirth. Not all babies have an easy time being born. There are so many \ncomplications, there are so many differences, so many problems. Senator \nDeWine spoke, I think, from the heart, about having the seventh child \nand still almost missing a serious problem. I am going to address that \nin my remarks, I say to my friend.\n  I think it is important to note that this amendment really gives the \nflexibility where it belongs, to the patient and to the doctor. I \nstrongly believe that, in any medical procedure, any medical issue, \nthat is where the decision belongs, in the hands of the patient and the \nhands of the doctor. Childbirth is one of the most incredible \nexperiences a woman can have. It is probably the most exciting--more \nexciting than winning elections. And, I have to say, it is also very \ndifficult. It is usually very painful. Even in the\n\n[[Page S9909]]\n\nbest of circumstances, where everything just goes according to the \nbook, if there is such a book, it is hard on the woman and it is hard \non the baby--even a perfect birth.\n\n  In the old days when my mother gave birth to me--and that's the old \ndays--she stayed in the hospital for a week or longer. When I had my \nchildren, I stayed in the hospital for several days. It was very \nimportant, because I gave birth to premature babies, and they were \nthere in little incubators. In those days, they did not even let you \nhold the babies, but I so wanted to be close to them, and I was able to \nstay in the hospital several days while I got stronger, and I watched \nthem happily grow stronger.\n  When my daughter gave birth just a year ago, or so, the hospital \nfigured she would stay in for 24 hours. She asked her doctor if she \ncould stay in for 2 days. She felt she needed that extra day. \nFortunately, he intervened on her behalf and she got to stay in for 48 \nhours and was very grateful for that.\n  I do not think that should be a gift from an insurance company. I \nthink that ought to be something that is absolutely a right of a \npatient. When we have gone from women staying in the hospital for a \nweek or 10 days down to where they are being thrown out after a day, \nbelieve me, women are not any stronger today physically than they were \nthen. It is the same thing. So it just doesn't add up.\n  Particularly new mothers need that option, it seems to me. They need \nto know how to nurse their children. That may sound strange, but I want \nto say for the benefit of my colleagues that nursing a baby takes a \nlittle bit getting used to. You have to learn how to do it. That added \nday in the hospital is very important to become comfortable with your \nbaby, to understand the signs to look for if there is trouble. And that \nbrings me to the issue that Senator DeWine spoke about, the jaundice.\n  The fact is that many babies do become jaundiced, and it is easy to \ntreat it with light, if you know what to look for. But many of these \nmothers, because it takes a while for the jaundice to develop, are out \nof that hospital within 24 hours and are not prepared, and terrible \nconsequences can flow from that.\n  In the case of my own grandchild, they noticed something right before \nthey left. They told her to watch for jaundice, and it happened. They \nhad to come over and bring the little light boxes into the home.\n  So I just want to say to my colleague, that added chance, that extra \n24 hours can make a great difference. I am very glad he put in the \nRecord that Kaiser Permanente supports this. They are a huge HMO in \nCalifornia. I could not be more proud of them for that.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for bringing an issue to the floor of the \nSenate that is extremely important to the families of America. I am so \nproud that I had a moment or five or six to speak to your amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I, too, rise to speak in support of the Bradley-Frist \namendment. I am going to be very brief this afternoon, but I did want \nto take a minute or two and discuss a General Accounting Office report \nthat I will have coming out next week. The General Accounting Office \nhas summarized a number of findings in a report for me, which report \nwill be available next week, and I would like to discuss those findings \nvery briefly.\n\n  First, it seems to me that, if you pass this important legislation, \nour country increases the odds that the next generation gets off to a \nhealthy start. That is what this legislation is all about: getting off \nto a healthy start.\n  As I mentioned, I asked the General Accounting Office a number of \nmonths ago to help the Congress identify the risks attributable to \nforeshortened hospital stays for mothers and their newborns, as well as \nto analyze health care plans on how well they provide postpartum care.\n  The General Accounting Office has given me a letter, Mr. President, \nthat I will make a part of the Record this afternoon, but I would like \nto summarize very briefly just four of the findings in the General \nAccounting Office report that they will have next week.\n  The first is the General Accounting Office has pinpointed studies \nanalyzing readmission statistics that indicate that babies staying less \nthan 48 hours do, in fact, have a higher rate of rehospitalization for \nhealth problems.\n  The General Accounting Office concludes that not every early \ndischarge is a danger to each and every child, but certainly there are \nstudies that do indicate that readmission statistics demonstrate that \nbabies staying less than 48 hours do, in fact, have a higher rate of \nrehospitalization.\n  Second, the General Accounting Office has found that a number of the \ndischarge plans are simply that they are just a drive-by delivery with \nno at-home follow up to ensure that the mother and the child are doing \nwell.\n  Third, the General Accounting Office has found that while a number of \nthe States do have laws on the books that deal with this practice, not \nall of the insured individuals, and certainly some of the most \nvulnerable of America's families, are protected by these laws. So I \nthink it is fair to conclude that there is a very significant variation \nwith respect to consumer protection in terms of State laws, and I think \nthat, too, makes a compelling argument for the Bradley-Frist \nlegislation.\n  Fourth--and I close with this point, because I think it is the most \nsignificant one and, in and of itself, makes the case for the Bradley-\nFrist bipartisan legislation--the General Accounting Office has found \nthat a significant number of plans offer doctors alternative financial \nincentives for early discharge and significant penalties for keeping \nyoung mothers and babies in the hospital longer than the plans would \nlike. So what we have--and I point out that this will be the first \nGovernment study looking at this problem--is already significant \nevidence that two sets of disincentives to good health for young \nfamilies exists on the basis of the GAO report: first, the question of \nplans offering financial incentives for early discharge and, second, \nthe matter of heavy penalties that the GAO has found in a number of \ninstances for keeping young mothers and babies in the hospital longer \nthan the plans would like.\n  What it comes down to--and I sure hope we get a unanimous vote in a \nfew minutes with respect to this legislation--is that this Congress has \na chance to put some votes behind all of the family-friendly rhetoric.\n  I am very hopeful that the Bradley-Frist legislation will pass on a \nbipartisan basis. I think that the Senator from New Jersey has \ncontributed so much, but what an important bill on which to finish a \nstellar career.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from the General Accounting Office to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       GAO, Health, Education, and\n\n\n                                      Human Services Division,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1996.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: To contain costs, some health care \n     plans have adopted guidelines to shorten hospital stays \n     associated with maternity care--the most common condition \n     requiring hospitalization. Some plans have limited hospital \n     coverage for mothers and their newborns to a maximum of 24 \n     hours after delivery. As a result, between 1980 and 1994, the \n     percent of 1-day postpartum hospital stays rose from about 9 \n     percent to about 40 percent of all births. Many in the \n     medical community have voiced concerns that these shortened \n     stays expose newborns to undue risks.\n       To better understand the issues involved, you asked us to \n     (1) identify the risks that are attributable to short \n     hospital stays for maternity care, (2) examine health plan \n     actions to ensure quality postpartum care for short-stay \n     mothers and newborns, and (3) determine state responses to \n     concerns about patient protection. To do this study, we \n     analyzed pertinent trend data and interviewed medical experts \n     and representatives from hospital maternity programs, managed \n     care organizations, home health agencies, medical specialty \n     societies, and health care trade associations. In briefing \n     your staff on our work, we noted that our report would be \n     available by the end of next week. In the interim, you asked \n     us to summarize the results of our work. Our key findings \n     include the following:\n       Guidelines issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics \n     suggest--notwithstanding the presence of complications--\n     either minimum 2-day stays for vaginal deliveries and 4-day \n     stays for caesarean sections or shorter stays if: (1) Medical \n     stability criteria are\n\n[[Page S9910]]\n\n     met, (2) the decision on length of stay is agreed to by \n     physician and patient, and (3) provisions are made for \n     timely, comprehensive followup care delivered by a maternity \n     care professional.\n       Neither researchers nor medical experts agree about the \n     direct effect of short stays on maternal and newborn health. \n     Using hospital readmission rates as an indicator of adverse \n     outcome, one recent study shows no association between the \n     number of days a newborn spends in the hospital and the rate \n     of readmission, while other studies show increased risk \n     for newborns discharged within 48 hours of birth.\n       Some plans allow physicians flexibility to apply early \n     discharge policies selectively. In addition, they have \n     programs of maternity care services that include intensive \n     prenatal assessment and education and comprehensive followup \n     care provided within 72 hours of discharge by a trained \n     professional at home or in a clinic. We found, however, that \n     some plans with shortened postpartum stays do not provide \n     adequate prenatal education or appropriate followup services. \n     For example, some plans' followup care consists of a phone \n     call rather than an actual home or office visit.\n       Early discharge policies have prompted more than half the \n     states to enact laws that regulate the length of maternity \n     stays but vary widely in degree of consumer protection and do \n     not apply to all insured individuals. For example, states \n     vary on whether the law specifies stay minimums, identifies \n     discharge decision makers, or mandates number of home visits \n     covered, among other things. The laws are also limited in \n     jurisdictional scope in that they: (1) Do not apply to plans \n     that are exempt from state regulation under the Employee's \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) or (2) may not \n     apply to individuals living in one state but working and \n     receiving insurance in another.\n       Federal legislation has been introduced to make maternity \n     care more consistent nationally and available to all \n     privately insured women. The Senate is considering S. 969, \n     Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, which would \n     mandate a minimum 48-hour hospital stay for normal vaginal \n     deliveries and 96-hour stays for caesarean section deliveries \n     unless the attending provider, in consultation with the \n     mother, makes the decision to discharge early and coverage is \n     provided for prescribed timely followup care. Timely care is \n     defined as care provided in a manner that meets the health \n     care needs of the mother and newborn, provides for \n     appropriate monitoring of their conditions, and occurs within \n     24-72 hours immediately following discharge. These provisions \n     are consistent with the findings contained in our forthcoming \n     report.\n       We hope that this information meets your needs in \n     considering proposed federal legislation on hospital length \n     of stays for maternity care. Please call me on (202) 512-7119 \n     if you or your staff have any questions regarding the issues \n     discussed above.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                              Sarah F. Jaggar,\n\n                                        Health Service Quality and\n                                             Public Health Issues.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and will make for the \nSenators a copy of the General Accounting Office's findings a matter of \nthe Record. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  I am so glad Senator Bradley came to me sometime back in October \nabout this legislation and asked if I could become a cosponsor, which I \nreadily did. I have not been a mother myself, but I have been around \nmothers. I am the husband of one, the father of two, and potentially \nthe grandfather of five.\n  In any case, this Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, as it \nis formally titled, will be beneficial to countless mothers and their \nnewborn children, because it will restore health care decisions to \nthose best suited to make them--the mothers and their doctors--\nwhile making certain that new mothers and their babies are allowed to \nremain in the hospital at least 48 hours following natural births and \n96 hours after Caesareans.\n\n  As Senators have already pointed out several times, in some instances \nnew mothers and their babies are forced to leave the hospital as early \nas 8 hours after delivery because insurance companies often refuse to \npay the bills otherwise.\n  It simply is unconscionable to require a new mother and her doctor to \nmake this decision based on arbitrary insurance deadlines. That is what \nthe distinguished Senator from New Jersey had in mind. I compliment him \non this amendment and I am honored to be a cosponsor.\n  I am not alone in my contention that mothers and their physicians are \nbetter able to determine what is needed to promote a mother's and \nchild's health rather than some arbitrary insurance deadline.\n  As a matter of fact, a Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center study \nconcluded that babies released earlier than 48 hours after birth had a \n50-percent greater chance of needing readmission to the hospital and a \n70-percent increased risk of emergency room visits.\n  Mr. President, the too-early discharges so often lead to jaundice \nwhich afflicts approximately one-third of newborns, dehydration \nresulting from breast-feeding difficulties and infections. Although \nthese conditions are of course treatable, each must be diagnosed \nquickly, within 3 to 5 days, lest they result in brain damage or worse.\n  Mr. President, in recent years hospitals around the Nation have \nreported an increasing number of babies being readmitted to hospitals \nwith complications of dehydration and jaundice.\n  A Virginia infant suffered dehydration-induced brain damage, and \nsevere dehydration of a Cincinnati baby led to the amputation of his \nleg. The truth is that these tragedies could have been prevented with \nlonger hospital stays.\n  Back in the 1970's, postbirth hospital stays were about 4 or 5 days \nfor routine normal births, and 1 to 2 weeks for Caesareans. According \nto the Centers for Disease Control, the median length of \nhospitalization between 1970 and 1992 for mothers having normal births \ndeclined by 46 percent, from 3.9 to 2.1 days, and by 49 percent for \nmothers having Caesareans, from 7.8 to 4 days.\n  There is broad agreement, I think, about the importance of reducing \nhealth care costs and I agree with that. While I am convinced that this \ngoal can best be accomplished through less, not more, Federal \nregulations, I also insist that the well-being of mothers and babies \nmust not be compromised in the process. This amendment addresses a \nunique, isolated problem which can be addressed by a carefully crafted \nFederal rule. And that is exactly what Senator Bradley has done. And I \ncompliment him for offering this amendment.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection \nAct of 1996, will ensure that arbitrary insurance guidelines do not \noverride the objective of healthy births.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator would withhold that.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I withhold.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, when I heard about this amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey originally, my first thought was, why is the \nFederal Government getting involved in deciding how long hospital stays \nare? It seemed to me that was a matter that quite properly should be \nhandled by States. And indeed in my State we have handled it. We have a \nbill, the best as I understand it, that is very similar to the \nsuggestion of the bill proposed by the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Indeed, I made notes of the Senator's remarks. He indicated that some \n28 States have taken action. That does not mean they have gone the \ncomplete route--and the Senator can obviously explain that further--but \nI take it some 28 States have dealt with this matter of how long a \nhospital stay should be or could be.\n  So I will confess that my original reaction was unfavorable to the \nSenator's proposal. However, two things happened. For one thing, my \ndaughter called me. She has four children and she has some views on \nthis subject. And also the ERISA point that the Senator raised. And I \nwould like to explore that if I might.\n  Finally, the so-called Frist amendment. I am not sure exactly what \nthe Frist amendment does. But my first question would be, of the \nSenator from New Jersey, as I understand it--first, I want to say, I \nlistened to his arguments. One of his arguments is that you need a \nnational law because you might have the State wherein the individual \nresides on a town right on the border of another State where the \nhospital is that serves that town, and the other State does not have \nthe legislation.\n\n[[Page S9911]]\n\n  However, I thought the most telling argument he made was the so-\ncalled ERISA argument. That is, as I understand it, that because ERISA \napplies to those corporations that have interstate health care plans, \nthat the ERISA law prevents the State government--and we dealt with \nthis, of course, when we were dealing with the health care business in \n1994--the ERISA prevents the State law from getting involved with the \nplans that are covered by the ERISA statute.\n  I had not thought of that. And so first, if the Senator would be good \nenough to explain a little bit on that. Is that point correct?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island, yes, the Senator is correct. For example, we have had on \nthe floor today the Senator from Delaware speaking. One of the largest \nemployers in his State is DuPont. And we had the Senator from Minnesota \nspeaking. One of the larger employers in his State is 3M. Each has what \nis known as a self-ensured ERISA plan. And under a State law, in \nMinnesota or Delaware, as each of the Senators has testified today on \nthe floor, it could not reach those plans in requiring them to allow 48 \nhours for delivery. Only this Federal law would achieve that objective.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So your point is, to follow it up, it only would be a \nFederal law that would deal with that situation. The State law could \nnot affect it.\n  The second point that would be helpful--maybe I should address this \nto the Senator from Tennessee. I am not sure exactly what the Frist \namendment is. What does it do?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I think I can answer. Essentially, the differences \nbetween the first- and second-degree amendments are minimal. The only \ndifference relates to a deletion of the sentence that essentially is \ninconsequential but was confusing, and the second-degree amendment adds \na sentence that gives some flexibility to health plans.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, is this the so-called Kaiser Permanente language? Is \nthat in the first amendment?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I say to the Senator that in the first amendment is \nlanguage that does allow some flexibility, and I think it would be in \nthe first amendment. I think Kaiser Permanente endorsed both the first- \nand the second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, the final question, the number of States that have \ndealt with this you say is 28 in total or in part?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The answer to the question is yes, 28 States have passed \nlaws that require insurers to provide 48 hours for a delivery, coverage \nfor 48 hours for delivery.\n  As the Senator has pointed out, there are a few gaps there. One is \nthe ERISA problem; the other is the problem of the hospital that is \nacross a State line in a State that is uncovered. Then there is the New \nJersey problem. I guess some other State law might have that problem, \nbut in New Jersey the State passed a law that said that the State \nrequirement of 48 hours would apply to only those insurance companies \nthat were headquartered in New Jersey. So you could be headquartered in \nanother State and you would not be covered. This could get at that \nissue as well.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator for that description.\n  As I say, I am troubled by the U.S. Congress getting involved in an \nissue like this. I found the explanation, particularly the ERISA \nargument, to be a very telling argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just to sort of further clarify, the Kaiser \nPermanente language was basically a clarification of the way it was \nwritten. It was written in the bill that if you are discharged in fewer \nhours than 48 hours--this bill says you have a safe haven for 48 hours \nand followup care has to be somewhere--you have to have care for 48 \nhours. You cannot be dumped out of the hospital after 6 hours, and that \nis the end of it.\n  What Kaiser said is you need to make it clear that it is the health \ncare provider who determines, in consultation with the mother, as to \nwhere that followup care is delivered. In other words, it is not just \nup to the mother as to where the followup care during the 48 hours was \ndelivered. That was written into the bill.\n  My amendment was to clarify that further.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I think that is an important point. I will \ngive my qualifications in the area. I had six children. I suppose that \nwould give me some knowledge about this subject.\n  As I understand it, if a mother should choose to leave in 24 hours--\nobviously, that is a big savings to the insurance company; say it cost \n$1,000 a day in a hospital, and I do not think that is outrageous and \nthat suggestion is pretty much on the mark, or something like that--it \nmay well be that the mother would vastly prefer being home but have \nsome help at home, and maybe that help would extend for 5 days. How do \nyou handle that?\n  Mr. FRIST. The health care plan can put whatever they want in. It has \nto be a minimum of 48 hours coverage. That coverage can be in any \nfacility that the mother and the physician decide--not the health \ninsurance plan--that they decide, during that 48-hour period. After \nthat 48 hours after vaginal delivery or 72 hours after a C-section, it \ncan be dictated by the insurance company.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So in other words, the mother could say, ``I want to go \nhome in 24 hours,'' but she would get the care, somebody at home would \ncare, if she wanted, for the next 24 hours?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is right. It could be at home, a followup clinic, a \nbirthing clinic. That is why it was important in this bill to give the \nflexibility. We do not know how babies will be delivered 4 years from \nnow.\n  Initially, it was fairly rigid, 48 hours in the hospital. Now the \nbill is flexible enough to say for 48 hours you are covered, and it can \nbe in the setting that you and your doctor decide, not some insurance \ncompany or not somebody sitting 500 miles away behind a telephone.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Bradley amendment denies consumers the \nright to select the type of insurance coverage they wish to purchase. \nWhile I would hope all policies would include the type of maternity \ncoverage he suggests, for the Federal Government to mandate it is a \nmistake. It establishes a precedent that consumers are no longer free \nto choose. I thus oppose the amendment.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nexpress my support for the Bradley amendment.\n  A few weeks ago Congress made an important step in the right \ndirection of adding necessary reform to our health care system. By \nlimiting exclusions for pre-existing conditions and by making health \ninsurance coverage portable, we answered the concerns of millions of \nAmericans that they will lose their access to health care. While I \nbelieve universal health coverage should be the ultimate goal, the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act represented a practical, incremental, and \ncaring attempt to deal with the real health care problems facing so \nmany Americans, based on their everyday realities.\n  Similarly, the Bradley amendment makes an important step in the right \ndirection. It is hard to conceptualize that the growing trend among \nhealth insurers is to force new mothers and their infants to leave the \nhospital 24 hours after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and 72 hours \nafter a cesarean section. In many cases, 24 hours is not sufficient \ntime to recover physically from the birth, not to mention have time to \nlearn essential child care information. You would think that this alone \nwould be sufficient to warrant allowing new mothers to stay longer in \nthe hospital. Having a mother who is strong and prepared to care for \nher new child will avoid unnecessary return visits to the hospitals due \nto insufficient care.\n  It is also important to note that many of the health problems \nnewborns face such as dehydration and jaundice do not appear until \nafter the first 24 hours of life. If undiagnosed, these easily \ntreatable conditions can lead to brain damage, strokes, and in the \nworst case scenarios, death. There is no justification against \nmonitoring babies that we know may be at risk for clearly preventable \nhealth conditions.\n\n  I do not believe that this bill is the panacea for health problems \nfacing mothers and newborns in this Nation. The proportion of babies \nborn at low birth-weight in the United States has been rising since \n1984, and is now at its highest level since 1976. Nearly 300,000\n\n[[Page S9912]]\n\nbabies, 7.2 percent of all those born in 1993, were born at low birth-\nweight. These infants were more vulnerable to infant death and serious \nhealth problems, such as developmental delays, cerebral palsy, and \nseizure disorders, as a result of their shaky start in life.\n  We need to focus more attention on making our children healthy on the \nfront-end so that we never have to have a discussion about how long a \nnew mother and baby should stay in a hospital. In 1993, almost 200,000 \nchildren were born to women who received either no prenatal care or \nprenatal care after the first trimester of their pregnancy. Good \nprenatal care can reduce rates of low-weight births and infant \nmortality, thus preventing disabilities and savings billions of dollars \nwhich are spent each year on caring for very sick newborns.\n  While the Bradley amendment is far from the total answer to the \nhealth problems of new mothers and their children, we should not \nunderestimate the importance of what we will be achieving if this \npolicy becomes law. Protecting the ability for mothers and infants to \nremain in the hospital up to 48 hours for vaginal deliveries and 96 \nhours for cesarean births has been endorsed by all four major medical \ngroups which involved in maternal health and caring for newborns: the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American \nNurses' Association.\n  I want to conclude by congratulating Senators Bradley, Kassebaum, and \nFrist for their leadership and for all the hard work they have put in \nto building momentum for this important amendment. I strongly urge the \nSenate to adopt the Bradley amendment. I urge all of my colleagues to \nthink about how much this bill means to Americans all across this \ncountry, and how critically necessary it is to make this improvement in \nour health care system. This amendment is another good step in the \nright direction.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senator Bradley \nand Senator Kassebaum, for their leadership in bringing this important \nlegislation before the Senate for consideration. Current trends in \nhealth care financing have created a clear need for this legislation. \nDoctors are under increasing pressure from insurance companies to \ndischarge mothers and newborns earlier and earlier.\n  Until a few years ago, the birth of a child was typically followed by \na 4-day hospital stay for the mother and her newborn, so that mothers \nhad time to recover from labor and delivery, and learn about the care \nof their infants. Health care providers had adequate time to watch the \ninitial development of the newborns carefully, to assure that the \nbabies were healthy. This initial period of expert observation is \ncritical, since it means early diagnosis and immediate response and \ntreatment when complications develop.\n  Now, however, the length of stay following a normal delivery is \ncommonly only a day or two, and in many cases, even less.\n  To some extent, this change results from better medical management of \nchildbirth, and greater responsiveness to women's desire for a less \nhospital-centered and more family centered experience of childbirth. \nBut the dominant motivation behind these shortened stays, however, is \nthe financial incentive to reduce the cost of childbirth, which is the \nmost common cause of hospitalization in the United States. Profit, not \nsound medical judgement is driving the increasingly serious problem of \ndrive-through deliveries.\n  The guidelines of the major medical societies provide for at least 2 \ndays of hospitalization after a normal delivery, to give mothers \nadequate time to recover and learn to care for their infant in a \nrestful atmosphere where professional help is immediately available.\n  Serious harm can result if a mother and her newborn are released too \nsoon. Conditions such as jaundice and dehydration typically do not \nappear until after the first 24 hours of life. Recent research in \nMassachusetts shows that babies discharged less than 1 day after birth \nhave a 25 times higher rate of not being screened for treatable \ncongenital disorders, compared with babies who stay longer.\n  Many serious condition are not easy to detect. Long-term \ndisabilities--even death--may result. Congress should not acquiesce in \nirresponsible insurance industry practices that put profits ahead of \nfamilies and the bottom-line ahead of babies. This legislation will \nguarantee that mothers and their doctors--not insurance companies--\ndecide when to leave the hospital after childbirth.\n  This legislation was written in accord with the recommendations of \nthe two leading medical societies with expertise in this area--the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics. They endorse this amendment. There is clear \nagreement among these experts that hospital stays should range from 48 \nhours for normal deliveries to 96 hours for cesarean sections.\n  By adopting this legislation, the Senate will not be requiring \nmothers and newborns to stay in the hospital unnecessarily. In many \ncases, mothers, in consultation with their doctors, will elect to go \nhome early. But this amendment will guarantee that patient choice and \nmedical judgment guide this decision--not insurance company orders.\n  I urge the Senate to support this important legislation. It has \nbroad, bipartisan support. It is endorsed by the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the \nAssociation of Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses, and the \nMarch of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. It is appropriate--indeed \noverdue--for the Federal Government to set these minimum standards for \nhealth and safety. Newborns should not be placed at risk for the sake \nof insurance industry profits.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the newborns' \nand mothers' health protection amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof this legislation. This amendment is about family friendly health \ncare. It puts the care of mothers and babies before the financial \ninterests of insurance companies. It puts into practice what we have \nalways preached--to honor the mother and to defend motherhood.\n  This amendment requires that insurance companies provide coverage for \ncare for a minimum of 48 hours after a vaginal delivery and 96 hours \nafter a caesarean section. It allows mothers and infants to be \ndischarged earlier if there is appropriate follow-up care. This is \nconsistent with the practice guidelines issued jointly by the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG] and the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics [AAP].\n  What I like about this amendment is that what we explicitly state as \nour values, we implicitly practice in public policy and public law. \nWhat we do with this legislation is ensure that mothers and their \nbabies receive the care that they need, that is deemed appropriate by \ntheir physicians. On both sides of the political aisle, we talk about \nputting families first. This amendment does that. It puts value on \nmotherhood.\n  This whole movement around providing care for 48 hours or 96 hours or \nwhatever is medically appropriate came from mothers themselves. Then it \nwas the movement of the extraordinary medical facilities that were \nwilling to step forward and even defy the insurance companies. St. \nAgnes Hospital in my hometown of Baltimore insisted that they would \nprovide this care if they had to do it out of a charitable endowment or \nif we all had to pitch in and do bake sales. St. Agnes took a stand--\nthey were going to assure that mothers and their babies got what they \nneeded when they needed it. That resulted in the Maryland general \nassembly acting--and now I am proud to say that Maryland has a law that \nreally mirrors in many ways what we are doing in the Federal \nlegislation.\n  So, I salute Senator Bradley for offering this amendment, but I also \nsalute the mothers who organized, and the doctors and medical \nfacilities who defied the insurance companies. I want to see managed \ncare, but I don't want to see doctors managed. There is a fundamental \ndistinction. We have to start getting our priorities straight and \ndecide where we are going to be making our decisions. And in the case \nof newborns and their mothers--I believe decisions need to be made in \nthe delivery room and not the boardroom.\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Newborns and Mothers\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\nHealth Protection Act, I am extremely pleased to rise in support of \nthis amendment to the VA/HUD appropriations bill. My colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Bradley, has worked steadfastly and diligently for well \nover a year to bring this important bill to the floor, and I commend \nhim for his tireless efforts. I share his concern over the growing \npractice of what has come to be known as drive-thru deliveries, and I \nbelieve that this practice of discharging new mothers and their infants \ntoo soon after delivery is simply unacceptable.\n  This amendment requires health plans to provide coverage for a \nminimum hospital stay for a mother and her newborn infant following \ndelivery, in accordance with established medical guidelines. These \nguidelines, developed in 1983 by the American College of Gynecologists \nand Obstetricians and the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend \nthat mothers remain in the hospital for 48 to 96 hours after giving \nbirth, depending on the type of delivery. Shorter hospital stays are \npermitted if the physician, in consultation of the mother, determines \nthat is the best course of action. For those mothers and newborns who \nleave the hospital after staying less than 48 or 96 hours, followup \ncare within 72 hours of discharge must be provided in order to monitor \nboth the mother and the infant during this vulnerable time.\n  Since 1970, the average hospital stay for newborns has been cut \nalmost exactly in half. Today, many insurers provide for only a 24-hour \nstay for deliveries, while some medical plans call for discharging \nwomen within 8 to 12 hours of a birth. Usually, women are not informed \nof these policies until they are already in the hospital. Many doctors \nwho decide, based on their best medical judgment, that their patients \nshould stay beyond the short time-frame are overruled by insurance \ncompanies. Others are unduly pressured to release these women and their \nbabies prematurely.\n  There are certain myths surrounding the impact of this bill, so I \nwould like to clarify what this bill does not do. It does not \nmandate how long a mother and baby must stay in the hospital. It simply \nstates that these patients may stay in the hospital up to the minimum \nperiod recommended by established medical guidelines. Insurers are \npermitted, and even encouraged, to develop alternatives to inpatient \ncare, and to allow doctors, in consultation with their patients, to \nselect the type of care which is most appropriate for a mother and her \nbaby.\n\n  I believe that this bill is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation this Congress has and will consider in the 104th Congress. \nTo date, stories abound about women whose infants have suffered \nphysical harm and even death as the result of early discharge policies. \nNo woman or family should have to endure such tragedy.\n  Often, doctors are not able to detect certain health problems in \ninfants within the first 12 or 24 hours after birth. For example, \ndoctors may be unable to detect jaundice--a disorder which may lead to \npermanent brain damage--within the first day after birth. Other infants \nhave been released before their doctors had time to test them for PKU--\nan easily treated metabolic disorder that causes mental retardation if \nnot detected early enough.\n  In addition, early discharge deprives mothers of important \nopportunities to learn how best to care for their infants, including \nproper breast feeding techniques. Problems with breast feeding can \ncause infants to suffer severe medical complications--even death--from \ndehydration. Hospitals report that increasing numbers of women and \ntheir children are returning for care after discovering problems such \nas life-threatening infections that could have been caught if the \nmother and child had been able to stay in the hospital just a little \nbit longer. While the financial costs of hospital readmissions \nresulting from early discharge can be astronomic, the human costs can \nbe truly tragic.\n  Twenty-eight States have passed maternity stay laws similar to this \nbill, including my home State of Maine. However, State legislation \nalone does not sufficiently protect the women of America and their \nnewborns. For example, many women are not protected by State \nlegislation because they work for employers with self-insured plans \nshielded by Federal ERISA preemption. In addition, women who live in \none State and work in another may find themselves vulnerable without \nFederal legislation.\n  Don't we owe it to the women of America and to our very youngest \ncitizens--those who are only a few days old--to ensure that they enjoy \nthe full protections and benefits of one of the best health care \nsystems in the world?\n  There is nothing more precious than the birth of a child. There is \nnothing more tragic than the death of an infant that could have been \nprevented. That is why we must leave it to doctors, not insurers, to \ndecide how long women stay in the hospital following delivery in \naccordance with established medical guidelines. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this important amendment.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the \namendment offered by Senator Bradley, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health \nProtection Act.\n  Supporters of this legislation contend that it is becoming a widely \nused cost-containment practice of health insurers to force the \npremature discharge of mothers and their newborns from the hospital \nfollowing childbirth. In other words, insurance companies supposedly \nare improperly influencing doctors' medical decisions regarding the \nappropriate lengths of stay for mothers and newborns following \nchildbirth. The remedy proposed in this amendment would require \ninsurance companies to cover at least 48 hours of inpatient care \nfollowing an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and 96 hours following a \ncesarean delivery.\n  Mr. President, I certainly share the concerns which have been \nexpressed in this debate regarding the health and safety of mothers and \ntheir newborn children. I am troubled, however, over the construction \nof this legislation. Not only would this amendment become the first \nFederal law to mandate health insurance benefits, it also comes \ndangerously close to being a statutory prescription for the practice of \nmedicine.\n  I believe that no one is more qualified than a woman's doctor to \njudge how long that woman and her newborn child should stay in the \nhospital following childbirth. Just as I believe that an insurance \ncompany has no business second guessing this decision, I firmly believe \nthat the Government also has no prerogative to interfere.\n  While I realize that this legislation does not require a woman and \nnewborn to spend 48 hours in the hospital after childbirth; the \nconstruction of this amendment, and the specification of 48 and 96 \nhours of coverage, strongly implies that these figures are some sort of \nlegally significant standard for the length of stay.\n  The sponsors of this legislation argue that legislation is necessary \nto ensure that mothers and newborns are assured an appropriate hospital \nstay following childbirth. Obviously, the appropriate length of stay \nwill depend on each mother and child individually, and the attending \ndoctor is the most qualified authority to make this decision. I am \nconcerned that, according to this amendment's construction, the \ndecision of the doctor is made an exception to the legislation's 48 and \n96 hour standards, rather than the rule.\n  If it is necessary to pass legislation to assure the health and \nsafety of mothers and newborns, then we should do it by protecting the \nauthority of doctors to make medical decisions regarding their \npatients, free from interference from both insurance companies and the \nGovernment. We should not replace insurance company interference with \nGovernment interference.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nNewborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996 introduced by \nSenators Bill Bradley, Nancy Kassebaum, and Bill Frist.\n  This bipartisan legislation--with the support of 52 Senate \ncosponsors--will help ensure that newborns and their mothers will have \nthe best possible beginning.\n  Unfortunately, a pattern has begun to develop throughout this country \nof pushing mothers and their newborns out of the hospital too quickly. \nToo often, some health insurance plans covering the costs of childbirth \noffer very limited benefits for post partum hospital stays.\n  Sometimes the coverage is limited to as little as 24 hours, which in \nmany\n\n[[Page S9914]]\n\ncases is not long enough to ensure that a mother and her infant remain \nhealthy after their hospital discharge. Sometimes doctors have found \nthat insurers refuse to agree to longer hospital stays, even when the \ndoctor argues the mother and newborn need to remain in the hospital \nlonger.\n  It is the first couple of days following the birth of a child that \nare the most critical to ensure the long-term health of both the infant \nand mother. Many mothers have difficulty in learning how to properly \nbreast feed, putting their infants at risk of inadequate nutrition in \ntheir first days of life. Likewise some mothers are just not physically \ncapable of providing for a newborn's care needs within 24 hours of \ngiving birth.\n  Medically, many health problems experienced by newborns do not show \nup until after the first 24 hours of life. These include jaundice and \ndehydration, and other conditions that only health professionals can \ndetect. Early hospital discharges can mean these conditions go \nundetected until it is too late.\n  The length of a hospital stay is a question that should not be driven \nby the limitations of an insurance policy, but should be the joint \nmedical decision of the mother and her physician.\n  Under this bill, if both the mother and her doctor agree that a \nshorter post partum stay is acceptable, the stay can be shortened. \nHowever, in these situations--and this is the key distinction--the \ndecision will still be a medical one, rather than a financial one.\n\n  This bill will require all health care insurance plans, which offer \nmaternity benefits, to cover post-partum stays of at least 48 hours \nafter a vaginal birth, and at least 96 hours after a caesarean section. \nThe bill's hospital stay requirements are consistent with post \nchildbirth guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n  This bill will end these drive-through baby deliveries, which push \nmothers and their newborns out of the hospital before they are \nmedically ready to go home. Such drive-through deliveries put the \nhealth of both mothers and their babies at risk. A mother and her \nnewborn's homecoming should be a time of celebration, not a time of \ntrepidation because neither was ready to leave the hospital.\n  In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released \nits study of New Jersey's maternity stay law. Following enactment of \nThe State's law, the CDC found that new mothers who had problem free \ndeliveries were the mothers who had stayed in the hospital \napproximately 10 to 12 hours longer than mothers had prior to the law. \nThe CDC research appears to indicate that just a few hours longer in \nthe hospital can result in major improvements in the health of both the \nmother and the newborn baby. The importance of those few more hours \ncannot be underestimated.\n  Many managed care plans place the care of the mother and newborn \ninfant at the forefront.\n  But many other managed care plans appear to have put the bottomline \nof profitability ahead of the real medical needs of newborns and their \nmothers. Those managed care plans should view this bill as a heads up. \nCutting medical costs will not be allowed to undermine the quality of \nhealth care.\n  We all acknowledge the need for controlling health care costs, and \nsupport efforts to curtail unnecessary spending. But there also must be \na reality check when cost cutting goes so far, that the quality of \nhealth care is endangered.\n  We want every newborn child to have the best chance for long-term \nhealth. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this legislation to \ngive mothers and newborns the assurance that their health needs will \nalways be paramount.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Senator \nBradley's amendment to require health insurance plans to cover hospital \nmaternity stays for 48 hours for routine deliveries and 96 hours for \ncesarean deliveries.\n  The issue here in whether the decision on how long a mother and her \nnewborn stay in the hospital is based on the mother's health or the \ninsurance company's bottom line.\n  I believe it is a medical decision that should be made by a doctor \nand a patient.\n  Before 1970 the median length of stay in this country for routine \ndeliveries was 4 to 5 days. By 1992, the median stay dropped to 2.1 \ndays.\n  In 1991--the latest year for which figures are available--nearly 40 \npercent of newborns in California were discharged in fewer than 24 \nhours.\n  And the problem seems to be even worse today.\n  Some insurers limit coverage of postpartum hospital care to 1 day or \n12 hours.\n  One large California HMO has reduced coverage to 8 hours.\n  These are not generally doctors determining that it is in their \npatients' best interest to be discharged sooner. The reduction in \nhospital care is the result of insurance companies making that decision \nbased on how much they want to pay--and the real cost is being borne by \npatients--mother and child--in greater health risks.\n  There are many medical reasons why a longer hospital stay may be \nnecessary. Some medical conditions do not manifest in 10 or 24 hours \nafter delivery, such as jaundice, heart murmurs, circulatory \ndisfunctions and fevers.\n  Early discharges can also exacerbate medical problems:\n  Studies presented to the Senate Labor Committee have shown that early \nrelease of infants can result in the baby having jaundice, feeding \nproblems, respiratory difficulties, metabolic disorders and infections.\n  In fact, a New Hampshire study of hospital readmission rates found \nthat babies discharged at less than 2 days of age have a 70 percent \nincreased risk of facing an emergency room visit.\n  Early discharge not only increases health risks, in many cases, it is \nso much more costly.\n  A Pasadena women and her 6-week premature infant were discharged \nafter only 23 hours of delivery. The baby was readmitted to the \nhospital for jaundice and dehydration 2 days later, costing an extra \n$20,000--$1,000 that had to be paid by the family.\n  Let me give some examples of the human impact of this problem:\n  A Los Angeles woman was released 15 hours after giving birth because \nof limited insurance coverage. Two days later, her baby was \nhospitalized for malnutrition--the infant had difficulty with lactation \nand breast feeding.\n  A San Francisco woman had to leave the hospital 23 hours after \ndelivery against her doctor's advice, even though her baby was 5 weeks \npremature. The baby was in the emergency room less than 2 days later, \nand was readmitted to the hospital for dehydration and jaundice.\n  Another California mother was discharged less than 14 hours after \ndeliver. The next morning she was shaking, feverish, and nauseous. She \nwas diagnosed as having a staph infection and was readmitted to the \nhospital for 4 days.\n  Sometimes these stories have tragic endings.\n  Leigh Fallon, of Petaluma, CA entered the hospital on July 25, 1994. \nAfter 2 days of labor with extraordinary complications, she had an \nemergency caesarean section.\n  The mother had a high fever and great physical distress. Her baby boy \ndeveloped jaundice, was being treated with antibiotics, and was \ndiagnosed with a heart murmer.\n  Still, under pressure from their insurance company, Leah and the baby \nwere discharged 72 hours after birth. The baby was rushed to the \nhospital a few days later and did not survive emergency heart surgery.\n  Perhaps nothing could have saved Leah's baby. But clearly, the \ndecision to discharge such a fragile patient was made in the interest \nof saving money instead of saving a life.\n  Medical decisions should be made by medical professionsals--not \ninsurance companies. That is what they are trained to do.\n  Twenty-nine States have enacted legislation or regulations to curb \nwhat's called drive-through deliveries. In California, the legislature \nfailed to come to agreement on legislation at the close of the current \nsession. California voters, instead, will face two ballot measures \nwhich include regulations on the subject this November.\n  This is a national problem, and Congress must set a uniform standard \nin the interest of public health.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the newborns and \nmothers bill.\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY.

I must tell \nyou, I think this amendment will provide an increased sense of \nsecurity, particularly to first-time mothers, who will now feel that \nthey can remain in the hospital a bit longer if necessary. Some will \nask, ``Why not even longer?'' Well, how do we know the correct length \nof stay in each situation? This should be decided on an individual \nbasis. But we do know that even an additional 24 hours is going to make \na difference. For some, it will make a big difference--where there is \nno family available to offer support when they come home and, \nparticularly, as I mentioned, with first-time mothers, where there is \nuncertainty about what lies ahead.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator; the amendment to my amendment. I hope we adopt \nit unanimously by a large, overwhelming vote, and hopefully we will be \nable to move forward. It is an amendment that would confirm that \ninsurers have to allow 48 hours for delivery of a child by a mother in \nthe hospital, 96 hours for cesarean section. The Senator's changes are \nmerited and important. It is a pleasure to work with him. I look \nforward to the 5:35 hour so that we can vote. Maybe we can move sooner.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The hour of 5:35 having arrived, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Tennessee. On this question, the yeas and \nnays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] \nand the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 272 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Hatfield\n     Murkowski\n       \n  The amendment (No. 5193) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 5192, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the \n     Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, sections 1 through 3 \n     will take effect on October 1, 1997.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Wellstone early \non in the debate on this bill that is pending. He had the good sense to \nput the amendment in, and, thus, it became relevant under the \nunanimous-consent decree.\n  I thank him for his generosity in permitting me to call up his \namendment, which is commonly known as the Domenici-Wellstone amendment. \nI am not going to take a lot of time. The U.S. Senate has heard me \nargue this issue a number of times.\n  I do believe in the 5 weeks that we have been gone--many of us at \nhome--I think a lot of U.S. Senators and a lot of House Members have \nbeen approached in their respective States and districts with reference \nto the need to adopt this amendment and to make it part of the \nsubstantive law of this land.\n  I am counting on that, because I believe the U.S. Senate will adopt \nit by a rather overwhelming margin. But I do want to say to those who \nwonder whether or not we are just offering an amendment again that has \npassed and then did not see the full rising Sun and the beauty of \ndaylight as a piece of legislation because the House had denied it in \nconference, that we clearly intend for the U.S. House to take a very \nserious look at this, even though it is in a conference and they have \nalready passed the HUD and independent agencies bill.\n  I believe before this bill is finally conferenced that there will be \nmany House Members on both sides of the aisle who will indicate their \nsupport. How we will go about doing that within the technical rules of \nthe U.S. House, I am not prepared yet to discuss, but a number of House \nMembers, both Republican and Democrat, want to help us get this \namendment before the President as part of this appropriations bill.\n  Having said that, let me make sure that Senators and that those out \nin the\n\n[[Page S9917]]\n\naudience, called America, whether it is families of severely mentally \nill young people, or whether it is small businesses, or whether it is \nbig businesses in the United States, this amendment is not the bill \nthat passed that brought concern as to the cost to business. This is a \nvery simple proposition.\n  This bill, let me make it clear, does not mandate mental health \nservices or determine charges. It does not require parity for \ncopayments and deductibles. It does not require parity for inpatient \nhospital stays or outpatient limits.\n  This amendment, as presented, does not cover substance abuse, and it \ndoes not cover chemical dependency. It excludes Medicare and Medicaid, \nto be handled separately in legislation with reference to those \nstatutory benefits. It allows for managed care and mental health carve-\nouts, does not apply to individual health coverage, and exempts small \nbusinesses with 25 or fewer employees.\n  So I guess with that clearly understood, one might ask, what does it \ndo? Essentially, this is a compromise to begin down the path of parity \nand nondiscrimination for the mentally ill people in this country who \nhave health insurance. It does just two very fundamental things.\n  The aggregate lifetime coverage on an insurance policy and the annual \npayment limits, Mr. President, must be the same for mental health \ncoverage as for the physical health coverage.\n  In simple terms, if heretofore you bought an insurance policy and it \ncovered mental health, with whatever conditions are attached--normally \ndown here well into the policy it would say the aggregate lifetime \ncoverage is $50,000, and up here in the bolder print it might say the \ncoverage for everybody in this policy, not otherwise provided for, is \n$1 million. So if you get sick from cancer or a heart condition or \ntuberculosis or, God forbid, any of the serious illnesses, the lifetime \ncoverage is $1 million under that policy.\n\n  But if you get schizophrenia when you are 16 or 18, which is within \nthe age, between 17 and 32 or so, you might get that dread mental \ndisease, this policy that I was just alluding to that is out there now \nwould say mental health is covered, mental illness, but it would say \nfor that one, you only get $50,000 worth of aggregate lifetime \ncoverage.\n  This Domenici-Wellstone amendment says that will not be legal \nanymore, for it says if you choose to write that policy or if you \nchoose to buy coverage as a big company and you buy a $1 million \naggregate coverage for your employees for their illnesses, then if you \nwant to cover them for mental illness, you have to cover them lifetime \nfor $1 million also.\n  And if the annual payment limit, for those are common also --you may \nhave a $1 million aggregate for your lifetime, but it may only cover \n$50,000 a year as the annual, or $100,000--it says that figure, too, \nfor the annual limits has to be the same for the coverage provided for \nmentally ill people as for others with physical ailments covered in an \ninsurance policy.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, from where we \nstarted, I will confess to everyone, this compromise truly--truly--\ndramatically reduced our expectations and our hopes. But we understand. \nWe have dramatically reduced the scope.\n  We understand that the first bill that cleared the Senate with 68 \nvotes required the same exact coverage for the mentally ill as you \nprovide for anyone else, for other illnesses. And we understand there \nwas a concern about that in terms of how much it might cost. There was \nsome concern expressed about what kind of treatment is treatment of the \nmentally ill. Is it just an ordinary visit to a psychiatrist because \nyou have marital difficulties or because you have a very temporary kind \nof depression?\n  So what we decided to do was to scale back our desire and our hope \nfor parity for this very important part of the American population and \nsay let us get started by eliminating the hoax that exists in many \ncases where mentally ill people think they have coverage, but when you \nlook at the fine print, the aggregate lifetime coverage is so small as \ncompared to the coverage for other illnesses that, in many cases, it is \na shock to those who have a family member who comes down with manic \ndepression or severe depression or schizophrenia or one of the bipolar \nillnesses.\n  So we, to make it clear again, do not mandate the copayments. If you \nwant to differentiate by having different copayments for mentally ill \npeople and the coverage you provide, that is your privilege, that will \nbe negotiated. That will be there in big companies as they work out how \nthey are going to cover people. We do not mandate that parity to go \ndown that far. We say just parity at the top, parity for the aggregate \nand parity for the aggregate annual.\n  We are starting down a path of at least beginning to understand that \nthere are indeed millions of Americans who have members of their family \nwith these dread diseases. Believe you me, the stereotype of old as to \nhow these happen, where they come from, are all out the window. They \ndid not come because a mother mistreated a child. They did not get \nschizophrenia because somebody neglected them for 10 years. These are \nvery, very serious illnesses of the brain. Someday we will tie those \ndown into very, very understandable physical treatments with medicines \nand other things which are already making dramatic, dramatic progress \nfor this part of our population.\n  So we have a chance to just send a little ray of hope to the millions \nof American people, hundreds of thousands of families who have this \nkind of situation that heretofore your companies, if they are insuring \nyou and your family through your employment, if they cover you for \nmental illness, then it will not be trivial coverage, it will not be a \nscaled-down coverage so insignificant that it hardly, hardly deserves \nbeing called coverage, because if you get schizophrenia or one of your \nchildren do or they get manic depression or they become seriously \ndepressed where it becomes chronic for any period of time, anybody in \nthis room knows those $50,000 lifetime limits do not cover it at all no \nmore than they would cover for somebody who is desperately ill with \ncancer and needs 10 operations and chemotherapy and 6 months in the \nhospital. That $50,000 would be gone in 5 months or 3 months.\n  So we get a little bit of what we call parity. And we move just a \nlittle bit further away from the rampant discrimination that besets \ncoverage for the mentally ill men, women, teenagers, young people \nacross this land.\n  I repeat, when you vote for this tonight, many of you will have \nheard--many of the men and women in the Senate on their trips home and \ncertainly many House Members in their districts will have heard from \nthe Alliance for the Mentally Ill, thousands and thousands of their \nmembers. I have already run into two Senators who met their membership \nat home. And some were joking, I say to Senator Wellstone, because they \nseem to say your name right but they seem to say my name wrong. So they \nsay you have to support that ``Dominichi''-Wellstone bill. But that is \nall right just so long as we all understand what it is.\n  So Mr. President, at this point I am going to yield to Senator \nWellstone. But I am wondering if we could get a time agreement to \nsatisfy--we have a second-degree amendment being offered here. Before I \nagree to a time agreement, I want to see it. So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be relatively brief because I \nknow there are several other Senators who want to speak tonight. \nSenator Kennedy has spent many of his years as a Senator fighting on \nbehalf of parity and fairness for people struggling with mental \nillness, and others.\n  Mr. President, on April 18 of this year, 68 Senators voted for our \namendment. This was really an amendment that said we ought to end the \ndiscrimination. There ought to be full parity for the treatment of \nmental illness in our country. I think what the Senate was saying--68 \nSenators, which is really a significant vote--was that for too long the \nstigma of mental illness has kept many in need from seeking help and \nfor too long it has prevented policymakers from providing the help. We \nheard from a number of Senators who spoke in very personal terms about \ntheir own families and their own experiences--Senator Conrad, Senator \nSimpson, and Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. President, their testimony was eloquent and powerful. But in \naddition\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\nI want to point out tonight that there are also very sound policy \nreasons for supporting this amendment. I will not describe our \namendment. Senator Domenici has already done so. But I do want \ncolleagues to know that it is just an incremental step forward, but a \nsignificant one.\n  What we are saying is that when it comes to lifetime caps and annual \ncaps, at least have parity there so that we do not have a situation \nwhere there is a million-dollar cap for someone who is struggling with \ncancer or heart disease and then you find out that if someone is \nstruggling with mental illness all together it is a $40,000 cap or an \nannual cap of only $10,000.\n  This amendment would really help many families in our country who \nright now, given the present arrangement, which is an arrangement of \ndiscrimination and stigma, just face economic catastrophe. People just \ngo bankrupt. People go under all too often.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment is incremental. It is not full \nparity, but it would be an enormous step forward. As I said, it is not \njust the personal stories. Certainly I could talk about this tonight in \nvery personal terms. We have done that already. But there are sound \npolicy reasons. The MIT Sloan School of Management reported in 1995 \nthat clinical depression costs American business $28.8 billion in lost \nproductivity and worker absenteeism.\n  In addition, there are too many people in prison who should not be. \nThere are too many children who could be doing well in school who do \nnot do well. There are too many families under tremendous strain that \ndo not need to be under so much strain. I mean, in many ways we talk so \nmuch about the importance of supporting families.\n  If we could pass this amendment tonight with a huge vote, and then \nwork hard and get the support in the House--and I think we will. \nSenator Domenici is right, so many families and so many people who have \nstruggled with this have been active. One of the things that has \nchanged through organizations like the National Alliance of the \nMentally Ill and others is that people no longer will accept the idea \nthat because they have to struggle with mental illness they are somehow \nwomen or men of less worth or less substance or less dignity. People \nare speaking up for themselves.\n  I think if we get a really strong vote tonight--and I think we will--\nI think you will see many of those families working hard with Members \nof the House and we will pass this. And we should, Mr. President. It \nwould make an enormous difference.\n  I said to my colleague, Senator Domenici, and I have said to other \nfriends as well, that the only thing that troubled me that evening--I \nwill never forget; I was very proud to be a part of this--was that at \nthe very end the expectations of all of the people that had just risen, \nthe hopes would just be dashed and people would end up just being \ndevastated and discouraged and feel like it all was for naught.\n  We did not make it on the insurance reform bill, but this is not just \na symbolic exercise tonight. We are hoping to get a huge vote from \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. I think we have the support for this. \nThen we are hoping that in conference committee this stays in and this \nbecomes the law of the land. It is not full parity, it is just \nincremental, but what a difference it would make. What a difference it \nwould make for families that are struggling with mental illness. Mr. \nPresident, what a difference it would make.\n  I do not guess this is the most important reason, but what a \ndifference it would make for all of the families that now are speaking \nfor themselves and talking to Senators and talking to Representatives.\n  I see Senator Conrad, and I talked about what the Senator said on the \nfloor on April 18. I said I would never forget those words. I see he is \nhere to speak. I do not want to cut into the time of others.\n  However, I think it is only old data and old ideas that have kept us \nfrom covering mental health the same way we cover other real illnesses, \nwhether they are acute or chronic. Congress should pass this. The \nSenate should pass this amendment. We should pass it by a huge margin. \nIt is a necessary and affordable step toward ending the stigma and \ndiscrimination against Americans suffering from mental illness.\n  Let me repeat one more time: This vote tonight, the larger the margin \nthe better, will be a necessary and affordable step that we as Senators \nhave taken toward ending the stigma of discrimination against Americans \nsuffering from mental illness. Colleagues, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, to take that step is no small accomplishment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Sarah \nVogelsberg, a fellow in my office, be given the privilege of the floor \nduring the consideration of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few forms of discrimination are crueler, \nmore counterproductive, and more widespread than those inflicted on the \nmentally ill and their families. Lack of adequate insurance coverage \nfor the severely mentally ill is a major factor leading to \nhomelessness--and hopelessness. Illness is a tragedy for any family. \nMental illness is a triple tragedy because the inevitable strain of \ncoping with the illness is compounded by the unfair stigma associated \nwith the illness and the lack of adequate insurance coverage to make \ntreatment affordable.\n  Five million Americans suffer from serious mental illnesses every \nyear. Few Americans do not have a family member, a friend, or a \ncoworker, who has been touched by these tragic illnesses.\n  The financial burden of serious illness can be crushing, whether the \nillness is mental or physical, whether schizophrenia, heart disease, or \ncancer. For the majority of Americans, health insurance provides \nprotection against the cost of treating heart disease, cancer, or other \nphysical diseases, but this protection is shamefully less available for \nmental illnesses. There is no discrimination in insurance coverage \nagainst victims of heart disease or cancer, but there is vast \ndiscrimination against those afflicted with mental illness, and it is \ntime for Congress to end it.\n  Every year, one in five Americans is afflicted by severe mental \nillness. Even mental illnesses that are less severe in the sense they \nare not chronic or do not have a clear biological basis can be \ndevastating to individuals and families. Transient depression can lead \nto suicide. Mental health problems can result in divorce, child abuse, \njob loss, failure in school, delinquency, and substance abuse. The \nhealth costs of treating severe mental illness is $27 billion a year. \nThe total cost of treating all mental illness is $70 billion a year.\n  Even these figures are far from reflecting the true cost of mental \nillness because such illnesses are often inappropriately treated in the \nhealth care system at a high cost with poor outcomes. It is estimated \nthat adequate treatment for mental illness would save 10 percent of \noverall medical costs.\n\n  And these are only the direct costs. The indirect costs of severe \nmental illness--lost productivity, disability, and premature death--\nexceed $40 billion a year, and the indirect costs of all mental \nillnesses are far higher than that.\n  Mental illness is treatable and often curable. And treatments are \nbecoming more effective every year. In fact, treatment for even very \nsevere mental disorders is more effective than angioplasty, one of the \nmost common treatments for heart disease.\n  Yet, insurance discrimination against mental illness is rampant, \ndespite the fact that mental illness can be as devastating as any \nphysical illness, despite the fact that good mental health care can \nactually save money, despite the heavy burden that mental illness \nplaces on millions of Americans and their families. Only about 11 \npercent of all employer-sponsored health plans cover treatment of \nmental illness as generously as treatment of other illnesses. Two-\nthirds of such plans place dollar limits on outpatient treatment. \nEighty percent have more restrictive hospital coverage for mental \nillness.\n  Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone offered a landmark amendment \nto end this injustice when the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance bill \nwas considered by the Senate. Their full parity role made sense.\n  Five States have already adopted comparable laws. None has \nexperienced\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\nsignificant cost increases as a result. If it works for Maryland, \nMinnesota, Maine, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, it can work for the \nrest of the country.\n  Here is what the Governor of New Hampshire said:\n\n       In the 2 years since I signed this bill, this has proven to \n     be an affordable and effective piece of legislation. . . I \n     urge you to pass similar health reform legislation on the \n     national level.\n\n  The Governor of Minnesota said:\n\n       Since the enactment of [our] law, there has not been a \n     significant cost increase . . . I encourage you to support \n     the Domenici-Wellstone amendment.\n\n  The Governor of Maine said:\n\n       Our experience with serious mental illness has indicated \n     that providing responsive and supportive coverage upfront . . \n     . is not only the proper public policy, but also has positive \n     economic impact with very little upfront costs for our State.\n\n  The Domenici-Wellstone amendment, as has been pointed out, was \napproved by the Senate by an overwhelming 68-30 bipartisan vote. \nPresident Bill Clinton urged that it be enacted into law. \nUnfortunately, it was dropped in the House-Senate conference because of \nthe opposition of our House Republican conferees.\n  Now on this bill we have another chance to do the right thing. The \npending amendment is a compromise--a worthwhile downpayment on this \nbasic issue. Under the amendment, the annual dollar limit and lifetime \ndollar limit for mental health services covered by insurance could not \nbe less than the limits set for other health services.\n  The amendment does not address many other special limits often \nimposed on mental health services, such as higher copayments, limits on \noutpatient visits, or limits on hospital days. Like the original \namendment, it does not limit in any way legitimate cost containment \nsteps to assure that care is necessary and effective.\n  The cost of this amendment is minimal. At most, it may lead to a rise \nof four-tenths of 1 percent in health insurance premiums, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office. Other analyses estimate the costs may \neven be lower. And none of these cost estimates take into account the \nsavings that better mental health care will provide.\n  Opponents contend this proposal is an unjustified interference with \nthe rights of employers. We heard the same objections to the minimum \nwage, to laws outlawing racial discrimination in employment, to the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, and to child labor laws. The opponents \nwere wrong then, and they are wrong now.\n  Americans with mental illnesses and their families deserve a simple \njustice from employers, from the health insurance industry, and from \ntheir Government. This is the Congress that can begin to show the \ncommon sense, the compassion, and the basic fairness that the mentally \nill and their families deserve. I urge the Senate to adopt this \namendment.\n  I join in paying tribute to my two colleagues and friends, Senator \nDomenici and Senator Wellstone for their efforts. They have fought long \nand hard to make this amendment a reality. Every family that will ever \nhave a loved one who will need mental health care is in their debt. I \nalso want to mention Tipper Gore, the Vice-President's wife, who has \ndone so much to increase understanding of the need to improve mental \nhealth coverage and has worked so hard for mental health parity. \nFinally, President Clinton's untiring efforts in this cause deserve \nspecial commendation.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment--and I urge the Senate \nconferees to hold firm this time, so that the House extremists will \nfail, and that this long overdue measure will go to the President for \nsignature.\n  This amendment has a special meaning for me and my family. In 1963, \nthe first Presidential message on mental illness in history was sent to \nthe Congress by President Kennedy. This message resulted in the passage \nof the first program to establish community mental health centers and \nprovide community-based services for the mentally ill. And I am proud \nthat, as chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I had \nthe opportunity to send to the full Senate President Clinton's Health \nSecurity Program, providing for full parity and comprehensive coverage \nof mental health services for every American. I believe the day will \nyet come when we will enact a program that assures the basic human \nright to health care for every American, whatever their wealth--and \nwhatever their illness.\n  Mr. President, this Senate owes a great sense of appreciation to our \ntwo colleagues for fighting for this modest but enormously significant \nand most important program. I hope it will be carried by an \noverwhelming margin.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, in commending Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone for \noffering this amendment.\n  The Senate has concerned itself with this issue several times in the \npast. Previously, when Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone offered \nthis amendment--a much broader amendment than this one--we got 68 votes \non the floor of the U.S. Senate. In the reconciliation bill, I had this \npassed in the Finance Committee, and it passed on the floor of the \nSenate on reconciliation. So the Senate has considered a much broader \nversion of mental health parity than we are considering tonight. This \nonly relates to parity on lifetime and annual caps for mental illness. \nIt is a small part of the parity provision that previously passed with \nan overwhelming vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Now, Mr. President, this is a beginning. It is an important \nbeginning, and we ought to make the start. It is the right thing to do. \nWe ought to treat a mental illness in the same way that we treat a \nphysical illness.\n  Mr. President, the last time I spoke on this matter before my \ncolleagues, I talked about an experience I had when I was the assistant \ntax commissioner in the State of North Dakota. We had a receptionist \nwho was struck by a mental illness. I recounted her case. I don't want \nto take the time of my colleagues tonight to repeat the specifics of \nthat matter, but I will simply say that she was a young, vibrant woman, \nwho one day was healthy--perfectly healthy, radiantly healthy--and the \nnext day she thought the pictures on the walls were talking to her. Her \nlife was badly damaged. In fact, she ultimately tried to take her own \nlife.\n\n  Mr. President, it was in dealing with that case that I learned that, \nin this country, insurance policies frequently discriminate against \nthose with mental illness. And it is a very serious matter, this matter \nof discrimination, because if you are so unfortunate as to have a loved \none or a family member or, God forbid, you yourself are stricken, you \nwill quickly find out that the coverage in most policies is \ndramatically different for a mental illness than a physical illness.\n  For example, annual caps, typically, for mental illness are $10,000 a \nyear. For physical illness they are $100,000 or $250,000 a year, which \nis a dramatic difference. Believe me, if you are part of a family that \nhas this awful thing happen to you, and you are up against those kinds \nof limits, you will find out very quickly that this can drain your \nfamily's finances. This can be devastating, not only in terms of the \npersonal tragedy, but in terms of the financial tragedy that follows, \nas well.\n  Mr. President, this is a modest proposal. According to CBO, on \naverage, this would increase health insurance premiums by .16 percent, \nnot 16 percent, not 1.6 percent, but .16 percent.\n  Mr. President, this is the right thing to do. We ought to take this \nstep. I hope my colleagues will join in on a bipartisan basis in \npassing the Domenici-Wellstone amendment. I thank the Chair and yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am very proud to be a cosponsor of the \nDomenici-Wellstone amendment, which provides for just a small measure \nof mental health ``parity.'' I am also a cosponsor of the freestanding \nbill, S. 2031, the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, which was \nintroduced on August 2. I am--and will remain--deeply committed to this \ncause. I sincerely believe that the manner in which we address this \nsingular issue will speak volumes about the true nature of the 104th \nCongress.\n  I want to emphasize as clearly as I can that this amendment does not \nask\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\nfor anything grand or far reaching. It would merely require health \nplans to provide parity with respect to lifetime caps and annual \npayment limits. In other words, if an existing health plan has a \nlifetime cap or an annual limit on what it will spend for medical or \nsurgical services, that plan must either include services for mental \nillness in that total or have a separate ceiling for mental illnesses \nthat is no more restrictive than the ceiling for medical and surgical \nservices.\n  This very limited proposal would apply only in these two areas--for \nlifetime caps and for annual payment limits. It would not require \n``parity'' for copayments or deductibles or any other aspects of health \ncoverage.\n  Considering that the Senate has previously voted--on April 18, by a \nmargin of 68 to 30--for an amendment that would have required a much \nmore sweeping version of mental health ``parity,'' it surely seems to \nme that the pending amendment--which is so very limited in scope--\nshould pass by an even larger vote. I would look forward to that.\n  But those of us who have been involved in this cause have learned not \nto take a thing for granted. Even if we are to win this vote, we know \nthat we will confront myriad further roadblocks as this measure works \nits way though the legislative process in the remaining weeks of this \nsession.\n  I still have a bit of a hollow feeling about our failure to include \nthis reasonable compromise in the health insurance reform bill. In a \nbill that was so packed full of ``mandates''--which is exactly what the \nhealth insurance bill consisted of--somehow this mental health \nprovision was singled out as some terrible mandate that would ``cost \ntoo much.''\n  As much as I don't want to believe this, my gut instincts tell me \nthat this outcome most surely had something to do with discrimination \nagainst the mentally ill. This Congress should not make this mistake a \nsecond time. I urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise with a heavy heart to address this \nsubject. I say heavy heart because no one could fail to be moved by the \nvery eloquent statements that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico \nhas made on this floor concerning this problem, both now and in the \npast. He has brought to light the problem that, I think, affects many \nAmericans and has focused our attention on a very difficult aspect of \nthe current health care policy.\n  On the major tenet that suggests that there are differences in \ncoverage in this area, I must say, the Senator is exactly right. That \ncertainly conforms with my understanding. There are differences in \ncoverage with regard to mental health. He has eloquently put the case \nthat many of the citizens who suffer from these infirmities suffer \ntremendous consequences because of the lack of insurance coverage in \nthat area. I think he has done an excellent job in articulating the \ndifficulties visited upon their families, not only because of the \nillness, but because of the nuances in the insurance policies.\n  Why would one rise to voice concerns? It is simply this, Mr. \nPresident. As this body requires coverage, or in this case sets \nlimitations, fixes limitations, what we also do is not only help people \nout who are on the receiving end, but we establish the precedent that \nit is for the Government to decide what kind of coverage you purchase, \nnot the person who is paying for it.\n  Mr. President, let us be very specific. If this amendment passes, \nconsumers will be denied the right to pick the terms of coverage, or \nnegotiate the terms of coverage they wish with an insurance company. We \nwill have had the Government make that decision and not the consumers. \nNow, I put it to Senators that it is important for consumers to have \nchoices. I must say that I think it is commendable that the Senators' \nunderlying amendment does not mandate the mental health coverage. It \nstill leaves that open. I do hear--and I think he and others have \nacknowledged it--that it may have a tendency to have people drop mental \nhealth coverage from their policies, if this passes in its present \nform.\n  What we do if we pass this is say that consumers are no longer \nallowed to make a choice as to the limitations on the mental health \ncoverage that they purchase. What we are saying is, you are going to \nhave to buy a policy that will conform with these guidelines, even \nthough you don't want to. Now, Mr. President, I believe that consumers \nought to retain that choice. I believe it is fair to require people to \noffer coverage, with the commensurate costs that it may involve, but I \ndon't think it is appropriate for us to take that decision away from \nconsumers. Thus, Mr. President, I do rise with an amendment that I \nthink clarifies the issue.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5195 To Amendment No. 5194\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5195 to amendment No. 5194.\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of this title, consumers \n     shall retain the freedoms to choose a group health plan with \n     coverage limitations of their choice, even if such coverage \n     limitations for mental health services are inconsistent with \n     section 2 of this title.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the amendment is very simple and it is very \ndirect. It simply retains the matter of choice in the consumer. If you \nthink the consumer ought to be able to purchase the protection that \nthey wish, you will want to vote for this amendment because it makes it \nclear that consumers can end up making that choice themselves. If you \nwish to deny the consumer the right to purchase the coverage that they \nprefer, you will want to vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think underlying this is a very important principle. \nShould we force people to buy coverage they do not want to buy? There \nare good arguments on both sides, incidentally. I will certainly \nconcede that. I will concede that the case the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico brings for his amendment is one of the most heart-\nrending and eloquent presentations I have ever listened to.\n  So, Mr. President, I also believe it is important in this land of \nfreedom to retain freedom of choice for consumers. Thus, I offer my \namendment here on the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not know if there are any other \nSenators who want to speak in behalf of the Domenici-Wellstone, et al., \namendment. I understand the Chair would like to speak. I will \npersonally relieve him shortly so he can speak. But let me make a \ncomment about the Brown amendment, after which I will move to table it \nonce Senators who want to speak have had an opportunity to do so.\n  Let me just make a case here. Fellow Senators, we just passed a \nKassebaum-Kennedy health reform bill. What did we say in it with \nreference to preexisting conditions? We said insurance companies can no \nlonger deny coverage because of preexisting conditions. We could have \nhad a distinguished Senator like the Senator from Colorado--and he is \ndistinguished--come to the floor and say, ``But we ought to have the \nconsumers retain the right to choose.'' So we could offer an amendment \nhere that would have said it. But we need to protect the consumers' \nchoice.\n  So we are saying you have to do this; you have to cover the \npreexisting conditions, but the consumer ought to have the choice, and \nhe ought to be able to opt out. You see what that did. Nobody dared do \nit--not even my distinguished friend from Colorado--because that \nproduced what we all call cherry picking. It permits people to offer \ncoverage at the lowest possible rate denying coverage to many, many \npeople and leaving those to somebody else.\n  I cited here on the floor where cherry picking came from. I thought \nit came from the basketball player where, when the fellow didn't want \nto get into the game of getting rebounds, he stood out on the side over \nthere and let the other people do all the work. And he would run down, \nand they throw him the ball, and he would get to cherry pick the \nbasket.\n  What the Senator is doing here in this amendment, which sounds great, \nis he is taking a provision that we are offering that says simply the \nfollowing:\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\n If an insurance company chooses to cover mental health--let me repeat; \nif they choose to cover mental health. Implicitly they do not have to \ncover mental health. I would assume they will offer policies without \ncoverage for mental health. I assume that exists today. It will exist \ntomorrow. It will exist a year from now if this becomes law. Companies \nwill offer policies with no mental health coverage, and that is \navailable for those consumers who want to choose that. But it will also \noffer mental health coverage. All we are saying is, if you choose to \noffer that coverage, then you must offer two things--only two things: \nThe annual amount to be paid for the illness and treatment must be the \nsame for physical as for severe or mental illness. You can't have two \ndifferent annual payments. As to the lifetime aggregate coverage, you \ncannot have two different ones, if you cover mental health.\n\n  So, in a sense, I say to my fellow Senators, this choice is already \nprovided for because insurance companies are going to provide ample \nchoice. They are going to say we are not covering mental health. Would \nyou like to buy that kind of policy? We are only saying if they choose \nto cover mental health that these two characteristics, qualities, must \nbe present.\n  If the Senator chooses to say, for those companies that choose to \nwrite insurance policies that have mental health and, therefore, have \nthis kind of coverage, people ought to be able to say, ``I opt out of a \nportion of it.'' Then I submit we are right back where we started where \nwe do not have coverage for the mentally ill because people who do not \nhave any problems will opt out of it, and there will not be coverage \nunder even those cases where policies have it expressly because the \ndecision has been made--because the decision has been made--to include \nit.\n  So from my standpoint, I will very soon move to table this. I say to \neveryone that I think, if it were adopted and implemented literally, I \nbelieve we will have done away with the kind of coverage we seek to \nprovide within the confines of a policy that the offset chooses--\ncoverage for mental illness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Very briefly, I say openly that I could go through in \na kind of logical way all of the specifics of it. But I believe the \namendment of my good friend from Colorado guts this amendment in the \nsecond degree. I think what he most objects to is the idea of any kind \nof standard. We just voted on a standard. That is what we just did. \nThat is the vote we just took. It was 98 votes where we said, ``Look, \nwhen it comes to the whole issue of the mother-child, we want to make \nsure there is at least a 48-hour period of time.'' That is what we just \ndid. We are now saying in a very incremental way that when it comes to \nthe mental health area we ought to deal with this discrimination and we \nought to make sure that, at least with the lifetime or annual caps, you \nhave some parity. If you begin to say, ``I am all for the plans, but I \ndo not want to have a situation where in fact there has to be in mental \nhealth coverage an equality with caps,'' then you move away from the \nwhole strength of this.\n  So this is the opposite of the perfecting amendment. This amendment \nguts this legislation. I hope that it will be defeated resoundingly.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, if I could, I would like to address the \ncomments of the two previous speakers.\n  With all respect to my good friend from Minnesota, let me suggest \nthat the vote we just had, at least in my view, is not quite the same \nas he implied. The record vote we just had was on the Frist amendment \nthat perfected the Bradley amendment. I voted for that because it did \nimprove the Bradley amendment. I certainly would confess to the Senator \nwith regard to the underlying Bradley amendment that there are \nsignificant similarities, and I think he makes a valid point there. One \ndifference, I might point out, is the cost differential for that very \nmodest step, first, I might say, which is something that I hope would \nbe in all policies, which is dramatically different than what I believe \nthe cost impact with regard to the mental health coverage is.\n\n  Second, Mr. President, with regard to the statement of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico with regard to his point in \nregard to choice being still present, if his amendment passes, I think \nthat is a valid point if either choice is retained. Unfortunately, the \nchoice, though, as to whether or not you have any mental coverage, if \nyou do not want to go with the higher limit, you have to drop all \ncoverage, this amendment would make it clear that you retain the choice \nas to the level of coverage. I think that is the crux of it.\n  Why is that significant? It may be possible to afford 10,000 dollars' \nworth of coverage, or 100,000 dollars' worth of coverage, or 1 million \ndollars' worth of coverage. But it may not be possible to pay for $10 \nmillion of coverage. Does that mean, if you can't go with the higher \nlevel, that you are not allowed to have any choice at all? Unless the \nBrown amendment passes, the second-degree amendment, that is exactly \nwhat it means. If the Brown amendment passes, it means that you are \nallowed to have choices as to the coverage levels you may wish for \nmental health.\n  It seems to me that is fundamentally a question of choice and an \nimportant part of it. And it is vital for our consumers to retain that \noption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have listened to this debate with great interest. I \nfind myself philosophically agreeing with the Senator from Colorado \nabout the issue of choice, but I intend to oppose his amendment because \nit ignores the reality of our current health care structure and raises \nan issue that I have raised before and will raise again and again and \nagain as we deal with the health care circumstance.\n  He uses in his amendment the word ``consumers.'' The fact is that \nconsumers do not buy health insurance. Individual consumers do not buy \nhealth insurance except in very rare cases. Companies buy health \ninsurance. Employers buy health insurance.\n  In my view, that is one of the main things that is wrong with our \nhealth care system, that individual consumers are not allowed choice. \nWe are forced to take whatever our employers decide to choose on our \nbehalf.\n  I have said on this floor before I had a better health care plan \nbefore I came to the Senate than I have now. Why? Because the employer \nfor whom I worked did a better job from my point of view than the U.S. \nGovernment does in choosing plans. If I were an individual consumer \nbuying health care the way I buy an automobile, I would have chosen to \nbring that health care plan with me when I came from one employer to \nthe other employer. But because of the way our health care system is \nstructured, we are not allowed to do that. We, as individual consumers, \nare not allowed to make those kinds of choices. So let us understand \nthat when the Senator from Colorado talks about consumers making \nchoices, he is using the language of the marketplace that simply does \nnot apply in health care.\n  We had a long battle on this floor for many weeks over the idea of \nallowing individuals to set up savings accounts from which they could \npurchase health services. We finally had a compromise saying that we \nwould only allow 750,000 people to do that. If we cannot find a more \ndramatic statement than that fact that underlies that consumers, that \nis, individuals, are not allowed to make these kinds of decisions, then \nI do not know where we would find a more dramatic statement.\n  I would like in coming Congresses to restructure the system around \nmedical savings accounts and around consumer choice. I think that is \nthe ultimate solution, and if we get to that point, then I think we can \nconsider the amendment of the Senator from Colorado. But when we are \nstuck with the circumstance we are stuck with now where decisions are \nmade by somebody other than individuals, I think the amendment of the \nSenator from New Mexico is an appropriate one, and I intend to oppose \nthe second-degree amendment and support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S9922]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BROWN. It is my understanding the Senator has favored letting \nemployers give employees choices. Would I be fair and accurate in \nsaying that, if the Domenici amendment passes, it would preclude \nemployers offering, making available to their employees a choice as to \nthe various levels of mental health coverage if they differ?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding, in response to the Senator's \nquestion, that an employer would not be precluded from offering \nwhatever he wanted. From my own experience as an employer, let me \ndescribe to the Senator what we offered to our employees. Under the \ncafeteria plan proposal, we say to our employees that we have x number \nof benefit dollars. You tell us how you want us to spend them on your \nbehalf. And under a cafeteria plan approach--a 125(c) plan, I think it \nis described in the Tax Code--an employer could say, here is a mental \nhealth care plan of x amount of coverage. Here is a mental health care \nplan of y amount of coverage. Here is a mental health care plan of z \namount of coverage. And here is a physical health care plan of x amount \nof coverage, and you get to pick.\n  The employee under those circumstances could say, ``I want $10,000 of \ncoverage in mental health care under this plan, and as a second option, \nI want a plan that has $1 million worth of physical coverage.''\n  Yes, I get, in effect, the same thing the Senator is talking about, \nbut I have to buy two plans to do it and there is nothing in the \ncurrent law or nothing in the Domenici-Wellstone amendment that would \nprevent an employer from offering that kind of circumstance.\n  Mr. BROWN. To follow up, if I may, my understanding of the reading of \nthe Domenici amendment is that he does exempt from these limitations \nrestrictions to small employers. That, I think, is a commendable aspect \nof his amendment. But I do not see an amendment that provides the \nexemption that the Senator just talked about. As a matter of fact, the \nway I read the amendment--and perhaps the Senator will want to clarify \nit or set me straight on it--the way I read it, it says precisely that \nyou cannot do what the Senator describes, that you cannot have a plan \nthat has $1 million for physical coverage and $100,000 for mental \nhealth coverage.\n  Mr. BENNETT. You cannot have a single plan that has that \ndiscrimination, but if under a 125(c) cafeteria plan you say we are \ngoing to offer separate plans and you buy both, you could get that \neffect if the employee made that kind of choice.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the Senator making that point. I think it is \na very important point, that you do retain that option at least in the \ncafeteria plan.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is right. An employer who does not have a cafeteria \nplan would not face that option. But if by passage of this we encourage \nemployers to move to a 125(c) plan, a cafeteria plan, I think that is \nall to the good. My underlying point is that the consumer does not make \nthese choices, which I think is wrong and needs to be changed at some \npoint when we restructure our health care system.\n  Mr. BROWN. If the Senator would permit me another.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Surely.\n  Mr. BROWN. It is this Senator's view that the option that the Senator \njust described for the employer about the cafeteria plan, which I think \nis an important option, is the option that ought to be preserved for \nother consumers who do not fit in the small employer option.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree with the Senator, but I do not think this \nlegislation is the place in which to do it.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we have before us is a very bad \namendment with very good intentions. What this amendment in essence is \nsaying is that we in the Senate know better than employers and workers \nwhat kind of health insurance coverage they need.\n  This amendment overrides the decision making of those workers who are \naffected by this amendment, and a very large portion of the population \nof the country will be affected.\n  We are going to say to them that we know better. You may think that \nyou want different limits for traditional physical health insurance \nthan mental health coverage, but we know better than you and are going \nto make you buy the coverage with increased mental health limits. The \nincredible paradox is that the only way you can escape this is to drop \nmental health coverage altogether.\n  This is an unfunded mandate. If we had a proposal before us tonight \nto raise taxes to provide this benefit, I doubt it would get 30 votes. \nBut what we have is a proposal tonight where ``Big Brother'' Congress, \nknow-it-all Congress, perfect-insight Congress, is going to say that \neven if you are a young worker and are having trouble buying health \ninsurance and remaining competitive in the job market, we are going to \nforce you to balloon your mental health coverage, as commendable as \nthat might be.\n  How wonderful it would be if everybody in America could afford this \ncoverage. But what we are saying is, if you have any mental coverage in \nyour plan, we are going to make you pay for a coverage limit up to the \namount you have for traditional physical ailments. In the process we \nare going to drive up the cost of health insurance. We are going to \nreduce the choices that people have. The Senator from Colorado is \nsaying if you want to mandate that insurance companies offer the \ncoverage, then do it, but do not make people buy it if they do not want \nit.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues--none of whom are having \ndifficulty buying health insurance--that even though this may sound \ngreat from our point of view, the problem with private health insurance \nis young working couples are having trouble paying for the health \ninsurance they have. And, to the extent that this bill drives up the \ncost of hiring people, it will cost people their jobs, it will force \ncompanies who cannot afford to provide this benefit to eliminate all \nmental health coverage, and it will force working families to do \nwithout, because every penny that goes towards health insurance comes \nright out of the pocket of the worker. Every economic study done, \nincluding studies by the administration, count fringe benefits as part \nof the wage package. What we are doing to young couples who are trying \nto make ends meet, who want health insurance in case Johnny falls down \nthe steps, is saying that you are going to have to pay for this \nextensive mental health coverage whether you want it or not. This \namendment says that Congress supposedly knows what is better for you \nthan you yourself do--it assumes that Congress is capable of making \nbetter decisions.\n\n  I totally and absolutely reject this. We adopted an amendment similar \nto this, but we adopted it when the majority leader, Senator Dole, made \nit clear that we were never going to see it emerge from conference--yet \nwe ended up in conference with serious negotiations about really doing \nthis.\n  I, frankly, think it is outrageous that, on an appropriations bill, \nwe are getting ready to mandate that working people and businesses \nprovide a benefit, whether they want it or not; that they pay for it, \nwhether they want it or not; and we are doing exactly what the American \npeople are continually outraged about: injecting our value judgments \nover theirs. We are saying that we know better than you know--that you \nreally need this expanded mental health coverage, even if you do not \nwant it and even if you can not afford it.\n  The point is, mental health care may be a wonderful thing. If we \ncould snap our fingers and have everybody in America covered, it would \nbe great. The truth, however, is that we cannot. This is expensive \ncoverage. It is not an accident that private health insurance policies \nnormally have differentials. In fact, in many cases, people do not have \nmental health coverage.\n  We have not had a tremendous amount of experience with mental health \ncoverage under a third party payment system, where the insurance \ncompany is paying for it. I know we can get into a lengthy debate about \nexperience of various States. I have seen estimates as high as 15-\npercent increase, if you force people to pay for mental care for \nalcohol and drug rehabilitation. I do not know how to pull\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\nthat apart. But the point is, whatever the costs, how dare we, in the \nfreest society in the history of the world, attempt to play God by \ntelling people what kind of health insurance they must have.\n  I think the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from New \nMexico is perfectly reasonable--more than reasonable. It simply says to \ninsurance companies: You do not really live in a free society, you can \nnot decide what product you want to sell, instead we are going to \nmandate that you sell this policy. Indeed, we are going to use the \npolice power of the State to make you sell this policy. But, at least \nthe Senator from Colorado says: We are not going to force young working \ncouples, whose jobs might be threatened, whose ability to afford \nphysical health insurance might be threatened--we are not going to make \nthem buy it.\n  It seems to me that is the issue. In terms of somehow relating this \nto medical savings accounts, that is the most contorted logic I have \never heard in my life. The point of medical savings accounts is that, \nunder the current tax law, if you buy low-deductible insurance it is \ntax free. But if you buy high-deductible insurance and you put the \ndifference in a savings account, then you have to pay taxes on that \ndifference. In essence, we are making people, through the Tax Code, buy \nlow-deductible insurance. We are putting people in a position where, \nwhen they are buying health care, it is like going to the grocery store \nand having a grocery insurance policy, where 95 percent of what you put \nin your grocery basket is going to be paid for by grocery insurance. \nNeedless to say, if you had such a policy, you would eat differently, \nand so would your dog--this is part of the problem.\n  What medical savings accounts do is expand choices. What the Domenici \namendment does is limits choices. What gives us the right to say that \npeople should be forced to buy health insurance that provides coverage \nwhich they otherwise would not choose to buy? Who are we to say that we \nhave made this value judgment, that mental health care and physical \nhealth care are equal? Furthermore, who are we to say that if you have \na policy which has a certain limit on physical care, and if you have \nany element of mental care in that policy, you are going to be forced \nto have the same limits on mental health care as well?\n  Let me tell you what this amendment would do. This amendment would \ndrive up the cost of health insurance, it would drive up payroll costs, \nit would increase the cost of employing workers, and, therefore, people \nwould lose their jobs.\n  Some courageous Members were willing to stand up and be counted upon \non the issue of the minimum wage. How is this issue any different? How \nis this at all different? The plain truth is, this is not different. \nWhat this amendment would do is impose an unfunded mandate on workers \nand businesses. This will drive up unemployment. It will limit freedom. \nIt will drive up the cost of health care. It will reduce the number of \npeople who are covered by health insurance. And, finally, in the most \nperverted provision of this amendment, it will induce people to drop \nmental health coverage rather than face these expanded limits.\n  So, I know we have danced around this issue before. I know that, in a \nform people thought would go to conference and die there, we have voted \non this before. I was proud to vote against it then and I am going to \nbe proud to vote against it now. I think the Brown amendment is an \namendment that makes the underlying amendment dramatically better. \nBecause what the Brown amendment says, in its simplest form, is people \nhave to offer this coverage for sale, but you do not have to buy it.\n  If you believe in freedom, if you believe in the right of people to \nchoose you will vote for the Brown amendment. I would remind my \ncolleagues who talked about lack of choice--there is a choice. If you \ndo not like the health insurance your employer is providing, you do \nhave an option. We do not have indentured labor in this country. We do \nnot allow the enforcement of indentured labor contracts. People have a \nright to change jobs, and in fact people change jobs every day because \nof health insurance, because they want it and they want to expand their \nfreedom.\n  This is an amendment that limits freedom. This is an amendment that \nis an unfunded mandate of the worst sort. This is an amendment which \nhas the Congress choosing for consumers, choosing for their employers, \nand I think it is absolutely wrong. I strongly oppose the underlying \namendment and I strongly support the Brown amendment, which simply \ntries to preserve consumer choice.\n  I would think that the authors of the underlying amendment would \naccept the Brown amendment because all the Brown amendment says is \nthat, while the insurance coverage has to be offered, if the consumer \ndoes not want it, cannot afford it, feels it threatens his or her job, \nor if it threatens the viability of the company, you do not have to buy \nit. You either believe in freedom or you do not.\n  If you believe in freedom, you are not for the Domenici amendment. If \nyou believe in freedom, you are for the Brown amendment. Those are \nstrong words but they are words that exactly fit the case before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have heard the distinguished Senator \ncategorize the words of my good friend, the occupant of the chair, as \n``preposterous,'' or what was it you chose to say, Senator? I think \nthat is probably a good paraphrase.\n  Let me suggest the entire debate by the Senator from Texas has been \npreposterous. First, it is wrong on the facts; and, second, it is wrong \non the logic; and, third, it is a gross exaggeration if ever I have \nheard one. So, let me tell you the facts. And the Senator might do well \nto listen, because they are the facts.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will listen.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And I appreciate it, if you will.\n  First of all, the only way we have been able to judge the cost of \nthese various insurance changes is to get the Congressional Budget \nOffice to tell us. Let me tell you what they said about this amendment. \nSixteen one-hundredths of 1 percent possible increase. Sixteen \nhundredths of 1 percent possible increase. Caveat, they said--caveat, \nwe are not taking into consideration that it will probably be \nsubstantially less, if we know the effect of managed care and HMO's.\n  Would anybody gather from the argument of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas that we are talking about that? Let me convert it to an \ninsurance policy's average costs: $6 to $8 a year. That is the choice \nbetween freedom and servitude, $6 a year, or $8.\n  That is freedom from being in jail or being forced to be indentured--\n$6 or $8 a year.\n  Let me talk about eliminating choice. I just asked what the \nconference report on the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill passed by, how many \nvotes. I looked and found my good friend, the Senator from Texas, voted \nfor that. Though I might suggest to him--and I am his good friend--when \nhe makes an argument I do not agree with, I make it as forcible as he, \nperhaps not as intellectually as he.\n  Having said that, I noted he voted for that bill. Mr. President, if \never you wanted to make an argument about eliminating freedom of \nchoice, that was the bill to do it on, because you no longer have any \nchoice to say, ``I don't want to buy insurance that covers the \npreexisting condition of my neighbor.'' Right? You say, ``I want \nanother insurance policy, because I want the right to choose between \ncoverage of preexisting conditions or not.''\n  Let me suggest, if there are degrees of freedom, you just waive \nfreedom there in an astronomical way, and if you are losing some \nfreedom here, you are losing it in a little, tiny, almost immeasurable \nquantity.\n  So let me repeat to the U.S. Senate what this issue is about. This \nissue is about whether or not you want to take a little tiny step \ntoward providing some kind of parity of treatment under insurance \npolicies in this land to those who suffer mental illness.\n  Let me tell you what it does not do. It does not require the kind of \ncoverage, the amount of copayment, the deductibles. Those are all left \nup to the insurance companies. All it says, I say to my friend from \nKentucky, is if you write an insurance policy that covers\n\n[[Page S9924]]\n\nmental illness, then write it for the aggregate coverage level that is \nidentical to the coverage level for physical illnesses. Is that a \nmonumental thing? Most policies aggregate between $500,000 and $1 \nmillion. That is what you are saying: If you write one with mental \nillness, do not put one in at $50,000 and cancel at $1 million. Just \nput 1 million dollars' worth of coverage.\n  I repeat, this is not a huge imposition of new costs on anyone. My \nfriend from Texas says there is no experience with the coverage of \nmental illness. That is absolutely wrong. There is plenty of experience \nwith the coverage of mental illness. There are all kind of insurance \npolicies out there with coverage of mental illness without \ndiscrimination on the aggregate amount. Many companies already know \nwhat it will cost, and they know what it will save.\n  All we are suggesting is that there are a few million American \nfamilies out there who think they have insurance coverage, and they \nfind that their 17-year-old daughter away at college got depression in \nher freshman year--could not make a choice, all of a sudden could not \nsleep, all of a sudden gets deathly sick, and all of a sudden the \ndoctors say she has severe depression.\n  All of a sudden they say, ``Well, we have insurance.'' They wake up \nand ask somebody. Surely, if the father of the house had a heart \nattack, he can stay in a hospital 6 weeks. He can get 300,000 dollars' \nworth of surgery. But for that daughter, if you look at the policy, and \nit probably said $50,000. And they thought they had insurance. If you \nhave severe depression and get hospitalized and then have to have the \ntreatment that follows it, $50,000 is not even going to begin to care \nfor them, just like $50,000 will not touch bypass surgery and all of \nthe rehabilitation that comes with it, or severe cancer with six \noperations and chemotherapy.\n  That is all we are saying. If you are going to write an insurance \npolicy, insurance industry of America, businesses in America, if you \nare going to cover your employees and you are going to cover physical \nailments and mental illness, just make sure that the aggregate amount \nis the same.\n  That is not making any huge, momentous decision for the populace of \nthe United States. It is a very simple, forthright, practical approach \nto insurance coverage.\n  As a matter of fact, the only reason they are writing it out of the \npolicies now and writing it lower is because it is cheaper. When people \nstart finding out and asking about it and wanting it, then they will \ncover them, but in many instances, it is already too late. But if you \nmake it that they must have these aggregates in all of the policies, I \nrepeat, the denial of freedom is so insignificant and the cost is so \ninsignificant that it is a trivialization, it trivializes the use of \nthe words ``denying freedom of choice.'' It is truly turning monumental \nwords that we cherish and worry about, like ``freedom,'' and attaching \nthose to something as insignificant as what we have just described here \non the floor.\n\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Brown-Gramm amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask the Senator to withhold so that I might respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would you like?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want time to respond, or I can suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico withhold?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will let the Senator respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, every Member of the Senate voted for the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill. I stood on the floor and made it very clear \nthat by moving toward community rating, we were driving up health \ninsurance costs.\n  What I wanted was medical savings accounts as a method to promote \ncompetition and empower the consumer to make rational choices. Like \nmost bills, it represented a tradeoff: an expansion of freedom in one \narea, a reduction of it in another. I see no expansion of freedom here.\n  No. 2. If this provision really costs one-sixth of 1 percent, why \nisn't it a matter of course in insurance policies? If this provision is \nso cheap and so good, why is it not provided?\n  I will offer another amendment saying that if, under this provision, \nthe cost of insurance rises more than 1 percent that this provision \nwill be void, and we will see if that will be supported.\n  Everyone who has ever argued that we should diminish freedom to \npromote a political objective has said that the political objective is \nbig and the diminution of freedom is small. The point remains and is \nirrefutable that under this amendment, we are going to make you buy \ncoverage that you may not want. We are going to make employers provide \ncoverage that they may not be able to pay for unless they drop mental \nhealth coverage altogether. I believe that this is clearly a step in \nthe wrong direction.\n  Obviously, any of us can stand up and talk about things that any \nfamily would like to have. Wouldn't any family in America like to have \ncomprehensive mental health care when a 17-year-old child in college \ncomes down with severe depression? Obviously, they would. But there are \nalso a lot of families who would like to have a 17-year-old in college.\n  There are a lot of people who would like to have better jobs than \nthey have. The point is, life is about choices. Life is about choices \nthat we have to make in a free society.\n  Senator Brown says that we can require insurance companies to offer \nthe policy. But the Domenici amendment says you also have to buy the \npolicy.\n  You have to buy this coverage whether or not you want it, whether or \nnot you can afford it, and whether or not it threatens your job or your \ncompany. Why? Because we, the Congress, in our infinite wisdom, have \ndecided that this is something you need to have.\n  It seems to me, if there was just one clear message in the last \nelection, it was stop making decisions for us in Washington, let us \nmake decisions for ourselves.\n  If this policy really cost one-sixth of 1 percent, then let people \nchoose to buy it, let companies decide to offer it. I do not believe it \nwill cost one-sixth of 1 percent. I believe we are talking about a very \nexpensive rider to insurance policies.\n  I think that this rider is going to drive up the cost of health \ninsurance and, in effect, deny people who are having trouble buying \ninsurance the ability to cover themselves or their child should he or \nshe fall down, break an arm, or, God forbid, be in an accident. We are \ngoing to jeopardize their ability to have any health insurance at all. \nFurther, we are going to jeopardize their ability to have a job, and \nare going to induce many companies to drop health coverage altogether. \nSoon people will find out that if they have a child that has a mental \nproblem, they will not even have $50,000 of coverage, let alone \ncoverage equal to the rest of their policy.\n  The point is this, if this is so cheap, if this is so irrelevant from \nthe point of view of cost, why not let people choose it on their own? \nOr better yet, why not have the insurance company be required to \nprovide it and then let people decide if they want it based on their \nanalysis of cost and benefits? Or are they so foolish, are the American \npeople so naive, so unaware of their own needs and their own wants that \nthey must have us tell them what they need? I do not think so.\n  It seems to me that the Brown amendment has the saving grace of \nletting people choose. You force the insurance companies to offer this \ncoverage whether they want to offer it or not, but at least you let \npeople decide if they want it. I cannot understand, for the life of me, \nwhy people are opposed to this. If really this coverage costs one-sixth \nof 1 percent, we would all want it; we would all choose it. The only \nreason you would not let people choose it on their own is if you do not \nbelieve that one-sixth of one percent number, or you believe that \npeople would not choose it. The point is, freedom is the right to make \nwrong decisions as well as to make right decisions. I simply go back to \na fundamental point which, in my opinion, despite all the wonderful \nspeeches you can give about this--Bismarck once said, ``Never does a \nsocialist stand on stronger ground than when he argues for the best \nprinciples of health.''\n  Who can stand and argue against somebody having coverage for a \nphysical or mental ailment? No one can. We\n\n[[Page S9925]]\n\nall want it. We wish we could magically make it happen. But we should \nnot make it magically happen by mandating that people have it, by \nforcing people to pay for it whether they want to or not, without \nknowing what it costs, without knowing the ramifications of this, all \non an appropriations bill at 7:30 p.m. at night in the month that we \nare going to adjourn the Senate.\n  I think that this amendment violates everything that many of us claim \nthat we stand for. I do not doubt the good intentions, nor have I ever \ndoubted the good intentions, of the Senator who is offering this \namendment. But this is bad public policy. It flies in the face of \neverything the 1994 election said because it denies people the right to \nchoose.\n  If we want to preserve this right to choose, not for the insurance \ncompanies, but for the consumer, then it is critical that the Brown \namendment be adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I shall not prolong the debate. We have had \nexcellent comments by both sides. I appreciate the very thoughtful \ncomments that Senator Domenici has made and Senator Gramm has made \nbecause I think they enlighten debate.\n\n  I hope Members, when they vote on this, will do one thing: look at \nthe amendment and read it. And let me just read the words because I \nthink they are important to focus on. Here are the words of this \namendment:\n\n       Consumers shall retain the freedom to choose a group health \n     care plan with coverage limitations of their choice even if \n     such coverage limitations for mental health services are \n     inconsistent with section 2 of this title.\n\n  Mr. President, that is all this amendment does. It retains, in the \nconsumer, the right to choose.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe we have had debate on this. I just want to, \none more time, suggest that what is missing from the Senator from \nTexas' discussion is--I would put it this way--there was total \nmisunderstanding as I listened to him talk about severe mental illness \nand the marketplace and the neighborhoods of America. Because that \nillness has been so stigmatized for so long, it has even stigmatized \nthe insurance policies of this land.\n  We started out 30 or 40 years ago recognizing that we came out of the \nDark Ages with reference to severe mental illness and crazies and \nloonies, and we started understanding that people really were sick. \nYet, we dragged everybody kicking and screaming to understand that a \nmother or a father with a child with schizophrenia had nothing \nwhatsoever to do by way of treatment or care with that child getting \nsick.\n  Pretty soon we got to recognize that even that famous old Dr. Freud \nwas wacko because you could not talk people out of mental illness. You \ncan have them on the sofa and chair and talk until you are blue in the \nface, and if you are a schizophrenic, you are sick. What happened is, \nsociety just resisted that. And I guess part of it is that every now \nand then somebody who is mentally sick kills someone and there we are \nagain talking about ``those people.''\n  But let me tell you, there are millions of Americans who have members \nof their family with one of these dread illnesses. All we are \nsuggesting in this measure, and I repeat, if an insurance company \nwrites insurance that covers mental illness--now if you want choice, \nunderstand, they do not have to cover mental illness--but if they \nchoose to, we just say, let us get rid of the stigma and cover them in \ntotal dollar coverage to the same extent you cover the other illnesses.\n  If they want to triple the copayment, I say to Senator Kennedy, \nbecause they want to keep people away from psychiatrists, there is \nnothing in this measure that says they cannot do that. We are just \nsaying, when you insure somebody that is mentally ill, and they get \nreal sick, make sure they are the same limitations on total coverage \nthat people who get cancer or diabetes or tuberculosis or triple bypass \nhave. And that is all it says.\n  That is the reason it is not going to cost very much. The amendment \nthat passed early on, where we mandated coverage and we mandated parity \nof actual literal coverage, was very, very different. And my friend \nfrom Texas might have made a very serious argument there, but in this \ncase that is not the situation.\n  So I believe, to say if you are writing mental health coverage it has \nto have these limits and turn around and say, on the other hand, even \nif you have done that, insurance company, we have the right to say, \nwell, lower the level and give us another kind of coverage with less of \nthat because we want freedom of choice--the choice is clear.\n  You can buy an insurance policy without mental health coverage or you \ncan buy in the manner discussed so eloquently on the floor by the \nSenator from Utah, if that applies. So having said that, I move to \ntable and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask the Senator on one point to allow me \nto respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do understand. I grew up in a household with someone who \nhad mental illness. I grew up in a household where nobody had health \ninsurance. We did not have health insurance for physical or mental \nailments. But the point is, if you are going to mandate coverage, then \nyou will end up with more people who have no health insurance, and you \nare going to have more people without jobs.\n  The point is that under this amendment you lose your right to choose. \nTo keep a policy that has limited mental health coverage, you either \nhave to take no mental health coverage or take coverage equal to that \nset for physical illness coverage. The Brown amendment gives you \nchoice. It seems to me that is what we want.\n  My problem here is not that I do not understand. My problem is that I \ndo understand. My problem is that I do understand what this does \neconomically. I do understand that this takes away from people the \nright to choose. That is why I am opposed to it. There certainly is no \npolitics in opposing this amendment. We should all be for giving \neverybody everything. Unfortunately, we live in a world where people \nhave to choose. When we choose for them, they not only have less \nfreedom, they do not get to choose to spend their money as they would \nchoose to spend it.\n  I believe families know better than we do. Even though our intentions \nmay be wonderful and even though we may wish everybody had mental \nhealth coverage, families have to make hard choices when they have to \npay. Businesses have to make hard choices. All I am saying is let them \nchoose. If you want to make insurance companies provide the coverage, \ndo not make people buy it. Have it available. Let them look at the \ncost. If it costs one-sixth of 1 percent, they will buy it if they want \nit. I would certainly buy it at that cost.\n  My fear is we are going to find out later this is a very costly add-\non, and we are going to price people out of the health insurance they \nhave now, and they are going to end up with both physical and mental \nailments, and they will not be covered for either.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know my colleagues are anxious to move forward. \nAlthough there is so much I want to say for the record, I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I want our colleagues to know that I have \nbeen discussing this back and forth with the Democratic leader. He was \naware that I was going to do this. We are working on a number of other \nissues that are not directly related necessarily to this. We also have \nan understanding that we are working out on exactly what time this vote \nmight occur.\n  But I have just filed a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 3396. Under rule XXII, the cloture vote will occur--we will either \nhave this occur on Monday or agree to a time on Tuesday. I believe we \nare going to agree to a time on Tuesday when this vote will occur. So I \nthink we are getting cooperation on that.\n  If we continue to work toward an agreement on the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill, and go ahead and get started next on the Interior \nappropriations bill, then we would probably have this vote on Tuesday \nmorning around 10 o'clock. But we will make that official later on.\n\n  I now withdraw the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I just wanted to take a moment to explain that it is not \nour desire necessarily to hold up this piece of legislation. There is \nsupport on our side as well. Unfortunately, the majority leader has not \nbeen able to work out an agreement with us to accommodate a number of \nSenators on our side who wish to offer amendments. It was for that \nreason that I objected tonight.\n  Obviously, we will have a good debate about the bill. It will be my \nhope we could offer amendments, but at least at this time it does not \nappear to be likely. We will continue to work together and try to find \na way to resolve these issues, but at least tonight that has not been \nresolved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9926-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9926-S9934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It will \nminimize the debate if we just have it read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following: Notwithstanding the provisions of this title, if \n     the provisions of this title result in a one percent or \n     greater increase in the cost of a group health plan's \n     premiums, the purchaser is exempt from the provisions of this \n     title.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this amendment says that if Senator \nDomenici is wrong, and there are more than de minimis costs in \nexpanding this coverage, and those costs exceed 1 percent, then the \npurchaser of that policy would be exempt.\n  I think this is a good stopgap measure. If the Senator is right and \nthis coverage can be provided for one-sixth of 1 percent, then it will \nbe provided. If it raises the cost of the policy more than 1 percent, \nthe purchaser of the policy would be exempt.\n  I think it does improve the underlying amendment, and I am grateful \nthe Senator has accepted it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, consistent with everything I knew when I \nbrought the amendment to the floor,\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\nthe cost should not exceed a 1 percent increase, and therefore, in good \nfaith to the Senators who supported me and supported the amendment, I \naccept this amendment as further evidence of what I have been saying in \nthe Chamber for the last hour and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment by the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after working with the Democratic leader, I \nask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \namendments in order between now and 9:30 p.m.; that any votes ordered \nwith respect to those amendments be stacked to begin at 9:30. They are \nas follows: Gramm second-degree amendment to Domenici, Domenici-\nWellstone, Harkin Veterans' Administration amendment, Daschle spina \nbifida, and the Lott-Daschle Iraq resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, only for \nthe purposes of clarification, it is my understanding that the spina \nbifida amendment will either be up or down or a tabling motion. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me consult before I respond completely \non that point. Let me double check with the managers of the bill to \nmake sure.\n  Is there something we can do in the interim while we make sure of the \nanswer to that question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Sure. Finish the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5196) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we have the yeas and nays ordered on the underlying \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Domenici-Wellstone \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me renew the unanimous-consent request and read it from \nthe beginning again, because there have been some changes already.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \namendments in order between now and 9:30, that any votes ordered with \nrespect to those amendments be stacked to begin at 9:30. They are as \nfollows: Since we have already dealt with the Gramm second-degree \namendment to Domenici, the first vote beginning at 9:30 would be \nDomenici-Wellstone, followed by a motion to table the Harkin amendment, \nfollowed by a vote on a point of order on germaneness on the Daschle \nspina bifida amendment, followed by a vote on the Iraq resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. There was not objection to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. On the final passage of VA-HUD, they are checking on that. \nThat could also occur tonight or will occur stacked with other votes on \nTuesday, probably beginning at 2:15. But the leader and I have \ndiscussed this, and I have his commitment that we will either do it \ntonight or we will do it in stacked votes on Tuesday. So we will \nbasically be prepared to complete the VA-HUD appropriations bill either \ntonight, depending on one other outstanding issue, or we will \ndefinitely have the final vote on it at 2:15 on Tuesday. And we will \nplan on asking consent there be 10 minutes between these votes \nbeginning at 9:30, so if Members stay in the Chamber, we could get them \ndone quickly. And you will have time here now to get a bite to eat, and \nwe will start this series of votes at 9:30 and hope we can wrap it up \ntonight.\n  Ten-minute votes, 10-minute votes, not between each vote.\n  Mr. President, let me go ahead and ask that now.\n  When the votes occur at 9:30, I ask unanimous consent that they be \n10-minute votes; that there be 2 minutes between each vote equally \ndivided to explain briefly exactly what the vote is, so Members will \nmake sure they understand exactly what the vote is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Iowa is present. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5197\n\n (Purpose: To provide that funding for veterans medical care shall not \n                         be reduced to states)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nMoynihan, myself, and Senator Specter, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Moynihan and Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered \n     5197.\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.   . Without regard to any provision in this bill, no \n     plan for the allocation of health care resources (including \n     personnel and funds) used or implemented by the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs among the health care facilities of the \n     Department shall reduce the funding going to any state for \n     veterans medical care for the fiscal year ending September \n     30, 1997, below its fiscal year 1996 level of funding if the \n     total funding provided for veterans medical care in fiscal \n     year 1997 exceeds the fiscal year 1996 funding level.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to have the amendment fully read \nso all Senators and staff watching on their television sets would know \nexactly what this amendment is all about.\n  The veterans of the United States have earned the right to decent \nhealth care and medical care. They have risked their health and their \nlives to secure the liberties that we all enjoy. As we allocate scarce \ndollars for veterans' health care, we must ensure that no State is \nunfairly cut. That is why I am rising here to offer an amendment that \nwill ensure that no State will lose funding for veterans' health care \nthis year if the overall budget for veterans' medical care increases, \nwhich it does in this bill. The budget goes from $16.6 billion in \nfiscal year 1996 to $17 billion in this bill, an increase of about 2.4 \npercent.\n  Why this amendment? Yesterday this body voted for an amendment by \nSenator McCain that calls for changes in the funding formula for \nveterans' health care. I hope my colleagues understand the full impact \nof that amendment. I want to make sure my colleagues know the amendment \nthat was adopted yesterday goes far beyond a mere study of the funding \nformula. I listened to some of the debate yesterday, and I talked with \nsome Senators. They said to me, ``This is just a study of the funding \nformula.''\n  That amendment, adopted yesterday, calls for implementation of the \nplan without further action by Congress. Let me read the relevant part \nof that amendment.\n\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\n\n       (d) Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement the plan \n     developed under subsection (a) [``shall'' implement the plan \n     developed under subsection (a)] not later than 60 days after \n     submitting the plan to Congress under subsection (c), unless \n     within that time the Secretary notifies Congress that the \n     plan will not be implemented in that time and includes with \n     the notification an explanation why the plan will not be \n     implemented in that time.\n\n  That is the end of it.\n  So subsection (d) says the Secretary shall implement the plan within \n60 days, not later than 60 days. It does not say that Congress has to \ndo a darn thing. He just has to submit it to Congress, and then within \n60 days, he has to implement it, unless within that time he submits or \nnotifies Congress that the plan will not be implemented and spelling \nout the reasons why it will not be implemented.\n  I hope we all understand the full force and effect of this. The \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs will submit a plan to Congress for \nreorganization. The McCain amendment says it shall be implemented not \nlater than 60 days, unless the Secretary turns right around and tells \nCongress, ``Oh, no, we don't want to implement it, and here are the \nreasons why we shouldn't.''\n  That is about as bizarre as you can get, that the Secretary would \ncome up with an implementation plan and then turn right around and tell \nCongress, ``But it's no good, and we don't want to implement it.''\n  I urge my colleagues, each and every one of the Senators here, to \ncall your regional network director to find out what the amendment will \ndo to their States. I think you may be in for some surprises, because \nthe VA, without notice to all of us, is already working to phase in a \nchange in payments to the States over the next 2 years, and that \nchange, which is similar to that called for under the McCain amendment \nthis body adopted, would result in substantial cuts to many States' VA \nmedical care budgets, even with the 2.4 percent increase that this bill \nprovides nationally.\n  The draft VA plan would significantly cut funds to Iowa. I only found \nout about the cuts because of an article in the August 23 issue of the \nCedar Rapids Iowa Gazette that indicated that veterans centers in Iowa \nand Nebraska would be receiving $12 million less in fiscal year 1997 \nthan in fiscal year 1996. This reduction was confirmed by John T. \nCarson, director of the Central Plains Network, in a letter to my \noffice.\n  Mr. President, this article goes on to show that there are going to \nbe huge cuts in Iowa and in Nebraska, at least, under this article, and \nothers, even though the total amount of money for VA health care is \nincreased next year.\n  I have a letter from Mr. Carson spelling out the details of what it \nwould mean for Network 14. The fiscal year 1996 base of distribution is \n$268,035,000. The recommended fiscal 1997 allocation is $255,942,000, a \ndifference of over $12 million less for that network, even though the \nfunding nationally is going up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article and the \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Cedar Rapids Iowa Gazette, Aug. 23, 1996]\n\n                 VA Official Warns of Future Iowa Cuts\n\n                            (By Lyle Muller)\n\n       Iowa City.--Iowa's Veterans Affairs medical centers may \n     have to cut more jobs next year if they cannot trim non-\n     personnel expenses, a VA official said Thursday.\n       Any cuts would follow the 100-plus scheduled for after Oct. \n     1 at VA hospitals in Iowa City, Des Moines and Knoxville.\n       ``One of the worrisome things is, will we have to continue \n     that next year?'' Tom Carson, director of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs' regional office, said in Iowa City.\n       ``I believe we all hope that we do not face what we faced \n     this year,'' he said, referring to a year of furloughs and \n     finally decisions to cut jobs during the federal budget year \n     that begins Oct. 1. ``It's a major troubling item we have \n     facing us for fiscal year 1997.''\n       Carson said he expects the three Iowa centers and three \n     more hospitals he oversees in Nebraska to spend $12 million \n     less next budget year than they received in federal funding \n     this year.\n       The centers, which make up the VA Health Administration's \n     Central Plains Network, would be able to spend $256 million \n     next budget year, according to current plans.\n       That is about 4 percent less than this year's $268 million \n     and marks a radical change from what Carson previously was \n     expecting. Until this week, plans called for boosting \n     spending at the Iowa and Nebraska centers by 2.5 percent.\n       Carson was in Iowa City for a monthly meeting with the \n     directors of the Iowa and Nebraska centers. The anticipated \n     funding cut was to receive most of the attention, he said.\n       On Tuesday, Iowa City's VA Medical Center announced it will \n     eliminate 39 jobs after Oct. 1.\n       Gary Wilkinson, director of the 1,200-employee, 165-bed \n     Iowa City center, said he expected to spend $72.6 million \n     next budget year. That will be adjusted, however, because it \n     reflected a 2.5 percent increase, he said.\n       ``This last year we were in financial trouble; there's no \n     question about that,'' Wilkinson said. ``We decided there was \n     this number of people that we couldn't afford.''\n       Eliminating 39 jobs at the Iowa City center will save about \n     $1 million, officials there estimate.\n       The Des Moines center announced last month that it will \n     drop 25 jobs. Knoxville has targeted 32 filled positions and \n     18 vacant ones for elimination.\n         Department of Veterans Affairs, Network 14, Miracle Hills \n           Parkview Professional Center,\n                                       Omaha, NE, August 23, 1996.\n     Peter Reinecke,\n     Legislative Director, Senator Harkin's Office, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Reinecke: Thank you for your inquiry regarding the \n     projected FY 97 budget for Network 14.

We will fax the \n     information to you by September 3, 1996, if this is \n     satisfactory.\n       Please contact us for any additional information you need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John T. Carson,\n                                 Director, Central Plains Network.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if that article had not appeared, I \nprobably would have blindly gone forward and voted for the McCain \namendment and voted for this bill, assuming that Iowa would get a 2.4 \npercent increase in its VA health care budget. After all, that is what \nis in the bill. The bill contains a 2.4 percent increase.\n  If we do not adopt the amendment that I just sent to the desk, I am \nconcerned that my colleagues from the Midwest and many other States \nwill also see massive cuts.\n  All my amendment does is ask for a little fairness in allocating the \nveterans health care budget. Our veterans in Iowa are older than the \nnational average. We have the highest percentage of citizens over age \n85 in the Nation--the highest. The health care that these, our oldest, \nveterans require is much more expensive than that for the general \nveteran population.\n  Any capitation funding formula that does not adequately account for \nthese factors will be grossly unfair to States like Iowa, and the \nMcCain amendment does not do the job. In fact, the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona was specifically revised to strike the factoring \nin of the medical condition and, thus, the cost of caring for veterans \nfrom the distribution formula.\n  Let me repeat that. The Senator from Arizona specifically revised his \namendment to strike the factoring in of the medical condition and, \nthus, the cost of caring for veterans from the distribution formula.\n  My friend, the Senator from Arizona, argues that the sheer number of \nveterans moving to his State creates an unfairness, but it is the \nyounger, healthier, and generally better off retired vets who are \nmoving to the sunshine States. It is the older, the sicker, and the \npoorer vets who are increasing in other States like Iowa. As a result, \nthe McCain amendment and the VA draft plan are grossly unfair to our \nStates.\n  While on the surface it may sound very nice to say we ought to \nallocate the money for just every veteran, that every veteran ought to \ncount the same in allocating the money. On the surface it sounds \ngenerally reasonable that, if you have more veterans in one State,\n\n[[Page S9929]]\n\nthey ought to get proportionally more than veterans in another State if \nthat State has fewer veterans. But what about a State like Iowa or New \nYork or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin or Indiana, or a lot of other States, \nwhere, again, our populations are older and they are poorer and they \nrequire this VA medical help?\n  I suppose my friend from Arizona might say, ``Well, they are moving \nto Arizona,'' but I am sorry, Mr. President, that is not the case. It \nis the younger, the healthier, and the more prosperous ones who are \nmoving to Arizona. What we are left with are those who are older and \nsicker and poorer, and they cost more to care for, especially in a \nrural area. This has to be taken into account.\n  It would be grossly unfair to equate an 80-year-old veteran, let's \nsay, who is making $12,000 a year or less and living in Iowa and has \nsevere health problems with a 65-year-old veteran fully mobile who has \nmoved to Arizona and plays golf every day. So the formula that the VA \ncomes up with has to take the medical condition into account.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Iowa yield? I apologize for \ninterrupting.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted to yield, if I do not lose my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Without losing his right to the floor. We have a number \nof pieces of legislation that have to be addressed in the next hour. We \nanticipated, given what the Senator from Iowa indicated to me that he \nonly had 10 minutes, that it would take 10 minutes. We have now used a \nhalf hour of that time allotted. He certainly did not consume it all. \nBut I am wondering whether it would be appropriate to get a unanimous-\nconsent agreement that the time on the Harkin amendment will be \nterminated at 8:45 to allow other amendments to be debated so that we \ncan assure the opportunity to vote on all of these at 9:30, as the \nunanimous-consent request was proposed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my leader, I thought it would only take about 10 \nminutes. I only wanted to make my point on them. I think the Senator \nfrom Arizona is probably going to rebut them. I am sorry. I apologize, \nI did not know we had a 9:30 time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Senator \nfrom Florida and I do not intend to take a lot of time. We understand \nwhat the distinguished Democratic leader is saying. In 2 or 3 minutes \nwe can rebut the arguments of the Senator from Iowa.\n  I think it is very important we provide courtesy to other people with \nother amendments so they will have ample time, too. So, please, don't \nbase your continued conversation on the fact that the Senator from \nFlorida and I will take a lot of time. We don't need a lot of time, \nfrankly, to rebut your arguments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthe Harkin amendment, with appropriate responses from the Senator from \nArizona and others, be limited to no more than 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think there \nare a couple minutes for both the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Florida. I had 5 minutes. We started this at 8 o'clock. And I \nnotified the Senator from Iowa we were trying to get going. If we could \ndivide this. He has had an opportunity. If he could take 5 more \nminutes, and we could have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did not start at 8 o'clock. I apologize to my friends \non the floor. I have been talking now for just a little over 7 minutes. \nI started about 7 minutes ago.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 8:16 is when we were told from the desk \nyou started. That is not the point. How much more time does the Senator \nfrom Iowa need?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would take 2 minutes. I do not know about the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Two minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is 4 minutes. The Senator from Missouri had 5 \nminutes. That would be 9 minutes. How much time does the Senator from \nIowa need?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I propound the unanimous-consent request \n20 minutes to be divided, 2 minutes, 2 minutes, 5 minutes and 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this body is making a major change in the \ndark, without adequate information of its impact on the States. I have \nasked the VA for a State-by-State breakdown of their draft reallocation \nplan so I could share it. However, the VA will not provide it to me. \nThey will not provide it to me.\n  After begging and pleading for information, I found out that 8 of the \n22 regional networks are scheduled to receive cuts under the draft \nplan. I believe that more would be cut under the McCain amendment \nbecause the VA is phasing in their change over 2 years. Under the draft \nVA plan, networks could see cuts as high as 15 percent next year alone.\n  Mr. President, I have an incomplete list of States and these networks \nthat would be cut, up to 15 percent, despite a 2.4 percent increase in \nthis bill. They are Iowa, Nebraska, California, Nevada, Michigan, \nIllinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, \nConnecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania, West \nVirginia, Delaware, and Vermont. This is an incomplete and unofficial \nlist. I have derived it from information provided by VA officials. So I \nwant to assure you that this is not in any way complete.\n  Let me tell you about the probable impact on Iowa veterans.\n  Until a month ago the regional network for Iowa and Nebraska was \ncounting on a budget increase commensurate with the proposed 2.4-\npercent increase in the VA medical budget for fiscal year 1997. Even \nwith this increase there have been significant layoffs at our hospitals \nand an increase in the number of veterans being turned away from \nmedical care. They are being told ``tough luck.''\n  Let me just relay a couple of the stories. One of the Iowa veterans \nwho has been shut out has multiple sclerosis. He qualifies for Social \nSecurity disabilities. But Medicare does not come close to covering all \nhis medication costs. He is classified as a category C veteran because \nhis wife works and makes about $18,000.\n\n  Mr. President, let me remind you category C veterans are treated at \nthe discretion of the VA. Because of the tight budgets, this veteran is \nbeing turned away without warning after coming to rely upon the \nVeterans' Administration for help. He is justifiably angry he is being \ndropped by the Government. He is worried about his medication bills. He \nand his wife are trying to be independent, but they need help from the \nVA medical center to make it.\n  There is another Iowa veteran who has diabetes, back problems, \ndepression. He is on Social Security disability, Medicare. He has \nbought Medicare supplemental. He has been going to the VA medical \ncenter for his medications which cost over $10,000 a year. If he were \nsingle he would be eligible for VA medical services. But his wife makes \nabout $25,000 a year. He is classified as category C. The local VA \nmedical center has turned him away because of tight budgets. This \nveteran who faithfully served this country is trying to decide between \ndropping most of his medication for diabetes, depression and pain or \nseparating from his wife.\n  Mr. President, can we in good conscience do this to our veterans?\n  A third Iowa veteran had rectal cancer. He had his anus, rectum, part \nof his colon, and part of a lung removed. He has had painful \nchemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite all this, he is managing to \nkeep a small business going, but he has been told he earns too much, \ncannot come back to the VA medical center for treatment. He is now \nfaced with giving up his business just so he can get medical care.\n  These three veterans are far from unique in Iowa. And now, if Iowa is \nsubject to this big cut, as opposed to a 2.4-percent increase in the \nNation, it will get much, much worse.\n  This amendment has the support of the American Legion in Iowa, the \nIowa AMVETS, the Iowa VFW.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from them be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The American Legion Department of Iowa, Office of the \n           Department Services Office,\n\n[[Page S9930]]\n\n                                                September 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: It was brought to our attention that \n     you are going to be presenting an amendment before Congress \n     proposing funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     medical centers not be reduced to the states.\n       We wanted you to know that The American Legion, Department \n     of Iowa, wholeheartedly approves of this proposed Amendment.\n       We have many veterans who fall into the VA's Category C \n     (veterans who make too much money to receive VA Health Care), \n     and we do not wish any other veterans to be cut from the \n     system.\n       The veterans of the United States deserve better treatment \n     from our government and we hope that you are also working on \n     getting rid of the ``categories'' that prohibit certain \n     veterans from receiving health care they so desperately need. \n     They served our country and believed our country would be \n     there for them. It is ironic that the government called on \n     them--yet will turn around and cut the funding for the \n     veterans at the drop of a hat.\n       We thank you for your support and hope that your proposal \n     is victorious.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kristin Waldron,\n     Senior Claims Representative.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                           AMVETS,\n\n\n                                           Department of Iowa,\n\n                                Des Moines, IA, September 5, 1996.\n     To: Senator Tom Harkin.\n     Attn: Kevin Aylesworth.\n     From: Robert O.

Further cuts would be devastating. . \n     . . These veterans have served our country without concerns \n     for their lives--many were wounded and died to save our \n     country from tyranny. The least we can do for them is \n     maintain 1st class medical programs for them--if it were not \n     for the veterans we wouldn't have the comforts we all enjoy \n     in this Great United States.\n                                         Robert O.

Terry Lipovac,\n                                       Department Service Officer.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, what is the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs planning to do to the veterans of your \nState? We are doing something here in the dark without any information \non their impact on the States. My amendment simply says this, that if \nthere is an increase like there is in this bill, that no State will get \nless than what they did last year.\n  That means that Mr. McCain in Arizona and perhaps Mr. Graham in \nFlorida and other sunshine States, they can get the increase, but at \nleast do no harm. That is what my amendment does. It borrows from the \nadage: First, do no harm. We are about to rush in, make rash changes in \nthe VA medical care funding allocations, and in a lot of our States, a \nlot of veterans are going to get hurt.\n  So let us not do any harm. All my amendment says is--we will cede the \nincrease--but let us next year hold the States harmless, that no State \nwill get a cut next year. And then let us see what the VA's plan really \ndoes when they come to Congress next year. I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has agreed that his \n2 minutes can be allocated to the Senator from Florida. So I ask the \nfull 4 minutes be allocated to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this amendment which was adopted overwhelmingly by the \nSenate, today being the third or fourth instance in which this \namendment has been adopted, speaks to a simple principle. And that is, \nthat the Nation's commitment to provide for the health care of its \nveterans is a national commitment, and that that commitment runs to \nindividual veterans, not to them through the State in which they happen \nto live.\n  These facilities that provide the services are facilities of the \nFederal Government, financed and administered under laws that we enact. \nOur responsibility is to individual veterans. The principle of this \namendment is that those veterans should be treated equitably.\n  The fundamental operative provision of the amendment which this \nSenate has adopted is that the Department of Veterans Affairs, among \nthe health care networks of the department, shall allocate health care \nresources so as to assure that veterans who have similar economic \nstatus and eligibility priority and who are eligible for medical care \nhave similar access to such care regardless of the region of the United \nStates in which such veterans reside, a fundamental principle of \nfairness. And that, Mr. President, has been the objective of the \nVeterans' Administration for over a decade.\n  Prior to 1985, the Veterans' Administration followed the principle \nthat the Senator from Iowa is advocating we return to. And that is, \nthat you look first at what were expenditures in the previous year, \nmake incremental adjustments to those previous expenditures, and that \nbecomes the funding level for the future.\n  According to a report by the General Accounting Office, dated \nFebruary 1996, the VA historically allocated funds to facilities on the \nbasis of the facility's past expenditures with incremental increases \nfor such factors as inflation and new programs.\n  Beginning in 1985--I repeat, beginning in 1985--the Veterans \nAdministration modified its allocation system because it recognized the \nneed to more directly relate funding to the work performed, the cost to \nperform it, and to improve the efficiency and productivity with which \nmedical care is delivered to veterans. We have not had the plan that \nthe Senator from Iowa suggested for a decade.\n\n  This same GAO report indicates we need to move further in order to \naccomplish the objective, that we still have a system which does not \ntreat all of our veterans fairly according to their eligibility \nstandards, their economic status, and their eligibility for and need \nfor medical services. The GAO report states in part, ``Because of \ndifferences in facility rationing practices, veterans' access to care \nsystemwide is uneven. We found that higher income veterans receive care \nat many facilities while lower income veterans were turned away at \nother facilities.''\n  That is the system that we have today. Mr. President, there are a \nnumber of reasons why this is occurring. A fundamental reason is the \nfact that veterans are, as a part of our population, becoming a smaller \ngroup. We have fewer veterans today than we did 5 years ago and we will \nhave still fewer 5 years into the future, and veterans are not \ndistributing themselves proportionately across the country.\n  For example, in the State of Arizona, between 1980 and 1995, the \nnumber of veterans increased by 89,000 or 24 percent. There were 24 \npercent more veterans in Arizona in 1995 than in 1980. In the State of \nthe proponent of this amendment, the number of veterans in the same 15-\nyear period declined by 68,000 or almost 19 percent. Yet the Senator is \nadvocating a proposition that says regardless of the number of veterans \nbeing served--my State happens to have a declining population while \nanother State has an increasing population--we should, for some \narbitrary reason, fix on the past and say that will be the basis on \nwhich we will distribute our Veterans' Administration funds for medical \ncare, not taking into account what that means in terms of per patient \nrecipient of funds or what it may mean in terms of encouraging greater \nefficiency and effectiveness in the use of funds available.\n  I could give stories similar to the one that the Senator from Iowa \nhas just given about former residents of his State who now live in my \nState who say, ``When I lived in my previous residence I was able to \nget certain prescriptions from the VA center. I cannot get them now in \nmy new home. I was able to get treatment for a condition in my previous \nresidence through the VA. I cannot receive it in my new home because of \ninadequate resources and inequitable allocation of funds.''\n  Mr. President, the principle of the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona and myself is a simple one: The Nation's responsibility is to \nindividual\n\n[[Page S9931]]\n\nveterans wherever they live. And to fulfill that responsibility, we \nshould pursue the goal of treating all veterans equally wherever they \nmight live, and the responsibility is upon the Veterans Administration \nto reach that goal.\n  We have outlined a plan which the Veterans' Administration supports. \nThey support the amendment that this Senate has already adopted because \nthey recognize that it is a road back to achieve the objective which \nthey have been pursuing since 1985.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate recommit itself to the principle of \nfairness that was adopted earlier in the debate on this issue and \nreject the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, which would return us to \na period of a decade in the past and would return us to a time in which \nwe did not accept the principle that all veterans should be treated \nequally, because all veterans in the same economic conditions, the same \nhealth status, have served this Nation with equal valor and commitment \nand deserve to be treated fairly.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reluctantly I state that I cannot support \nthe Harkin amendment. The amendment, as has been recognized, is \ndirectly in conflict with the McCain amendment we adopted yesterday, \nwhich the Senate approved in a 79 to 18 vote. I am very sympathetic to \nthe concerns of the Senator from Iowa that certain VA facilities may be \nlosing resources relative to other facilities as the Veterans \nAdministration changes its operations to become more like an efficient, \nmodern, managed care organization.\n  I am fully supportive of the steps VA is taking to change the way it \noperates. Frankly, I believe the changes initiated by the VA under \nSecretary for Health Dr. Ken Kaizer represent very positive steps for \nthe betterment of veterans' health care, and the McCain amendment is \ncompletely consistent with the bold and necessary steps being taken by \nDr. Kaizer to ensure approved quality of care for veterans.\n  I do not minimize that the steps being taken are painful. The VA has \nnever experienced so much change in so little time. However, with \ndeclining discretionary resources, a shift in the veteran population to \nSunbelt States, a decline in the veteran population, and rapid changes \nin health care delivery, the VA must, indeed, make changes.\n  The McCain amendment reflected the findings of a GAO report of \nFebruary 1996 which found the VA's traditional method of allocating \nresources was not equitable, it was not population based, and some \nfacilities were receiving twice as much funding per patient as other \nfacilities. In response to GAO's findings and in recognition of the \nneed to change its traditional resource allocation method, the \nVeterans' Administration has begun moving toward a parity-based \ncapitated model for resource allocation. I emphasize that, despite what \nsome newspaper stories may have stated, no final allocations have yet \nbeen determined.\n  In the process of allocating the resources more equitably, a process \nwhich is to be fully implemented in fiscal year 1998, there are going \nto be some areas in some facilities which are winners. There are going \nto be some facilities which are losers. There are different populations \nserved by those facilities. It is the right direction for the VA to be \npursuing. It will bring about efficiencies, fairness, and improved \ncare. We should not stand in the way of these important improvements. \nWe have already seen the elimination of some redundancies as closely \nlocated facilities merge their administrative services and as VA opens \ncommunity-based outpatient clinics in lieu of providing high-cost \nhospital-based care.\n  In my own State of Missouri, the Poplar Bluff, MO, Veterans' \nAdministration recently closed inpatient surgical procedures because of \nthe inadequate workload and excessive mortality rates. The decision to \nclose that portion of the facility was painful and four doctors lost \ntheir jobs. But it was the right decision. It was the right decision \nfor the facility, for the system, but, most importantly, it was the \nright decision for veterans' health care.\n  The Harkin amendment is unacceptable partly because at this time VA \ndoes not know what the specific allocation to each hospital will be for \nfiscal year 1997 since the model for resource allocation for fiscal \nyear 1997 is still under development. Frankly, it is possible that some \nfacilities could receive less than the fiscal year 1996 level. \nMoreover, the allocation will not be individually to hospitals but \nrather to the 22 networks, each of which encompass several VA \nfacilities and which we can hope will be based on the need and the \npopulation in each area.\n  I should add, very importantly, that the Veterans' Administration is \nopposed to the amendment as it takes a step backward to the progress it \nis attempting to make. The VA has said the only obstacle to better \nhealth care for veterans is likely to be Congress. If we are looking at \nhow many jobs in how many facilities and trying to legislate those into \nplace and into being, we will prevent an improvement in the system.\n  The VA has stated it intends to provide health care services to the \n2.8 million veterans currently receiving care. Even with the resource \nadjustments within the system, VA does not expect to deny patients care \nwho are now getting care in any of its 22 networks.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 4 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield 1 minute to me?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield a minute to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I see no discrepancy between the McCain \namendment that we adopted last night and what Senator Harkin is doing. \nSenator Harkin is essentially doing a bridge and ensuring that those \nStates that might have to make readjustments under the new plan that is \nbeing suggested can do so, which I voted for; I voted for McCain. But \ndoing McCain without Harkin is going to send out panic in the \nNortheast-Northwest corridor. We want to have full-scale cooperation. \nWe want to do the plan being suggested in an orderly, rational way. We \ndon't need administrators doing damage control instead of patient \nmanagement. I do not see the discrepancy.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment is for 1 year, this fiscal year, providing \nthe bridge, because the Veterans' Administration does not have a plan. \nThis does not prohibit McCain from going forward in terms of the plan \nand giving us the report in 60 days, beginning to implement the 60 \ndays. You can do that, but it is going to take a full year to do it. \nWith all due respect to the VA, they are, at times, a bit sluggish. \nThis will at least give a year. I see that as a bridge. I thank the \nSenator from Iowa. I support the McCain amendment, I support the Harkin \namendment, and I support the veterans. God bless America.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I had written down \nhere that a vote for my amendment does not contradict a vote for McCain \nat all. The Senator from Maryland pointed that out. What I am saying is \nthat, for the first year, all of the increase can go to Florida and can \ngo to Arizona, these high-growth States. All we are saying is, don't \ncut the legs out from underneath those States, so we at least have 1 \nyear to figure out what is going on here. That is why I offered this \namendment. I am not trying to fix on the past. I am not advocating that \nat all. I want efficiencies. But any plan that does not take into \naccount the age and the illness, rural areas, that type of thing, I am \nsorry, that is not a good plan.\n  Again, I point out that last night the Senator from Arizona modified \nhis amendment. If you read the first page, what was modified and \nstricken out--it says this as it was first written:\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall develop a plan for \n     the allocation of health care resources in the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs among the health care facilities of the \n     department so as to ensure that veterans who have similar \n     economic status and eligibility priority or medical \n     conditions. . . .\n\n  Guess what was stricken out? ``Or medical conditions.'' That is what \nI am talking about. This amendment says wait a minute, you have to take \ninto account medical conditions. I say to my friend from Florida, that \nis why I think we need a year, as the Senator from Maryland said, as a \nbridge. I know that the number of veterans in Iowa is going down. They \nare going up in Florida and in Arizona. I understand that. But keep in \nmind, as I keep saying, that the ones we have left are the\n\n[[Page S9932]]\n\nolder and the poorer of the veterans.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amount \nof time allocated to this amendment not exceed 15 minutes with the time \nevenly divided between myself and the Senator from Missouri, Senator \nBond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we had the debate on this amendment this \nmorning, so this is meant simply to be a summary statement. Let me \nbegin by reminding my colleagues about the mission of agent orange and \nthe Agent Orange Act of 1991.\n  The Agent Orange Act of 1991 was passed unanimously, 99-0, with the \ncosponsorship of my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Simpson. It \nrequires the Department of Veterans Affairs to evaluate scientific \nfindings from the National Academy of Sciences, based on their review \nof all related evidence.\n  This year, the National Academy of Sciences found compelling \nevidence, based on scientifically sound epidemiological studies, to \nplace spina bifida in the second category of compensated diseases. As I \nmentioned earlier, the VA already covers all of the conditions in \ncategories 1 and 2, except spina bifida, because the Secretary doesn't \nhave the authority to provide these benefits to children of veterans.\n  We are not here today to debate the underpinnings of the original \nlaw. What we are here today to do is to talk about our obligation. The \nbattle about the original law was fought and won. That ended 5 years \nago.\n  We have a reasonable proposal to address the unique needs of these \nkids, whose disabilities are linked to their parent's exposure to agent \norange. I don't have to remind any of my colleagues that the National \nAcademy of Sciences is a highly respected, nonpartisan research \norganization. Congress regularly relies on the National Academy of \nSciences to provide unbiased, scientifically sound information. It is \nvery unfortunate, as some of my colleagues have done, to criticize \ntheir professionalism simply because one disagrees with its findings.\n  NAS has assembled a panel of expert scientists to review all of the \nsigns associated with agent orange exposure. They found several \nepidemiological studies that supported an association between parental \nexposure to agent orange and the presence of spina bifida in children. \nNAS found the reanalysis of the Ranch-Hand study particularly \ncompelling. They compared Vietnam veterans with non-Vietnam veterans \nand accounts of exposure. Despite the comments of the Senator from \nWyoming this morning, they have indeed found a higher incidence of \nspina bifida in the children of Vietnam veterans. That is what led them \nto conclude what they did in the report last spring.\n  That report states simply:\n\n       Neural tube birth defects were in excess among offspring of \n     Ranch Hands with four total cases in contrast to none among \n     the comparison infants.\n\n  This translates into a rate of 5 per 1,000, significantly higher than \nCDC's normal spina bifida rate of 4.5 per 10,000.\n  In other words, there is a four times higher level of incidence of \nspina bifida with agent orange exposure than there is with no agent \norange exposure, according to this study. These findings are \nstatistically significant. And that is what the law requires. If you \nsee a significant statistical difference, you have to reflect that in \nthe requirements provided in the law that passed in 1991.\n  Furthermore, in addition to the Ranch Hand study, a number of studies \nof veterans appear to show an elevated relative risk for either service \nin Vietnam or estimated exposure to herbicides or dioxin, and the \npresence of neural tube defects in their offspring. For those \ninterested in reading an unbiased analysis of the strengths and \nweaknesses of each study, I certainly refer you to the NAS report.\n  Mr. President, we could talk for the rest of the night, if we had the \ntime, about the science of this issue. The real question is: Who ought \nto get the benefit of the doubt? Who should deserve the benefit of the \ndoubt, given the commitment made by our veterans in Vietnam, now more \nthan 20 years ago? Do we give it to the veterans and their children, or \ndo we give it to those who would argue that we need more information, \nmore science, more data, even though the accumulation of data has \nalready demonstrated a clear association?\n\n  By placing spina bifida in the second category, NAS, the experts we \nchose 5 years ago to advise us, concluded there is evidence suggestive \nof an association. The law set a standard of positive association that \nwe are relying upon in this amendment. When the credible evidence for \nan association is equal to or outweighs the evidence against an \nassociation, the benefit of the doubt, by law, must go to the veteran. \nThe law specifically does not require evidence of cause and effect.\n  Reconciliation has not happened and is not in sight. As a result, the \nprovision identified in the amendment can be used as savings to pay the \nvery limited benefits we are talking about today. This widely supported \nprovision would insert into the law a fault requirement to limit the \nVA's liability in non-malpractice related cases.\n  Regardless of what arguments can be put forth by others, the fact \nthat a hearing is being held later this month is an argument that, in \nmy view, is not relevant to the debate on this amendment. It is not \neven dealing with the issue. Those interested in addressing\n\n[[Page S9934]]\n\nthe issues raised by the March report have been working for months to \ndesign an appropriate solution.\n\n  This amendment is strongly supported by veterans and disability \ncommunities. Veterans and their families have waited decades for the \nconfirmation embedded in these findings. They should not have to wait \nany longer.\n  This amendment is clearly germane to the underlying bill. It is a \nveterans issue, and this is a veterans bill. We are not going to be \nfooling America's veterans by suggesting that somehow this is not \ngermane. Opponents of this amendment should not be able to hide behind \nsome convenient, questionable procedural motion. This is germane. It is \nrelevant. And the time to act is now.\n  We cannot wait any longer. Let us treat spina bifida as we do all the \nother diseases that we have already determined have a direct \nassociation to agent orange exposure. Let us give veterans and their \nchildren the means and support necessary to deal with the problems \nassociated with this crippling disability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have had a lot of debate, a lot of heated \nrhetoric, and a lot of stirring stories of personal tragedies during \nthis morning's session and tonight, and there is a lot of emotion \ninvolved. I think it is reasonable to understand why there is emotion, \nbecause every year in the United States there are approximately 150,000 \nbabies born with serious birth defects. There are congenital heart \ndefects, Down's syndrome, neural tube defects, primarily spina bifida. \nOf those birth defects, about 4,000 babies have spina bifida.\n  Over the past several years, I have worked with the March of Dimes \nattempting, with some success, to get the Centers for Disease Control \nfunding for their prevention programs in research to find out what \ncauses these problems, to set up a surveillance and monitoring program \nso that we can have some sound evidence as to what causes these \ndefects. Some research on spina bifida is already bearing fruit. There \nis a connection between mothers taking folic acid early in pregnancy, \nand reduced rates of the incidence of spina bifida have been found. \nThis is good news. This is good science. We are making some progress. \nBut a lot more work needs to be done on the causes, the incidence, and \nthe protections.\n  Now we come to the recent actions by the National Academy of \nSciences. Let me be clear that the agent orange law does not require us \nto expand an entitlement on this bill. The Agent Orange law does not \napply to children or offspring of veterans. The agent orange law sets \nup some presumptions, but they have to be based on science, which is \nnot present here.\n  The National Academy of Sciences in their review this past spring \nfound in one study what the authors called a possible association \nbetween exposure and spina bifida in the offspring of veterans. The \nNational Academy of Sciences then presented this information to the \nVeterans' Administration with the caution on how the study should be \nused. In fact, in that study, the task force emphasizes that its \nconclusions ``made for the limited purposes of PL-10234 do not reflect \na judgment that a particular health outcome has shown to be caused by, \nor in some cases even definitely associated with, herbicide exposure \nunder the standards ordinarily governing such conclusions for purposes \nof scientific inquiry and medical care.''\n  So much for the contentions that there is compelling scientific \nevidence. They said there was not.\n  Later this summer, the author of the study, the Ranch Hand study, \ntold us in testimony before the House that his study was not adequate \nto make a decision that there was a causal link. He cautioned the \nHouse, and said do not count on a causal link from this study. It does \nnot show it.\n  Then, on July 29, the minority leader introduced legislation which \nused the study to create this new entitlement program. There has not \nbeen a hearing held on it in the authorizing committee.\n\n  But there is also some new information that, frankly, I just came \nacross. The Air Force has now sent a letter to Congress, dated August \n29, in which they state in their 1996 progress report on the bottom of \npage 3--this is on the Ranch Hand study, the one study which reported \nto show any connection:\n\n       We found no indication of increased birth defects severity, \n     delays in development, or hyperkinetic syndrome with paternal \n     dioxin. The data provides little or no support for the theory \n     that external exposure to Agent Orange and its dioxin \n     contaminant is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that there is a very real question of whether \nthere is any--certainly this has not been demonstrated--scientific \nevidence of a linkage.\n  It is time for cooler heads to prevail. We have all expressed our \nconcerns over birth defects. The amendment is not supported by sound \nscientific evidence. It is not even uniformly supported by veterans \ngroups who recognize that the impact of the amendment will mean reduced \nbenefits to veterans as a result of new entitlements and health care \nfor dependents.\n  There are many questions which the debate has raised which deserve \nfull consideration in the normal legislative process before the \nauthorizing committee. The opponents of this amendment have every bit \nas much compassion for people with these disabilities such as spina \nbifida. All we are saying is let us get the science that establishes \nthe linkage. It is not there. Let us not jump into something that is so \nlacking in scientific evidence.\n  That is precisely why we have a separate procedure in this body to \nconsider legislation, particularly legislation setting up an \nentitlement program with hearings and actions before an authorizing \ncommittee.\n  Since this is an attempt to set up an entitlement program, and it has \nnot been heard before or acted upon by the authorizing committee, I \nraise a point of order that this amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would suggest that the manager of \nthe bill withhold his request as the minority leader still has 50 \nseconds of his time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield that time to the distinguished \nDemocratic whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleague from \nMissouri talk about the March of Dimes. I started with the March of \nDimes. We raised $800 trying to find a polio vaccine until it was \ncompleted. For 25 years I have worked with the March of Dimes and \nscholarships. The March of Dimes can't be used to stop this amendment. \nThe veterans and their children deserve the vote of this Senate.\n  If you could listen to the Democratic leader and the statements he \nhas made, if you want to vote against the Vietnam veterans' children \nwith spina bifida, you go ahead and do it. Then we will see who suffers \nthe consequences. We are talking about children here. Let us be \ncompassionate tonight, and not be so hard that we say to these Vietnam \nveterans there is even the possibility that they should not be taken \ncare of.\n  I hope the Senate will join the Democratic leader and support his \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 49 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the argument about political retribution for \nsomebody who demands scientific evidence and wants to provide a fair \nhearing and a scientific basis for action is one which does not, I \nthink, serve this body well. I think we have a proper procedure for \ndetermining whether there is scientific evidence. To date, there has \nbeen none shown. That is why when I said this is entitlement \nlegislation being offered on an appropriations bill, it is not germane \nto the appropriations process. And, for that reason, I raise this point \nof order that this amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. According to the unanimous consent agreement, the final \nissue to be disposed of at approximately 9:30 deals with the resolution \nrelating to Iraq. I would like to address that resolution at this time.\n  I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 288) regarding the United States \n     response to Iraqi aggression.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on Tuesday, I spoke briefly about my \nviews on President Clinton's decision to retaliate against Iraq for its \nunprovoked, unjustified, and brutal attack on the civilian population \nof Irbil, a city in northern Iraq.\n  At that time, I also indicated I planned to introduce a resolution \ncondemning Saddam Hussein's behavior and expressing the Senate's \nsupport for the President's actions.\n  I must say I never dreamed it would take this long and be this \ndifficult to arrive at a simple resolution in support of the actions \ntaken earlier this week.\n  For several days now, we have been attempting to resolve issues \nrelating to language and have been thwarted and frustrated in that \neffort for a lot of reasons, in large measure because many of my \ncolleagues on the other side wish not to laud the President or find any \nway with which to praise the President's actions. In fact, for the last \nseveral hours the issue has been, do we even use the word ``President'' \nin the resolution? There was an adamant feeling on the part of many on \nthe other side that we could not use the word ``President,'' and so you \nwill not find that word used as a result of the requirements by many of \nmy colleagues on the Republican side.\n  In fact, the only reference to the President is a reference to the \nCommander in Chief, and I must say that that is suitable to many of us, \nbut I do believe that it is a very unfortunate set of circumstances \nthat could have caused some partisanship, in fact a great deal of \npartisanship, to enter into these deliberations.\n  Let me at the same time applaud the majority leader for his \nwillingness to continue to work with me to resolve those outstanding \nquestions and to come to some compromise on the language that has now \nbeen presented to the Senate. His work and his cooperation as well as \nthat of some of our colleagues on the other side have brought us to \nthis point tonight.\n  Let me also thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia, the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Nunn, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Carl Levin. Let me also \nthank Senator Pell and many others--Senator Biden, who had a lot to do \nwith the wording of this legislation; in addition, Senator McCain, \nSenator Warner, and others who were very helpful in bringing us to this \npoint.\n  Let me make it very clear that in spite of what I consider to be the \npettiness involved with whether you use the word ``President'' or not, \nthis resolution very clearly and strongly and wholeheartedly supports \nthe measures taken by this President in the last 72 hours.\n  Last Saturday, in spite of clear warnings from the United States and \nthe international community, Iraqi forces commenced their vicious \nattack on the defenseless civilian Kurdish population in and around \nIrbil. Casualties reportedly numbered in the thousands. Reports of \ndoor-to-door searches resulting in executions were rampant and, \nunfortunately, all too credible.\n\n  In addition to this obvious toll on human life, Saddam's invasion \nalso threatens the interests of the United States and its allies in \nthis crucial region of the world. The prospect for factional strife has \nbeen greatly increased while regional stability has been called into \nquestion, thereby enhancing the risk of a larger scale conflict in the \nregion.\n  Saddam's aggression is in direct contravention of the United Nations \nResolution 688 which was enacted in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf \nwar. At that time the Security Council empowered the United States, \nBritain, and France to protect the Kurdish population from human rights \nabuses by the Iraqi regime through the establishment of a no-fly zone \nover large portions of northern and southern Iraq.\n  Saddam's attack on Irbil blatantly violates international norms and \nis by itself sufficient justification for the President's decisions to \nstrike four critical Iraqi targets with 44 cruise missiles and to \nexpand the no-fly zone northward to the very suburbs of Baghdad.\n  Unfortunately, the aggression in Irbil is but the latest in a string \nof ruthless and provocative actions undertaken by Saddam before, \nduring, and after the Persian Gulf war.\n  Mr. President, I will not outline the entire catalog of violent and \nreprehensible acts undertaken by Saddam and his henchmen since he \nascended to power in Iraq. Needless to say, the list is as chilling as \nit is long. President Clinton succinctly noted in his statement on \nTuesday, ``Saddam Hussein's objectives may change but his methods are \nalways the same--violence and aggression against the Kurds, against \nethnic minorities, against Iraq's neighbors.''\n  It is for these reasons that I support and our colleagues support the \nPresident's decision to take action. I am very confident the American \npeople feel exactly as we do tonight.\n  The President's actions served a twofold purpose. First, they showed \nSaddam that he will pay a price for his latest act of aggression. In \nmounting the largest attack on Iraqi territory in the 5 years since the \nend of the Persian Gulf war, president Clinton has appropriately \nreminded Saddam that violations of international norms will not go \nunpunished.\n  Secondly, by destroying air defense assets in central Iraq and \nextending the no-fly zone northward toward Baghdad, the United States \nhas greatly reduced the threat Saddam poses to his opponents within \nIraq and his opponents in adjoining nations.\n  By restraining Saddam's bloody hand, the President's decisive action \nhas limited the ability of an oppressive regime to disrupt the volatile \ncenter of a Middle East region that is vital to American foreign policy \ninterests. The response was measured, appropriate, and absolutely \nnecessary.\n  I also want to indicate at this time my strong support for the men \nand women in uniform who are asked repeatedly to go in harm's way to \nprotect our national interests. Early damage reports from the latest \nattack on Iraq indicate another mission accomplished without a hitch \nand without a casualty.\n  It is noteworthy that despite the end of the cold war, the military \nforces of the United States continue to play a crucial role around the \nworld in advancing and protecting our national interests. This \ndedicated group of men and women have been called upon repeatedly since \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union and the onset of the post-cold-war \nera. They have never failed the American people or our friends abroad.\n  The resolution before us is an extremely crucial matter for all of us \nbecause our enemies and friends must see that we speak with one voice \nwhen it comes to our policy for containing and defeating Saddam \nHussein. As we have learned only too painfully in the past, domestic \ndiscord on important national security issues only plays into the hands \nof those who seek to undermine our resolve. It is critically important \nto demonstrate national unity when our military forces are in harm's \nway.\n  Even in this most intense political season, politics for all \nAmericans still ends at the water's edge.\n  President Clinton was faced with a broad array of choices when \ndeciding how to respond to Saddam's aggression, everything from doing \nnothing to inserting United States ground troops and forcefully \nevicting Iraqi troops from Irbil. Obviously, each end of this spectrum \nconstitutes an unacceptable and inappropriate response. Only something \nbetween the two extremes makes any sense, precisely the course chosen \nby President Clinton.\n  This resolution puts the Senate forcefully behind the President's \nmeasured decision. The President opted both to weaken Iraqi air \ndefenses and simultaneously expand the area in which the Iraqi Air \nForce will not be permitted to operate. These actions clearly \ndemonstrate the United States\n\n[[Page S9936]]\n\nis prepared to impose real costs on Saddam Hussein for his aggression. \nAs noted by Gen. Colin Powell, the President did exactly the right \nthing.\n  Of our friends and allies abroad, we ask they stand with the United \nStates as we seek to faithfully implement the U.N. resolutions adopted \nat the end of the Persian Gulf war. Saddam's actions demonstrate he \nstill represents a direct threat to his people, his neighbors, and the \nsecurity of the entire vitally important region. If the world were to \nlook the other way now and allow Saddam to go unpunished, we would \nencourage more blatant and damaging incursions in the future. There \nmust be no doubt in Saddam's mind that the international community is \nunited in its opposition to such unacceptable behavior.\n  Finally, to Saddam Hussein, let us state for the record the position \nof this administration and this Congress, as plainly and as simply as \nwe can. Although we may belong to different political parties and have \nopposing views on some issues, we stand united and indivisible on this. \nIraqi aggression must not go unpunished, now or in the future. We will \ninsist on Iraq's compliance with international norms of behavior, \nregardless of the circumstance.\n  To this end I have worked with the distinguished majority leader to \ndraft a resolution condemning Saddam's behavior and indicating our \nstrong support for the U.S. response to this latest incident. With the \nadoption of this resolution by the Senate, there should be no doubt in \nanyone's mind, least of all Saddam Hussein's, that the American people \nare united in their opposition to this conduct. Passage of this \nresolution is one way to demonstrate to our friends and enemies alike, \nour resolve on this crucial issue.\n  I ask for its support tonight. I hope we could indicate our support \nunanimously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just briefly, this Senate Resolution 288 \nrecognizes that the United States and its allies have vital interests \nin ensuring regional stability in the Persian Gulf. It recognizes that:\n\n       On August 31, 1996, Saddam Hussein, despite warnings from \n     the United States, began an unprovoked, unjustified, and \n     brutal attack on civilian population in and around Irbil in \n     northern Iraq.\n\n  It recognizes:\n\n       the United States responded to Hussein's aggression on \n     September 3, 1996 by destroying some of the Iraqi air defense \n     installations and announcing the expansion of the southern \n     no-fly zone.\n\n  Those are the whereas clauses in the resolution. And the resolved \nsays:\n\n       The Senate commends the military actions taken by and the \n     performance of the United States Armed Force under the \n     direction of the Commander-in-Chief, for carrying out this \n     military mission in a highly professional, efficient and \n     effective manner.\n\n  There are those who would have liked for it to have said a lot more. \nThere are those who were not comfortable saying anything at this time, \nwho have some questions about the policy and what the future holds. But \nI do think it is appropriate that we have a bipartisan resolution on \nthis subject matter, that we commend our men and women for the job they \nhave done. They have done a wonderful job in the air and on the sea in \nthis instance, as in all other instances. And whenever American forces \nare introduced, we do come together and partisanship stops at the \nshoreline, and that is the case here.\n  We have been working since Tuesday to craft a resolution that \ncondemns what happened there in Iraq, under Saddam Hussein's actions, \nagain, and to commend these troops.\n  There is no doubt in any Senator's mind that we have 100 percent \nsupport by the American people and by us in support of our men and \nwomen who have participated in this military action.\n  The United States has led the multinational coalition which defeated \nHussein's aggression in 1991. When President Clinton came into office, \nhe inherited a policy toward Iraq that included a weakened Saddam \nHussein, a united international coalition, a solid international \nsanctions regime and a united Iraqi opposition.\n  There is concern now about the move toward lessening sanctions, \nalthough I had an opportunity to personally ask the President about the \nsanctions, and he assured me that the sanctions were not being lifted \nand that the Iraqi oil sales were not going to go forward under these \nconditions.\n  We are also concerned about our international coalition, what is \ngoing to be their role in the new no-fly zone in the southern part of \nIraq.\n  So there is work to be done in this area, but I am sure both the \nCongress will be paying attention to that, as will the administration.\n  There is unanimous condemnation by the American people and by the \nSenate of the brutal attacks on the Kurdish areas in northern Iraq. \nThat is as it should be. While it is a complicated situation, with \ninterests by Turkey and interests by Iran and by different factions \nwithin the Kurds, it still is a situation that we cannot ignore. Any \nleader of a country, however that person obtained that position, that \nwill exercise that kind of brutality in his own country or threaten \nmilitary action against its neighbors or, in fact, invade a neighbor \nmust be consistently watched and very serious and strong actions taken \nagainst them.\n  I want to also say I am concerned--and I discussed this with the \nDemocratic leader--about the lack of prior consultation with the \nCongress about this action. The War Powers Act is very clear about the \nneed for notification, consultation and also a report on what happened. \nIt did not happen in this instance, and I don't believe it happened on \neither side of the aisle. That is unacceptable. Perhaps there were \nreasons for it, but I have expressed my concern to the administration, \nto the NSC, and I believe that we will have more consultation and \nnotification in the future. We must not have the commitment of military \npower without even a word of consultation with the Congress. We have to \ncontinue to insist on that.\n  Our resolution is a modest step tonight. Many of our Members would \nlike it to have been much more. I think it is fair. It has been worked \nout in a bipartisan way. I think it is time we stepped up to this \nissue, we have this resolution and we move on. So I appreciate the \ncooperation we did have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the resolution on \nIraq. This resolution states the Senate stands with our troops, and our \nPresident, as they respond to Saddam Hussein's brutality.\n  The President was right to act to contain Saddam Hussein's \naggression. Saddam Hussein's actions threaten American interests and \npeace in the Middle East--as well as the safety of his own people. He \nmust be taught that his reckless acts have consequences. He must pay \nthe price for his brutal and immoral actions.\n  The U.S. response is swift, specific and limited. The President \nresponded swiftly and strategically after Iraq seized the city of Irbil \nin the Kurdish safe haven. Our objectives are clear and limited: to \nforce Saddam Hussein to pay a price for his brutality and to make it \nsafer for our pilots to patrol the no-fly zones in Iraq by destroying \nIraqi air defense systems. To achieve these objectives, only specific \nmilitary sites are targeted.\n  We have already paid a great price to contain Saddam Hussein in \nOperation Desert Storm. If we ignore Saddam Hussein's latest \naggression, he will only be emboldened to take further reckless actions \nthat threaten our national interests--and the lives of his own people.\n  Mr. President, my thoughts and gratitude are with our brave troops. \nThey are once again called upon to stand sentry for those who would \notherwise stand alone. The men and women of our Armed Forces have \nperformed their mission with great skill and courage. I pray for their \nsafe and swift return.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last weekend Saddam Hussein sought to test \nthe international community's tolerance and resolve yet again. Some \n30,000 Iraqi soldiers, led by the elite Republican Guards, attacked and \ncaptured the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil in northern Iraq. Saddam \nundertook this action despite warnings from the United States and other \nmembers of the international community and in defiance of our \ncollective commitment, born out of the Persian Gulf war, to protect the \nKurds.\n  None of us knows why Saddam decided to test us now. But if the \nhistory of the last six years has taught us anything, it is that Saddam \nHussein does\n\n[[Page S9937]]\n\nnot understand diplomacy, he only understands power, and when he \nbrandishes power in a manner that threatens our interests or violates \ninternationally accepted standards of behavior, we must be prepared to \nrespond--and with force, if necessary.\n  President Clinton's response to Saddam's latest challenge was the \nright one--decisive, measured, and carefully calculated to take the \nstrategic advantage away from Saddam. By expanding the southern no-fly \nzone to the 33d parallel, we have denied him the ability to use two key \nmilitary air bases and to control Iraqi airspace from the Kuwaiti \nborder to the southern outskirts of Baghdad. This significantly reduces \nhis capacity to launch offensive operations against Iraq's neighbors \nand the Persian Gulf oil fields. By attacking his air defense and \ncommand and control systems we have increased our capacity to patrol \nthe no-fly zone and reduced the potential treat to our pilots and those \nof our British and French allies.\n  Saddam Hussein has tried to explain away this latest aggressive move \nby contending that his forces entered Irbil at the request of the \nKurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], one of the two warring factions in \nnorthern Iraq. It is hard to understand why any Kurdish faction would \nwillingly ally with Saddam, given the many years in which his forces \nhave repressed, tortured and abused the human rights of the Kurdish \npeople. However, if the KDP did request Iraqi intervention, that \nrequest does not justify the use of force against Kurdish civilians in \nIrbil. The international community has made it clear since April 1991, \nwhen the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 688, that it \nwould not tolerate the repression of the Kurds and other Iraqi \ncivilians. That is why the United Nations established the no-fly zone \nin northern Iraq. The Iraqi attack on Irbil, and the continued threat \nposed by Iraqi forces positioned to attack again in support of the KDP, \ncontravenes the letter and the spirit of this resolution.\n\n  For months the United States has led a diplomatic effort to try to \nmediate the conflict between two warring Kurdish factions, the \nKurdistan Democratic Party led by Massoud Barzani and the Patriotic \nUnion of Kurdistan [PUK] led by Jalal Talabani. There is no doubt that \nthe PUK's flirtation with Iran earlier this year and the raw power \npolitics played by these groups opened the door for Saddam Hussein. \nHundreds of innocent Kurdish civilians have died, and others could die \nas long as Saddam has de facto control over Irbil and Iraqi forces \nremain poised to attack other PUK-controlled areas.\n  The United States has a moral interest in preventing the abuse of the \nKurdish people, but our strategic interests go beyond this. We have \nstrategic interests in denying Saddam the capability to take action \nagainst Kuwait and other states in the region or to threaten the \nworld's oil supply. We also have a strategic interest in supporting the \nIraqi opposition as a way to counter Iran's growing influence and \nlimiting its ability to control a post-Saddam Iraq. That is why we did \nnot--and should not--side with either of the Kurdish factions.\n  The U.S. military response was deliberately designed to accomplish \ntwo objectives: first, to make Saddam Hussein pay a steep price for his \naggressive moves against Kurdish civilians in Irbil, and second, to \nweaken his capacity to undertake offensive action in the region. Time \nand again in the last six years, Saddam has tried to test the \ninternational community's commitment to peace and stability in the \nregion. Each and every time he has met a forceful response.\n  Iraq's August 1990 attack on Kuwait resulted in defeat for Iraqi \nforces at the hands of a U.S.-led coalition. Suppression of the Kurdish \nrevolt in northern Iraq at the end of the Persian Gulf war led to the \nestablishment of the northern no-fly zone by the international \ncommunity. Iraqi threats against United States and allied planes \nenforcing the no-fly zone in January 1993 led to missile strikes \nagainst Iraq's southern air defense systems. Six months later President \nClinton ordered United States forces to strike at an Iraqi intelligence \nfacility when he learned of an Iraqi plot to assassinate former \nPresident Bush. In October 1994, the United States and its allies sent \nforces to the region as Iraqi troops began to move south toward Kuwait. \nWe did the same thing the following fall when Iraqi troops appeared to \nbe moving south again.\n\n  The United States, under President Bush and then President Clinton, \nled these earlier efforts to contain Saddam. Whereas some of our allies \nin the region are constrained from acting on this occasion, we are not. \nOur interests, and the long-term interests of peace and stability in \nthe region, dictate that we respond to this latest test of wills with \nSaddam.\n  The Iraqi attack on Irbil has had serious ramifications for the \npeople of Iraq. It has resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians. It \nhas set back the possibility of resolving differences and reaching a \nviable political settlement between the Kurdish factions. It has forced \nthe United Nations Secretary General to suspend implementation of U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 986, which provides for the sale of some \nIraqi oil to generate funds to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi \npeople. Irbil is one of the key distribution centers for this \nhumanitarian assistance. Needless to say that plan cannot go forward in \nthe shadow of Iraqi forces.\n  President Clinton made it clear that we intend to judge Saddam \nHussein by his actions, not his words. Saddam has said that Iraq will \nnot respect the expanded no fly zone and yesterday, Iraqi radar locked \non a United States plane enforcing the zone. What this means is \nunclear. Clearly the rational response on Saddam's part would be to \nrefrain from any action that will escalate this crisis. I know that all \nof us hope that rationality will prevail.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join the majority leader today in \nexpressing the Senate's support for the accomplishments by the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces who planned and executed the recent air \nstrikes against Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi military. At times of \ninternational crisis, it is essential that our troops in the field--\nthose who are assuming high personal risks--know that they have the \nsupport of Congress and the American people. Having myself served in, \nand later with our military, as Secretary of Navy, I know the vital \nneed for this support for our troops and their families.\n  Since Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait in August 1990, I have \nbeen a consistent supporter of U.S. military, using force if justified, \nto stop Iraqi aggression throughout that region. It is clearly in the \nnational security interests, and the economic interests, of the United \nStates--and indeed the international community--to ensure that the \nGovernment and military of Iraq do not threaten the stability of a \nregion which contains an estimated 70 percent of the world's known oil \nreserves. That is why the United States, under the leadership of \nPresident Bush, was able to put together the most significant military \ncoalition since World war II to force Iraqi invaders out of Kuwait, \nrestore Kuwait sovereignty, impose severe restrictions and prohibitions \non Saddam Hussein's military capability and aggressive behavior, and \nrestore a measure of stability to this ever troubled region.\n  I was privileged to work with Senator Dole in drafting the \nlegislation and managing the floor debate resulting in Senate approval \nof the resolution which authorized President Bush to employ U.S. Armed \nForces--using force--in the Gulf War. It is hard to image today--when a \nconsensus generally exists in this country for taking military action \nagainst Iraqui agression--that in 1991, with 500,000 U.S. troops in the \nGulf ready to use force that the Senate supported the authority for the \nPresident to use force by a mere 5 votes. Thankfully, after Desert \nStorm was launched, the Congress, the nation quickly rallied behind our \ntroops. The missions, as set out in U.N. resolutions, were successfully \naccomplished.\n  Today, the crisis in Iraq is not simply about a tragic civil war \nbetween factions of the Kurds. It is about maintaining the regional \nsecurity balance that our troops fought--and died--for in 1991. Almost \n6 years after the gulf war, the international community is still \nfighting to secure Saddam's compliance with the agreements demanded \nfrom him and his government at the end of the war. Yet today, Saddam \ncontinues to defy U.N. weapons inspectors;\n\n[[Page S9938]]\n\nrefuses to account for Kuwaitis missing since the war; refuses to \nreturn Kuwaiti property seized during the Iraqi occupation; and \ncontinues to repress Iraqi citizens. Such actions must not be \ntolerated.\n  The United States has already made a substantial investment, in the \nSacrifices, casualties of our troops and their families, to contain \nSaddam's aggression. During Desert Storm, almost 150 U.S. military \npersonnel were killed, and over 460 were wounded. In addition, the \nAmerican taxpayer invested heavily in the U.S. major military effort, \nand has continued to pay--an average of at least a half billion dollars \na year since 1991--to contain Saddam Hussein.\n  That investment must be preserved, so a U.S. response to Saddam's \nlatest transgression had to be made. The timeliness, the magnitude, and \nthe process by which the Presidential decisions were made must be fully \nreviewed. But for now, a ``well done'' to the U.S. military.\n  I commend the majority leader, Senators Thurmond and McCain for their \nleadership on this resolution.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Saddam Hussein's movement into northern \nIraq was yet another direct threat to U.S. national interest: to \nmaintain security and stability in the Middle East. American cruise \nmissiles have struck various Iraqi military installations with the \npurpose of deterring Iraq from further violence against the Kurds and \nto take out air-defense systems that posed a danger to our air patrols.\n  I support the President as our Commander in Chief and his decision to \nattack Saddam Hussein's military installations to provide greater \nprotection for our personnel enforcing the current and expanded no-fly \nzone. I stand 100 percent behind the brave men and women in our Armed \nForces. Therefore, I support the resolution we are voting on this \nevening which condemns Saddam Hussein's actions and expresses support \nfor our troops and the President's efforts to curb further actions by \nIraq. It is my understanding that after intelligence reports disclosed \nthe Iraqi military buildup, clear warnings were sent that he should not \nuse any military force--warnings that were not heeded.\n  Mr. President, Saddam Hussein's actions and our response didn't come \nout of the blue. They are an extension of ongoing efforts to enforce \nthe restraints placed on Iraq at the end of the Gulf war. Therefore, \nwhile the use of force should always be a last resort tool of foreign \npolicy, the reckless and aggressive pattern of actions Hussein has \ncarried out, required the only warning he would respond to: force.\n  While we can understand these recent events, the future of this \nsituation remains a concern for us all. U.S. interests in the region \nhave not changed. In addition, the various conflicts among neighboring \nnations and the division within the Kurdish people, further complicates \nour ability to stabilize the situation. It is critical and in our \nnational interest that the administration work with our allies, \nespecially those in the region, to bring this incident to a peaceful \nconclusion.\n  Finally, while the cold war has come to an end, it is clear that we \ncontinue to live in an unstable world where our national security \ninterests will be tested. We must continue to fully fund our Armed \nForces so they remain strong. When we ask American men and women to put \ntheir lives on the line for our country, they better have the best \nequipment and training possible.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that we have strong national \nsecurity interests in this very volatile and unstable region of the \nworld. Any further hostility by Saddam Hussein's forces against our \npersonnel, or in violation of Operation Provide Comfort or the other \nrestraints established by the international community must be met with \na swift and decisive response from the United States.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 2 days ago the President ordered a forceful \nresponse to Iraq's aggression against its own Kurdish minority.\n  The question before us is whether the Senate supports the action \ntaken by our President.\n  Some have expressed concerns that go beyond the scope of that \nquestion. They have raised points that could be the matter of legitmate \ndebate--but that debate should be reserved for another day.\n  We are not debating the history of American diplomacy with respect to \nIraq. We are not debating the future of American security policy in the \nPersian Gulf. We are simply being asked to state whether or not we \nsupport the actions initiated by the Commander in Chief; Whether we \nsupport the troops fulfilling his orders; and, whether we condemn \nSaddam Hussein's aggressive actions.\n  These are weighty matters in and of themselves. We should not cloud \nthe debate by injecting extraneous issues.\n  I intend to support the resolution before us because I believe that \nthe forceful response ordered by the President was both necessary and \nappropriate. Saddam Hussein has demonstrated repeatedly that he only \nunderstands the language of force.\n  He was warned explicitly by the United States when evidence mounted \nof a threatening Iraqi military mobilization. He chose to ignore those \nwarnings and enter an area that has been the site of past Iraqi \ntransgressions. His actions violated universal human rights norms as \nwell as U.N. Security Council Resolution 688, which demanded that he \ncease his oppression of the Kurds.\n  Had this aggression gone unanswered, it would have strengthened his \nposition internally and emboldened him to strike elsewhere. Thankfully, \nit did not go unanswered.\n  President Clinton's decisive action sent a strong signal that the \nUnited States will not condone Iraqi military adventurism. It sent the \nmessage that there is a price to pay for aggression. It served to \nprotect vital interests in the Persian Gulf by reassuring key allies of \nAmerica's commitment to regional stability. And by extending the \nSouthern no-fly-zone, the President has constrained Saddam Hussein's \nability to make greater mischief.\n  Upholding these interests transcends the concerns that I and many of \nmy colleagues have over becoming enmeshed in the internecine warfare \nbetween Kurdish factions. The saga of the Kurds is a long tale of \nstruggle, betrayal, and oppression. It is one that is further \ncomplicated by a regional dynamic involving Iran, Iraq, Syria, and \nTurkey. The Kurdish question does not lend itself to an easy solution.\n  However, we should not allow the complexities of Kurdistan to cause \nus to lose sight of our broader objectives. The President's action is \nnot about involving the United States in Kurdish intrigue. It is about \ncontaining a dangerous tyrant who is a continuing threat to \ninternational peace and security. It is about preserving stability in a \nregion vital to American national security. In short, it is about \nprotecting American interests.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing with the President as he \nconfronts a ruthless dictator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9934-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9938-S9953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BOND.

MORTGAGE INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) None of the funds appropriated under this Act may be \n     used to give final approval to any proposal to provide \n     mortgage insurance having a value in excess of $50 million \n     for any project financing for which may be guaranteed under \n     section 220 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715K), \n     unless the Secretary has transmitted to the President pro \n     tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House the \n     Secretary's justification for such guarantee and no final \n     approval shall be given until the justification has laid \n     before the Congress for a period of not less than 30 days.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment which \nwould have stopped the Federal Housing Authority from using taxpayer \ndollars to guarantee mortgages for luxury housing developments, \ntargeted to families earning over $100,000 per year.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development is processing an \napplication from a team of developers, headed by the venerable Donald \nTrump, to obtain Federal Housing Authority mortgage guarantees for \ntheir luxury apartment development in Manhattan known as Riverside \nSouth.\n  The HUD program to which Mr. Trump and his associates are applying \nfor assistance is intended to promote development within urban renewal \nareas. To help qualify for the aid, Mr. Trump's group has pledged to \nreserve 20 percent of the units for low- and moderate-income residents.\n  The issuance of the Federal mortgage guarantee and the 20 percent \nlow-income reserve will entitle Mr. Trump and his partners to a vast \narray of municipal tax benefits, which one group calculates to be in \nthe range of nearly $4.5 million per ``needy'' individual assisted--not \nexactly what most Americans would consider cost-effective use of \nGovernment assistance.\n  I certainly have nothing against luxury apartments nor do I have \nanything against very successful project developers, including Mr. \nTrump. I do object, however, to asking the taxpayer to bear the risk of \na development for one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the country, \nto help finance a project that will predominantly benefit upper income \nAmericans.\n  I do not know how many similar projects are in the pipeline but they \nshould not be approved.\n  If this particular mortgage guarantee is approved, taxpayers will be \non the\n\n[[Page S9940]]\n\nhook for over $350 million. They will take this enormous risk--the \nlargest ever in the history of the program--to help provide housing, in \nsome instances, for people who earn an annual income of over $200,000 \nper year. the average apartment in the Riverside South project will be \ntargeted to families who earn in excess of $100,000.\n  I want to stress, the FHA program tapped to guarantee the success of \nRiverside South and its financiers is designed to promote vital urban \nrenewal.\n  I am not sure that downtown Manhattan is among our highest urban \nrenewal priorities. Harlem, South Chicago, South Central Los Angeles, \nand South Phoenix come to mind as needier priorities. Congressman \nNadler who represents the area in the House, and who is a member on the \nother side of the aisle, does not consider the area around the \ndevelopment site to be blighted and he opposes the project. I am just \nnot sure that Manhattan is particularly lacking the means to undertake \nurban renewal activities at its own expense.\n  The very simple premise is that we can and should focus our scarce \nFederal housing dollars, including loan guarantees, on projects that \nare primarily targeted to the needy in the most seriously depressed \nareas.\n  Moreover, the Donald Trumps of the world can more than afford to bear \nthe risk of their endeavors, and should not be indemnified with \ntaxpayer dollars. Quite to the contrary, scarce Federal housing \nresources should be used to maximize help to those who truly need \nassistance. I understand this amendment would be objected to.\n  In order to accomodate the leader's desire to finish the bill in a \ntimely manner, I've offered an alternative that will ensure that should \nHUD decide to approve the Riverside South project or any other project \nover $250 million, Congress will at least have the opportunity to act \nto stop it if we decide that the risk is too much or otherwise not in \nthe public interest. Under the amendment Congress will have 30 days to \nstop the approval before it can become effective.\n  Mr. BOND. There is no objection to the amendment on this side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5200) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5201\n\n     (Purpose: To provide supplemental appropriations for veterans \n            compensation and pensions for fiscal year 1996)\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 105, after line 2, insert:\n\n                     Department of Veterans Affairs\n\n\n                    veterans benefits administration\n\n                       compensation and pensions\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Compensation and Pensions'', \n     $100,000,000, to be made available upon enactment of this \n     Act, to remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment provides supplemental \nappropriations for fiscal year 1996 for VA compensation and pensions. \nThe department has just, today, notified our staffs that they \nanticipate being short $100 million in this current fiscal year for \ncompensation. Without this supplemental, checks for about 2 million \nveterans would be delayed for a week until the start of the new fiscal \nyear. It is supported on this side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5201) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased that once again the Senate \nhas chosen to continue our Nation's commitment to the future through \nthe exploration and study of the exciting frontier of space. No one can \npredict the outcome of our investment in NASA, the space program, and \nthe international space station; but we must continue to push forward \nin our pursuit of knowledge. Generations to come will benefit from the \nknowledge and experience gained from the investment we have made, and \ncontinued exploration of space will present many more opportunities to \nlearn.\n  First, the space program will provide significant contributions not \nonly to Americans, but people all around the world. We have already \nseen results of space-related research in life sciences, and the \npotential for expansion and development is virtually limitless. The \ndiscovery of possible life on Mars is a very exciting development for \nall mankind, and highlights the possibilities that exist if we continue \nto encourage and support our curiosities about the universe.\n  Second, our Nation's leadership role in high technology research and \ndevelopment must be maintained and enhanced. The aerospace industry is \na significant area of America's international competitiveness. Support \nof our space program is essential to our future position as the world \nleader in high technology aerospace sciences.\n  Third, projects such as the international space station help to \ncontinue and expand the cooperation among the nation's of the world. \nOur collaborative efforts with the Europeans, Japanese, and Russians \nonly serve to increase stability and strengthen our relations. Our \nspace program enables us to exchange exciting ideas with the world \ncommunity, and accelerate the pace of our own technology and space \nexploration.\n  Mr. President, I believe that these are very compelling reasons for \ncontinued support of our space program. NASA deserves our support. \nCongress and the administration should provide the appropriate \nresources needed for NASA to effectively and efficiently manage the \nspace program. We must invest in our future, and invest in ourselves.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the efforts of the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Bond, and the ranking minority member, Senator \nMikulski, in bringing H.R. 3666, the fiscal year 1997 VA/HUD and \nIndependent Agencies Appropriation Bill to the Senate expeditiously. \nThey have done their best to craft a balanced bill within the \ndiscretionary funding allocation they were given. While the VA/HUD \nSubcommittee received an allocation that is $100 million in budget \nauthority above the House allocation, the discretionary allocation for \nthis subcommittee is nevertheless $3 billion below the President's \nrequest. Having to work within that very constrained level of funding, \nChairman Bond and Senator Mikulski have done a remarkable job in \nfunding the many important departments and agencies under the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction; from the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nNASA to HUD, to NSF, to FEMA, to EPA, and a number of other Federal \nagencies.\n  I also commend the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee \nfor their attempts to keep this bill free of the controversial riders \nand significant new legislative language that made this such a \ndifficult bill during the fiscal year 1996 process.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I express my gratitude to the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Bond, for his support of a very important \namendment, which I co-sponsored. This initiative provides for a one-\nyear extension of the authorization of the Federal Flood Insurance \nProgram, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration. It will prevent disruption in the Federal Flood \nInsurance Program--which provides affordable insurance to residents of \nhigh-risk areas--ensuring that FEMA can enter into new flood insurance \ncontracts and can renew existing contracts throughout the next year. \nFor states\n\n[[Page S9941]]\n\nlike West Virginia, where the topography makes a great many communities \nvulnerable to flooding, but the high price of private flood insurance \noften places it out of reach of families, residents rely on the Federal \nFlood Insurance Program. Again, I thank the chairman for his attention \nto this important program.\n  Finally, the staff of the subcommittee--Sally Chadbourne and Liz \nBlevins for the minority, and Stephen Kohashi, Carrie Apostolou, and \nLaShawnda Leftwich for the majority--are to be commended for their \nexcellent work over the past weeks and months on this very important \nbill.\n\n\n                        Environmental Protection\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to reflect on the provisions \nof this bill that fund the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] and \nthe Council on Environmental Quality [CEQ] for fiscal year 1997.\n  With regard to the EPA, this bill is a vast improvement over the 1996 \nbill reported by the Appropriations Committee last year. It is welcome, \nindeed, that this bill reached the Senate floor without the \nantienvironmental legislative riders which plagued the 1996 Senate \nbill. These riders--which the Washington Post dubbed the ``riders from \nhell'' included legislative provisions which would have prohibited the \nEPA from implementing provisions in key environmental statutes such as \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act and would have \neliminated EPA's role in issuing permits to fill wetlands.\n  In addition, compared to the severe budget cuts made to the EPA's \nbudget request for fiscal year 1996, this appropriations bill certainly \nis preferable; it is just 6 percent below the President's requested \nlevel. Nonetheless, 6 percent of the EPA budget is over $425 million--\nwith a disproportionate percentage coming from the EPA operating budget \nwhich includes management and oversight for standards-setting and \nenforcement. We must realize that such a reduction does not come \nwithout a significant loss of capability for the environmental \nprotection efforts of this vital agency.\n  I fully support the President's funding request for the EPA--which \nincludes his request to provide $100 million for the Boston Harbor \ncleanup project. In addition, I am disappointed that the committee cut \nby 86 percent from the President's request and 76 percent from last \nyear's level funding for the Environmental Technology Initiative and \nmade deep cuts in EPA's climate change program. I greatly regret this \nbill does not contain the President's levels of support and that there \nare sufficient Republican votes to prevent passage of amendments that \nwould raise the bill's appropriations levels for these items.\n  As the House and Senate begin meeting in conference to work out their \ndifferences on the VA-HUD bill, I will continue working with the \nPresident, the subcommittee chairman and ranking member, and other \nconferees to secure funding for the Boston Harbor project.\n  While I wish to convey my concerns about the extremely serious \nsituation facing the residents of Boston in undertaking the \nmultibillion dollar Boston Harbor project, I want to emphasize that \nthis project merits national attention as do other projects in cities \nthat face requirements for similar water infrastructure improvements to \ncomply with federal mandates.\n  Mr. President, the Boston Harbor project is a massive \nundertaking which will provide water and sewer services to over 2.5 \nmillion people in 61 communities with a total cost, including the \ncombined sewer overflow (CSO) and capital cost improvements, of over $5 \nbillion. The sewage treatment plant is being built under a Federal \ncourt-ordered schedule that requires completion by 1999.\n\n  When the Clean Water Act was originally enacted, Congress \nacknowledged the great importance of the Federal role in cleaning the \nwater we drink and use for so many other purposes. It did so by \nproviding Federal support of 50 to 90 percent of the funding for \nprojects on the scale of the Boston Harbor project. The goals of the \nFederal Clean Water Act are laudable and the environmental benefits to \nBoston Harbor from the initial water infrastructure improvements are \nalready being felt in the surrounding Bay area. However, while the \ngoals and standards of the Clean Water Act have remained and should \ncontinue to remain intact, over the past 15 years we have seen the \nFederal assistance for large water infrastructure projects decline. \nOnly approximately 20 percent of the Boston secondary sewerage \ntreatment project costs have been paid by the Federal Government, and \nthat is not even counting the costs of the combined sewer overflow and \nother improvements that will be required in the future.\n  Let me also say that the Harbor cleanup is not a partisan issue. The \nClinton administration each year has included $100 million in its \nbudget request, as did the Bush administration before it. I hope the \nCongress will take this same bipartisan approach and will appropriate \n$100 million for the project.\n  I also would like to comment on the importance of funding the Council \non Environmental Quality. There are those in the Senate who do not \nrealize the great value of CEQ to the American people.\n  Since its inception in 1971, CEQ has played the key role of arbiter \nof environmental policy conflicts among Federal agencies. Most \nrecently, CEQ coordinated the administration's support for and \ncontributed to the passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act \nreauthorization legislation and the Food Safety bill.\n  The President and his administration advocate sustainable \nenvironmental policies that enhance economic growth. The Vice \nPresident, as charged by the President, has led an effort under the \nNational Performance Review to streamline regulations, remove redtape, \nand reward efficiency, compliance, and innovation by industry. With a \nvery limited budget, CEQ has been and remains a cost-effective and \nresourceful contributor in these endeavors.\n  The Henry M. Jackson Foundation's 1995 report states that the ``* * * \nCEQ has never been more needed. The easy environmental problems are \nresolved. Now the more difficult business begins of seeing to it that \ngovernmental efforts produce results in an economically efficient \nmanner and not just greater bureaucracy, waste and frustration.''\n  CEQ provides an invaluable public service and the limited Federal \nresources dedicated to its functions are well spent. I compliment the \ncommittee on providing adequate funding for these activities.\n  After the dark nights of 1995 and early 1996, we have emerged to find \ngreater reasonableness in the environmental funding and policy actions \nof the Republican congressional majority. Despite the significant \ndifferences that still exist between our views of the level of \nenvironmental protection activities the Federal Government should \nundertake, we are close enough to compromise.\n  I compliment and thank the chairman and ranking member and their \nstaffs for their diligent efforts to bring this bill before the Senate, \nand urge that they push as hard as possible for the highest achievable \nlevel of funding for environmental programs during the conference \ncommittee with the House.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with \nlanguage that appears in the committee report on the fiscal year 1997 \nVA-HUD appropriations bill.\n  Last year, when we debated the fiscal year 1996 version of this \nlegislation, I and the junior Senator from Illinois Senator Moseley-\nBraun, offered an amendment to strike a provision in that bill that \nwould have effectively barred HUD from investigating complaints of \ndiscrimination in the sale of property insurance.\n  Mr. President, this issue, commonly known as insurance redlining, is \nnothing new. Redlining derives its name from the practice of literally \ndrawing red lines around certain minority and low-income neighborhoods \nand treating the residents of those neighborhoods differently. In the \ncase of insurance redlining, agents refuse to sell homeowners policies \nin these neighborhoods, or if they do sell policies, they are policies \nthat provide significantly less coverage than a policy that might be \nsold for a similar house in a more upscale neighborhood.\n  The ramifications of reducing access to affordable and adequate \nhomeowners' insurance have proven severe\n\n[[Page S9942]]\n\nfor urban areas with large minority communities. As we all know, \nwithout property insurance an individual cannot obtain a home loan. And \nwithout a home loan, an individual cannot obtain a home. Thus, refusing \nto provide property insurance to an individual because he or she lives \nin a predominantly minority community is a clear violation of the civil \nrights protections of the Fair Housing Act.\n  My interest in this issue grew out of widely-reported redlining \nabuses in the city of Milwaukee, WI, where it was well documented that \ninsurance redlining was occurring on a widespread basis. I was deeply \nconcerned that this sort of documented discrimination was occurring not \nonly in my home State, but apparently in many others as well, including \nIllinois, Missouri, and Ohio.\n  Early in 1995, as well as in the 103d Congress, I introduced \nlegislation that would have required insurance companies in our \nNation's largest urban areas to collect and report certain information \nabout their underwriting practices to the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development. This information, including the number and type of \npolicies written, where such policies are written, and certain loss \nclaims data, would have then been made available to State regulators, \ncivil rights organizations, and other groups interested in combating \nproperty insurance discrimination.\n  Mr. President, it is important not to forget who these redlining \nvictims are--they are hard-working Americans, who have played by the \nrules and are trying to simply buy a home. They are trying to bring a \nsense of stability and vitality to their families and their \ncommunities.\n  Unfortunately, as happened in Milwaukee, they often run into a brick \nwall of ignorance and injustice. The pattern of discrimination in \nMilwaukee led seven Milwaukee residents to join with the NAACP and file \nsuit against the American Family Insurance Co. An unprecedented and \nhistoric out-of-court settlement was reached in this case between the \nparties where the insurance company agreed to spend $14.5 million \ncompensating these and other Milwaukee homeowners who had been \ndiscriminated against, as well as for special housing programs in the \ncity of Milwaukee.\n  But for those of my colleagues who might think such discrimination in \nthe insurance market is limited to Milwaukee, WI, I assure you that is \nnot the case. Extensive studies conducted by consumer and civil rights \norganizations, as well as a recent study conducted by the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners, have found insurance redlining \nto be a widespread phenomenon, national in scope. Strong evidence of \nproperty insurance discrimination has been reported in cities across \nthe country, including St. Louis, Chicago, New Orleans, Kansas City, \nDetroit, Dallas, and many others.\n  Mr. President, there is ample reason to believe that insurance \nredlining does occur, it occurs all across this country, and we should \nbe taking steps to enhance the government's ability to combat this form \nof discrimination.\n  Unfortunately, we're not taking those steps forward. And last year, \nthe Appropriations Committee, which to my knowledge had not held a \nsingle hearing on this issue, sought to prohibit HUD from expending \nfunds on the adjudication of property insurance discrimination \ncomplaints.\n  The provisions in that bill were a direct attempt to stop HUD from \ninvestigating complaints of discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. \nHUD would have been barred from spending any money investigating any \ncomplaints of insurance redlining. They would not have been allowed to \ninvestigate the over 10,000 property insurance complaints that are \nfiled with HUD each year.\n  Thankfully, when it became clear that there was a bipartisan majority \nin favor of protecting our civil rights laws, our amendment was agreed \nto and the language was stricken from the bill.\n  Although this year's VA-HUD bill does not include this language \nrestricting HUD's enforcement of our fair housing laws, the committee \nreport does include some language that I believe is rife with \ninaccuracies and mischaracterizations.\n  The report language claims that the Fair Housing Act does not say one \nword about property insurance. The language states that ``neither it \n[the FHA] nor its legislative history suggests that Congress intended \nit to apply to the provision of property insurance''. It is true the \noriginal Fair Housing Act does not address property insurance. But as a \nresult of the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988--signed into law by \nPresident Reagan--HUD promulgated regulations that specifically placed \nproperty insurance under the umbrella of the Fair Housing Act. These \nregulations were promulgated by the Bush administration.\n\n  Let me repeat that: If anyone is under the impression that HUD's \ninvolvement in combating property insurance discrimination is a Clinton \nadministration initiative, that is categorically wrong. The regulations \nwere the result of a law that passed Congress with strong bipartisan \nsupport and was signed into law by President Reagan. The regulations \nwere promulgated by the Bush administration.\n  So let's set aside the faulty assertion that HUD's role in enforcing \nthe Fair Housing Act as it applies to property insurance is some new \neffort to expand the Federal Government regulatory powers over a \nparticular industry.\n  The supporters of this new language also say that regulating the \ninsurance industry is the sole domain of the States as mandated under \nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act. This, Mr. President, is a diversionary \ntactic. This is not an issue of regulating the insurance industry. The \nStates are the regulators of the insurance industry. This is an \nargument about whether the Federal Government has the ability to \nenforce the civil rights of those who have been discriminated against \nwhen they are attempting to purchase a home.\n  This argument also fails to recognize that virtually every Federal \ncourt that has ruled on this issue, including the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals in Nationwide Insurance Co. versus Cisneros, and the Seventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals in NAACP versus American Family Insurance, \nhave held that the Fair Housing Act applies to property insurance and \nthat HUD was legally authorized to enforce the FHA as it relates to \nhomeowners insurance. Moreover, the Supreme Court has specifically \nrefused to review these cases.\n  There is clearly another attempt to undermine HUD's efforts to do its \njob. Over the last several years, time and time again, HUD has \nuncovered incidents and patterns of discrimination in the sale and \navailability of homeowners insurance. And that is precisely why we are \ndebating this issue today. It is because HUD has been too effective in \nenforcing our civil rights laws.\n  Look at last year's settlement between American Family Insurance Co. \nand the people of Milwaukee. And just weeks ago, it was announced that \nState Farm Insurance Co., long under investigation by HUD for property \ninsurance discrimination, had agreed to completely restructure their \nunderwriting procedures, add new sales and service centers in urban \ncommunities, and invest over $1 million in first-mortgage financing in \nurban Toledo, OH.\n  As I have said repeatedly in the past, I do not mean in any way to \nthrow a blanket indictment at the insurance industry. I know many \nindividuals in my home State who work in the insurance industry, and it \nis my firm belief that the vast majority of those individuals are \ndecent, hard-working Americans who would join with myself and others in \ncondemning this sort of bigotry and discrimination. Unfortunately, it \nis evident that these sort of abuses do occur, and the Federal \nGovernment must do all it can to aggressively enforce the Fair Housing \nAct.\n  As was demonstrated last year and in years past, this is not an \ninherently partisan issue. This Congress has in fact, demonstrated time \nand time again that it will stand up to mindless bigotry and \ndiscrimination in whatever form it might take. The language contained \nin the committee report represents a threat to a longstanding \nbipartisan commitment to protecting and enforcing civil rights in this \ncountry and battling the various forms of bigotry and discrimination \nthat continue to pervade this Nation. The committee report language, \nobviously, does not have the force of law and it should be disregarded.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the VA-HUD bill currently under\n\n[[Page S9943]]\n\nconsideration contains report language stating that HUD's property \ninsurance practices duplicate State regulation of insurance and that \nHUD's activities in this area create an unwarranted and unnecessary \nlayer of Federal bureaucracy. Mr. President, now is not the time to \nretreat from our commitment to fair housing opportunities for all. \nCongress made its decision on this issue last year when I offered an \namendment which was adopted to ensure that the Government would remain \nable to combat discrimination in the issuance of property insurance.\n  In 1988, Congress gave HUD the authority to promulgate regulations to \nenforce the Fair Housing Act. At that time, HUD, under then-President \nGeorge Bush and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, issued a regulation which \ndefined conduct prohibited under the Fair Housing Act to include: \n``refusing to provide property or hazard insurance for dwellings, or \nproviding such insurance differently, because of race, color, religion, \nsex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.''\n  The reason for this prohibition is simple. Without property \ninsurance, no lender will provide a mortgage. Without a mortgage, few \nindividuals can buy a house. Denial of property or hazard insurance \nimpairs the ability of an individual to buy their own home, in a very \nreal and concrete way.\n  Mr. President, discrimination in the issuance of property insurance \nis not a minor problem. Recent investigations conducted in 9 different \ncities found that discrimination against African-Americans and Latino \nneighborhoods occurred more than 50 percent of the time. In my hometown \nof Chicago, discrimination occurred 83 percent of the time. \nInvestigators found that minority homeowners were routinely charged \nmore money for less coverage, were not offered the best insurance \npolicies, and were even denied any coverage at all.\n  Consider a case that the Department of Justice settled last year \nagainst a major insurance company for its conduct in Milwaukee, WI. The \nDepartment alleged that the company routinely sold more costly, less \ncomprehensive policies to minorities, failed to return phone calls or \nkeep appointments with black customers, avoided entire neighborhoods \nwith high minority populations, and subjected applications from black \nneighborhoods to greater scrutiny. One potential black customer was \ntold that ``you people make phony claims,'' and a white manager was \ninstructed in writing to quit writing all those blacks.\n  Despite opponents arguments to the contrary, HUD's enforcement of the \nFair Housing Act does not involve regulation. Regulation of rates, or \nother aspects of the insurance business, is a State responsibility. \nWhat HUD is obligated to do, and what it has done, is enforce civil \nrights laws that prohibit discrimination. No one has offered any valid \nexplanation to show why this one particular industry should be exempted \nfrom antidiscrimination laws.\n  This fact is, Congress has consistently rejected the argument that \nthe Federal Government should leave the enforcement of civil rights to \nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the States. The Federal Government has a \nvery real interest in ensuring that effective remedies for acts of \ndiscrimination are available to all people. While States do have laws \nprohibiting discrimination in insurance, the Fair Housing Act provides \na wider array of remedies, including a private right of action, than \nthose provided by most States.\n\n  There is more uniting America, than dividing us. We share a common \ndream--the American dream. We all want to raise our children in safe \ncommunities, and provide a home for our families. It's because of the \nAmerican dream that we have to keep raising these issues.\n  Housing discrimination and segregation undermine the health and \nvitality of American communities--our cities, suburbs and rural towns. \nIt denies families full and free choice about where to live, send their \nkids to school, and where to work.\n  As a Chicago Tribune editorial said,\n\n       We all pay a price for racial discrimination. Those who are \n     discriminated against pay the most. But those who do the \n     discriminating, or condone it, eventually reap what they sow \n     in higher taxes and lowered economic horizons. Experience \n     teaches that the cost of racial segregation reaches beyond \n     the inner city. We all pay the price for the poverty, \n     joblessness, and crime that fester there. In one respect, \n     wealthier taxpayers pay the most.\n  The American people believe in fairness. They certainly don't believe \nin a special-interest exemption to the civil rights laws. Yet that is \nexactly what we are approaching if Congress condones report language \nindicating a concern about HUD's use of funds for other fair housing \nactivities aimed at property insurance practices.\n  Federal efforts to combat discrimination are vital. Congress would be \nsetting a bad example if it retreats from its commitment to fairness \nand non-discrimination in fair housing laws. Continued enforcement of \nthe Fair Housing Act is key.\n\n\n                        mission to planet earth\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to ask if the distinguished \nchairman of the appropriations subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent \nAgencies, Senator Bond, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nMikulski, would yield to a question regarding funding for NASA's \nMission to Planet Earth Program.\n  Mr. BOND. We would be happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I first want to thank the chairman and the \nranking member for their work to restore cuts in the House bill to the \nMission to Planet Earth, the civilian scientific mission to study the \nenvironment of this third planet from the Sun. The Senate bill provides \n$100 million more for NASA than provided in the House bill and restores \nthis critical program for studying global climate change. As the Senate \ncommittee report points out, this program also encompasses disaster \nprediction and mitigation. This element is very important to my State \nof California.\n  Technological growth and the experience of repeated earthquakes in \nCalifornia have helped expand our ability to provide important data for \ndetailed mapping of earthquake faults. The California Seismic Safety \nCommission has recommended a research and technology initiative whereby \nspace technology may be used to reduce the risk from major California \nearthquakes. NASA has the unique ability to provide orbital \nphotography, remote sensing data such as radar, and advanced optics and \nradio wave technology under the Mission to Planet Earth to assist \nCalifornia's earthquake risk reduction efforts. I understand that \nMissouri's Office of Emergency Services is interested in this effort, \nas well.\n  Accelerating California's seismic hazards identification programs \nwould go a long way toward providing earth sciences information in a \nform that is useful to builders and local government planners so that \nwe can genuinely manage seismic risk and reduce economic damage and \nhuman casualties from these natural disasters.\n  I ask the chairman and ranking member if it is their understanding \nthat a portion of the funds provided to the Mission to Planet Earth \ncould be made available for a cooperative program between the Johnson \nSpace Center and the California Seismic Safety Commission and other \nseismically active States, and if such a program would be consistent \nwith the goals of the Mission to Planet Earth?\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from California. The committee \nencourages NASA to collaborate with other Federal agencies and private \nindustry to pursue opportunities for public-private partnerships to \napply Mission to Planet Earth data for environmental, agricultural, \ntransportation, fisheries and forestry management, as well as disaster \nprediction and management. I believe a cooperative program between \nNASA's Johnson Space Center and the State of California and other \nseismically active States, such as my own State of Missouri, would be \nan excellent example of this committee's intent.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The cooperative venture that the Senator from \nCalifornia has described is clearly the kind of information that we \nintend the Mission to Planet Earth to provide for our local officials \nto make real use of this invaluable data from space. We should support \nhazard reduction programs whenever we can in order to hold down cost of \ndisaster in lives and property in the future.\n\n\n     THE TRANSFER OF SPACE STATION RELATED BIOTECHNICAL ACTIVITIES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am concerned about a number of \nhighly qualified persons who work at NASA's\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\nAmes Research Center in California. It is my understanding that NASA is \nconsidering a layoff of these highly trained individuals and sending \nthe technologies for the space station program on which they are \nworking--the Centrifuge Facility--to the Japanese space agency NASDA. \nThe Centrifuge Facility, and its related programs, have always been a \npart of the United States' contribution to the International Space \nStation. I simply do not understand why NASA would consider giving this \nwork to the Japanese when they have significantly less experience in \nthe life sciences area.\n  I say to the Chairman that we are both strong supporters of the \nInternational Space Station Program and want to see it become the \npremier microgravity research center of the world. This can only be \naccomplished if the best talent is focused on every sector of the \nprogram. To assign these biotechnology activities to anyone other than \nthe individuals at the Ames Research Center--many of whom invented \nthese technologies in the first place--makes little sense. Can he \nassure me that Ames Research Center will remain the center for these \ncritical space station related biotechnical activities?\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the senior Senator from California raising the \nvery important issue of the development of research capabilities and \ninstruments for use on the space station. As the Senator indicates, the \nspace station program will draw upon a wide variety of disciplines and \ntechnical capabilities of NASA, as well as other research institutions \nhere in the United States and those of our international partners. With \nsuch a widely distributed effort, involving so many different parties, \nit is critical that we demand of NASA a rigorous system of utilizing \nthe most capable entities available to as to yield the highest quality \nresearch for our significant investment in this program.\n  The Senator is justifiably proud of the biotechnology capabilities of \nAmes Research Center, and I certainly agree that shifts in \nresponsibility for important research tasks be very sensitive to issues \nof technical merit and capacity. I am aware that NASA has under \nconsideration a shift in responsibility for the centrifuge facility \nwhich is a matter of significant concern to me. The Congress has long \nsupported retention of the centrifuge in the face of repeated past \nproposals to eliminate this important facility. The centrifuge is \ncrucial to life science studies since it provides a control for \nexperiments in the microgravity environment of the space station.\n  Unfortunately, as the Senator from California knows, NASA has \nrequested authority to shift funding for the current fiscal year, and \nfor the next 2 years, within the $2.1 billion annual cap. The cost of \nfabricating components of the overall spacecraft such as the nodes are \nrequiring greater investment at this point in the development program \nto maintain deployment schedule goals. These funding shifts from space \nstation research hardware development, to spacecraft development, \nrequire rescheduling and optimization of space station research program \nplans in order to avoid cost overruns and minimize adverse program \nimpacts.\n  We are evaluating these requirements and will be proposing changes in \nconference to the NASA appropriations accounts to enable the agency to \nmake the most effective use of available funding. We extensively will \nexamine the agency proposals to make sure that such authorities will \nretain critical research capabilities within a workable overall \ndevelopment schedule. I want to assure her that we will all participate \nin evaluating the merits of the agency's proposals, and I certainly \nexpect NASA to consult fully with all affected parties prior to making \nsignificant program changes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree with the Senator from California that this \nbiotechnology capability should remain within the United States. We \nhave the experience that Japan cannot match in this arena and should \nnot relinquish that capability.\n\n\n                FUNDING FOR OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING RELIEF\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. It has now been more than a year since the tragic and \nsenseless bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. Last year, \nthis Congress, with the support of the administration, approved $39 \nmillion in disaster relief specifically for the recovery of Oklahoma \nCity. This funding was for community development assistance to repair \npublic and private facilities damaged by the blast. For that I, along \nwith the people of Oklahoma, am grateful.\n  In the aftermath of this disaster, a full evaluation of its impact on \ndowntown Oklahoma City indicates that if the area is to adequately \nrecover, additional Federal assistance is needed. To this end, I asked \nthe Appropriations Committee in May to consider supplementing last \nyear's funding to cover additional damage claims plus loan and grant \nfunds to assist businesses as they re-enter the damaged area. The \nadministration, while not officially requesting these funds, has \nindicated its support for the additional funding during recent \ndiscussions with Oklahoma City officials.\n  The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has worked with me in \ntrying to accommodate this request. Can he assure me that he will \ncontinue this cooperative effort to meet these ongoing needs arising \nfrom the bombing?\n  Mr. BOND. I can assure my friend and colleague from Oklahoma that the \ncommittee will continue to work with him and the people of Oklahoma in \nrecovering from this terrible tragedy. As the Senator has noted, the \ncommittee was pleased to provide $39 million in community development \nfunds last year to aid in the restoration of downtown Oklahoma City. In \naddition, the emergency supplemental appropriation last year provided \n$40.4 million for the replacement of the Murrah Federal Building. \nAdditional funds have also been made available administratively through \nseveral government agencies, particularly the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency.\n  Also, as can certainly be understood, only a portion of the $39 \nmillion appropriation from last year has been obligated by the city. It \ntakes time to assess the vast damage that occurred and award the \ncontracts for repair. Further, compliance with Federal regulations, \nsuch as prevailing wage statutes, adds to the complexity of awarding \ncontracts. Therefore, it takes time to fully obligate these funds.\n  Once these funds are fully expended, I assure the Senator from \nOklahoma that I will reassess the remaining assistance needs for the \ncity. I also understand that commitments have been made by the \nadministration to Oklahoma City officials to furnish currently \nappropriated funds for the relief effort. FEMA has indicated that $2 \nmillion will be made available from its public assistance program for \ninfrastructure repair. Further, the administration has agreed to make \navailable $2.1 million for the purchase of land for a Federal campus \nfor housing several Federal agencies. Both of these items were to be \npaid for by the emergency appropriation. This will enable the city to \nrepay additional damage claims from this emergency supplemental.\n  Let me state to the Senator, however, that no budget request from the \nadministration has been received for additional funds. Such a request \nwould show what offsets, if any, the administration intended to utilize \nto pay for these added funds. It would also indicate whether or not \nthis was an emergency designation, or if it intended to use \nreprogrammed funds from existing appropriations.\n  I commend the Senator for his ongoing commitment to ensure that \nOklahoma City, and indeed the entire State of Oklahoma, recovers from \nthis terrible tragedy. I fully intend to work with the Senator, the \nadministration, and the city of Oklahoma City to meet any need for \nfurther assistance.\n\n\n              hud's authority regarding property insurance\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, when the Senate considered the fiscal \nyear 1996 VA-HUD appropriations bill last year, I was a proud cosponsor \nof the Feingold/Moseley-Braun amendment, which deleted language which \nwould have restricted the use of HUD funds in the investigation of \ndiscrimination in homeowner's insurance. This year, in the Senate \ncommittee report of the fiscal year 1997 VA-HUD appropriations bill, \nthere is once again language recommending that HUD be prohibited from \nenforcing protections against property insurance redlining. In fact the \ncommittee report calls\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\nHUD's activities related to property insurance ``duplicative of state \nregulation of insurance . . . creat(ing) an unwarranted and unnecessary \nlayer of federal bureaucracy.''\n  I want to make it very clear, as I did last year, that I believe the \nU.S. Senate should not set the precedent of exempting property \ninsurance from fair housing laws. If HUD is not able to investigate \nclaims of property insurance redlining, Americans might be kept from \nbuying houses because they might not be able to get homeowner's \ninsurance. I believe that all Americans have the right to homeowner's \ninsurance, regardless of race or ethnicity or the neighborhood in which \nthey live.\n  Mr. President, once again, I will remind you that we have been \nthrough this before. The insurance industry claims that this type of \ndenial of coverage is not taking place, but HUD reports that it \ncontinues to process and settle thousands of claims of property \ninsurance redlining. Unfortunately, the shameful practice of denying \ncoverage to Americans because of the neighborhood they live in or the \ncolor of their skin is still practiced today.\n  If HUD is barred from funding private fair housing groups \ninvestigating claims of property insurance redlining, Americans will be \ndenied the protection of a basic civil rights law. I do not think that \ninsurance companies should be exempt from property provisions in the \nFair Housing Act. HUD's enforcement of civil rights protections does \nnot undermine State insurance regulation, rather, Federal fair housing \nprotections ensure that homeowners or potential homeowners do not \nencounter discriminatory practices in their effort to obtain \nhomeowner's insurance. In this campaign season, many have voiced their \ndesire to help all Americans get their piece of the American dream. Mr. \nPresident, this is a perfect place for us to protect Americans who are \ntrying to purchase a home from discrimination.\n\n\n                           travis va hospital\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \ndisappointment that funding for the Travis VA Hospital was not included \nin the VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1997. There are currently 450,000 veterans in northern California \nwho have no local veterans hospital.\n  Let me briefly describe the continuing situation for these veterans \nseeking inpatient health services. A veteran in northern California \nmust drive an average of 4 to 5 hours, sometimes as many as 8 hours, to \nget to a VA inpatient facility. Once the veteran is released from the \nhospital, he and his family must drive back and forth from home to the \nVA facility again for checkups.\n  These hardships are having a detrimental effect on the care these \nveterans receive. The Department of Veterans Affairs own numbers show \nthat the use of inpatient care in northern California has declined from \n7,000 cases in fiscal year 1991 to 2,538 in fiscal year 1995. That is a \ndecrease of 64 percent. With the aging population of these veterans, it \nis hard to believe that they do not need the health care that the \nTravis VA Hospital would provide.\n  The Clinton administration has seen the needs of these veterans and \nresponded. The President's fiscal year 1997 budget request included \n$32.1 million for phase II construction at the hospital. Phase II \nallocation funds utility relocation, site development, and foundation \nand structural construction. The House of Representatives also acted to \nmeet the needs of these veterans by funding President Clinton's request \nfor phase II funds and by reprogramming the $25 million appropriated \nlast year for an outpatient care facility so that they could also be \nused to build the hospital.\n  As bad as the situation has been, these veterans have been \nexceedingly patient. At the groundbreaking ceremony on June 2, 1994, \nattended by Vice President Gore, we all were optimistic that northern \nCalifornia's veterans would not have much longer to wait for quality \nhealth care. More than 2 years later, the plans are complete and the \nland is ready to begin construction of the replacement hospital. \nInstead, that land will remain empty, and nearly a half a million \nveterans will continue to be unserved.\n  The area that the Travis VA Hospital would serve is one of the \nlargest, most geographically dispersed, and highly populated veterans' \nareas in the country. In fact, more veterans live in northern \nCalifornia than in 27 individual States and the District of Columbia.\n  I am very disappointed that the members of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee deleted the funding the House included for the Travis VA \nHospital and turned their backs on nearly a half a million veterans by \nnot continuing to fund the replacement VA hospital at Travis Air Force \nBase.\n  It is a sad day when the men and women who have served our country \nwithout question--and who have the right to expect their Government to \nfulfill its promises--are now being told ``tough luck.''\n  I appeal to my colleagues to honor the commitment we as a nation have \nmade to our veterans when this bill is considered in conference. I \npledge to continue my fight for northern California's veterans and for \nfull funding for the Travis VA Hospital.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing concern \nabout language in the Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 3666, the \nVA, HUD, and independent agencies bill, which raises concerns about \n``HUD's use of funds for * * * fair housing activities aimed at \nproperty insurance practices.'' The report concludes that HUD's \nactivities duplicate State regulation of insurance and violate the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act by ``interfer[ing] with State regulation of \ninsurance.'' I disagree with this view of the nature and effect of \nHUD's antidiscrimination activities regarding property insurance.\n  Republican and Democratic administrations have recognized that \nwithout non-discriminatory access to property insurance, many hard-\nworking Americans will be denied the opportunity to own a home. The \nBush administration's regulations implementing the 1988 Fair Housing \nAct Amendments explicitly applied the act to discrimination in access \nto property insurance. This interpretation has been upheld by U.S. \ndistrict and circuit courts which have ruled that HUD's enforcement \nactivities in this area do not constitute a regulation of insurance and \ndo not conflict with the McCarran-Ferguson Act because they do not \n``invalidate, impair or supersede'' any state laws regulating the \nbusiness of insurance.\n  It is my expectation that nothing in H.R. 3666 or the accompanying \nreport will be interpreted to diminish HUD's enforcement authority \nunder the Fair Housing Act with regard to discriminatory property \ninsurance practice.\n\n\n                      insurance redlining language\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am heartened that, in the context of \nthe VA-HUD appropriations bill, certain Republicans have not attempted \nto repeat the mistake of last year, when there was an ill-advised \neffort to insert a provision that would have prohibited the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development from enforcing the Fair Housing Act as \nit relates to property insurance. This provision, if enacted, would \nhave prevented millions of Americans from pursuing the American dream \nof home ownership by prohibiting HUD from enforcing the Fair Housing \nAct as it relates to property insurance.\n  This effort to roll back civil rights protections in the name of \nregulatory and insurance reform was defeated by a voice vote, under the \nleadership of Senators Feingold, Simon, Moseley-Braun, and Mikulski. \nFortunately Republicans did not attempt to include this provision in \nthe 1997 VA-HUD appropriations bill. However, there is language in the \ncommittee report pertaining to insurance redlining which incorrectly \nasserts that: First, HUD lacks the authority under the Fair Housing Act \nto investigate insurance redlining cases; and second, insurance \nredlining is not covered by the Fair Housing Act.\n  These claims are simply wrong, Since passage of the Fair Housing Act \namendments in 1988, courts have consistently held that the Fair Housing \nAct prohibits racial discrimination in the provision of property \ninsurance. Nationwide Mut. Insurance Co. v. Cisneros, 52 F.3d 1351 (6th \nCir. 1995); United Farm Bureau Mut. v. Human Relation Comm'n, 24 F.3d \n1008 (7th Cir. 1994); NAACP v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 978 F.2d \n287 (7th Cir. 1992); Strange v. National Mutual Insurance Co., 867 F. \nSupp. 1209 (E.D. Pa. 1994).\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\nThese consistent court interpretations of the Fair Housing Act make \nperfect sense. If a person does not have access to homeowners \ninsurance, buying a home would be impossible. As Judge Easterbrook, a \nconservative Seventh Circuit judge, observed in NAACP v. American \nFamily Mutual Insurance Co., ``lenders require their borrowers to \nsecure property insurance. No insurance, no loan; no loan, no house; \nlack of insurance thus makes housing unavailable [within the meaning of \nthe Fair Housing Act].'' 978 F.2d at 297. Overall, the case law is \nclear that the Fair Housing Act covers property insurance \ndiscrimination. Any assertion to the contrary is simply incorrect.\n  In the Committee Report, there is a claim that the McCarran-Ferguson \nAct prevents the enforcement of property insurance discrimination under \nthe Fair Housing Act. This claim also ignores the case law, in which \ncourts have consistently stated that the Fair Housing Act is not \npreempted by McCarran-Ferguson. See American Family, 978 F.2d at 293-\n97; Cisneros, 52 F.3d at 1363; United Farm Bureau, 24 F.3d at 1016. \nThus, it is incorrect to suggest that HUD's assertion of authority in \ninsurance redlining cases ``contradicts'' the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n  The Fair Housing Act was intended to break down barriers of \ndiscrimination that unfairly prevented scores of Americans from \nsecuring decent and affordable housing. This discrimination comes in \nmany forms. Insurance redlining is one such manifestation, and is a \npersistent problem throughout America. For example, in a recent case in \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, a $14.5 million settlement was reached on behalf \nof a class of hundreds of African-American homeowners. A manager at the \ninsurance company wrote to an agent who expressed a willingness to give \ninsurance to African-Americans: ``Quit writing to all those Blacks'' \n(emphasis in original). Eliminating such discrimination is an \nappropriate and vital function of HUD and the Department of Justice. \nAmerica cannot be America unless we eliminate all vestiges of \ndiscrimination, and I applaud Secretary Cisneros for his willingness to \nenforce laws banning insurance redlining.\n\n\n  Opposition to Restrictions on HUD funding to investigate insurance \n                               redlining\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to inclusion of \nlanguage in the VA-HUD fiscal year 1997 Appropriations Committee Report \nbarring the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] from \nusing Fair Housing Initiatives Program [FHIP] funds to enforce the Fair \nHousing Act against insurance redlining. The language in this report is \nintended to deny the protection of a basic civil rights law to people \nsubject to discrimination by a particular industry. Because insurance \nredlining is a reality in America, efforts to eliminate such \ndiscrimination should be aggressively undertaken. Sadly, by attempting \nto strip HUD of its enforcement authority, this funding restriction \nwill allow such discrimination to flourish.\n  In September 1995, language prohibiting HUD from investigating \ninsurance-related discrimination complaints was placed in the 1996 VA-\nHUD Appropriations bill. This language was removed before a vote on the \nSenate floor due to opposition from a number of Senators. Now, the \ncommittee seeks to accomplish through the back door what the Senate \nrefused to sanction last year.\n  Mr. President, insurance redlining is a serious problem in this \ncountry. Recently, the National Fair Housing Alliance conducted a 3-\nyear investigation--partially funded with $800,000 from a HUD grant \nawarded when Jack Kemp was HUD Secretary--using white and minority \ntesters posing as middle-class homeowners seeking property insurance \ncoverage. The test covered nine major cities and targeted Allstate, \nState Farm, and Nationwide Insurance. The homes selected were of \ncomparable value, size, age, style, construction, and were located in \nmiddle-class neighborhoods.\n  The investigation uncovered the fact that discrimination against \nAfrican American and Latino neighborhoods occurred more than 50 percent \nof the time. Astoundingly, in Chicago, Latino testers ran into problems \nin more than 95 percent of the attempts to obtain insurance; in Toledo, \nAfrican Americans experienced discrimination by State Farm 85 percent \nof the time. While white testers encountered no problems obtaining \ninsurance quotations and favorable rates, African American and Latino \ntesters encountered the following problems: Failure by insurance agents \nto return repeated phone calls; Failure to provide quote information; \nGiving pre-conditions for providing quotes (inspection of property, \ncredit rating checks); Failure to provide replacement cost coverage to \nhomes of Blacks and Latinos; and Charging more money to Blacks and \nLatinos, while providing less coverage.\n   Mr. President, the results of this investigation are profoundly \ndisturbing. Insurance redlining directly affects the ability of African \nAmericans, Asians and Hispanics to purchase a home, because the denial \nof insurance results in the denial of a mortgage loan, which in turn \nresults in the inability to purchase a home. Property insurance \ndiscrimination is illegal under the Fair Housing Act. As this country \nmoves toward its stated ideal of a colorblind society, the effort of \nthe committee to strip HUD of its enforcement authority and remove a \nwhole category of discrimination--insurance redlining--from the reach \nof the law is not supported by judicial decisions or the language of \nthe Fair Housing Act.\n   Mr. President, the report claims that HUD's assertion of authority \nregarding property insurance contradicts the McCarran-Ferguson Act of \n1945. However, Federal fair housing laws enforce civil rights \nprotections which do not threaten or regulate the business of providing \ninsurance. Thus, the report's argument that enforcement of civil rights \nprotections undermines State insurance regulation is inaccurate, and \nmore importantly, elevates a business practice over the enforcement of \nfundamental civil rights.\n  The report further claims that the Fair Housing Act does not directly \nmention homeowners insurance, and therefore does not apply to the \nprovision of homeowners insurance. However, section 3604 of the Fair \nHousing Act makes it illegal to ``discriminate against any person in \nthe terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling or \nin the provision of services * * * in connection therewith. * * *'' \nBased on the language of section 3604, Federal courts have held that \nhomeowners insurance discrimination is within the purview of the Fair \nHousing Act. Indeed, in February of this year, the Supreme Court \nrefused to entertain an appeal from a decision holding that the Fair \nHousing Act covers insurance.\n   Mr. President, under Secretary Cisneros, HUD has been an active \nparticipant in enforcing the Fair Housing Act and ensuring that \nproperty insurance discrimination ceases. The insurance industry has \nbeen fighting in court to restrict HUD's authority to enforce insurance \nredlining. The industry has not been successful in the judicial arena \nin its efforts to stop HUD's enforcement activities. Thus, the industry \nhas now turned to Congress to restrain stepped-up Federal fair lending \nenforcement efforts. This effort failed last year, and there exists no \nlegal justification for the committee to now restrict FHIP funds in the \ninvestigation of homeowners insurance redlining.\n  It is this Senator's view, and I believe that of many others, that \nthis report language does not and should not reflect the view of the \nSenate, and that HUD should not treat this language as having the force \nof law.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, let me begin by commending both the \nchairman, Senator Bond, and the ranking minority member, Senator \nMikulski, and their staffs, for their hard work on this legislation.\n  With the inadequate allocation given this subcommittee, they have had \nto make very hard choices between the competing needs for environmental \nprotection, housing, veterans, science, and NASA, not to mention the \nmany other agencies covered by this bill. It's a very, very difficult \njob.\n  Mr. President, as one with a strong interest in the environment, I am \nvery pleased that the bill funds Superfund cleanup at the President's \nlevel, and exceeds the President's level for the State revolving loan \nfunds, which are used to ensure that our water supply is clean. I also \nappreciate the chairman's support of the Agency for Toxic Substances \nand Disease Registry, which studies the health threats posed by toxic \nwaste sites and helps to prioritize Superfund cleanups.\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\n  I also am pleased that this year we will avoid the debate on anti-\nenvironmental riders that have been pushed so hard in the past by many \nHouse Republicans.\n  Mr. President, although we have made great progress on EPA funding \noverall, I do remain concerned about the inadequate funding of research \ninto sediment decontamination technology. This work is critical to \nfinding affordable and environmentally benign ways of dredging many \nharbors that are contaminated with deadly toxics sediments.\n  I also am concerned that we are continuing to add duties to EPA \nwithout the accompanying resources. This budget does not provide the \nneeded funding to implement Congress' demands for more and better risk-\nbenefit analysis, more assistance to small business, and more \nconsideration of stakeholders in the regulatory process. It does not \nprovide the needed infrastructure to enhance EPA's scientific \nabilities. It also does not provide adequate funding to counter global \nwarming, or for President Bush's initiative to improve the water \nquality of Boston Harbor.\n\n  The President's budget provided $450 million for these various \nprograms, money that is not in this bill. As the process moves forward, \nI want to work with the President to add these funds for this important \nallocations.\n  Mr. President, led by Newt Gingrich and extremist Members of the \nHouse, this Congress has seen a massive assault on our environment. \nLast year, the House passed a bill to cut EPA by one-third. They have \ntried to tie the agency up in regulatory knots and red-tape. And they \nhave invited polluters into the back rooms to weaken environmental \nstandards.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton has stood up to these extremists, \nand our environment will be much cleaner as a result.\n  However, the war over the environment is not over. Senator Dole is \nproposing a budget scheme that calls for massive cuts in domestic \nprograms. And that would mean deep reductions in environmental \nprotection. Senator Dole also has pushed hard to undermine the ability \nof EPA and other agencies to protect public health and the environment.\n  So, Mr. President, the real battle over the environment will be \nfought in this November's elections.\n  Mr. President, let me now move beyond the environment to discuss the \nprovisions in this bill that provide funding for housing, and for our \nNation's cities.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that these programs have again been \ntargeted for disproportionate budget cuts. I represent a State with \nvery severe housing needs, and several depressed urban areas. And it is \nof great concern to me that the Congress has not made these problems a \nhigher priority.\n  This bill funds HUD at $2 billion below the President's budget \nrequest and cuts spending for vital programs such as homeless \nassistance, the economic development initiative, and public housing \nmodernization.\n  These cuts will adversely affect many of our Nation's most \neconomically vulnerable families. And that troubles me. Just as I know \nit troubles many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  So, Mr. President, I am concerned about many of the cuts in this bill \nfor housing and community development. But I realize that the chairman \nand the ranking minority member have been dealt a terrible deck, and \nthey've done their best in a bad situation. During last year's \nappropriations process, after Senate passage, additional funds were \nallocated for housing and environmental programs. I will work with the \nadministration to restore these funds so that we may better address the \nsevere housing needs of our Nation.\n  I want to commend both Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for \nprotecting several other important programs from funding cuts, \nincluding the Drug Elimination Program, CDBG, and HOME, each of which \nwill continue to operate at current funding levels.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the chairman for his generous funding \nof the low-income housing preservation program. This program will help \nto maintain the stock of affordable housing and potentially protect \nthousands of families from losing their homes.\n  So, Mr. President, as a member of the VA/HUD and Independent Agencies \nSubcommittee, I will vote for this bill. It is not perfect legislation. \nBut it is a significant improvement over some of the related \nlegislation we've seen in the recent past.\n\n\n                   the neighborhood networks program\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to commend the \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Bond, and the distinguished ranking \nmember of the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee on \nAppropriations, Senator Mikulski, for their guidance and cooperative \nefforts in bringing this bill, H.R. 3666, to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a program that is \nproviding an indispensable service to Americans living in our Nation's \ntroubled urban areas, in public and assisted housing. As HUD has worked \nto increase housing and home ownership opportunities for our citizens, \nit has become increasingly clear that an important aspect of insuring \nadequate housing is insuring that people have the skills and employment \nopportunities that will allow them to contribute sufficiently to their \nown rents and mortgages. Insuring that our people have such skills and \nopportunities is not only a means of improving the lives of these \ncitizens but also helping them develop and maintain their neighborhoods \nand communities.\n  Mr. BOND. I would agree with my colleague.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The University of New Orleans has developed an \nentrepreneurship program designed not only to assist in the development \nof skills, but also to assist in the creating of individual, family, \nand small businesses in our inner cities. The two things go hand in \nhand--providing training and skills development and then seeing that \nthere is a job in which the training skills can be used. UNO has held \ndiscussions on this program with HUD and I believe that it is the type \nof activity which HUD should be supporting. Consequently, I would hope \nthat we could urge HUD to pursue this effort with UNO whether it be \nthrough the Neighborhood Networks Program or some other means.\n  Mr. BOND. I strongly support finding ways to encourage people to find \nmeans of self-support with a goal towards bettering their lives. This \nseems to me an excellent way to move people away from a state of \ndependence into one of independence and self-sufficiency. I agree with \nthe Senator from Louisiana that HUD should be supportive of such \nprograms.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree with my colleagues. These efforts are important \nas we expect a future of declining allocations. We must find ways to \nmeet the needs of Federal programs in a balanced way. Particular \nattention should be paid to effective programs that give taxpayers the \nmost bang for their hard earned buck.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I must note that our first priority for HUD \nis demand that it more adequately address its principal \nresponsibilities over loan and grant programs for housing and community \ndevelopment. We have worked to drastically cut back on the thicket of \nprograms that it amassed over the years, some 240 individual \nactivities. Though terminations and by consolidating related activities \nin more flexible, broadly-based grant programs we are reducing \nburdensome paperwork requirements both for HUD and for the local \nadministering agency. Furthermore, by granting flexibility, we hope to \nenable local units of government to better tailor programs to meet \ntheir specific local needs and priorities. With this orientation,we \nmust be restrained in our appetite for endorsing new programs or \ninitiatives or risk turning back the clock on our reforms by creating a \nwhole new set of categorical programs and requirements.\n\n\n                  montreal protocol facilitation fund\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the EPA portion of this bill includes $12 \nmillion for Agency contributions to the Montreal Protocol facilitation \nfund. This funding level is the same as that approved by the Congress \nlast year, but $7 million lower than the administration's request of \n$19 million.\n  It is my understanding that the House of Representatives approved the \nfull fiscal year 1997 administration request of $19 million for EPA's \ncontribution to this fund. This funding is included in the EPA \nenvironmental programs and management account. If I\n\n[[Page S9948]]\n\nmight, Mr. President, I would like to provide some historical \nperspective on the Montreal Protocol facilitation fund.\n  The fund was created in 1990 through the London Amendments to the \nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. It was \ncreated to assist developing countries in their efforts to phase out \nozone depleting substances. The United States agreed to participate in \nthe fund after the Senate, on December 18, 1991, voted to approve \nratification of the London Amendments. It is important to remember that \nthe Montreal Protocol and the facilitation fund were successfully \nnegotiated by the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, \nrespectively.\n  The Montreal Protocol facilitation fund was established with the \nclear understanding that the problem of ozone depletion was global in \nnature. That understanding, and the agreement which ensued, was that \nthe developed countries would provide technical and financial \nassistance to developing countries who agree to strict ozone depleting \nsubstance use reductions.\n  This is a pact, Mr. President, that the United States freely \ncommitted itself to. A pact which has enjoyed tremendous success with \nrespect to reducing the use of these chemicals around the world; with \nrespect to the promotion of American goods and services around the \nworld; and with respect to the development of a global effort to solve \na complicated environmental problem. Contributions to this multilateral \nfund, from nations like Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada, \nhave been made at a higher rate, 85 percent, than any other United \nNations trust fund.\n  How large is the facilitation fund? How much does the United States \ncontribute? The total size of the fund has been set at $510 million \nwith the U.S. share capped at 25 percent of the total, which is the \nU.N. standard. The current U.S. contribution is set at $38 million per \nyear.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that we have not met our obligations \nto the fund. At the conclusion of calendar year 1996, the United States \nwill be approximately $27 million in arrears. Even if the full \nadministration request for EPA and State Department contributions were \nto be provided for fiscal year 1997, the United States would still find \nitself behind in 1997 by approximately $18 million.\n  If the $12 million level recommended by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee is approved by the Senate and ultimately prevails in \nconference with the House, the United States would find itself $25 \nmillion in arrears. This estimate assumes that the full State \nDepartment allotment of $27.5 million will be provided in fiscal year \n1997.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to fall further and further behind on \nthis commitment. Failure by the United States to maintain this pact in \nthe agreed-upon fashion would not only harm the progress made in this \narea, but would undoubtedly make negotiation of future international \nenvironmental agreements much more difficult. As such, I would request \nof my friend from Missouri, who will be leading negotiations with the \nHouse on this matter, that he work toward conference adoption of the \nHouse-passed funding level of $19 million for the Montreal Protocol \nfacilitation fund.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks made by my \ncolleague from Rhode Island. While I cannot guarantee the results on \nthis or any other matter in a conference with the House, I will make \nsure that all conferees are aware of the Senator's strong interest in \nthis vitally important program.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator from Missouri and appreciate all of \nhis good work on this bill. Mr. President, before I yield, I would like \nto conclude with a statement made by President Reagan on April 5, 1988, \nconcerning the Montreal Protocol:\n\n       The Montreal Protocol is a model of cooperation. It is a \n     product of the recognition and international consensus that \n     ozone depletion is a global problem, both in terms of its \n     causes and effects. The Protocol is the result of an \n     extraordinary process of scientific study, negotiations among \n     representatives of the business and environmental \n     communities, and international diplomacy. It is a monumental \n     achievement.\n\n  Indeed it is. With that, Mr. President, I again thank the Senator \nfrom Missouri and yield the floor.\n\n\n                              epa research\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in 1994, the EPA awarded the University of \nRhode Island's Marine Ecosystem Research Laboratory a $1.4 million \ngrant to examine the degree to which coastal marine areas of the United \nStates are degraded by elevated concentrations of waterborne nitrogen. \nWhy should this matter be studied? Why do we care if elevated \nconcentrations of nitrogen exist in estuaries and bays? Let me provide \njust a few reasons.\n  Nitrogen concentrations stimulate the growth of marine plants such as \nphytoplankton and seaweed. Excessive growth of these plants often shade \nout and thus kill off natural sea grasses that form fish habitat, as in \nChesapeake Bay. In some instances these plants sink to the bottom and \ndecompose, thus consuming all oxygen and leading to widespread fish \nkills, as in Long Island Sound, Mobile Bay, and elsewhere.\n  Elevated nitrogen levels are also believed to be responsible for \naltering the species composition and biodiversity of indigenous plants, \nthus dramatically altering marine food chains. Some suspect links \nbetween nitrogen enrichment and toxic algal blooms and fish disease. \nThe project undertaken in 1994 at the University of Rhode Island is \ndesigned to help scientists and policymakers better understand how \ncoastal marine systems respond to nitrogen enrichment.\n  Regrettably, only two-thirds of the agreed upon project has been \ncompleted. Under the 1994 grant agreement, the University of Rhode \nIsland was to receive $1.4 million over fiscal years 1994 through 1996. \nAccording to EPA, insufficient fiscal year 1996 resources prevent the \nAgency from fulfilling the third and final year's commitment of \n$474,000.\n  Mr. President, it is my belief that this important research effort \nwarrants the very modest resources committed to it just 2 years ago. I \nmight note that two papers submitted by the university as a result of \nthis project have been published recently in peer-reviewed scientific \njournals.\n  Thus, it is my hope that the EPA Administrator and her Assistant \nAdministrator for Research and Development will give every \nconsideration to providing the final year of funding for this effort in \nfiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his interest in \nEPA research programs. While I am not familiar with the merits of this \nparticular project, it seems only fair to me that EPA should look \nclosely at fulfilling previously initiated grant awards before \nbeginning new ones.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank my friend from Missouri. Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the HUD \nappropriation levels for fiscal year 1997 and to raise concerns about \nsome of HUD's programs that have been going forward unabated for \ndecades.\n  HUD has failed. It has too many programs with hundreds of billions of \ndollars of long-term financial commitments. There are widespread \nweaknesses. It has the worst reputation of all the large Government \nagencies.\n  Over the past 3 years, all kinds of proposals for reinventing HUD \nhave been suggested. Proposals have come from Secretary Cisneros, the \nWhite House, and the Congress. HUD's proposal to change its delivery of \nhousing programs was named ``Reinvention Blueprint.''\n  This proposal is not really a reinvention of HUD. It is just a few \nchanges to the same idea. Solving problems was supposed to be HUD's \nmission. When considering whether we should reinvent HUD or end it, \neach of us has to ask ourselves these questions:\n  Are our inner cities better off than they were 30 years ago?\n  Is the state of public housing better off than it was 30 years ago?\n  The answers to these questions is no--absolutely no. In fact, our \ncities are more decayed and more dangerous today than ever.\n  HUD's housing policy denotes the 1930's belief that public housing \nwill solve the problems of the poor--that tearing down the slums and \nbuilding public housing to replace them would eliminate breeding \ngrounds for crime and disease.\n  HUD thinks that the housing it built is now ill-designed and not well \nconstructed. HUD wants to believe that if\n\n[[Page S9949]]\n\nwe tear down those unsightly highrise buildings and build more \naesthetically pleasing townhouses that the state of the poor will \nchange.\n  HUD wants to believe that bricks and mortar are to blame. But we know \nthat is not true. We cannot blame the state of public housing on bricks \nand mortar.\n  That is why I believe this administration's housing policy is flawed. \nHousing is first and foremost a local issue. Reinvention Blueprint \nrecognizes some major flaws with HUD, but it falls short of what is \nreally needed to reform housing.\n  As former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said, ``The American people do not \nwant to reinvent government, they want to reduce the role of \nGovernment.''\n  HUD is a massive bureaucracy with over 11,000 bureaucrats. It has \nover 240 housing programs--so many that the Secretary of HUD himself \ndid not even know he had that many.\n  HUD has over $192 billion in unused budget authority. This spending \nis increasing so rapidly that by the year 2000, housing assistance will \nbe the largest discretionary spending function in our Government.\n  Can Secretary Cisneros reinvent HUD? No. That is why I introduced \nlegislation to abolish HUD.\n  States should be given maximum flexibility to develop their own \nhousing policies. With States in control, tenants will be offered home \nownership opportunities consistent with what Secretary Jack Kemp \ndeveloped during the Bush administration.\n  We have made strides in changing our housing policy with reforms made \nin the public housing bills currently in conference. But we need to go \nfurther. We need to abolish HUD.\n  My colleagues, when you cast your vote for this bill and you look at \nthe funding levels for HUD, ask yourselves why we continue to fund \nprograms that have failed. HUD is not truly going to reinvent itself. \nWhen you look at the administration's policy behind its funding \nrequests you too will see that we can't afford not to abolish HUD.\n\n\n                       sweetwater branch project\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Florida, \nSenator Graham, to make the Senate--and particularly the chairman of \nthe VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee--aware of the \nSweetwater Branch project. This project is most important to the \ncitizens of Florida and I believe it merits attention by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the Sweetwater Basin begins north of Gainesville, FL, \nruns through the city and discharges into Paynes Prairie--a critical \nnatural resource area owned by the State of Florida and home to many \nimportant species of plants and animals. This water ultimately makes \nits way through the Alachua Sink--a large sinkhole in the area--into \nthe Floridan aquifer. The aquifer is a primary source of drinking water \nfor Florida's citizens and its health is critical to our quality of \nlife.\n  The city has brought together the State, Alachua County, and other \ninterested parties in an effort to ensure that these discharges into \nthe Prairie and the aquifer are not contaminated with agricultural and \nurban runoff. The city is to be commended for its diligence in working \ntoward a solution. The project of cleaning up this water, however, is \nbeyond the scope--both geographically and financially--of the city of \nGainesville. While it has prepared to plan that would mitigate this \nproblem at a relatively low cost, the city needs help on the funding \nand implementation.\n  Thus, it is important--in my view--that this project be made eligible \nfor Federal assistance. I am hopeful the chairman of the subcommittee \nwill work with us on securing the necessary funding to assist the city \nof Gainesville in this most important effort.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would join Senator Mack in commending \nthe city of Gainesville for its diligence in funding a solution to this \ncomplex problem. The project should be considered for Federal funding \nbecause of the complexity of the problem, the difficult web of \njurisdictions, and the large potential impact to the State's primary \ndrinking water supply.\n  I would simply add, Mr. President, that the city of Gainesville has a \nhistory of using local resources to solve local problems. In this case \nthe city has already financed the development of this plan and would be \nfurther committed to a financial partnership on the solution. I believe \nsuch an arrangement is critical to the success of the plan and, again, \nI commend the city of Gainesville for its strong commitment to this \nmost important project. I express my strong support for the efforts of \nthe city of Gainesville and look forward to working with my colleagues \non the subcommittee to secure the necessary funding in the fiscal year \n1997 legislation.\n\n\n    Restructuring the FHA-insured and assisted multifamily mortgage \n                               portfolio\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Senator Bond for his \ninterest in moving forward the process for restructuring the FHA-\ninsured and assisted multifamily mortgage portfolio.\n  I know that the Senator believes his amendment is not a substitute \nfor a permanent debt restructuring proposal. I want to make it clear \nthat the authorizing committee fully intends to move forward with \nportfolio restructuring legislation that can be enacted before the end \nof this Congress.\n  Immediately before the recess, I introduced S. 2042, the Multifamily \nAssisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1996. This \ncomprehensive multifamily mortgage portfolio restructuring proposal; \nwill deal with expiring contracts on units with rents that exceed fair \nmarket rents by reducing those rents to market levels and providing a \nprocess for restructuring the underlying FHA mortgages. I am pleased \nthat Senator Bond has cosponsored this legislation.\n  The Housing Subcommittee of the Banking Committee has long been \nconcerned that flaws in the HUD multifamily insurance and rental \nassistance programs have allowed owners to receive more federal dollars \nin rental assistance than necessary to maintain properties as decent \nand affordable housing. Such a policy is not fair to the American \ntaxpayer, and it cannot be sustained in the current budget environment.\n  Without changes in current policies, the cost of renewing expiring \nproject-based section 8 contracts will grow from $1.2 billion in fiscal \nyear 1997 to almost $4 billion in fiscal year 2000 and $8 billion 10 \nyears from now. However, if these contracts are not renewed, residents \nand communities will be adversely affected and most of the FHA-insured \nmortgages--with an unpaid balance of $18 billion--will default and \nresult in claims on the FHA insurance fund.\n  This proposal would establish an orderly and well-understood \nmechanism for reducing section 8 rents and restructuring mortgage debt \nwith or without FHA mortgage insurance. It would utilize capable public \nentities, like State housing finance agencies, to restructure the \nportfolio; require input from residents and communities; and treat good \nowners and managers of multifamily properties fairly.\n  I believe our bill will have broad-based support that reflects the \ninterests of all of the stakeholders in the process, and we intend to \nmove it forward.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Bond to develop a sound long \nterm strategy for section 8 contract renewals.\n\n\n                  BUDGET COMMITTEE SCORING OF H.R. 366\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3666, the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill for 1997.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $84.3 billion and new \noutlays of $49.7 billion to finance the programs of the Departments of \nVeterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat, with adoption of the manager's amendment, is within the \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation. This is a one of the most difficult \nbills to manage with its varied programs and challenging allocation, \nbut I think the bill meets most of the demands made of it while staying \nunder budget and is a strong candidate for enactment, so I commend my \nfriend the chairman for his efforts and leadership.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other adjustments \nare taken into account, the bill totals $84.3 billion in budget \nauthority and $98.7\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\nbillion in outlays. As reported, the total bill is over the Senate \nsubcommittee's 602(b) nondefense allocation for budget authority by $4 \nmillion and under its allocation for outlays by $6 million. The \nsubcommittee is also under its defense allocation by $4 million in \nbudget authority and outlays.\n  I ask Members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which \nwould cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge \nthe speedy adoption of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n        VA-HUD SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL       \n                 [Fiscal year 1997, dollars in millions]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget               \n                                                 authority     Outlays  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year budget authority                            \n     and other actions completed..............           --           61\n    H.R. 3666, as reported to the Senate......          125           64\n    Scorekeeping adjustment...................           --           --\n                                               -------------------------\n      Subtotal defense discretionary..........          125          125\n                                               =========================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year budget authority                            \n     and other actions completed..............          365       47,431\n    H.R. 3666, as reported to the Senate......       63,964       31,611\n    Scorekeeping adjustment...................           --           --\n                                               -------------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary.......       64,329       79,042\n                                               =========================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year budget authority                            \n     and other actions completed..............           --        1,153\n    H.R. 3666, as reported to the Senate......       20,260       18,013\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs                            \n     with budget resolution assumptions.......         -406          381\n                                               -------------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory......................       19,854       19,547\n                                               =========================\n      Adjusted bill total.....................       84,308       98,714\n                                               =========================\nSenate subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary.....................          129          129\n    Nondefense discretionary..................       64,325       79,048\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund........           --           --\n    Mandatory.................................       19,854       19,547\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total allocation........................       84,308       98,724\n                                               =========================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary.....................           -4           -4\n    Nondefense discretionary..................            4           -6\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund........           --           --\n    Mandatory.................................           --           --\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total allocation........................           --          -10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, more than a month after the Committee on \nAppropriations reported the pending fiscal year 1997 VA-HUD \nappropriations bill, the Department of Commerce announced that it would \nundertake an investigation of the alleged below-market bid made by a \nJapanese vendor in a pending supercomputer procurement of the National \nCenter for Atmospheric Research [NCAR]. This investigation is in \naccordance with the anti-dumping procedures specified in law. \nSubsequent to this announcement, on August 20, the National Science \nFoundation, which provides the bulk of Federal operating support for \nNCAR requested that the pending procurement be put on hold and await \nthe resolution of the dumping issue.\n  I have been asked if these actions negate or otherwise change the \nCommittee's position with respect to the deletion of section 421 of the \nHouse-passed bill. That provision was intended to block the NCAR \nprocurement by prohibiting the use of funds to pay the salaries of \npersonnel who approve a contract for a supercomputer which is found to \nbe in violation of the anti-dumping provisions of law.\n  The answer is no. The House provision inappropriately attempted to \nimpose a penalty for alleged dumping, separate and apart from that \nprovided for in law. Current law specifies a clearly defined process \nfor the Department of Commerce to investigate and determine if unfair \nprices are being offered by a foreign vendor. Furthermore, upon the \ndetermination that dumping has occurred, redress is provided through \nthe imposition of compensating duties. The House proposal would require \nthe National Science Foundation to determine whether dumping has \noccurred, an agency that does not have the expertise nor the authority \nto make such a finding. If this provision were to be enacted the \nFoundation would have to prejudge the outcome of the Commerce \nDepartment investigation. Unfortunately, by preventing any contract \nfrom being approved, NSF may lead to the adverse consequences that we \nare seeking to avoid.\n  The decision of the Foundation to request a delay in the procurement \npending competition of the anti-dumping investigation process now \nunderway by the Commerce Department may jeopardize the pending \nprocurement, and will certainly delay the needed acquisition of state-\nof-the-art supercomputing technology. Such potential consequences are \nvery disturbing, especially since the NSF is under no obligation to \ndelay these contractual negotiations. Indeed, the anti-dumping \nprovisions remedies are premised on imposition of special duties, not \non a rescission of any sales or a prohibition on any sale.\n  If the action of the Foundation were to terminate the pending \nprocurement, it would have the effect of nullifying the established \nprocess of investigating and determining whether dumping has occurred, \na responsibility of the Commerce Department, not the National Science \nFoundation.\n   Mr. President, the chairman and the ranking minority Member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, Senators Roth and Moynihan, wrote a letter \nobjecting to the House provision, and urging that the normal process be \nfollowed. In addition, the Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen, also \nwrote on behalf of the Government Affairs Committee expressing his \nconcern over the implications that the House provision would have on \nprocurement procedures of the Government, under the jurisdiction of \nthat committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, \n         Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kit: We are writing to express our concerns about a \n     provision in the House version of the VA-HUD appropriations \n     bill for fiscal year 1997 (H.R. 3666), which may also be \n     offered as an amendment to the Senate version of the bill. \n     This provision (section 421) would prohibit the use of \n     appropriated funds to pay the salaries of National Science \n     Foundation (NSF) employees who authorize the acquisition of \n     any supercomputer, which the Department of Commerce \n     determines was sold at a dumped price.\n       In our opinion, it is inappropriate to include this \n     provision on an appropriations bill. The provision involves \n     the administration of the antidumping law, which falls \n     squarely under the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on \n     Finance. Because the provision could result in a violation of \n     United States' obligations under the antidumping rules of the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO), the Committee on Finance \n     should have an opportunity to examine the potential \n     consequences should the provision be enacted into law.\n       Moreover, in making its procurement decision, the NSF must \n     take into account all relevant factors, including the \n     possibility of dumping. However, the U.S. antidumping law \n     provides a remedy if the NSF's procurement results in the \n     U.S. industry having to compete with dumped imports. Then the \n     appropriate action is for the U.S. industry to file an \n     antidumping petition with the Department of Commerce and the \n     U.S. International Trade Commission or for the Department of \n     Commerce to self initiate an antidumping investigation.\n       In light of these considerations, we urge you to do what \n     you can to resist any attempt to add this or any similar \n     provision to the Senate bill and to ensure that the provision \n     is not included in the bill when the legislation moves to \n     conference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on VA-HUD Appropriations, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Attached is a copy of a provision \n     contained in H.R. 3666, which the House recently passed to \n     provide appropriations for VA-HUD and Independent Agencies.\n       This bill contains funding for National Science Foundation \n     (NSF) programs. Section 421 is aimed at preventing the \n     planned lease of a supercomputer by the University \n     Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), which must \n     obtain NSF approval before entering into a contract to \n     acquire the supercomputing capacity selected by UCAR \n     technical experts under a competitive procurement process.\n       When the House of Representatives considered H.R. 3666, \n     there was serious disagreement among several Members as to \n     whether the language of Section 421 was a violation of the \n     government procurement code. Representative Kolbe and \n     Representative Campbell presented strong arguments that the\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\n     procurement code would indeed be violated by this provision, \n     if it is enacted into law. Representative Crane, Chairman of \n     the Subcommittee on Trade, presented arguments that the \n     provision could also be a violation of antidumping and trade \n     laws (please see attached copy of his letter).\n       As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of \n     Government Management and the District of Columbia, I wanted \n     to inform you of my concern that this particular provision \n     has not been discussed in appropriate hearings before the \n     Senate and that it's impact has not received any \n     consideration by the Committee on Government Affairs which \n     has jurisdiction over the issue of government procurement.\n       In your role as the Chairman of the Subcommittee providing \n     funding for the National Science Foundation, I hope you will \n     agree the language of Section 421 or any language which is \n     intended to interrupt the orderly operation of the formal \n     procurement process could set a dangerous precedent. Because \n     of the intense concern expressed by the House Members during \n     their debate and because the Senate committee of jurisdiction \n     has not yet discussed this serious issue, I ask that you take \n     whatever action is necessary to prevent the inclusion of any \n     language in the VA-HUD appropriations bill which, in effect, \n     could create a legislated change in the manner in which the \n     procurement code is applied. Any impact on the procurement \n     process caused by congressional legislative action should \n     receive the full review and consideration by the committee of \n     jurisdiction.\n       Your consideration of this request will be sincerely \n     appreciated.\n       With best wishes, I am\n           Sincerely,\n     William S. Cohen,\n\n                                     Chairman, Subcommittee on\n\n                                Oversight of Government Management\n     and the District of Columbia.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Livingston,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I am writing in reference to provision 421 \n     included in the National Science Foundation (NSF) \n     appropriations legislation as reported out by subcommittee \n     that would provide that no funding may be used to pay the \n     salaries of any NSF employee who approves a contract for \n     supercomputing equipment after a preliminary or final \n     determination of dumping by the Commerce Department (language \n     attached). This amendment is aimed at the proposed \n     procurement of an NEC supercomputer by an NSF grantee. In a \n     May 20, 1996 letter, the Commerce Department opined, without \n     conducting a formal investigation, that the lease in question \n     may constitute dumping.\n       I am greatly concerned that the effect of this amendment \n     would be to force NSF to turn down the NEC supercomputer even \n     though neither the Department of Commerce nor the \n     International Trade Commission have made any formal findings \n     of dumping and injury and, in fact, have not initiated any \n     formal investigations, as required in order to impose \n     antidumping duties.\n       Clearly, we must enforce our antidumping laws to prevent \n     unfair trading. However, this amendment would improperly use \n     the appropriations process to chill what could be a \n     legitimate, procurement that does not involve dumping. I \n     believe that whether the NEC lease is an appropriate \n     procurement and whether the lease is in fact being made at a \n     dumped price should be determined on the merits of the case. \n     It is impossible for Congress to determine now whether the \n     procurement in question violates the antidumping statute. \n     That is a matter for the Commerce Department and the \n     International Trade Commission to determine, using \n     statutorily mandated procedures. Only when they have made \n     this determination can we begin to consider the effects on \n     the procurement.\n       The amendment, however, forces Congress to prejudge this \n     decision. Indeed, I am concerned that such an amendment could \n     violate our obligations under Article 18(1) of the WTO \n     Antidumping Agreement, which states that no specific action \n     against dumping of exports from another party may be taken \n     except in accordance with the Agreement and does not \n     authorize punitive measures such as disqualification from \n     government procurement. In addition, I am concerned that the \n     amendment could violate Article III of the Government \n     Procurement Agreement, which provides that each party shall \n     provide national treatment to suppliers of other parties. \n     Accordingly, I strongly urge you to remove the amendment from \n     the legislation when the bill is considered by your \n     Committee.\n       I look forward to working with you on this matter.\n           With best personal regards,\n                                                  Philip M. Crane,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                             Provision 421\n\n       Sec. 421. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to pay the salaries of \n     personnel who approve a contract for the purchase, lease, or \n     acquisition in any manner of supercomputing equipment or \n     services after a preliminary determination, as defined in 19 \n     U.S.C. 1673b, or final determination, as defined in 19 U.S.C. \n     1673d, by the Department of Commerce that an organization \n     providing such supercomputing equipment or services has \n     offered such product at other than fair value.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for the reasons I have outlined, both \nprogrammatic, as well as jurisdictional, it is my intent to sustain the \nSenate's deletion of the House provision in conference. And for the \nsame reasons, I urge the National Science Foundation to reconsider its \ndelay in this procurement.\n\n\n                    Environmental Protection Agency\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last year Republicans waged a covert war \nagainst the environment when they attempted to drastically cut EPA's \nbudget in order to cripple the EPA's ability to set and enforce \nenvironmental standards. The cuts that eventually passed were not as \ndrastic, but they have meant that an already stretched EPA has had to \ncurtail important work that ensures the health and safety of all \nAmericans.\n  I am relieved to see that, this year, there is no new attempt by \nRepublicans to further cut EPA's enforcement budget. A poorly funded \nEPA will mean more water pollution, more smog in our cities and \ncountryside, more toxic waste problems. For this reason I will continue \nto fight for a strong, efficient, and well funded Environmental \nProtection Agency. It is in the best interest of the health and safety \nof our citizens.\n  I am also pleased that the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill for \nthe Environmental Protection Agency does not include any of the \ncontentious antienvironmental legislative riders that were attempted \nlast year.\n  There are several issues included in this bill of great importance to \nCalifornia that I would like to highlight:\n  South Tahoe export pipeline replacement project:\n  Although my request for funds for this project was not included in \nthe bill, I want to thank Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for their \ninterest in the project and ask them to keep Lake Tahoe in mind in \nconference to see if some help for Lake Tahoe can be provided.\n  Help for Lake Tahoe is so urgent that the project was authorized in \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act as a special project to be considered by \nthe Administrator of EPA if there are sufficient funds.\n  The South Tahoe Public Utility District needs urgent help in \nreplacing its export pipeline system which protects and preserves the \nwater quality in Lake Tahoe. The export pipeline transports reclaimed \nwater from the wastewater treatment plant in South Tahoe out of the \nLake Tahoe basin to a nearby reservoir where the reclaimed water is \nstored and later used for irrigation and other purposes.\n  The existing pipeline is reaching the end of its useful life and must \nbe replaced quickly if we are to avoid the possibility of a \ncatastrophic spill resulting in serious environmental harm to Lake \nTahoe. Several serious leaks have already occurred over the last 2 \nyears, and the risk of a rupture increases the longer it takes to \ncomplete the replacement project.\n  The local community has raised $10 million toward replacement of the \npipeline, but a total of $30 million will be needed. The local \ncommunity is already paying sewer rates substantially higher than the \naverage in California, $10 million in Federal assistance is needed if \nthe pipeline is to be replaced in a timely manner. While the local \ncommunity might be able to pay for the pipeline replacement over the \nlong term by enduring high utility rates, it will not get the job done \nas quickly as it could be done with Federal assistance. Such Federal \nassistance would enable the South Tahoe Public Utility District to \ncomplete the project in a more expeditious manner, reducing the chances \nof a large leak with serious environmental consequences for the lake.\n  Southwest center for environmental research and policy center.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes an additional $2.5 million for \nthe Southwest Center for Environmental Research and Policy.\n  SCERP is a consortium of American and Mexican universities that works \nto address environmental problems along the United States-Mexican \nborder including but not limited to air quality, water quality, and \nhazardous materials. SCERP's members include San Diego State \nUniversity, New Mexico State University, University of Utah, University \nof Texas-El Paso, and Arizona State University. SCERP had its\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\norigins in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which authorized the \nestablishment of an entity to research air and water quality and other \nenvironmental problems in the border region. SCERP has been funded \nthrough congressional appropriations for the last 5 years in \nfulfillment of the Clean Air Act mandate.\n  United States-Mexico border cleanup: New River cleanup.\n  I strongly support the $100,000 million appropriation, the same as \nthe budget request, for architecture, engineering, design, and \nconstruction-related activities for high priority water and wastewater \nfacilities in communities near the United States-Mexico border.\n  A top priority border cleanup project is the cleanup of the New \nRiver, which flows from Mexico to Imperial County, CA, and is one of \nthe most polluted rivers in the world.\n  New River cleanup is essential to ensuring the environmental health \nof the southern California border region. The cleanup project consists \nof two stages. Stage one, currently underway, consists of a series of \nquick fix repair jobs on the Mexicali, Mexico, sewer system aimed at \nsignificantly reducing the flow of raw sewage into the New River. Stage \ntwo will consist of planning, design, and construction of a wastewater \ntreatment plant and allied systems.\n  I recently wrote to Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency asking the EPA to reaffirm its commitment to meeting \nthe obligation of the United States to contribute 55 percent of the \ncleanup costs of the New River in Imperial County, CA. The EPA \nresponded on July 26, 1996, confirming its commitment to meeting its \n55-percent share of the cleanup costs for the New River. I ask \nunanimous consent that the EPA letter appear in the Record immediately \nafter my statement.\n  Rice growers in California's Sacramento River valley.\n  In closing I strongly urge the Environmental Protection Agency to \ncontinue working closely with California rice growers to help them \nachieve certainty regarding the regulation of agricultural waters under \nthe Clean Water Act. Rice growers need clarity and certainty regarding \nhow water quality standards apply to waters associated with rice \nproduction in the Sacramento River Valley. I am hopeful that we will be \nable to reach a solution that all sides are comfortable with in the \nvery near future.\n\n\n                    Low-Income Housing Preservation\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman \nand ranking member of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies \nSubcommittee, on behalf of myself and the other sponsors of the \npreservation amendment, for including an increase in preservation \nfunding in the manager's amendment to the appropriations bill. Senator \nBond and Senator Mikulski have been strong and constant champions of \nthe preservation program.\n  The provision included in the manager's amendment would increase the \nfull appropriation for the low-income housing preservation program by \n$150 million to $500 million by rescinding $150 million in recaptured \npreservation interest payments.\n  Adequate funding for preservation sales to nonprofit organizations is \nvital if we are to retain affordable rental housing in our communities \nfor families and senior citizens. There are currently more than 300 \nprojects with 30,000 units of affordable housing in the process of \nbeing sold to nonprofit and tenant organizations. Without sufficient \nfunding these sales will not go through and thousands of units of \naffordable housing could be irretrievably lost.\n  Preservation has been a tremendous success throughout the country and \nin my own State of Illinois. To date, over 4,000 apartments in more \nthan 17 developments in Illinois have been preserved as affordable \nhousing. Eight of these properties, containing over 2,400 apartments \nhave been transferred to non-profit owners with the support of the \nresidents.\n  In Illinois we have three properties, Carmen Marine Apartments, 707 \nWaveland, and West Park Place, that have been sold to resident councils \nwho are converting the properties to resident home ownership. Carmen \nMarine is a 300 unit high rise located on Lake Michigan. The residents \nhere became the first tenants in the country to purchase their units \nunder the preservation program in 1994. The average income is \napproximately $18,000 per year. Rents have remained affordable and a \nmixed income community with seniors and families of diverse national \norigins has been preserved. An Illinois success story repeated across \nthe Nation.\n  The need for affordable housing greatly exceeds the supply. It does \nnot make sense to take a significant number of high quality, low-income \nunits off the market where they can be preserved. With adequate \npreservation funding we can preserve some of the best of our affordable \nhousing stock. In many neighborhoods, there is no comparable housing \navailable to these tenants.\n  In Illinois alone, the sales of over 3,500 units to nonprofits are \npending. These are units that house senior citizens in their own \nneighborhoods. These are units that allow families to grow up in good \ncommunities. These are affordable units for working people.\n  The decisions we make concerning funding for preservation will have a \ndirect impact on the lives of these residents and for hundreds of \nthousand of others around the country. Good, affordable apartments and \nthe American dream of home ownership, to me that, is something worth \npreserving. I thank my colleagues for including this important increase \nin preservation funding in the fiscal year 1997 VA, HUD, and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the HUD title of \nthe VA-HUD appropriations bill. I first want to commend the chairman \nand the ranking member of the subscommittee for their hard work on this \nbill. The competing and diverse priorities addressed by this \nappropriations bill make it arguably the most difficult of all the \nbills to craft. The chairman and the ranking members take a thoughtful, \nconsidered approach to a difficult task and their efforts deserve \nrecognition.\n  Unfortunately, the VA-HUD Subcommittee has over the last several \nyears been saddled with an insufficient budget allocation. It should \nnot be terribly surprising therefore, that the amounts the subcommittee \nhas provided for many of its programs and activities are inadequate. \nNowhere are the overall Federal budget pressures felt more keenly than \nat HUD. Funding in this bill for public housing operating subsidies, \npublic housing modernization, incremental section 8, elderly and \ndisabled housing, and homeless assistance simply is inadequate relative \nto the needs across our Nation.\n  But despite the insufficient overall allocation, there are some \nbright spots in the bill. Several elements of the HUD title deserve \nparticular mention. I congratulate the subcommittee for providing level \nfunding for the HOME and CDBG programs. These are extremely important \nprograms for providing affordable housing and revitalizing distressed \ncommunities. Their blend of national priorities and local flexibility \nmakes these two of HUD's strongest programs.\n  I also would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for \naccepting two amendments that I offered with other members. The first \namendment that I offered with my distinguished colleague from new \nMexico, Senator Domenici, will provide a set-aside of $50 million for \nvouchers for disabled persons. As the Congress has moved to allow local \npublic housing authorities to designate certain housing developments \nfor elderly only, it is important that we provide alternative housing \nresources to meet the housing needs of disabled individuals who in the \npast had access to such housing.\n  The second amendment increases the appropriations for the low-income \nhousing preservation program from $350 million to $500 million. This is \nan extremely important program in Massachusetts and across the country. \nThousands of families around the country are threatened with losing \ntheir affordable housing as owners prepay their HUD-assisted mortgages \nand convert the housing to either market-rate housing or other uses. \nThe preservation program provides funding to maintain the buildings as \naffordable housing. The program has been troubled, but its mission is \nsound. We on the authorizing committee will continue to work to\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\nimprove its performance. I again thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their support of this amendment and I thank my cosponsors \nSenators Craig, Moseley-Braun, and Sarbanes.\n  In 1996, Congress provided a priority for funding the portion of the \npreservation program that provides for the transfer of these \ndevelopments to community and resident-based nonprofit corporations. I \nhave visited with residents in my home State who have worked for years \nto assemble funding packages and grant applications to achieve \nownership of their dwellings. With this appropriation, the dreams of \nmany across the Nation will come to fruition. But the demand for the \nsales program has been extraordinary and it is already clear that the \n$500 million for fiscal year 1997 will not be enough. I am planning to \nwork with the administration and the conferees on this bill to identify \nother possible sources of funding in order to meet this demand.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to comment on the Bond amendment \nrelated to HUD multifamily portfolio restructuring. We have been \nworking very hard in a bipartisan manner in the Banking Committee to \naddress this intractable problem. As others have described, the effort \nto lower high section 8 costs and avoid excessive FAA mortgage \ndefaults--while at the same time preserving affordable housing--is \ncomplicated and costly. The demonstration for which the Bond amendment \nprovides, represents a good first step toward putting in place a \nprogram for lowering section 8 costs and restructuring the mortgages in \na sound way. Most important, the amendment states that the purpose of \nthe demonstration is to preserve affordable housing and identifies the \npublic interest in the future affordability of these properties. The \namendment preserves project-based assistance and ensures that public \nagencies are involved in the restructuring.\n  I do have several concerns with the Bond amendment--particularly \nrelated to the role of the residents, the community, and the local \ngovernment in the restructuring process--but I am confident the \nbipartisan approach Senator Bond has taken to this point with respect \nto this amendment will continue in the conference committee and I look \nforward to working with the chairman in making these improvements and \nin putting something in place until the authorizing committee can enact \na permanent solution.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me thank the leaders for their \ncooperation in helping us come to what I had not expected to see at \nthis point. We are deeply grateful for the accommodation. After we have \nacted on the pending amendments, then I believe we will be ready to go \nto third reading.\n  Thanks and appreciation to all involved, particularly my colleague, \nSenator Mikulski, and our staffs on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as we are just minutes away from the \nvote on four amendments and then final passage, I thank Senator Bond \nfor his cooperation, respecting the voice of the minority, and for his \nvery able staff and the way they worked with us; Senator Lott, who \nworked with us to bring the bill to the floor; to the Democratic leader \nfor his advocacy for all of the issues in this bill, and for creating a \nframework where we could get many things done; and also to my staff for \nthe excellent work that they did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to take a moment, too, to say to the chairman \nof the subcommittee and the ranking member, the managers of this \nlegislation, they have done an excellent job. I know it has not been \neasy for them, many times, working with the leadership as we have tried \nto get agreement on a whole number of issues that were really unrelated \nto their legislation. I think they have done a great job with the bill \nitself. I apologize for us not being able to get it done before the \nAugust recess, but you have been very considerate in your willingness \nfor us to do other things. I thank you for your work. You have done a \ngood job and I am glad we are going to be able to complete it tonight. \nAlthough we have enjoyed having you on the floor all this week, you \nhave done such a wonderful job, we still think it better to move on to \nother issues. Thank you for your good work.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 5194, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 5194, as amended, offered by the Senator from New Mexico. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, before we start, we had a minute on each \nside. Do they need it? I think we might as well get started. I don't \nthink we need it on this particular amendment, but I wanted to be sure. \nUnder the unanimous-consent agreement, there are 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to each piece of legislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Kentucky, I \nthink on the Domenici-Wellstone amendment, we had a pretty thorough \ndebate and discussion, so we probably don't need it on this one.\n  Mr. FORD. That is what I was saying. On the others, I wanted to alert \nthe Chair to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the minority whip. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, we are ready to propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest. That way Members will know what they can expect for the next 3 \ndays, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday. We will go through this now and then \nwe will go to the brief explanation on the Harkin amendment and go to \nfinal vote. Members have been asking, Mr. President, what will be the \nitems that we will go to next. Rather than answer one by one I thought \nI could go ahead and outline this. I want to thank\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\nthe leader for his work in trying to put it together.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 on Friday the Senate turn to the \nimmediate consideration of a bill to be introduced tonight by Senator \nKennedy regarding employment discrimination, and the bill be placed on \nthe calendar, the text of which will be submitted in the form of an \namendment to Calendar No. 499, and there be a time limitation of 3 \nhours to be equally divided in the usual form with no amendments or \nmotions to refer in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that at 9:30 on Tuesday the Senate proceed to \nCalendar No. 499, the Defense of Marriage Act and it be considered \nunder the same terms as outlined above, with 45 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that the vote regarding passage of Calendar \nNo. 499 occur immediately following the vote with respect to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization conference report on Tuesday, \nSeptember 10, and following that vote there be 30 minutes for debate on \nthe Kennedy bill to be equally divided in the usual form with the vote \nto occur following the conclusion or yielding back of the time on \nTuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that following the disposition of the \nemployment discrimination bill on Tuesday, September 10, the Senate \nproceed to the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion \nfiled earlier this evening with respect to Calendar No. 499 be vitiated \nsince it is no longer needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \nproceed to four remaining back-to-back votes regarding the HUD-VA bill \nand the Iraqi resolution. There will be no further votes following \npassage.\n  On Friday the Senate will debate the employment discrimination bill \nintroduced by Senator Kennedy and also conduct a period for morning \nbusiness. However, no votes will occur on Friday. On Monday, the Senate \nwill debate the Department of Defense authorization conference report \nunder previous consent. Also, the Senate will conduct a period for \nmorning business. No votes will occur during Monday's session of the \nSenate. On Tuesday, the Senate will debate the defense of marriage \nbill, and at 2:15 a series of votes will occur beginning with the DOD \nauthorization conference report. Following those stacked votes, the \nSenate will proceed to the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill.\n\n  I want to thank all Senators and the Democratic leader for their \ncooperation. Now it does make it possible for us not to have votes on \nFriday and Monday, but allows for us to accomplish a great deal of our \nwork together, have debate, and then have stacked votes on Tuesday. We \nwill be able to proceed with getting our work done with a minimum \ndisruption of commitments that Senators must necessarily fulfill.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield just for a \nclarification, I say at the outset that I support entirely the result \nof these negotiations, and I appreciate very much everyone's \ncooperation.\n  On the first page of the unanimous-consent agreement, in reference to \nthe bill to be offered by Senator Kennedy, on the bottom line it asks \nunanimous consent that the bill be equally divided in the usual form, \nwith a vote to occur on Tuesday. It did not say a vote on final \npassage. I assume the majority leader meant a vote on final passage.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. I amend that request to include that a \nvote on final passage occur following the conclusion or yielding back \nof the time. I ask unanimous consent that the agreement be modified to \nreflect that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, am I correct that when we are talking \nabout the Defense of Marriage Act on Tuesday, that will be a vote on \nfinal passage as well?\n  Mr. LOTT. It would be, yes, immediately after the vote on the \nDepartment of Defense conference report at 2:15, between 2:30 and 2:45.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9953-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9954-S9955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5197\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Harkin amendment. \nThere are 2 minutes equally divided. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what this amendment does is it basically \nis a hold-harmless amendment. There is no contradiction between this \namendment and the McCain amendment of last night. This amendment says \nthat any increases can go to these States, but no State this year can \nget less than what it did last year. It is almost commonly held around \nhere that when we make major changes in formulas, we always have a 1-\nyear hold harmless as a bridge. That is what this amendment does; it \nmakes that bridge.\n  What I am saying, basically, is that this vote on this amendment I \nhave offered means that a lot of States will not be severely cut in \ntheir veterans health benefits this year. It holds them harmless. But \nit says to those high-growth States, like Arizona, Florida, and others, \nthey can go ahead and get the increase. But there will not be big cuts \nin a lot of other States.\n  I suggest that people might want to check to see what is going to \nhappen to their States if the McCain amendment is adopted without this \nhold-harmless clause. I know people say we have to treat veterans \nequitably, and we do. But in a lot of the States, like Pennsylvania, \nNew York, Iowa, and a lot of Northern States, our veterans are older, \npoorer, and sicker, and it costs more. That is not taken into account \nin the McCain amendment, and it is in mine.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Veterans' Administration Undersecretary \nfor Health is doing an outstanding job in bringing modern, efficient, \neffective, and compassionate health care to our Nation's veterans. He \ntestified before my subcommittee earlier this year that one of the \nbarriers about which he was most concerned in attempting to change and \nimprove the way the Veterans' Administration operates is the Congress. \nThe Harkin amendment is precisely what the Veterans' Administration \nfeared, because it would prevent the Veterans' Administration from \nmaking changes to see that the older and sicker veterans, wherever they \nlive, get the care that they need.\n  The Veterans' Administration opposes this amendment because it would \nprevent them from efficiently allocating resources to meet veterans' \nhealth needs in the most effective manner. I, therefore, move to table \nthe amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto table.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] \nand the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD.

The question now occurs on amendment No. 5190 \nby the Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle. Pursuant to rule XVI, paragraph \n4, the Chair submits the question to the Senate; namely, Is the \namendment germane subject matter of the bill? On this question, the \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute of debate.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as a requirement of the 1991 Agent Orange \nAct, after a thorough analysis of all relevant scientific evidence, the \nNational Academy of Sciences announced in March a link between agent \norange exposure and the presence of spina bifida in offspring.\n  My amendment would extend health care, vocational rehabilitation, and \nmonetary benefits to Vietnam veterans' children born with spina bifida, \na serious birth defect that requires lifelong medical care. It is \ncompletely paid for with a non-controversial savings provision.\n  While this should be an honest vote on the proposal itself, some have \nchosen to cloak it in a procedural question. I ask my colleagues to \nvote against the germaneness point of order. Of all amendments we have \ndebated and voted on today, this amendment is clearly a veterans' issue \non this veterans' bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. This is a perfect example of why this country has a $5 \ntrillion debt. On the basis of one study, one study which the author \ntestified before the House we should not rely on, the minority leader \nwants to create on an appropriations bill a brand-new entitlement \nprogram which has not been heard in the authorizing committee, which is \nnot based on sound science. If you believe sound science rather than \nemotion should be the basis of our action, then you could not support \nthis proposal. But it is an effort to establish over the objections of \nthe authorizing committee chairman an entitlement program on an \nappropriations bill, and it was for that reason I raised the point that \nthis amendment is not germane.\n  I ask that the Members support the argument that this is not germane, \nand I ask they vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question before the Senate now is Senate \nResolution 288, offered by the majority leader and minority leader \nregarding the United States response to Iraqi aggression. There are 2 \nminutes equally divided.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who deserve our gratitude for the effort put forth \nin the last couple of days to bring us to this point. I will not name \nthem now. I will name them later.\n  Let me simply read the resolving clause:\n\n       The Senate commends the military actions taken by and the \n     performance of the United States Armed Forces, under the \n     direction of the Commander in Chief, for carrying out this \n     military mission in a highly professional, efficient and \n     effective manner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader for framing a very difficult compromise which has, \ngiven the proximity to a Presidential election, a great deal of emotion \nassociated with it.\n  I believe this resolution achieves the goal that we seek of \nexpressing our appreciation and our gratitude for the outstanding men \nand women who serve in the military. It is obvious that those men and \nwomen serve under the Commander in Chief, and that is appropriate to be \nmentioned in this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I don't know how this whole situation is going to \nevolve, nor do we know exactly what has taken place. But I do know, as \nalways, we can thank and be grateful and in our prayers be grateful \nthat we have the finest men and women that this world has ever seen \nserving in our military who, again, responded to the call of the \nCommander in Chief in such an outstanding fashion.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this \nresolution. When the President, in his unique capacity as Commander in \nChief, orders our Armed Forces into action, Congress has an obligation \nto both affirm our support for the men and women of the United States \nmilitary who have been ordered to undertake the mission, and our \nrespect for the President as the constitutional officer responsible for \nthe conduct of our military and foreign policies. This is the purpose \nof the resolution before us,\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\nand it is wholly appropriate that the Senate adopt it without dissent.\n  Such an affirmation does not, however, signal Congress' intention to \nrelinquish our responsibility to make critical judgments about the \nPresident's decision, the goals which his decision are intended to \nachieve, and the efficacy of his administration's policies to secure \nUnited States security interests in the Persian Gulf region. Political \ncustom and the importance of assuring our servicemen and women of \nCongress' support, as well as the necessity of presenting a united \nfront to America's adversaries oblige Members of Congress to refrain \nfrom criticizing the administration while military operations are \nunderway. But, we are not expected to permanently defer our \nconstitutional responsibility to either concur with or oppose the \nPresident's policy.\n  I have never shied away from criticizing administration policies in \nthe Persian Gulf or elsewhere when I found them wanting. Neither have I \nrefrained from offering my support to this administration when I \nbelieved such support was warranted. I am on record criticizing \nadministration policies for Iraq and the region prior to the initiation \nof the recent military operation there. I stand by that criticism, but \nwill refrain from elaborating it further until I am confident that the \nimmediate military exigency has passed.\n  I will reserve judgment on the efficacy of these strikes, and the \nadvisability of the President's subsequent policies in the region until \nthe administration has provided Congress with sufficient information \nupon which to base an informed judgment.\n  Toward that end, Mr. President, let me suggest that the \nadministration in briefings and testimony before Congress be prepared \nto answer certain obvious and basic questions about its purposes and \npolicies in the region beyond simply providing bomb damage assessments \nand analyses of Iraqi responses to our missile strikes.\n  Speaking for myself, and, I suspect, many of my colleagues, the \nnecessity of taking some military action against Iraq is apparent. \nWhether the action ordered by the President was the appropriate \nresponse to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein cannot be determined \nuntil we have a much fuller understanding of the administration's \noverall strategy for reducing instability and countering threats to our \nsecurity interests in the region.\n  The administration should explain what precise purposes our cruise \nmissile strikes were intended to serve. Were they intended to compel \nIraq's complete withdrawal from the Kurdish city of Irbil in the north \nof Iraq and to cease all aggression against Kurds? Were they intended \nto persuade Saddam against contemplating renewed aggression against his \nneighbors to the south? Were they intended to foment opposition to \nSaddam within the Iraqi military? Was the limited dimension of this \noperation dictated by the opposition of our allies in the region or \ndoes it represent some other consideration which the administration has \nyet to disclose?\n  Should Saddam test American resolve further by continuing hostilities \nin the north, launching new operations against the Shiite minority in \nthe south, flaunting the new no-fly restrictions, firing missiles at \nU.S. and allied warplanes, or again threatening the territorial \nintegrity of U.S. allies in the region, is the administration prepared \nto take significantly greater military actions? Will they rebuild the \ncoalition of Desert Storm allies that will almost certainly be \nnecessary if we are obliged to increase our military response? Without \nthe use of bases in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, our military options are \nobviously very severely limited.\n  Most important, Mr. President, what are the geopolitical \ncircumstances which the administration wishes to obtain in the Persian \nGulf region, and what is its overall, coherent strategy for achieving \nthem which integrates our bilateral policies for all the countries of \nthe region? Until these basic questions are answered, neither I nor any \nMember of Congress, nor the public we serve can judge not only the \nefficacy of these strikes, but the administration's ability to protect \nour most vital security interests in the region, interests for which \nthis country has already paid a very high price to defend.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate that none of these unanswered \nquestions cause me nor should they cause any Member of Congress to \nwithhold his or her support for our military personnel tasked with \nexecuting the President's decision. Nor should we begrudge the \nPresident our respect for his authority or our prayers for the success \nof his policy. This is the time to give voice to that support as I am \nconfident we will do when we shortly vote on this resolution. The time \nfor critical analysis also begins now. Our conclusions must await \nanother day. That day, however, will not be too distant.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the United States Senate, That: The Senate \n     commends the military actions taken by and the performance of \n     the United States Armed Forces, under the direction of the \n     Commander-in-Chief, for carrying out this military mission in \n     a highly professional, efficient and effective manner.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

In addition to representing the interests of the \nminority side, she has been extremely helpful in expediting and \ncompleting action on many of the matters that faced us.\n  We could not have done this without the work of our trusted and \nvaluable staff. On our side, the chief clerk, Stephen Kohashi, ably \nassisted by Carrie Apostolou, and Julie Dammann on my staff was \nessential on our side. Sally Chadbourne has been terrific to work with. \nI am grateful for her assistance on this. Also, David Bowers and \nCatherine Corson helped on the minority side.\n  We are most grateful that this measure had such spirited involvement \non so many interesting and challenging issues.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending August 30, the United States imported \n6,700,000 barrels of oil each day, 500,000 less than the 7,200,000 \nimported during the same week a year ago.\n  Nevertheless, Americans relied on foreign oil for 51 percent of their \nneeds last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will \nabate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained about 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil by \nU.S. producers using American workers?

Mr. President, under a previous unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senate is scheduled to consider and complete action \nbefore the end of next week on the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The Convention bans the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical \nweapons. It includes detailed verification provisions. It was \nnegotiated in the Reagan and Bush administrations and was based largely \non a text personally presented to the Conference on Disarmament in \nGeneva by then Vice President Bush. The convention represents a \nsignificant advance beyond the only existing constraint on chemical \nweapons, the 1929 Geneva Protocol, which only bans the use of such \nweapons in war.\n  Earlier today, several Members expressed concern with regard to the \nconvention. I am sure that those concerns and any others that Members \nmay have will be raised and addressed in detail next week during the \ntotal of 12 hours agreed upon for consideration of the treaty.\n  I personally favor very much ratification of the treaty. I reached \nthat judgment following extensive hearings I chaired in 1994 while \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Additional \nhearings have been held this year under the chairmanship of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina [Mr. Helms], and, as a result, the Committee has \nbeen able to consider a broad range of issues and, in my view, resolve \nthem quite satisfactorily.\n  The Clinton administration strongly supports the treaty as settled \nupon during the Bush administration. In its efforts to inform the \nSenate, I am told that the administration has responded to over 300 \nSenate questions on the treaty and has responded in detail to inquiries \nmade by members of the Committee on Foreign Relations and others. The \nadministration's responses include over 1,500 pages of information on \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention--over 300 pages of testimony, over 500 \npages of answers to Senate letters and reports, over 400 pages of \nanswers to Senate questions for the treaty record, and over 300 pages \nof additional documentation. During the August recess the White House \nheld a series of briefings for Senate staffers.\n  This coming Monday at 4 p.m. in S-407 senior administration officials \nwill meet with all Senators in S-407 to discuss the treaty. This will \nallow all Members an opportunity to assess first-hand the arguments for \nthe treaty and to raise any questions they have. I hope that any \nSenator with the slightest concern will avail him or herself of the \nchance to have concerns addressed directly.\n  As we prepare for formal consideration I thought it would be helpful \nto my fellow Members to consider a letter I received this afternoon \nfrom the President's Assistant for National Security Affairs, Anthony \nLake, addressing in detail some of the questions that have been raised \nregarding the treaty. The letter included an enclosure, a portion of \nwhich is classified, which is available in committee offices for \ninterested Members. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Lake's letter be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, there is no question that this convention \nenjoys the overwhelming support of the Nation's chemical industries. On \nAugust 29, I and other Senators received a letter strongly endorsing \nthe convention and arguing for Senate consent to ratification. This \nletter was authored by senior officials of a number of significant \ncorporations. I ask unanimous consent that the text of that letter also \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I look forward to the debate on the \nconvention when it comes before the Senate next week.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, September 5, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Pell: As we continue to prepare for the \n     Senate's floor debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     (CWC) two weeks from now, I want to share with you the basic \n     points we have made recently in responding to certain \n     concerns that have been raised by the Chairman of the Foreign \n     Relations Committee.\n       Senator Helms has questioned whether Russia will ever \n     ratify the CWC. As you are aware, the Russian Government has \n     formally stated its commitment to become a party to the CWC, \n     as recently as July 22 of this year at the Plenary meeting of \n     the CWC Preparatory Commission (PrepCom) in The Hague. In \n     this same statement, the Russian Government announced that it \n     is seeking the speedy submission of the Convention to the \n     Russian parliament for ratification.\n       In my view, the recent Russian statement in The Hague, \n     which mentioned the issue of entry into force, does not \n     reflect an intention to distance Russia from the CWC, but \n     rather a concern about being left behind. In these \n     circumstances, I believe that the best way to promote Russian \n     ratification is to proceed with our own ratification, as has \n     been done by all of our major NATO allies and many others, \n     and to bring the CWC into force as soon as possible while, at \n     the same time, trying to address Russian concerns in a manner \n     consistent with our own interests.\n       We have forthrightly told the Russians that we believe that \n     prompt entry into force of the Convention is crucial to the \n     fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction and \n     the fight against terrorism. Consequently, we have informed \n     them that we are moving forward with our own ratification and \n     have urged that they continue to proceed ahead with their \n     effort as well.\n       The Russians have clearly stated that the central problem \n     they face regarding the CWC is financing the cost of their CW \n     destruction program. While requesting international \n     assistance, the Russians have also made it clear, most \n     recently in their Plenary Statement in The Hague, that the \n     program will be financed primarily by Russia itself. We and \n     other countries have indicated our willingness to address \n     this outstanding concern on an expedited basis, but we have \n     continued to underscore to the Russians that CW destruction \n     is primarily their responsibility and that any U.S. \n     assistance is contingent upon approval by the U.S. Congress.\n       Senator Helms has also raised concerns with regard to the \n     1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement (BDA). The Russian \n     Federation, as you know, has long expressed concerns about \n     certain aspects of this agreement and has not agreed to \n     detailed implementing procedures and updated provisions to \n     finalize the BDA. We continue to press the Russians at the \n     highest levels on the need to resolve the outstanding CW \n     issues, and they agreed to a meeting with ACDA Director \n     Holum, which was held on August 10. They also agreed to host \n     a visit to Volgograd later this fall to address specifically \n     the issue of conversion of production facilities. While the \n     Russians have stated that they believe that the bilateral \n     agreements between Russia and the United States have \n     fulfilled their useful role, they have also stated that they \n     will not renege on the agreements they have made.\n       As for the Chairman's specific concerns about the possible \n     consequences of Russian withdrawal from the BDA, I would \n     point out that if the BDA is not in force when the CWC is \n     implemented, Russian chemical weapons elimination will still \n     be subject to systematic verification under the CWC, although \n     that would be performed by the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), instead of the United \n     States. It is important to remember that, in contrast to the \n     CWC, the BDA does not require total destruction of CW stocks \n     nor does it provide a multilateral framework including \n     challenge inspections for addressing compliance concerns. As \n     you may recall, the President informed the Senate in 1993 in \n     transmittal of the CWC that, while the BDA was an important \n     agreement in its own right, it has become less relevant than \n     it was in 1990 because the CWC has been completed and that \n     final agreement on the BDA should not delay submission of the \n     CWC to the Senate.\n       Some have the impression that Russia is ``withdrawing'' \n     from the 1989 Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding. This \n     agreement has been implemented in two phases. During the \n     first phase, the two sides exchanged general information on \n     their chemical weapons stockpiles and production and storage \n     facilities and carried out reciprocal visits to relevant \n     military and civilian facilities. During the second phase, \n     the two sides exchanged the detailed information on their \n     stockpiles and chemical weapons facilities and carried out a \n     number of inspections at declared chemical weapons \n     production, storage and development facilities, including \n     challenge inspections of such facilities.\n       While Russia has met its obligations to participate in \n     implementation activities under the Memorandum of \n     Understanding, questions remain regarding certain aspects of \n     the Russian data. We are continuing to press the Russians at \n     the highest levels on the need to resolve these outstanding \n     CW issues.\n       In any case, I have stressed to Senator Helms that the \n     Administration is prepared to actively pursue concerns \n     regarding the veracity of any State Party's reporting under\n\n[[Page S9959]]\n\n     the CWC, since the provision of accurate declaration \n     information is a fundamental obligation essential to the \n     effective implementation of the Convention. The \n     Administration also continues to believe that prompt entry \n     into force of the CWC will provide the necessary tools to \n     deal effectively with these issues, including a basis for \n     punitive measures or sanctions in response to noncompliance.\n       Finally, we have carefully considered the Chairman's \n     request for declassification of any documents and cables \n     pertaining to bilateral discussions with Russia. As you know, \n     it is our standard practice to make relevant classified \n     information available to the Senate through classified \n     briefings and reports. The Administration has provided the \n     Senate with numerous briefings and reports of this sort since \n     November 23, 1993, when the President submitted the CWC with \n     a request for its prompt consideration. I informed Senator \n     Helms that I regretted that we cannot declassify the \n     requested documents, because they have been properly \n     classified pursuant to E.O. 12958 and because disclosure of \n     the information they contain could seriously undermine \n     ongoing diplomatic activities. The Administration is eager, \n     however, to assist the Senate in developing a complete record \n     for its consideration prior to floor action on the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention, as stated in the June 28, 1996 unanimous \n     consent agreement pertaining to the Convention. Therefore, I \n     made clear to the Chairman that we are prepared to make \n     appropriate officials available to Senators and cleared staff \n     to brief on those documents under appropriate classification \n     at the earliest date.\n       We look forward to Senate advice and consent to the CWC by \n     September 14. Enclosed please find the detailed answers we \n     provided the Chairman in response to the questions he had \n     recently raised.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Anthony Lake,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                  August 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pell: The undersigned senior executives of \n     chemical companies urge your vote in support of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention (CWC), and quick Senate action on \n     legislation to implement this important treaty.\n       The chemical industry has long supported the CWC. Our \n     industry participated in negotiating the agreement, and in \n     U.S. and international implementation efforts. The treaty \n     contains substantial protections for confidential business \n     information (CBI). We know, because industry helped to draft \n     the CBI provisions. Chemical companies also help test the \n     draft CWC reporting system, and we tested the on-site \n     inspection procedures that will help verify compliance with \n     the treaty. In short, our industry has thoroughly examined \n     and tested this Convention. We have concluded that the \n     benefits of the CWC far outweigh the costs.\n       Indeed, the real price to pay would come from not ratifying \n     the CWC. The treaty calls for strict restrictions on trade \n     with nations which are not party to the Convention. The \n     chemical industry is America's largest export industry, \n     posting $60 billion in export sales last year. But our \n     industry's status as the world's preferred supplier of \n     chemical products may be jeopardized if the U.S. does not \n     ratify the Convention. If the Senate does not vote in favor \n     of the CWC, we stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in overseas sales, putting at risk thousands of good-paying \n     American jobs.\n       The U.S. chemical industry has spent more than 15 years \n     working on this agreement, and we long ago decided that \n     ratifying the CWC is the right thing to do.\n       We urge you to vote in support of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n           Sincerely,\n         J.

Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues in \nthe Senate of another case where a foreign government is punishing an \nAmerican company for no legitimate reason. The United States must stand \nup against such actions by foreign governments and end such unfair and \nunwarranted treatment of our citizens.\n  Some years ago, two of my constituents, Bill and Allan MacDonald, \nrespected businessmen in Alabama and the United States, invested in \nBermuda's struggling cable television system. The MacDonalds were \nencouraged to make their initial investment by the Bermudian Government \nbecause of the poor state of the cable television system. The \nMacDonalds devoted not only sizeable amounts of time and energy to this \neffort, but they also invested sizeable amounts of their own money to \nupgrade the cable television system.\n  Contrary to the expectations of some Bermudians, the MacDonalds \nturned the company around and the company began making money. As soon \nas the business began to do well, some Bermudians began to try to wrest \nthe business away from the MacDonalds. These Bermudian citizens, with \nthe help of their Government, are determined to take control of the \ncompany away from the MacDonalds now that the company is doing well. My \nquestion to the Senate today is: Will the U.S. Government let this \nhappen?\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Government and the State Department in \nparticular must do a better job of protecting U.S. businesses operating \nabroad. We must make sure that foreign countries know that we will not \ntolerate unfair trade practices against American companies or citizens.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if we can get the Bermudian Government \nto treat the MacDonalds fairly, but one thing we can do is make sure \nthat Bermudian companies do not receive more favorable treatment in the \nUnited States than United States companies receive in Bermuda. It is my \nunderstanding that a Bermudian company, Telebermuda, has applied for a \ngeneral landing license to the Federal Communications Commission [FCC]. \nUnder U.S. law the FCC may not grant such a license without the \napproval of the\n\n[[Page S9960]]\n\nSecretary of State. In addition, this same law states that ``the \nPresident [FCC] may withhold * * * such license when he shall be \nsatisfied after notice and hearings that such action will assist . . . \nin maintaining the rights or interests of the United States or of its \ncitizens in foreign countries * * * .'' I have requested the Secretary \nof State to withhold his approval of Telebermuda's license application, \nuntil the case involving my constituents is resolved.\n  Mr. President, this case is not only important to my constituents, it \nis important for all businesses who operate overseas. It is our duty to \nensure that they are treated fairly. We cannot allow foreign \ngovernments to take advantage of U.S. businesses. If the Bermudian \ntelephone monopoly or other Bermudian interests want to buy the \nMacDonalds interest in Bermuda Cable they should pay the fair market \nprice for the MacDonalds interest in the company. Mr. President, I am \nnot asking for special treatment for the MacDonalds, but I believe they \nare entitled to receive justice.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Bermudian Government will reexamine \nthis situation involving my constituents and determine that it is in \ntheir best interest to treat all businesses fairly and not punish \npeople because they are from the United States or other foreign \ncountries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9959-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEM\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

This has to do with the transition \n     of computer programs from the 20th to the 21st century.\n       The main computer languages from the '50s and '60s such as \n     COBOL, Fortran, and Assembler were designed to minimize \n     consumption of computer memory by employing date fields \n     providing for only six digits. The date of this letter in \n     ``computerese,'' for example, is 96-07-31. The century \n     designation ``19'' is assumed.\n       The problem is that many computer programs will read \n     January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900. Computer programs will \n     not recognize the 21st century without a massive rewriting of \n     computer codes.\n       I first learned of all this in February and requested a \n     study by the Congressional Research Service. The study, just \n     now completed, substantiates the worst fears of the \n     doomsayers. (A copy of the CRS study is attached.) The Year \n     2000 problem (``Y2K'') is worldwide. Each line of computer \n     code needs to be analyzed and either passed on or be \n     rewritten. The banking system is particularly vulnerable. A \n     money center bank may have 500 million lines of code to be \n     revised at a cost of $1 per line. That's a $500 million \n     problem. (I learn from Lanny Davis that his client, the Mars \n     Company, estimates the cost of becoming Y2K date compliant at \n     $100 million to $200 million. Mars is only a candy company.) \n     One would expect that a quick fix of the problem would have \n     been found but it hasn't happened and the experts tell me it \n     is not likely.\n       There are three issues. First, the cost of reviewing and \n     rewriting codes for Federal and state governments which will \n     range in the billions of dollars over the next three years. \n     Second, the question of whether there is time enough to get \n     the job done and, if not, what sort of triage we may need. I \n     am particularly concerned about the IRS and Social Security \n     in this respect. Third, the question of what happens to the \n     economy if the problem is not resolved by mid-1999? Are \n     corporations and consumers not likely to withhold spending \n     decisions and possibly even withdraw funds from banks if they \n     fear the economy is facing chaos?\n       I have a recommendation. A Presidential aide should be \n     appointed to take responsibility for assuring that all \n     Federal agencies including the military be Y2K date compliant \n     by January 1, 1999 and that all commercial and industrial \n     firms doing business with the Federal government also be \n     compliant by that date. I am advised that the Pentagon is \n     further ahead on the curve here than any of the Federal \n     agencies. You may wish to turn to the military to take \n     command of dealing with the problem.\n       The computer has been a blessing; if we don't act quickly, \n     however, it could become the curse of the age.\n           Respectfully,\n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    The Year 2000 Computer Challenge\n\n                         (By Richard M. Nunno)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Most computer systems in use today can only record dates in \n     a two-digit format for the year. Under this system, computers \n     will fail to operate properly when years after 1999 are used, \n     because the year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900. This \n     problem could have a serious impact on a wide range of \n     activities that use computers. Information systems must be \n     inspected, and modified, if necessary, before January 1, 2000 \n     to avoid major system malfunctions.\n       Many managers initially doubted the seriousness of this \n     problem, assuming that an easy technical fix would be \n     developed. Several independent research firms, however, have \n     refuted this view, with the conclusion that inspecting all \n     computer systems and converting date fields where necessary \n     and then testing modified software will be a very time-\n     consuming and costly task. Research firms predict that due to \n     a lack of time and resources, the majority of U.S. businesses \n     and government agencies will likely not fix all of their \n     computer systems by the start of the new millennium.\n       Most agencies and businesses have come to understand the \n     difficulties involved, although some have not yet started \n     implementing changes. Several companies have emerged offering \n     services to work on the year-2000 conversion, and software \n     analysis products are commercially available to assist with \n     finding and converting flawed software code. Even with the \n     assistance of these products, however, most of the work will \n     still have to be done by humans.\n       Federal agencies are generally aware of the year-2000 \n     challenge and most are working to correct it. Agencies that \n     manage vast databases, conduct massive monetary transactions, \n     or interact extensively with other computer systems, face the \n     greatest challenge. An interagency committee has been \n     established to raise awareness of the year-2000 challenge and \n     facilitate federal efforts at solving it. The interagency \n     committee has initiated several actions, such as requiring \n     vendor software listed in future federal procurement \n     schedules to be year-2000 compliant and specifying four-digit \n     year fields for federal computers. The shortage of time to \n     complete year-2000 computer changes may force agencies to \n     prioritize their systems. Agencies may also need to shift \n     resources from other projects to work on year-2000 efforts. \n     State and local governments, as well as foreign \n     organizations, will also have significant year-2000 \n     conversion problems.\n       Congressional hearings have been held recently to \n     investigate the year-2000 challenge, and a legislative \n     provision was introduced directing the Defense Department to \n     assess the risk to its systems resulting from it. Several \n     options exist for congressional consideration. One option is \n     to provide special funding to federal agencies for year-2000 \n     conversion. While agencies are reluctant to request \n     additional funds, some observers contend this may be \n     necessary. Another option is to give agencies increased \n     autonomy in reprogramming appropriated funds for year-2000 \n     efforts. A third, less controversial alternative is to \n     continue to raise public awareness through hearings and by \n     overseeing federal efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9960-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the vitally \nimportant issue of aviation security challenges. Last month, the \nCommerce Committee which I chair held an open hearing to examine \naviation security. Later this month, we will hold a closed hearing to \nfurther consider this vitally important issue.\n  At the outset, let me stress that the United States continues to have \nthe\n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\nbest aviation safety record in the world. Every day, 1.5 million people \nfly commercially in the United States and we have a marvelous record of \ngetting passengers safely to their destinations. Regrettably, however, \nrecent incidents have caused the traveling public great anxiety. It is \nour responsibility to help reassure the public of our superb air safety \nrecord.\n  Impressive as U.S. aviation safety statistics are, we cannot rest on \nour laurels. Statistics are no comfort to a family which has lost a \nloved one or friend in an aviation tragedy. On a bipartisan basis, \nCongress and the administration must constantly strive to do better in \nthe area of aviation safety. In fact, I believe we must rededicate \nourselves to the goal of zero aviation accidents, whether caused by \nsafety lapses, security breaches, or other factors.\n  Today, I would like to briefly discuss three points.\n  First, it is imperative that Congress and the administration resist \nthe temptation to rush to embrace any simple solution to the very \ncomplex aviation security challenges we face. Rather, an effective \naviation security program depends on a number of components working \ntogether in a coordinated manner to form a virtual security net \nprotecting the traveling public. These elements include: the collection \nof intelligence information used to identify potential threats; \ncoordination of efforts by law enforcement agencies to interdict \nthreats; human factors including effective passenger screening; and \ntechnology. As is the case with any system, aviation security is only \nas strong as the weakest link in the security chain.\n  Each of these components needs to be improved. In the areas of \ntechnology and human factors, there is vast room for improvement. \nSimply put, we can do a better job protecting the traveling public. We \nmust do a better job.\n  In recent weeks the aviation security debate has understandably \nfocused on the lack of explosive detection capability in our Nation's \nairports. This focus is well placed. After all, in 1990 Congress \nrecognized explosive detection systems needed to be installed in our \nairports and directed FAA to mandate deployment of such systems by \nNovember 1993. Yet today--nearly 6 years later and after the Federal \nAviation Administration [FAA] has spent more than $150 million in \ntaxpayer money on explosive detection research--our airports continue \nto lack the capability to screen checked baggage for explosives. To \nmake matters worse, our airports stand out as soft targets for aviation \nterrorism because many airports around the world already have put in \nplace U.S.-manufactured explosive detection devices as part of their \nheightened security measures.\n  While I am pleased we are finally field testing a FAA-certified \nexplosive detection system, the current absence of explosive detection \ncapability in our airports raises a fundamental policy question: Should \nCongress require interim deployment of existing explosive detection \ndevices until a FAA-certified explosive detection system successfully \ncompletes operational testing and is available in sufficient quantities \nto be deployed at least in our highest risk airports? I strongly \nbelieve the answer is yes. We should take a very hard look at those \nU.S.-manufactured bulk and trace explosive detection devices which \ncurrently are widely used around the world.\n\n  Tempting as it is, however, I hope the aviation security debate does \nnot continue to be transfixed on technology. For instance, I am equally \nconcerned about the shortcomings in so-called aviation security human \nfactors. Passenger screening personnel are our most visible line of \ndefense at airports. Unfortunately, all too often they are inadequately \ntrained and suffer from a very high rate of turnover. Currently, \ncompanies hired by airlines to provide screening services at our \nNation's airports are not subject to any certification requirement. \nSimilarly, screening personnel are not required to be certified. We \nshould carefully consider whether such certification requirements would \nprovide the quality control assurance we expect and the traveling \npublic deserves. At the same time, Congress should not overlook \nmeasures that should be taken to strengthen the intelligence gathering \nand enforcement elements of our aviation security system.\n  As the aviation security debate continues, our goal should be nothing \nless than improving every component of our security system and ensuring \nwe have no weak links.\n  Second, Congress and the administration must be very cautious to \navoid a ``one size fits all'' approach to aviation security policy. The \nsecurity challenges faced by small airlines and small airports are \ntruly unique. They differ markedly from those faced by international \ncarriers and major hub airports. Accordingly, it is critically \nimportant these differences are not overlooked in a rush to heighten \naviation security standards.\n  Earlier this year, the U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO] released \na study I requested which found that many small communities across the \ncountry currently suffer from inadequate air service. Having just \nreturned from my home State of South Dakota where maintaining adequate \nair service is a day-to-day struggle, I can report from the front lines \nthat GAO is absolutely correct. Even where a small community is lucky \nenough to have air service, often that service is economically fragile. \nEven a small economic shock can sever a community's only remaining air \nservice link to our national air service network.\n  Passengers traveling to and from small cities must have the same \nlevel of security as those traveling to and from large hub airports. I \nbelieve, however, there are thoughtful ways of accomplishing this goal \nwithout toppling this fragile economic balance. For instance, is it \ngood policy to force a small community like Mitchell, SD, which had \njust 34 commercial boardings in July to install at its airport a CTX-\n5000 explosive detection machine costing $1 million? How about \nBrookings, SD, and Yankton, SD, which in July had 104 and 112 boardings \nrespectively? I believe the answer clearly is no, particularly since \nhand searching of selected luggage at our small airports is a viable, \ncost-effective and common sense alternative.\n  Unfortunately, this kind of ``one size fits all'' approach was \nembraced by the House last month when it adopted Section 111 of the \nAviation Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1996 which calls for new, \ncostly security measures to be imposed on small airlines. I have no \ndoubt this is a well-intentioned provision. However, it fails to \nrecognize FAA's ongoing assessment of the threat faced by small \nairlines and the unique security needs of passengers traveling on such \ncarriers. One thing is certain--this expensive, unfunded mandate likely \nwould cause a further erosion of air service in our small cities and \nthat is why I will oppose it in the Senate.\n  Before I move on to my final point, let me reiterate that persons \ntraveling to and from small communities deserve the same level of \nsecurity as those traveling in larger markets. Due to profound \ndifferences in both passenger numbers and in threat levels, however, we \ncan meet this goal without resorting to the identical, very expensive \nmeasures called for in our major international hub airports. Continued \nair service to many small communities depends on an appreciation of \nthis simple, but critically important, point.\n  The final point I wish to discuss today is that the enormous \npotential cost of security upgrades requires that heightened security \nmeasures be based on the philosophy of focussing limited resources on \nthe most threatening passengers and cargo. For that reason, I have \nadvocated the use of passenger profiling as the ideal way to weed out \nnon-threatening passengers and thereby enabling airlines to target \nsecurity resources more effectively. I stressed this point in the \nCommerce Committee's aviation security hearing last month and want to \nreemphasize it today.\n  As in the case of explosive detection systems, the problem in the \nUnited States is not developing sophisticated weapons to fight aviation \nterrorism, the problem is deploying them. Passenger profiling is \nanother case in point. While countries with highly regarded aviation \nsecurity systems such as Israel and the Netherlands put great emphasis \non passenger profiling, thus far we have failed to follow their lead. \nWhat makes this so remarkable is U.S. carriers have long recognized the \nsecurity benefits of passenger profiling and\n\n[[Page S9962]]\n\nNorthwest Airlines, in close cooperation with the FAA, recently \ndeveloped perhaps the most sophisticated automated profiling system \navailable. I am very pleased that FAA is working closely with Northwest \nto put the finishing touches on this system and to make it available to \nother airlines as soon as possible.\n  In my view, using passenger profiling as the bedrock of any aviation \nsecurity system is good common sense policy. This is especially the \ncase when one considers the cost of explosive detection systems, the \nlimited space available in many of our airports for such systems, and \nthe commercial need for our airlines to avoid unnecessary ground \ndelays. An increased reliance on passenger profiling as the first step \nin assessing passenger threats makes perfect sense. It can help make an \noverall aviation security program effective, quick and efficient for \nthe traveling public. At the same time, it can help make heightened \nsecurity measures cost-effective and operationally viable for our \nairlines.\n  Is passenger profiling a flawless or foolproof piece to our aviation \nsecurity puzzle? No. Short of grounding all airplanes, no perfect \nsolution exists. However, automated passenger profiling holds great \npromise as a key part of an integrated aviation security system. For \ninstance, Northwest's system looks at more than 100 criteria for each \npassenger and--based on a ranking system and parameters that can be \nflexibly set based on perceived threats in any market--calculates which \npassengers should receive special security attention. Although no \nsystem can predict human behavior with 100 percent accuracy, this \nsystem appears to hold the promise of helping to allocate security \nresources with a very high probability of certainty.\n  In addition, I am sensitive to the concerns some have raised about \nthe constitutional implications of passenger profiling. While much has \nbeen written about potential economic costs of heightened aviation \nsecurity measures, inevitably there will be civil liberties costs as \nwell. As with economic considerations, we must balance costs and \nbenefits. Considering that passenger profiling looks at an enormous \nnumber of varied factors, I believe any civil liberties costs resulting \nfrom passenger profiling will be very minimal compared to the \nsignificant social benefits resulting from minimizing public anxiety \nabout the security of air travel.\n  Let me conclude by reiterating that we can, and we must, do a better \njob in aviation security. If Congress, the administration, airlines and \nairports work cooperatively in the spirit of making every component of \nour security system as strong as possible, I have no doubt we will meet \nthis challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9960-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LORET MILLER RUPPE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Loret Miller Ruppe, \na woman of uncompromising dedication for peace at home and abroad, who \ndied at the age of 60. In addition to her remarkable career as the \nDirector of the Peace Corps from 1981 to 1989 and Ambassador to Norway \nfrom 1989 to 1993, Loret Miller Ruppe was a beloved wife to former Rep. \nPhilip Ruppe (R-Mich), mother of five daughters, sister to six \nsiblings, and grandmother of three.\n  Her accomplishments were vast and far reaching, her constitution \nstrong, and her character was humble yet filled with passion. Her main \npassion was for peace. She struggled relentlessly to promote peace and \njustice throughout the developing world and here at home. In a speech \ncelebrating the 35th Anniversary of the Peace Corps Mrs. Ruppe spoke \nabout the future of the organization and its mission, ``Peace, that \nbeautiful five-letter word we all say we crave and pray for, is up for \ngrabs in the '90's.'' For her, peace was not simply the absence of war, \nbut the absence of the conditions that bring on war such as hunger, \ndisease, poverty, illiteracy, and despair. Mrs. Ruppe worked hard to \nprotect the fragile state of peace in regions around the globe. She \nachieved this goal through supervising programs in more than 93 \ncountries, serving as a role model to field volunteers, and \nstrengthening the Peace Corps organization.\n  Mrs. Ruppe also fought battles at home. When President Reagan \nappointed her in 1981, the Peace Corps budget was rapidly declining and \nwas less than that of the military marching bands. By the end of Mrs. \nRuppe's tenure she had succeeded in increasing the agency's budget \nalmost 50 percent. In addition to budgetary challenges, Mrs. Ruppe gave \nthe agency a political facelift by projecting the agency as non-\npartisan, despite the fact that she herself was a political appointee, \nand increasing its viability on both national and local levels. As she \nnoted ``We took Peace Corps out of the pit of politics and made it non-\npartisan. It must always signify Americans pulling together for \npeace.'' As a result of her efforts, Mrs. Ruppe was respected and \nadmired by Democrats and Republicans alike. In terms of national \nvisibility, she brought much needed congressional and executive level \nattention to the Peace Corps. Prior to her leadership the organization \nwas nicknamed ``the corpse'' and many believed its end was near. Under \nher command however, the organization was revitalized and its future \nsecured. On a local level, she worked hard to increase young Americans' \ninterest in participating in the program. By 1989, she had raised the \nnumber of volunteers by 20 percent.\n  Mrs. Ruppe was also an initiator who maintained the simple motto ``we \ncan do it.'' She founded three important programs which continue to \nthrive today: The African Food Initiative, Women in Development, and \nthe Leadership for Peace Program. Additionally, she brought seven new \ncountries to the Peace Corps program.\n  As the longest tenured director of the Peace Corps, Mrs. Ruppe \ncontributed much indeed to the organization. It was through her vision, \ndedication, and leadership that the Peace Corps continues to play a \nvital role in American foreign aid efforts. Under Mrs. Ruppe's \nleadership the organization responded to new challenges, transformed \nitself, and now stands prepared to continue promoting peace in the next \ncentury. Mrs. Ruppe's absence will be felt throughout the world. I will \nespecially miss her. To me Loret was more than a dedicated and gifted \npublic servant--she was my friend. I know her husband Philip, her \ndaughters Antoinette, Adele, Katherine, Mary, and Loret will miss her \nvery much, and so will I.\n  Mr. President, I know that all of our colleagues join with me in \nextending our sincere condolences to her family members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9962-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     200TH BIRTHDAY OF LIBERTY HALL\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, during the August recess, 14 youngsters \nfrom Cranston, RI, achieved something that no Rhode Islanders had ever \nachieved before. On August 22, the Cranston\n\n[[Page S9963]]\n\nWestern Little League All-Stars were crowned the National Champions at \nthis year's Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA.\n  Mr. President, I know we are dealing with important matters here. But \nthis is an important matter also. This wonderful team of youngsters \nfrom our State first had to win the State championship. Then they went \nto the national championships in Williamsport where they defeated--can \nyou believe it--California 5 to 1. Three days later in front of 17,000 \nfans and a national television audience they defeated the team that had \npreviously defeated them, namely the heavily favored Panama City, FL, \nteam which put them into the world championship game. That was against \nChinese Taipei.\n  I think for anyone who follows the Little League baseball knows that \nthe Chinese Taipei team was always an outstanding one and, indeed, they \ndid win against the Cranston Western All-Stars.\n  This was truly an amazing accomplishment. When Cranston Western \nstarted down this road, it was just one of several thousand teams \nacross the country vying for the right to play for the world \nchampionship. To get into the World Series, it had to win three mini-\ntournaments against the best teams in Rhode Island, and then in the \nNortheast, over the course of 2 months.\n  Listen to some of these last-minute heroics. It took a home run in \nthe tenth inning just to advance beyond the district playoffs. Then \nthey had to win three straight games, including two in a row over a \npreviously undefeated South Kingstown team, to stave off elimination in \nthe State tournament. And in the final game of the East Regionals, \nCranston Western needed a game-saving, diving catch by their left \nfielder, and then a three-run homer in the bottom of the seventh, to \novercome a tough Pennsylvania squad.\n\n  Once they got to Williamsport, the job only got tougher. History \ncertainly was not on their side. Indeed, Cranston Western was only the \nthird team from Rhode Island to make it to the Little League World \nSeries, and the first to do so since 1980. And in neither of those two \ncases did a Rhode Island team win a single game at the national level. \nWhat's more, in the first game, they had to face California--a State \nthat had produced 5 World Series champions and had been represented in \nthe tournament a record 32 times.\n  But these courageous, young Rhode Islanders proved their mettle. They \nshook off any butterflies they might have had, and defeated the \nCalifornians by a 5 to 1 score. Three days later, in front of 17,000 \nfans and a national television audience, they avenged an earlier loss \nto heavily favored Panama City, FL. That win put them in the world \nchampionship game.\n  Unfortunately, Cranston Western came up short in the World Series \nfinal against Chinese Taipei. But that loss in no way diminished what \nthese boys from the city of Cranston accomplished. They were front page \nnews in Rhode Island for a solid week. Nearly every television in the \nState--whether in private homes or restaurants--was tuned to the final \ngame. And when they returned home they received a hero's welcome, \ncomplete with a police escort from the Connecticut border and a \nfireworks display in their hometown.\n  What did these boys learn from their experience this summer? I can \nthink of three things.\n  First, they learned that you don't have to be the biggest, or the \nstrongest, or even the most-talented to succeed in life. While those \nattributes are important, they're meaningless without heart, grit, and \nfierce determination. And Cranston Western led the pack in those three \ncategories.\n  Second, they learned that practice really does make perfect. \nThroughout the summer, the team spent nearly every waking moment on the \nbaseball diamond, whether it was at official practices or playing pick-\nup games. Moreover, at the beginning of their championship run, every \nplayer made a commitment to the team not to miss a single practice. And \neach one of them lived up to that commitment.\n  Third, and I believe most importantly, they learned to place a high \nvalue on teamwork. No single player could be counted on to carry the \nload alone. Each member of that team made a crucial contribution at one \npoint or another. That's a critical lesson I hope these little leaguers \nwill remember for the rest of their lives.\n  And Mr. President, as I'm sure they would tell you, these boys had a \nlot of help along the way. There was their very capable manager, Mike \nVarrato. He was the one who set the lineup, arranged the defense, and \nmade sure the team was physically and mentally ready to play every day.\n  They had veteran coaches Nick Dinezza and Larry Lepore. These two men \nhelped the pitchers with their location, threw batting practice, and \nhit hundreds, if not thousands, of ground balls to the infielders and \nfly balls to the outfielders. There's no doubt that on many occasions, \nthe coaches went home more tired than the young ballplayers.\n  And, of course, there were the parents. You've never seen a more \nloyal group. They scheduled family meals around games and practices. \nThey gave up summer vacations at the beach to follow their sons from \none venue to the next. During the games, they rang cowbells, and banged \npots and pans, and did whatever it took to rally the troops. They \ncheered mightily when their boys won, and hugged them and reassured \nthem the few times that they lost. And I'm sure they never hesitated to \nvoice their opinions whenever the umpires made a bad call.\n  And so, I want to offer my heartiest congratulations to the members \nof the Cranston Western Little League team, and all who were associated \nwith their championship season. They stirred an enormous amount of \npride in Rhode Island, and made for a very exciting August in our \nState.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the team roster \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Cranston Western Little League All-Stars--1996 Little League National \n                               Champions\n\n       Lucas Ashton; Jake Bazirgan; Brett Bell; Lew Colby; Evan \n     Dizoglio; Chris Gallo; Matt Lovejoy; Michael Luke; Tom \n     Michael; Jay Sparling; Peter Spinelli; Craig Stinson; Rick \n     Stoddard; and Paul Tavarozzi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9962-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9963-S9965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NOTE\n\n  [In yesterday's Record beginning on page S9829, a colloquy between \nSenators Craig, Bond, and Inhofe appears with material omitted. The \npermanent Record has been corrected to reflect the following.]\n\n\n                        particulates rulemaking\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. If I might ask the distinguished chairman of the \nSubcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations about \nthe EPA review of the national ambient air quality standard for \nparticulate matter. I understand that there are recent epidemiological \nstudies that indicate a correlation between exposure to air polluted \nwith particulates and adverse human health effects, and that EPA is \nstudying this matter as a high priority.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Idaho for raising this important \npoint. The EPA has indicated to our committee that it is highly \nconcerned about the health effects of particulates. We have met the \nEPA's request for funding for this program, and included $18.8 million. \nThese funds are for health effects research, exposure research, \nimproving monitoring technologies, modeling studies, and other key \nrequirements.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am pleased to learn that the committee has directed this \nlevel of funding to EPA for this important research. This comprehensive \nresearch program is very much needed. At present, there appears to be \ninsufficient data available for the agency to decide what changes, if \nany, should be made to the current standard. There is no scientific \nconsensus on whether it is necessary to change the current ambient air \nquality standards for particulate matter to protect human and \nenvironmental health. It has come to my attention that in a letter to \nEPA on June 13, 1996, EPA's own Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee \nconcluded that ``our understanding of the health effects of \n[particulates] is far from complete,'' and these scientific \nuncertainties prevented the committee from agreeing on the agency's \nsuggested new particulate standards. In addition, the former chairman \nof this advisory committee who is now a consultant to the advisory \ncommittee, Roger McClellan,\n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\nwrote the current chairman in May to advise him that ``the current \nstaff document does not provide a scientifically adequate basis for \nmaking regulatory decisions for setting of National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards and related control of particulate matter as specified in the \nClean Air Act.'' Finally, in a peer-reviewed article just published in \nthe Journal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, \nscientists John Gamble and Jeffery Lewis conclude that the recent \nepidemiology studies that show statistically significant acute health \neffects of particulate air pollution do not meet the criteria for \ncausality. They suggest that the weak statistical correlations of \nincreased mortality are as likely due to confounding by \nweather, copollutants, or exposure misclassification as they are by \nambient particulate matter.\n\n  As the chairman is aware, EPA is under a Federal court order to make \na final decision on whether to revise the current clean air rule \nregarding particulate matter. Under the court order, EPA must make a \nproposed decision on or before November 29, 1996, and a final decision \non or before June 28, 1997. Can the Chairman inform me whether the \ncourt order allows the agency to decide not to revise the particular \nstandard until there is sufficient scientific basis for doing so?\n  Mr. BOND. It is my understanding that the court order only requires \nthe agency to make a final decision on whether to revise the current \nambient air standard for particulates, but the order does not require \nthe agency to promulgate a new standard.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. If I might interject, the fact that EPA has found \nseveral studies that indicate a correlation between loading of \nparticulates in the air and premature mortality is important. This \nsuggested link to human health problems needs to be promptly and \nthoroughly investigated. My objective is to provide protection of \npublic health and the environment by designing control strategies that \nreduce harmful particulates and other pollutants from the air people \nbreathe. However, I am concerned that EPA may be rushed to judgment by \nthe Federal courts before real science has been developed to inform the \nagency about which pariculates, in which geographic locations, and in \nwhich concentrations are harming people and the environment. There are \nmany questions that need to be answered about particulate matter, as \nEPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, referred to as \n``CASAC,'' made clear in its June 13, 1996, letter to EPA--to which the \nSenator from Idaho just referred. For example, we do not know the \nmechanisms by which particulates might affect public health. Since \n1988, particulate matter concentrations have declined by more than 20 \npercent, with substantial future declines in particulates expected to \nresult from compliance with existing clean air standards. Moving \nforward with the targeted research program recommended by the CASAC is \nessential to understand the health problems associated with \nparticulates. That better understanding of the health effects caused by \nparticulates is needed before we can design an effective control \nstrategy. I would note for my colleagues that this EPA advisory \ncommittee is meeting again in early September to design this \nparticulate research program.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator would yield, I would ask the chairman that \nif EPA is only going to begin to implement the CASAC research program \nin October of this year, how can it be expected to issue a proposed \nrule on November 29, as required under the court order?\n  Mr. INHOFE. If I might add an additional comment to address the \nSenator from Idaho's question, I want to assure my colleagues that I \nshare their concern that there is evidence of potential harm to \nAmericans from exposure to fine particles. I want to know what kinds of \nparticulates cause health problems. And I want to know where those \nparticulates are and what are the best ways to reduce them.\n  I would note for the Senator from Idaho that the chairman of the \nsubcommittee stated earlier the court order does not require the EPA to \npropose a change in the particulate standard. The EPA can satisfy its \nobligations by proposing not to change the particulate standard until \nthere is a better understanding about which particulates cause health \neffects, and where those particulates are prevalent in unhealthful \nlevels. I would like to add that the Clinton Administration's Executive \nOrder or Regulatory Review states the Administration's own regulatory \nphilosophy as requiring agencies that are deciding whether and how to \nregulate must ``assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory \nalternatives, including the alternative of not regulating.'' I believe \nthe only prudent course would be for EPA to include consideration of \nretaining the current particulate standard in its proposed rule. In \nfollowing this path, progress will continue to be made by the ongoing \nimplementation of the existing Clean Air Act while the necessary \nresearch is being conducted to address the unanswered questions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I agree with my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma. I \ndo not want the people in our states breathing unhealthy air. I applaud \nand fully support the funding provided by the Senator from Missouri's \ncommittee for particulate research. I just don't think it makes much \nsense to promulgate new standards until you know what particles are \nunhealthy. It is my understanding that rural fugitive dust might be \nfurther regulated by the EPA when it issues its new particulate \nstandards. Idaho, and I believe, my colleague's State of Oklahoma, are \nrenowned for the volumes of fine, natural dirt that are carried by our \nbreezes out West. Even without winds, just driving down a road, tilling \na field, running cattle, sanding roads in the winter, or the gentlest \nof mining operations, will create dust. If dust is unhealthy, I'm sure \nthe hard working people of my state will want to know about it, and \nwould want to take measures to protect themselves. So I look forward to \nthe CASAC's targeted study to be implemented before the rural fugitive \ndust standards are changed.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. If the chairman would yield, I would ask whether any \nof the money in the FY 1997 funding for particulate research will go to \nimplementing an ambient air quality and emissions monitoring program, \nand will EPA be placing the monitors, or simply telling the States to \ndo it? We want to know not just whether this expense will bring any \nhealth benefits, but also whether it will create serious unfunded \nmandates problem. I would ask the chairman if he would join me in \nrequesting that the EPA send the appropriate committees of Congress, \nwithin 90 days, a description of the monitoring program they will be \nimplementing and to what extent EPA will fund the cost of that program, \nand whether they intend to ask for additional funding in FY 1998.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, the agency has informed me that it will be using the \n1997 appropriation for both increased health effects research and, in \naddition, more than $2 million will be for initiating an emissions \nmonitoring program. In addition, it is my understanding EPA will be \nrequesting additional funds for monitoring in its FY98 budget \nsubmission. It is my expectation that the agency will request the funds \nnecessary to establish a thorough and scientifically defensible \nmonitoring program. I concur that EPA should send us a description of \ntheir proposed comprehensive monitoring program and a budget proposal.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I agree with my colleagues that EPA should \nseriously consider a ``no change'' option as part of its proposed \ndecision due by November 29. However, I would add that in view of the \npotential for harm to the public from particulates, a prudent option \nfor the November deadline would be to reaffirm the current ambient air \nstandard--and thus not disrupt ongoing programs--while moving \nexpeditiously to implement a sound research agenda upon which to base \nfuture decisions.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned that EPA must pay closer attention \nto the potential adverse impacts of changes to the particulates \nstandard on small businesses. I am aware that EPA is taking the \nposition that changes to the particulates standard do not impact small \nbusiness in terms of implicating the Regulatory Flexibility Act, \nbecause the EPA's standards do not create burdens on small business, it \nis the State implementation plan. As a primary author of the 1996 \namendments to the Regulatory Flexibility\n\n[[Page S9965]]\n\nAct, I strongly disagree with the agency's interpretation, and believe \nthat EPA agency should fully comply with the requirements imposed on \nFederal agencies by that act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9963-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9965-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING THE EMIGRATION LAWS AND POLICIES OF MONGOLIA--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 167\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies of \nMongolia as required by subsections 402(b) and 409(b) of title IV of \nthe Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``the Act'').

A bill to waive temporarily the Medicare enrollment \ncomposition rules for the Wellness Plan; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE WELLNESS PLAN WAIVER ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr President, today I rise along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, to introduce legislation which \nwill expand the number of health care choices available to residents of \nMichigan. This bill will provide Medicare beneficiaries in Michigan the \nopportunity to obtain health care from The Wellness Plan, a \nlongstanding, federally qualified health maintenance organization. The \nWellness Plan has been recognized by national leaders, including two \nformer Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services, as a \nmodel managed care plan. In addition, the Wellness Plan has made \nsignificant contributions to improving the health and well-being of its \nenrollees, many of whom are poor women and children, by decreasing \ninfant mortality, effectively reducing hypertension, and increasing \nmammography rates.\n  The Wellness Plan has been serving the Medicaid population for over \ntwo decades. It currently has 150,000 enrollees, 141,000 of whom are \nMedicaid, 12,000 commercial and 2,000 Medicare. Since 1993, the \nWellness Plan has had a health care prepayment plan contract with \nMedicare. However, technical changes enacted by Congress effective \nJanuary 1, 1996, had the unintended effect of preventing the Wellness \nPlan from enrolling additional Medicare beneficiaries under the HCPP \ncontract. The Wellness Plan is positioned to become a full Medicare \nrisk contractor but currently is precluded from doing so due to the 50/\n50 Medicare/Medicaid enrollment composition rule. It must be emphasized \nthat the Health Care Financing Administration supports the Wellness \nPlan receiving a plan-specific 50/50 waiver at this time.\n  Allowing Medicare beneficiaries to participate in this program \nrepresents a small, but important step toward fulfilling Congress' \ncommitment to improve the quality of this country's health care system. \nGiven that the Wellness Plan has an established record with respect to \nboth the Medicaid and Medicare programs, and that the Health Care \nFinancing Administration supports the Wellness Plan receiving a plan-\nspecific 50/50 waiver, I urge Congress to move this bill before the end \nof this session so that Michigan Medicare beneficiaries will once again \nhave the opportunity to participate in this plan beginning in 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 2057. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to make \npermanent the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs guarantee \nloans with adjustable rate mortgages; to the Committee on Veterans \nAffairs.\n\n\n  the va adjustable rate mortgage program reauthorization act of 1996\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Thurmond a bill to permanently reauthorize the VA \nAdjustable Rate Mortgage Program.\n  This program was created in the 102d Congress to guarantee adjustable \nrate mortgages for a 3-year period ending September 30, 1995. The \nprogram allowed a maximum of 1-percent increase annually with a 5-\npercent maximum increase on the interest rate over the life of the \nloan. These annual and lifetime caps are identical to those contained \nin the FHA Adjustable Rate Mortgage Program, which is a permanent \nprogram.\n  Adjustable rate mortgages have proven to be a valuable and essential \nhome mortgage financing tool for American families, particularly in \ntimes of rising interest rates. Adjustable rate mortgages allow \nborrowers to obtain home loans with interest rates below those required \nfor normal fixed interest rate loans.\n  During the 3-year period that the VA Adjustable Rate Mortgage Program \nwas in effect, large numbers of veterans took advantage of this \nfinancing tool, with 131,250 VA adjustable rate mortgages being \noriginated nationwide, totaling $14.9 billion. In Virginia alone, \n10,599 loans granted totaling over $1.2 billion. Over 58 percent of \nthese loans nationally were made to first-time home buyers.\n  The VA Home Loan Guaranty Program was created by the Congress in 1944 \nto ensure that veterans returning home from World War II would have an \nopportunity to achieve the American dream of owning a home. This \nbenefit was established for our veterans because their service to our \ncountry denied them the opportunity to save the necessary funds for a \ndown payment for a home or to establish a credit rating. The program \nhas since been extended to benefit all of the men and women who have \nserved their country honorably in the Armed Forces. Since the program's \ninception, 14.8 million loans totaling $515 billion have been made to \nveterans.\n  This bill simply guarantees that the home loans that are available to \nAmerican veterans are affordable. I urge my\n\n[[Page S9968]]\n\ncolleagues to join Senator Thurmond and myself in supporting a program \nthat has proven to be successful and beneficial to the most deserving \nof Americans, our veterans, by permanently reauthorizing the VA \nAdjustable Rate Mortgage Program.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nwith Senator Warner, that will permanently extend the authority of the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs [VA] to guarantee loans with adjustable \nrate mortgages [ARMS].\n  The Veterans Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992 made significant \nchanges to the VA Home Loan Program. Included in that bill were \nprovisions establishing a demonstration project authorizing VA to \nguarantee ARMS during fiscal years 1993-95.\n  The Loan Guaranty Program is a benefit of great value to veterans and \nto the Nation. This program provides housing credit assistance to \nsatisfy the mortgage credit needs of veterans and members of the Armed \nForces. It provides private capital on more liberal terms than are \ngenerally available to nonveterans, without the assumption of undue \nrisks by the Federal Government. Veterans are assisted primarily \nthrough the use of the Government's guaranty on loans instead of the \nsubstantial down payment and other investment safeguards applicable to \nconventional mortgage transactions. Since the program's inception in \n1944, the VA has guaranteed nearly 15 million loans totaling more than \n$500 billion.\n  The ARM program offers veterans another choice in the mortgage \nmarket, particularly when interest rates are high. It is particularly \nuseful to first-time home buyers who can obtain loans with interest \nrates generally lower than fixed rate loans. The VA ARM allows a \nmaximum of 1 percent interest annually with a 5-percent maximum \ninterest rate increase over the life of the loan. These annual and \nlifetime caps are identical to those contained in the Federal Housing \nAdministration [FHA] ARM program, which is permanently authorized.\n  During the pilot program, the popularity of ARMS was well \nestablished. According to VA statistics, during fiscal year 1995, \napproximately 20 percent of all loans guaranteed were ARMS. This was \ndouble the ration of ARMS to all loans guaranteed in fiscal year 1994. \nDuring the test period of 1993-95, ARMS totaling $14.9 billion were \nguaranteed. In South Carolina, nearly 2,000 ARMS were originated, with \na value of more than $181 million.\n  Mr. President, this bill will permanently authorize a worthy program. \nARMS are a valuable financing tool for American families. They are used \nextensively nationwide by conventional and FHA home buyers. This bill \nwill permit qualified veterans to take advantage of ARMS, if they so \nchoose.

JAMES D. KNEELAND\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on July 17, I flew home to \nVermont to attend a funeral service for a man who passed away far too \nearly. His name was Col. James D. Kneeland, a man in the prime of his \nlife and career as a member of the Vermont National Guard. He will be \nremembered by all those whose lives he touched as a kind, honorable, \nand compassionate man. His legacy, a lifetime of extraordinary \nachievement.\n  Colonel Kneeland had a distinguished military career that began in \n1964. In 1968 he received his commission and continued to rise through \nthe ranks of the Army National Guard and was awarded his final \npromotion to colonel last September. As a National Guardsman and \nhelicopter pilot, Colonel Kneeland was en route to Macedonia when he \ndied unexpectedly. A tragic loss, not only to his family and friends, \nbut to his country.\n  As I look through Col. Kneeland's long list of awards and \ndecorations, it strikes me that his service was one marked by \nexcellence. However, there is more to this tribute than to speak simply \nof his military career. Like many Vermonters, Jim had an abiding love \nof the outdoors and took pleasure in the simpler things, like chopping \nwood at his camp in Wolcott, or walking through the woods with family \nand friends. Many will also remember him as a man with a sense of humor \nwho delighted in playing practical jokes and bringing a smile to those \naround him. I learned a lot about Jim Kneeland as I sat in Building \n890, henceforth known as the Col. James D. Kneeland Aviation Facility, \nand listened as friends and family remembered and celebrated his life. \nAppropriately, the backdrop for his casket was the last helicopter he \nflew in, an OH6A Cayuse, as flying was both his occupation and his \npassion. Nearly 1,000 people came to pay tribute to Colonel Kneeland, \nsome in uniform, some not, but all in tears. As Command Sgt. Maj. \nMichael Datillio said, Jim Kneeland was not your average officer. He \nwas,'' an enlisted man's officer.'' As a retired Naval Reserve Captain, \nI know of no greater praise.\n  Retired Gen. Benjamin Day had served with Jim and knew him for \nseveral years, both as a fellow officer and as a friend. General Day \nspoke of Jim fondly, and I was touched by some of his comments:\n\n       Monuments to Jim will not be found in material form . . . \n     rather, Jim's monuments will be in the less tangible, but \n     more important forms such as the indelible and unhesitating \n     friendship that he so generously and readily gave to us all. \n     His legacy to us are those priceless memories of his dry wit, \n     humor, easy handshake and friendly greeting. . . . With Jim \n     there was no pretense, what you saw was exactly what you got. \n     There was no smoke, no mirrors and no gilding the lilly. A \n     handshake on a deal with Jim was as good as gold and a \n     commitment that would be honored. Regardless of the \n     circumstances it was going to be carried out fully and \n     properly. . . . Jim's dedication to his family, friends, God \n     and country knew no limits.''\n\n  I was pleased to know that the Vermont National Guard has paid \nfurther tribute to Colonel Kneeland by naming their helicopter hanger \nat the Burlington Airport after him. I was personally touched by the \nloss of Colonel Kneeland as he was the father of Jason Kneeland, a \nvalued member of my staff. My heartfelt sympathy and condolences go out \nto Jim's wife, Jeannine, to Jason, and to all of Jim's family. He will \nbe truly missed, and remembered by us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9978-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNITED WAY OF GREATER BATTLE CREEK\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Over that period, \nthe programs it supports have touched the lives of one out of every \nfour members of the community.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring the United Way of \nGreater Battle Creek for the extraordinary work it has done over the \npast 75 years in helping improve the lives of the people in this \nterrific American community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9978-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9978-S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise in support of a bill, the \nInternational Narcotics Control Act of 1996, that was introduced \nyesterday. S. 2053 is a long overdue bill and I commend my colleague \nfrom Iowa for his work on this important legislation. Since 1986, we \nhave had on a law requiring the President to certify that foreign \ncountries are cooperating in the United States efforts to stop the flow \nof drugs into our borders. This law has not been revised for 10 years \nso it is critical that these important changes are made to ensure an \neffective antinarcotics effort.\n  The Foreign Assistance Act mandates that the President deliver to \nCongress a list of countries that have been fully cooperating with the \nUnited States to stop international drug trafficking as well as those \nthat have failed to cooperate by the 1st of March of each year. The \nDepartment of State details the decision in the International Narcotics \nControl Strategy Report. For those countries that have been \ndecertified, sanctions may be imposed, or a waiver can be given.\n  But the intent of the original act has been lost. Rather than \nsanctioning countries that are not cooperating with the United States \nto halt the flow of illegal drugs, the process has been stifled with \nother considerations. It is high time for changes to the law.\n  Timing could not be better. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration released the preliminary estimates from the \n1995 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Let me quote from the \ninitial study,\n\n       The percentage of adolescents (12 to 17 years old) using \n     drugs increased between 1994 and 1995 continuing a trend that \n     began in 1993. In 1992, the rate of past month use among \n     youth age 12 to 17 reached a low of 5.3 percent, the result \n     of a decline from 16.3 percent in 1979. By 1994 the rate \n     had climbed back up to 8.2 percent, and in 1995 it \n     increased again to 10.9 percent.\n\n  According to the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America,\n\n     overall use of all drugs among this age group rose 78 percent \n     between 1992 and 1995, and 33 percent just between 1994 and \n     1995. In particular marijuana use among young people is up \n     105 percent since 1992, and 37 percent between 1994 and 1995. \n     Monthly use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 percent \n     since 1992, and rose 54 percent between 1994 and 1995. \n     Monthly use of cocaine rose 166 percent between 1994 and \n     1995.\n\n  It is clear that the number of teenagers using illicit drugs is \nrising--and that is unacceptable. After decades of working on reducing \ndrug use, our young people are believing that it is OK to use drugs. \nThe media, and even the administration, are sending signals that a \nlittle drug use is OK. It is not. The wrong message has been sent and \nit is time to change that. Teenagers must learn the harmful, even \ndeadly, effects of illegal drug use.\n  The availability of illegal drugs must be curtailed. The best way to \ndiminish accessibility is to stop drugs from crossing our borders. This \nbill would accomplish that goal.\n  International drug trafficking can only be halted with the full \ncooperation of a drug-producing or drug-transit country. It is \nimperative then, that foreign countries assist in the interdiction and \nprosecution of those responsible. We should expect this from our \nallies.\n  The provisions in the International Narcotics Control Act are \ncomprehensive and tough. If a drug-producing or drug-transit country \nhas failed to cooperate with the United States for 3 consecutive years, \nthen sanctions must be applied. Decertification will no longer be a \nmeaningless label to these countries.\n\n[[Page S9979]]\n\n  The trade sanctions are particularly important to stopping the \ninternational drug trade. Trade sanctions will force the foreign \ncountry to sit up and take notice. Far too often, traffickers use \nlegitimate commercial trade to smuggle illicit drugs into this country.\n  In addition, the administration has been less than forthcoming. \nAdditional reporting requirements and notices to Congress will ensure \nthat the American people are receiving prompt and accurate information.\n  I am pleased to have worked with my colleagues on this measure and \nurge my colleagues to support this bill's immediate passage. The \ncommunities that are fighting the war on drugs--and our children--\ndeserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9978-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COPE-O'BRIEN CENTER'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor a special \norganization on the 25th anniversary of its founding. This year the \nCOPE-O'Brien Center celebrates 25 years of outstanding service to \nWashtenaw County and the State of Michigan.\n  COPE stands for Center for Occupational and Personalized Education. \nThe center works to address the major problems facing today's youth--\nhigh dropout rates, illiteracy, unemployment, substance abuse, and teen \npregnancy. At a time when domestic spending is being cut, the COPE-\nO'Brien Center stands out as a successful, cost-effective program.\n  This innovative center strives to lessen barriers to employment for \nyoung men and women by offering skill training and placement into \nunsubsidized employment or entry into more advanced vocational and \neducational programs. The center provides daytime counseling, \nrecreation, and alternative educational services for troubled and needy \nadolescents. Emergency shelters, foster care, and life skill training \nare also a part of the program. As an alternative to institutional \nplacement, the program saves money by working with families and the \njuvenile courts to resolve long-term needs of youngsters.\n  The COPE-O'Brien Youth Center plays a critical role in offering \nessential educational and counseling services for at-risk youth in \nWashtenaw County. The center's accomplishments in meeting the multiple \nneeds of youth for over two decades run deep. It is my pleasure to \nrecognize their many valuable services which enhance the lives of our \nyoung people.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating the COPE-\nO'Brien center on its 25th anniversary of working with our most \nvaluable resource--our youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9979-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO HUBBARD FARMS ON THEIR 75TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nHubbard Farms Inc. in Walpole, NH, for their 75 years of excellence in \nserving the poultry industry. For years now, Hubbard Farms has become \ninternationally recognized for their research and development into \nchicken breeding and hatching. Amazingly, each year Hubbard Farms \ndoubles their worldwide demand for chicken products. This annual profit \nincrease is primarily due to their market-driven and customer-focused \nresearch. On the occasion of their 75th anniversary celebration, I \napplaud Austin, Oliver, and Leslie, the three Hubbard brothers, and all \nthe employees at Hubbard Farms for their invaluable contributions to \nthe national and international poultry industry. Having been raised on \nmy grandparent's farm, I have the utmost admiration for the dedication \nand hard work of farmers and their families.\n  Few companies in the United States can trace their origins back to \nthe 1700's and Hubbard Farms is one of them. In 1791, Levi Hubbard \nsettled in the newly founded Walpole area and began working with \npoultry in addition to his general farming enterprise. Hubbard Farms \nwas founded in 1921 when Ira's son, Oliver, graduated from the \nUniversity of New Hampshire with one of the first majors in poultry and \nopened the company's doors. Oliver, who is now 96 years old, began the \npoultry breeding and hatching operations which have made his company so \nsuccessful in the international poultry industry. In the 1930's, Oliver \neven helped develop a new chicken breed called the New Hampshire.\n  As Hubbard Farms began to experience an increase in sales, Oliver's \ntwo brothers, Austin and Leslie, joined the family company. During the \n1930's and 1940's their breeding and commercial hatchery operations \nexpanded considerably. As the boiler industry began to grow, the \nHubbards produced a large volume of Barred Cross chickens in addition \nto their purebred New Hampshire chicks.\n  In the 1950's and 1960's, Hubbard Farms built hatcheries and breeding \nfarms in Statesville, NC, and Hot Springs, AR, and opened an \ninternational subsidiary in Belgium. The three Hubbard brothers have \nenjoyed a steady increase in growth over the years that includes an \nextensive network of franchise distribution for the production, sale, \nand delivery of Hubbard meat-breeding stock. These franchise operations \nare in countries all over the world--Brazil, Equador, Mexico, Taiwan, \nMalaysia, Indonesia, South Africa, India, and China.\n  Hubbard Farms was acquired in 1974 by Merck & Co., a leading \ninnovator of health products and is still considered an innovator in \npoultry genetics. Their company objective is to supply an increasing \nshare of the market with broiler parent stock that consistently \noutperforms all competitors.\n  Hubbard Farm's 75-year history is marked by distinction and \nachievement. In 1973, the company received the President's E-Star Award \nfor Excellence in Exporting from the Secretary of Commerce and \nSecretary of Agriculture in recognition of their outstanding \ncontributions to the increase of U.S. trade abroad. In addition, \nHubbard Farms is one of the largest and most highly respected employers \nin the town of Walpole. Hubbard Farms has consistently supported \nWalpole and the surrounding areas for 75 exceptional years.\n  I am proud to join with other New Hampshire residents in \ncongratulating this longstanding poultry leader. Hubbard Farms is a \ntruly distinct company with their commitment to breeding excellence and \ntheir extensive record of achievement. I send my very best wishes on \nthe memorable occasion of their 75th anniversary and wish Oliver, \nAustin, and Leslie continued years of success at Hubbard Farms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9979-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRENE M. AUBERLIN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an incredible \nwoman who has reached the age of 100 years. This is a remarkable moment \nnot only for her longevity but also for the wonderful works her long \nlife has produced. This year marks the 100th birthday of Irene \nAuberlin. You may not have heard her name before, but her vision and \nwork have touched hundreds of thousands of people the world over.\n  In 1953, Irene Auberlin saw a television show that changed her life \nand the lives of countless others around the world. That show was about \nwar-torn Korea and the plight of the many children who were left \norphans by the war. In order to assist these children, Mrs. Auberlin \nbegan what would later be known as World Medical Relief of Detroit, MI.\n  World Medical Relief's mission is to provide donated medical supplies \nfor the benefit and relief of indigent persons throughout the world who \nare unable to pay for medical and dental care. Over the past 43 years, \nWorld Medical Relief has provided three quarters of a billion dollars' \nworth of excess medical items around the world. World Medical Relief \nhas also expanded its mission to include helping senior citizens who \nneed prescription medicine in the Detroit metropolitan area.\n  It is a pleasure to rise today and honor the 100th birthday of Irene \nAuberlin, a woman who has done so much to help so many around the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9979-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9979-S9980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MILWAUKEE'S CAMPAIGN FOR OUR CHILDREN\n\n   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to \napplaud the efforts of the city of Milwaukee, Milwaukee County, the \nschool system,\n\n[[Page S9980]]\n\nindependent foundations, and other organizations for launching the \nCampaign for Our Children-Milwaukee to combat teen pregnancy. The \nCampaign For Our Children, Inc., is a private, nonprofit corporation \nthat works in a cooperative effort with communities, schools, and State \ngovernments. The Campaign for Our Children is built on two important \nideas: responsible behavior and creating opportunities for youth. The \nprogram additionally emphasizes mentoring for children after school \nthrough private organizations and the public school system.\n  Much credit for this new program belongs to Milwaukee Alderman \nMichael Murphy who started the groundwork in Milwaukee, then contacted \nthe national office of the Campaign for Our Children, Inc. based in \nMaryland for additional assistance. Once the preliminary planning \ncommenced, Alderman Murphy worked on securing financial support for the \nprogram, as well as, private and public support in the community. I \nknow that he and those who have worked to make this program a reality \nare very pleased to see it commence.\n  President Clinton mentioned a similar program during his 1996 State \nof the Union Address. At that time the President urged Americans to \njoin together to combat teen pregnancy. Mr. President, as a parent of \nfour children I understand the importance of helping young people \nbecome responsible young adults and learning to make the right \ndecisions.\n  The Campaign for Our Children is designed to be a positive force for \nMilwaukee and its surrounding communities. This program can help \nprovide young residents of Milwaukee with the opportunity to focus on \ntheir goals and interests with positive role models. We should use \nprograms such as these with an emphasis on self-reliance and self-\nresponsibility.\n  I commend Campaign for Our Children-Milwaukee and wish them success \nfor many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9979-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RUTH YOUNG WATT\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, earlier this year the Senate family \nlost one of its own, Ruth Young Watt, the former chief clerk of the \nSenate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, who passed away peacefully on June 16, 1996.\n  Ruth's Senate career spanned 32 years. Beginning as the clerk of the \nSpecial Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program for \nSenator Owen Brewster of Maine, Ruth later became the chief clerk of \nthe Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Government \nAffairs Committee where she worked for 31 years. Ruth also served as \nchief clerk of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in \nLabor-Management Relations from 1957 until 1960.\n  Ruth gave herself and her time to all who asked. People who turned to \nRuth Watt knew they were hard and that she would do her best. As chief \nclerk she played an integral role in the committee; without her, \noperations would not have run as smoothly and succinctly as they did \nunder her care.\n  Ruth was a remarkable woman who dedicated all of her life to public \nservice. I commend her commitment to her country, to her coworkers and \nto her family.\n  On behalf of the Senate family, I extend my condolences to Ruth's \nsiblings, Richard Young, Frances Lilly, and Kathryn Woods. Our prayers \nand our thoughts are with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9980-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PHILANTHROPY DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Each year \non this day, the Nation recognizes the outstanding contributions that \nnonprofit philanthropic organizations make to our communities.\n  There are presently more than 800,000 philanthropic organizations in \nthe United States, employing approximately 10,000,000 people. These \norganizations and individuals give their time, talent, and resources to \nthe important causes that can improve our communities.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the Detroit Concert \nChoir for winning top honors as Choir of the World at the Llangollen \nInternational Musical Eisteddfod in north Wales. The 50-year-old \nfestival is considered the ultimate in vocal music competitions, and in \nthe past has featured artists such as Luciano Pavarotti and Placido\n\n[[Page S9981]]\n\nDomingo. The 70-voice choir competed against 80 choirs representing 40 \ncountries. The Detroit group won first place for mixed ensemble, \nsecond-place honors for men's chorus, a third place for men's folk and \na fourth place for women's ensemble. Their combined score from all the \ncompetitions earned a spot in the finals. There they represented the \nUnited States against choirs from Hungary, Denmark and Wales. A seven \nmember panel voted the Detroit Concert Choir the best among the \ncompetitors and awarded them a large bronze trophy and the title of \nChoir of the World. The choir impressed the judges by signing in five \nlanguages--English, Aruban, Portugese, Russian and Latin. After winning \nthe competition, the choir honored the festival and their hosts by \nperforming the Welsh national anthem and ``God Save the Queen.'' I know \nmy Senate colleagues join me in honoring the extraordinary achievement \nof the Detroit Concert Choir in bringing home top honors at the \nLlangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. The members have made the \nState of Michigan and the entire Nation proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9980-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9981-S9982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1996\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 564, S. 1970.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1970) to amend the National Museum of the \n     American Indian Act to make improvements in the Act, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for voting \nto adopt S. 1970, a bill to amend the National Museum of the American \nIndian Act [NMAIA]. This legislation is intended to codify existing \npolicies and procedures practiced by the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian and the National Museum of Natural History and to amend \nthe act so that its repatriation requirements are consistent with the \nrequirements of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation \nAct [NAGPRA]. The overriding purpose of this legislation is to ensure \nthat the requirements for the inventory, identification, and return of \nIndian human remains and Indian funerary objects in the possession of \nthe Smithsonian Institution are being carried out and that the remains \nand funerary objects are being returned to their rightful keepers and \nprotectors the Indian tribes.\n  The possession of Indian human remains and associated funerary \nobjects by non-Indians has been a contentious issue for Indian tribes \nand Indian organizations for many years. In order to bring about a \nsatisfactory resolution to these issues and to create a respectful \ndialog between the parties, Congress enacted the Native American Graves \nProtection and Repatriation Act and the National Museum of the American \nIndian Act. In the years since its passage, the Smithsonian Institution \nhas worked diligently to fulfill the mandates of both the NAGPRA and \nthe NMAIA. Both the National Museum of the American Indian and the \nNational Museum of Natural History employ written policies that are \nconsistent with the spirit and intent of NAGPRA.\n  S. 1970 will ensure that these policies are consistent with the \nrequirements of NAGPRA by establishing additional procedures and \ndeadlines for the completion of the Smithsonian's repatriation \nmandates. It mandates that a simple inventory of the remains and \nobjects in the Smithsonian's possession be completed by June 1, 1998, \nand that a written summary of all unassociated funerary objects, sacred \nobjects, and objects of cultural patrimony in its possession be \ncompleted by December 31, 1996. Second, S. 1970 requires that the \nSmithsonian notify and return expeditiously all unassociated funerary \nobjects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony to the \nappropriate individual, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization. \nIn order to facilitate the repatriation process, the bill increases the \nmembership of the repatriation committee and requires that two members \nbe ``traditional Indian religious elders.'' Finally, this legislation \nallows the Smithsonian the flexibility to go beyond the Act's minimum \nrequirements in returning the funerary and sacred objects and remains \nto Indian people.\n  Mr. President, I would like to express my deep appreciation for the \nhard work and dedication of representatives of the Smithsonian who have \ncooperated tremendously in the preparation of this legislation and who \nhave continued to demonstrate their serious commitment to returning \nthese sacred remains and objects to their rightful owners the Indian \ntribes. Finally, I would like to express my personal thanks for the \ntireless work of Senator Inouye in making the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian a reality and for his efforts on behalf of this \nlegislation. I thank my colleagues for their support of S. 1970.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1970) was deemed read the third time, and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1970\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 569, S. 1972.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1972) to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 \n     to improve the provisions relating to Indians, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for voting \nto adopt S. 1972, a bill to amend the Older Americans Act. S. 1972 \nmakes technical corrections to the Act to clarify and improve the \nprovisions relating to older Native Americans.\n  Mr. President, many older Native Americans have benefited from \nprograms authorized under the Older Americans Act. Indian tribes have \nprovided much needed home-based care, meals and services to elderly \ntribal members living on Indian reservations and in nearby communities. \nIn most cases, older Native Americans live in remote and isolated \ncommunities with little or no access to a grocery store, telephone, \nhealth care and other important services. Through the Older Americans \nAct, nutrition and support services can be provided to older Native \nAmericans in their homes and communities on a daily basis.\n  However, many of these services can be strengthened to ensure that \nIndian tribes are able to tailor nutritional and supportive programs to \nthe cultural and geographic characteristics of their communities. \nOften, employment and nutrition programs are difficult to administer in \nIndian country because of the remoteness of the service area and the \nunique character of Indian cultures. The changes in S. 1972 will ensure \nthat Indian tribes and tribal organizations serving Native American \nelders will be afforded maximum flexibility in administering employment \nand nutrition programs to ensure that they are appropriate to the \nunique characteristics of the Indian communities.\n  Mr. President, I have proposed a minor technical change to the bill \nas it was reported in the Committee on Indian Affairs. This amendment \nto Section 2 of the bill is necessary to clarify that the proposed \nchange to the definition of ``reservation'' will not alter any existing \neligibility for Indians living near an Indian reservation.\n  Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to Senators Inouye \nand Stevens, who joined me in sponsoring this legislation and my \ncolleagues in the Senate who voted to pass S. 1972. This Act will bring \nus closer to meeting the goals of the Older Americans Act to ensure \nthat older Native Americans will continue to benefit from the services \nprovided by the Act.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1972) was deemed read the third time, and passed.\n  (The text of the bill will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9982-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9982-S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PANAMA NEW BASE RIGHTS NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nturn to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 268, S. Con. Res. \n14.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 14) urging the \n     President to negotiate a new base rights agreement with \n     government of Panama to permit United States Armed Forces to \n     remain in Panama beyond December 31, 1999.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5202\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for Mr. Helms, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5202.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 3, line 3, strike all through the period \n     on page 4, line 3, and insert the following:\n       (1) The President should negotiate a new base rights \n     agreement with the Government of Panama--\n       (A) taking into account the foregoing findings; and\n       (B) consulting with the Congress regarding any bilateral \n     negotiations that take place.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I do hope the Senate will approve this \nresolution urging the President to negotiate an agreement with Panama \nto permit United States Armed Forces to maintain a presence in that \ncountry beyond the year 2000.\n  The Panama Canal treaties state that unless we pursue an agreement \nwith Panama, the United States military must complete the withdrawal of \nits forces from Panama by the date. Imagine, if you can, the U.S. flag \ncoming down for the last time on December 31, 1999--ending a special \nand unique relationship that has lasted almost a century. This must not \nbe allowed to happen.\n  The Panama Canal treaties provide for a continued United States \nmilitary presence--if both parties express an interest.\n\n[[Page S9983]]\n\n  I feel strongly that it is in the best interests of both the United \nStates and Panama to maintain a United States military presence in \nPanama. United States forces in Panama help promote stable democracies \nthroughout the region and serve as a critical component for United \nStates counter-drug monitoring and interdiction efforts. Without \nquestion, United States forces offer the best protection for the Panama \nCanal. If the United States leaves, the canal will be left literally \nundefended.\n  Although the United States is engaged in a drawdown of our forces, \nboth overseas and in the United States, there are, nevertheless, more \nthan 135,000 United States troops remaining in Europe and almost \n100,000 in the Pacific. By early 1998, fewer than 6,000 troops will \nremain in Panama--that is, basically 6,000 troops for the entire \nhemisphere. If total United States military withdrawal from Panama were \nto be allowed to happen, this nation will be left with no major \nmilitary presence in the region.\n  Mr. President, I have had a number of meetings with Panamanians. They \nwant us to stay. Polls in Panama show that about 75 percent of \nPanamanians want the United States to maintain military forces there \nbeyond the year 2000. It is time to negotiate a new base rights \nagreement. Congress should urge the President to negotiate a continued \nUnited States military presence in Panama. The House of Representatives \napproved this resolution in June 1995; and it was voted out of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously in December 1995. Now is \nthe time to pursue an agreement with Panama.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5202) was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con Res. 14), with its preamble, is as \nfollows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 14\n\n       Whereas the Panama Canal is a vital strategic asset to the \n     United States, its allies, and the world;\n       Whereas the Treaty on the Permanent Neutrality and \n     Operation of the Panama Canal signed on September 7, 1977, \n     provides that Panama and the United States have the \n     responsibility to assure that the Panama Canal will remain \n     open and secure;\n       Whereas such Treaty also provides that each of the two \n     countries shall, in accordance with their respective \n     constitutional processes, defend the Canal against any threat \n     to the regime of neutrality, and consequently shall have the \n     right to act against any aggression or threat directed \n     against the Canal or against the peaceful transit of vessels \n     through the Canal;\n       Whereas the United States instrument of ratification of \n     such Treaty includes specific language that the two countries \n     should consider negotiating future arrangements or agreements \n     to maintain military forces necessary to fulfill the \n     responsibility of the two countries of maintaining the \n     neutrality of the Canal after 1999;\n       Whereas the Government of Panama, in the bilateral Protocol \n     of Exchange of instruments of ratification, expressly \n     ``agreed upon'' such arrangements or agreements;\n       Whereas the Navy depends upon the Panama Canal for rapid \n     transit in times of emergency, as demonstrated during World \n     War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam conflict, the Cuban \n     Missile Crisis, and the Persian Gulf conflict;\n       Whereas drug trafficking and money laundering has \n     proliferated in the Western Hemisphere since the Treaty on \n     the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal \n     was signed on September 7, 1977, and such trafficking and \n     laundering poses a grave threat to peace and security in the \n     region;\n       Whereas certain facilities now utilized by the United \n     States Armed Forces in Panama are critical to combat the \n     trade in illegal drugs;\n       Whereas the United States and Panama share common policy \n     goals such as strengthening democracy, expanding economic \n     trade, and combating illegal narcotics throughout Latin \n     America;\n       Whereas the Government of Panama has dissolved its military \n     forces and has maintained only a civilian police organization \n     to defend the Panama Canal against aggression; and\n       Whereas certain public opinion polls in Panama suggest that \n     many Panamanians desire a continued United States military \n     presence in Panama: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the President should negotiate a new base rights \n     agreement with the Government of Panama--\n       (A) taking into account the foregoing findings; and\n       (B) consulting with the Congress regarding any bilateral \n     negotiations that take place.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/05/senate-section/article/S9982-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1996\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
