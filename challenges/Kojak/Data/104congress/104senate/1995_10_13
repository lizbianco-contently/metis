These can be riverbeds for the flow of discouragement or of \njoy. In this time of prayer we ask that Your joy overflow the banks of \nour hearts.\n  Nehemiah expressed this assurance in the arduous time of the \nrebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem. ``The joy of the Lord is your \nstrength,'' he said. Only You could give the people what they needed to \npersist and endure. The same is true for us in our work today. We do \nnot always find joy in our work: Sometimes it is demanding and \nexasperating. But we can bring Your joy to our work, a joy that lasts, \na joy that bursts forth from Your love, forgiveness, and hope. Thank \nYou for the creative thought and energy that Your divine joy triggers \nin our minds and our bodies.\n  This is the day You have made. We will rejoice and be glad in You, \nfor Your joy is our strength. In our blessed Lord's name. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15143-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, several weeks ago on this floor, I \naddressed the issue of what I regard as a serious and growing problem \nin this country. The problem has two major features: Disturbing \nindications of a new drug epidemic among the Nation's young; and a lack \nof leadership from the administration either to provide the necessary \nmoral guidance at home or to sustain programs overseas.\n  I called upon Democrats and Republicans to join in an effort to \nreverse this trend. In addition, Senator Coverdell and I worked to \nrestore funding to our international narcotics efforts as did Senator \nMcConnell. We hope that as we go to conference with the House that we \ncan preserve the funding for our international programs that contribute \nto our overall efforts to fight drug abuse. Yesterday, Senator Hatch, \nin an eloquent and forceful statement, joined me in summoning up the \nawareness and resolve that we need to address now the dangerous trends \nwe see in teenage drug use. Something that we must do before we find \nourselves deep in a new wave of addicts and ruined lives.\n  Two weeks ago, Senator Dole pointed out the seriousness of the \nproblems that we face in an insightful opinion piece. As he noted \nthere, we have lost our focus on drug policy. As a result the voice \nmost commonly heard on the drug issue is from those who favor \nlegalization in one form or another. Despite the fact that the public \nroutinely, by overwhelming majorities, opposes any such notion, the \npress, our cultural elite, and some of our political leaders act as if \nthis was not the case. The most remembered voice on the Clinton \nadministration's drug policy was the call by Joclyn Elders, the Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States, for legalization. The result of a policy \nof replacing Just Say No with Just Say Nothing has had predictable \nresults.\n  Our interdiction efforts have fallen off as the focus on law \nenforcement has diminished. The priorities at DEA and Customs have \nshifted away from international efforts. Even domestically these \nagencies are doing far less to combat drug trafficking, as declines in \narrests and seizures indicate. The Coast Guard has seen its budget \nshrink \n\n[[Page S 15144]]\nfor drug control, and DOD counterdrug funding has plummeted. More \nseriously, the administration has not fought for its own programs or \nsupported its own drug czar in Congress. And the President has \nabandoned the bully pulpit--something that his own Attorney General, \nhis Secretary of Health and Human Services, and his drug czar have \ncalled one of the most important tools in our counterdrug arsenal.\n  As a consequence, the message that drug use is both harmful and wrong \nis simply not getting to the audience that most needs it--young \nAmericans. Marijuana use is on the rise, dramatically. Lest anyone \nforget, this was how the drug epidemic of the 1960's and 1970's got \nstarted. Marijuana was the gateway to an age of major drug addiction. \nWe are seeing a repeat of that history because we failed to learn from \nour history. Today's marijuana, however, is many times more potent than \nanything from the 1960's, and we know a great deal more about the \ndangerous health consequences of even small use. Thus, we are not \nignorant. We are, however, in danger of being negligent.\n  It is not as if we have learned nothing about what works. After many \nyears of trial and error, we hit upon the mix of things that gets the \njob done. The first hurdle we overcame in the efforts of the late \n1980's was to realize that counterdrug efforts cannot be a sometime \nthing. We need consistency and sustained effort.\n  We also learned that we needed comprehensive programs that combine \neffective interdiction, law enforcement, education, prevention, and \ntreatment in well-publicized efforts. This is what it takes to send a \nclear message to the most at-risk population--young people between the \nages of 12 and 20. When we managed to put these things together we saw \nsignificant declines in use.\n\n  Now, however, all that is at risk. We have retreated from what works. \nWe have seen rhetoric that tries to ignore one of the most significant \nparts of the message about illegal drug use--that drugs are illegal \nbecause they are dangerous and wrong. Instead, the voice we hear says \nthat drugs are dangerous because they are illegal. Or just as bad, that \nthe only way to deal with the problem of drug abuse is through \ntreatment. And we have seen program changes that reinforce this view. \nOnce again, however, we can see the obvious: When you do not make it \nclear that drug use is not only harmful but wrong, and that use has \nconsequences both social and judicial, then the coherence of the \nmessage is lost on our young people.\n  We need to revitalize our efforts. To remind ourselves of our \nresponsibilities and of what is needful. It also involves asking \nourselves what are the appropriate responses of the Federal Government. \nIt certainly is not simply throwing money at programs.\n  There are a number of things the Federal Government is best able to \ndo and most responsible for. First, there is a need to develop sound \nstrategies that have substance rather than rhetoric as their main \ncomponents. Second, Federal authorities need to focus on those things \nState and local authorities are less able or unable to do. This means, \nin particular, a major focus on interdiction, international control \nefforts, and law enforcement at and near the borders. These are areas \nthat have suffered the most in recent years.\n  Third, we need consistent, visible leadership that ensures the level \nof cooperation and oversight of individual programs necessary to \nproduce coordinated efforts. We need a drug czar whose authority is \nbacked by a President committed to the effort.\n  Fourth, we need to renew our public agenda. To encourage local \ngroups, family organizations, and private, voluntary groups in their \nefforts to fight drug abuse and the creeping influence of legalizers. \nWe need a Just-Say-No czar with visibility and credibility.\n  Fifth, we need to revitalize our interdiction efforts at and near the \nborders and to recover the lost ground in recent years. We need to stop \nusing our Federal drug law enforcement officers as deputy sheriffs in \nlocal jurisdictions. They should be focusing on the major cases that \ninvolve multiple jurisdictions. We need a recommitment to protect our \nborders, something even more important as we move forward with NAFTA.\n  Sixth, we need a major international effort to go after the major \ncriminal organizations that are responsible for a spreading wave of \ncriminality here and abroad.\n  Finally, we need congressional commitment to sustain realistic \nprograms that have proven records. We need all of these things today.\n  As chairman of the Drug Caucus, I have highlighted the problems in \nthe past. It is time for us to move ahead. In this regard, as a first \nstep, I intend to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in the coming \ndays calling for a day of national drug awareness. This is in \nconjunction with Red Ribbon Week, sponsored by the National Family \nPartnership. I call on my colleagues and all Americans to wear a red \nribbon during the period of October 23-31 in memory of a real hero in \nthe drug war, Enrique Camarena, a DEA agent killed fighting drug \ntraffickers, and as a reminder of and commitment to a drug free \ncountry.\n  In the coming weeks I will be working with the private sector and my \ncolleagues to bring greater focus to and effort on the drug issue. It \nis time. It is necessary. It is right. We need to make the whole \ncountry one big drug-free zone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15143-7", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate a \n\n[[Page S 15145]]\nmessage from the House of Representatives on S. 652 a bill to provide \nfor a procompetitive, deregulatory national policy framework designed \nto accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \ntelecommunications and information technologies and services to all \nAmericans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition, and \nfor other purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the House insist upon its amendments to the \n     bill (S. 652) entitled ``An Act to provide for a pro-\n     competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed \n     to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \n     telecommunications and information technologies and services \n     to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to \n     competition, and for other purposes'', and ask a conference \n     with the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \n     thereon.\n       Ordered, That the following Members be the managers of the \n     conference on the part of the House:\n       From the Committee on Commerce: Mr. Bliley, Mr. Fields of \n     Texas, Mr. Oxley, Mr. White, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Markey, Mr. \n     Boucher, Ms. Eshoo, and Mr. Rush: Provided, Mr. Pallone is \n     appointed in lieu of Mr. Boucher solely for consideration of \n     section 205 of the Senate bill.\n       As additional conferees, for consideration of sections 1-6, \n     101-104, 106-107, 201, 204-205, 221-225, 301-305, 307-311, \n     401-402, 405-406, 410, 601-606, 703, and 705 of the Senate \n     bill, and title I of the House amendment, and modifications \n     committed to conference: Mr. Schaefer, Mr. Barton of Texas, \n     Mr. Hastert, Mr. Paxon, Mr. Klug, Mr. Frisa, Mr. Stearns, Mr. \n     Brown of Ohio, Mr. Gordon, and Mrs. Lincoln.\n       As additional conferees, for consideration of sections 102, \n     202-203, 403, 407-409, and 706 of the Senate bill, and title \n     II of the House amendment, and modifications committed to \n     conference: Mr. Schaefer, Mr. Hastert, and Mr. Frisa.\n       As additional conferees, for consideration of sections 105, \n     206, 302, 306, 312, 501-505, and 701-702 of the Senate bill, \n     and title III of the House amendment, and modifications \n     committed to conference: Mr. Stearns, Mr. Paxon and Mr. Klug.\n       As additional conferees, for consideration of sections 7-8, \n     226, 404, and 704 of the Senate bill, and titles IV-V of the \n     House amendment, and modifications committed to conference: \n     Mr. Schaefer, Mr. Hastert, and Mr. Klug.\n       As additional conferees, for consideration of title VI of \n     the House amendment, and modifications committed to \n     conference: Mr. Schaefer, Mr. Barton, and Mr. Klug.\n       As additional conferees from the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, for consideration of the Senate bill (except \n     sections 1-6, 101-104, 106-107, 201, 204-205, 221-225, 301-\n     305, 307-311, 401-402, 405-406, 410, 601-606, 703, and 705), \n     and of the House amendment (except title I), and \n     modifications committed to conference: Mr. Hyde, Mr. \n     Moorhead, Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Buyer, Mr. Flanagan, Mr. \n     Conyers, Mrs. Schroeder, and Mr. Bryant of Texas.\n       As additional conferees, for consideration of sections 1-6, \n     101-104, 106-107, 201, 204-205, 221-225, 301-305, 307-311, \n     401-402, 405-406, 410, 601-606, 703, and 705 of the Senate \n     bill, and title I of the House amendment, and modifications \n     committed to conference: Mr. Hyde, Mr. Moorhead, Mr. \n     Goodlatte, Mr. Buyer, Mr. Flanagan, Mr. Gallegly, Mr. Barr, \n     Mr. Hoke, Mr. Conyers, Mrs. Schroeder, Mr. Berman, Mr. Bryant \n     of Texas, Mr. Scott, and Ms. Jackson-Lee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours of debate divided in the following manner: 90 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senators Dorgan and Kerrey of Nebraska, 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Pressler.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If the Senate should agree later today, I believe that \nthe Chair will be appointing the following conferees to the \ntelecommunications bill. If the Chair so appoints and if there is not \nobjection, Senators Pressler, Stevens, McCain, Burns, Gorton, Lott, \nHollings, Inouye, Ford, Exon, and Rockefeller will be named as \nconferees.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize for the Senate where we stand on the \ntelecommunications bill.\n  The House and Senate have both passed major bills reforming the \nTelecommunications Act of 1934, bringing it up to date, and also making \ncertain changes in our Nation's telecommunications laws. In addition, \nthere are efforts to make it more procompetitive and deregulatory but \nalso to protect the rights of the consumers in our country and to move \nthe telecommunications bill forward.\n  We are in a situation today that our Nation very much needs to \nmodernize its telecommunications laws. A House-Senate conference will \nsoon begin to iron out the differences between the Senate and the House \nversions of telecommunications. We are doing this on a bipartisan \nbasis, and I hope that it will proceed quickly and thoroughly.\n  I look forward to working with those Senators and all Members of this \nChamber. Let me say, Mr. President, that although there are certain \nconferees named, all Senators are invited to have input, as they have \nhad on this bill. I commend Senator Hollings of South Carolina, the \nranking Democrat and former chairman of the Commerce Committee, who has \nprovided so much leadership on this bill. Indeed, he has brought to \nthis process a very bipartisan spirit, and I look forward to working \nwith him and the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and the House.\n  Mr. President, I reserve as much time as I may have and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to have a discussion this morning \nprior to the Senate appointment of conferees to the telecommunications \nbill.\n  After the appointment of conferees, there will then be a conference \nbetween the House and Senate on the telecommunications bill. This bill \nis very important. The telecommunications bill is the first substantial \nchange in telecommunications law since the 1930's.\n  All of us know what has happened in this country to communication \nsince the 1930's. I mean, it is breathtaking the kinds of changes we \nhave seen in the communications industry and for everybody in this \ncountry. So when this Congress sits down and decides to make changes to \nlaw--and we should and must--the question is, How will those changes \naffect our country? Who will they affect? What will they affect?\n  One of the things I have been very concerned about is the issue of \nuniversal service for telephone service. You know, it is more costly to \nhave telephone service in a town of 100 people in South Dakota, North \nDakota, or Montana, than it is to have telephone service in New York \nCity. Why is that? Well, because the fixed costs of providing telephone \nservice in New York can be spread over millions of phone instruments, \nbut in Grenora, ND, the fixed costs are spread over relatively few \ntelephones.\n  But is the telephone in Grenora, ND, or Regent, ND, any less \nimportant than the telephone in New York City? No. One is used to call \nthe other. The absence of one makes the other less valuable. Universal \nservice in telephone service is important. It has been a concept in \nthis country we have understood and protected for a long, long time.\n  We must make sure to protect universal service in the \ntelecommunications legislation. People say, ``Well, this bill is about \ncompetition.'' I love the flowery language about opening up the petals \nof competition, competition in the marketplace; worshiping at that \naltar is what is going to allow us to flourish and provide vast new \nopportunities in communications for everyone in our country.\n  I want to talk a little bit about that competition today. One can \nconceive of competition in a rural area being someone saying, ``I want \nto come into this rural county''--where you barely have a telephone \nstructure and are able to survive currently--``and I want to pick the \nonly town that exists out in that county and serve that. That is all I \nwant to serve.'' What about the rest of it that cannot stand by itself? \n``That doesn't matter to me because I only want to compete in that \nsmall town.''\n  That is the kind of thing we have to be concerned about. We need \nlegislation that protects us and provides universal service for the \nlong term. We made progress on universal service in the \ntelecommunications bill. Now, we just have to keep universal service \nintact in the conference. That is critically important.\n  There are two other areas that concern me greatly. \n\n[[Page S 15146]]\n\n  The two areas are this:\n  One is, when should local telephone carriers who essentially have a \nmonopoly be free to compete in long distance? And should the Department \nof Justice have a role in determining when there is competition in the \nlocal exchange so that that carrier then is free to compete in long \ndistance? The bill is set up pretty much like it is for airlines.\n  The airline situation says that if a couple airlines want to merge, \nthe Department of Transportation determines whether it is in the public \ninterest, and they make the decision, and they say to the Department of \nJustice and the antitrust folks over there, ``We will allow you to \nadvise us on what you think, but we will make the decision at the \nDepartment of Transportation.''\n  Guess what? There has not been a merger that these folks have not \nloved to death. It does not matter which kind of corporations want to \nmarry. Two airlines want to marry each other? Just fine. The Department \nof Justice might say, ``This is going to be anti-competitive, it is \ngoing to increase fares, it is not going to be in the public \ninterest.'' But guess what? The Department of Transportation says, \n``Well, it's just fine with us. Just get hitched. Merge up. That's \nfine.''\n  What do we have in this country these days? We see all these big \nairlines swallow the little airlines, either they crush them or they \nswallow them, one of the two, whichever they have the opportunity to \ndo.\n  And if they decide to buy them and merge, the Department of Justice \nmight say, ``Well, you know, they are trying to take out their \ncompetition here. It will be less competitive if you have this \nmerger.'' The Department of Transportation says, ``It doesn't matter to \nus. We will allow them to merge anyway.''\n  That is what the experience has been. If you like that and think that \nis the right approach, then you do what is done in the Senate bill on \ntelephones and communications. You say the same thing, prevent the \nDepartment of Justice from having a role in determining whether you \nhave anticompetitive practices.\n  That does not make any sense to me. This bill is advertised with neon \nlights and bells and bands as being a bill for competition. ``It \nprovides America the fruits and flowers of competition.'' Well, if that \nis the case, why would you not allow the Justice Department and the \nantitrust people in the Justice Department to weigh in on the question \nof when are you involved in anticompetitive practices? When is there \ntruly competition in local exchanges so the local telephone carriers \ncan then be free to compete in long distance?\n  The second area I want to talk about is whether there should be \nlimits in this country on the number of television stations you can \nown. Or, the number of radio stations you can own.\n  Why is that important? We now have in law a limit that you can only \nown 12 television stations. It says 12 is the limit; and those 12 can \nreach no more than 25 percent of the American population. Now, why \nwould we have a law like that? Well, because we believe that there \nought to be competition in the flow of communications and ideas and in \nthe media.\n  How do you promote competition? By broad-based ownership; that is \nhow. If you get concentration of ownership, if you get half a dozen \ncompanies owning everything, you do not have competition. So we said, \nin the television industry, you can only own 12 television stations \nthat reach no more than 25 percent of the population.\n  Now, we write a bill, the telecommunications bill, that we say \npromotes this idea of competition, and guess what, the bill says, ``By \nthe way, we are going to change the law. Now you can have as many \ntelevision stations as you want. You want to own 100? God bless you. \nYou can own 100. It is no problem with us,'' they said. ``And we want \nto, by the way, allow you to own as many as you want up to 50 percent \nof the population.'' Then they thought better of it and said, ``OK, we \nbetter compromise; 35 percent of the population.'' So you can own as \nmany television stations as you want that reach 35 percent of the \npopulation in this country.\n  Well, anybody worth their salt knows what is going to happen as a \nresult of that. We will see a half dozen companies in America owning \nalmost all the television stations in our country. And if you look \nsurprised 10 years from now when we reach that point and stand on the \nfloor of the Senate and say, ``Gee,'' scratch our head and say, ``Gee, \nI never thought that would happen,'' let me just tell you it is going \nto happen. You know it is going to happen. And it's not good for this \ncountry. This is about pressure, politics, and big money; it is not \nabout good economics and good competition. Look what has already been \nhappening in this country. Mega media mergers. This is not a discussion \nin which I am trying to be pejorative about all these mergers. Some are \nprobably just fine.\n  People say, ``There's all this competition. Why should you worry \nabout somebody owning more than 12 televisions stations? We have 250 \nchannels or 500 channels.'' That sounds interesting. One of the major \nnetworks owns 19 cable channels, 19. So when you say we have 19 \nchannels, is that competition where the same company owns it? I do not \nthink so.\n  Here is a new mega media merger. We witnessed their big grins, \nsmoking their cigars talking about this merger. Time Warner and Turner \nBroadcasting Co. Both are good companies. People I admire work for \nthese companies. But let us look at the size of these companies. Time \nWarner decides to merge with Turner, for a total of $18.7 billion in \nrevenue. Look at their cable holdings: CNN, TBS, TNT, Court TV, HBO, \nCinemax, Comedy Central, Warner Brothers Television Network, New York 1 \nNews Channel, on and on. You see the publications, the cable systems.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if my friend from North Dakota will yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KERREY. First of all, I ask my friend from North Dakota, Mr. \nPresident, is it not the case that one of the arguments we have heard \nall along for this bill that we are going to get more competition?\n  Are Time Warner and Turner competitive?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will we not get less competition as a consequence of \nbringing these two companies together?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, that is exactly the point. When you have mergers, it \nmeans companies that used to be two get married up and now they are \none.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if my friend also will talk about something else \nthat I think is terribly important. That is, all of us, when we go home \nand talk to people who are working, they feel a great deal of \ninsecurity about their jobs today. As I saw that announcement, it seems \nto me I heard them say that there may be somewhere between 5,000 and \n10,000 fewer jobs as a consequence of this merger, that they are \nexpected to have some savings, as they call it, as a consequence. I \nbelieve I also saw Ted Turner is going to get $20 million a year for 5 \nyears and Mike Milken got $50 million for shaking hands, none of which \nI doubt will benefit those people who will lose their jobs.\n  James Fallows the other morning talked about the fact that a single \ncorporation, Boeing, laid more people off in the last 5 years than \nevery corporation in Japan has over that comparable period of time.\n  What is going on, I ask my friend from North Dakota? We heard all \nthrough this debate that this piece of legislation was going to create \njobs, that we are going to get more opportunity, that this is going to \nbe good for the American worker? Do you see it that way?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not see it that way. I am going to go through a \ncouple of charts and talk about the mergers, the corporate weddings \nwhere people get together and say, ``Bigger is better. There used to be \ntwo, we are now going to be one, we don't have to compete. We control \nthe markets.''\n  They say, ``This is all about competition. We are going to have \ncompetition and competition is good for people.'' Not in this case. \nThis is about concentration, the issue of whether you ought to limit \nthe number of television stations you own to 12, as in current law. \nSome feel maybe we ought to make an adjustment. It should not be a \npolitical adjustment by somebody in Congress who says, ``Gee, let's \nremove the shackles from the folks who want to buy 100 television \nstations.'' Maybe that ought to be made by the Federal Communications \nCommission after an \n\n[[Page S 15147]]\nevaluation of what represents effective and good competition, what is \nin the public interest.\n  ABC and Walt Disney got hitched a couple months ago; ABC and Disney. \nLet us look at what all this means. Disney, 11 television stations so \nfar: Walt Disney Television, Touchstone, Buena Vista. They have cable: \nDisney channel, ESPN, Lifetime, they have 10 FM radio stations, 11 AM \nradio stations, publications, retail, motion pictures.\n  Put all of this together and what do they have? Less competition. Is \nthat bad? Not necessarily. I am not saying every merger is bad. I say \nwhen you look at the confluence of mergers in this industry, you cannot \nconclude at the end of that look that this is good for competition. You \ncannot at the same time brag about the virtues of competition and then \ncreate a bill that gives you a fast slide toward more concentration. \nThat does not fit.\n  CBS and Westinghouse just announced they were fond of each other and \ndecided they would have an arrangement to get together. I do not know \nmuch about either of them, but let us look: 15 television stations \nowned by CBS broadcasting; Westinghouse has 18 AM stations, 21 FM \nstations; they have cable channels, publications, a whole range of \nbroadcasting properties, $4.5 billion revenue.\n  Another merger, Gannett and Multimedia--15 television stations, $4.5 \nbillion revenue.\n  NBC and GE, they are folks looking around to figure out who they can \nput together. There have been no mergers here, but there is lots of \nspeculation in the press about if this group is able to be out there \nalone when everybody else is forming new partnerships. Fox, take a look \nat Fox.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if my friend will yield for an additional \nquestion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KERREY. One of the things the public needs to understand, it \nseems to me, is that these companies have been given public franchises. \nThey made their money not as a consequence of going out and starting a \nbusiness and trying to get customers to buy their product. Their \nbusiness began by coming to Washington, DC, and getting a public \nfranchise, in many cases a monopoly franchise.\n  The phone company is a monopoly. It is not a competitive business. It \nis not a farm in North Dakota or a manufacturer in Nebraska. This is \nnot a person who said, ``Gee, I have an idea. I want to go to my bank, \nborrow a little bit of money, put a little bit of my money on the line, \ngo into business and get customers to buy my products.''\n  You have 12 stations on that list on the left. These are franchises \ngranted by the people's Government to these businesses. In the case of \neach of these stations, even if some of them do not make any money, \njust by holding a contract with the Government, the franchise that they \nhave been given has value. They sometimes sell these stations for 20 \ntimes earnings simply because people know that there are a limited \nnumber of franchises. There are only so many that we can grant to these \ncompanies.\n  So they own something that the people have given them, they have made \nmoney as a consequence of the Government having granted them a license, \nand now they come in and object, very often, to us putting rules in \nplace. They say, ``Oh, no, let the market take care of this.''\n  They did not make their money off the market to begin with. \nCertainly, they are out there selling and certainly there is a \ncompetitive environment. It seems to me, however, that it is a \ndifferent kind of business than most small businesses and most \nentrepreneurs and most free enterprise capitalists who start off and \ntry and engage in the competitive exercise of producing revenue from \ncustomers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with the Senator. The point is, these are \nimportant properties, and the reason we provide them franchises is the \ncommunication industry is a very important industry. I am not unmindful \nof the fact that some of these are very good corporations, very well \nrun. I am not critical of individual corporations. I am critical of a \nmindset that says it does not matter how big you get, you can combine \nall you want and earn all you want and the public interest be damned. I \nam critical of that, because I think there is a public interest in \nmaintaining and fostering competition in this country. The fewer \ncorporations you have in an industry, the greater concentration you \nhave, by definition the less competition you have. And that does not \nauger well for the American people.\n  The Wall Street Journal has an article. I want to read the headline: \n``Immediate Consolidation Has Left and Right Worried About Big Firms \nGetting a Lock on Information.''\n  You talk about an odd couple. A picture of Bill Bennett and Jesse \nJackson. That is both ends of the political spectrum, both of them \nessentially saying the same things: Worried about media concentration, \nmedia consolidation, stemming the flow of ideas, the competition that \ncomes from having ideas moving from different centers of energy.\n  We need to reform our telecommunications laws. But this bill is in \ndeep, deep trouble. If you try to push this bill through the White \nHouse, I think the President is going to veto it. I think what he said \npublicly indicates he is going to veto it, and I think he should veto \nit. He ought not in a million years allow a bill to come to the White \nHouse where a bunch of politicians decide, ``Hey, boys, let's take the \nlimit off the number of television stations you can own. Let's say the \nsky is the limit.'' That is not in the public interest. That may be \npart of a deal somebody wants to make around here, but that is not in \nthe public interest.\n  That is why when we had a vote on an amendment I offered, with the \nhelp of the Senator Bob Kerry from Nebraska, we prevailed, that is why \nwe won. A lot of folks did not feel comfortable voting against an \namendment that says, ``Hey, let's have the FCC determine what kind of \nlimits are in the public interest, instead of a bunch of politicians \nsaying we are arbitrarily going to say the sky is the limit on the \nnumber of television stations you own.''\n  So we won the vote, and then, politics of course--and somebody \nchanges their vote and we lose.\n  The reason I come to the floor today is to say, if you try to push \nthis kind of bill without a role for the Department of Justice on the \nissue of antitrust and on the issue of where there is competition with \nrespect to the telephone industry, and when local carriers who have a \nmonopoly are free to go out and compete in the long distance area, if \nyou try to push a bill without the opportunity for the Justice \nDepartment to weigh in on this question of public interest and \ncompetition, I think the President will veto it.\n  If you try to push a telecommunications bill through conference \ncommittee that says the sky is the limit on television ownership, we do \nnot care about concentration--the bigger the better, and the less \ncompetition the better, I think this President will veto it.\n  In conference, if we can make changes in this bill dealing with \nownership limits on television stations and radio stations and make \nsome changes with respect to the role of the Department of Justice, I \nthink this bill will advance. If it keeps protection for universal \nservice, then this bill can and will advance and should be signed by \nthe President. If not, I hope very much the President says, no, this is \nradical and extreme and should not pass.\n  I yield the floor to my friend from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend from North \nDakota for this presentation. I would like to be able to vote for a \npiece of legislation. I have spent a great deal of time on \ntelecommunications. I am prepared to not only embrace the future but \nplace a bet that there is tremendous opportunity for us in technology. \nMany of our systems need to rapidly acquire the transmission capacity \nto use these new technologies, as the computer moves from a calculating \ndevice to a communication device--I think, especially, for example, for \nour university systems.\n  I just had a meeting a couple of weeks ago in Nebraska with an \nindividual with a very large software company who happens to be from a \nfarm not far from Ashland, NE, and who came back to try to help us \nbring computer technology into our university. It is a tough \ntransition. The university is sitting there with a real problem. They \n\n[[Page S 15148]]\nhave increased enrollment as people recognize that a college degree is \nworth an awful lot more than a high school degree. Student enrollment \nhas almost doubled in a 4-year period as that demand goes up. In \naddition, what a person needs to know coming out of college is that \nthere is a doubling, tripling, quadrupling of the requirements of the \nuniversities and they cannot get the professors and instructors to do \nmore for less. The tax base will not allow us to build more buildings \nrapidly enough to be able to accommodate the demands. Only one thing \ncan do that for us, and that is computer technology.\n  We are trying to figure out how to get these systems into an old \nsystem that does not replace the old system but augments it. Well, \nthere are real serious problems trying to make those adjustments. We \njust got a couple of grants to match local commitments for three \nschools in the State through the Department of Education, and that will \nleverage a great deal of the private sector, as well as local money, to \nget the job done. But those are a couple of schools amongst many who \nare trying to bring this technology into the educational environment. I \nwas pleased that a majority of this body, the Senate--I do not believe \nit is in the House bill--but in the Senate language we included a \nprovision I cosponsored which provides for preferential rates for local \nK-12 schools. Connectivity may represent only 17 percent of the total \ncost of bringing information technology into local schools, but it is \nan awful lot of money. It is a principal barrier for many communities \nthat do not, as I say, have competitive choice; they do not have \ncompetitive choice now, and they are not likely to see it for a long \nperiod of time.\n  So I do not want anybody to suffer under the illusion that I do not \nsupport change. I believe our telecommunications laws need to be \nchanged. I am prepared to embrace the future. I am prepared to put down \na bet. I am prepared to help institutions from the K-through-12 \nenvironment through the postsecondary, and indeed for Congress to bring \nthis technology in so it becomes part of our core competency so that we \nare able to improve our efficiency.\n  We are going to debate in reconciliation the earned-income tax \ncredit. One of the biggest reasons EITC has had trouble has nothing to \ndo with the merits of being able to help people at the lower end of the \neconomic scale--a woman, for example, that you see at your checkout \nstand at the grocery store making $7, $8 an hour, $12,000 to $15,000 a \nyear, trying to support a couple of kids. That is better than being on \nwelfare. So we want to refund your taxes and give you a couple thousand \ndollars so you can buy health insurance. Well, the IRS has a tough time \ndoing it because it does not have a good information system.\n  I am prepared to embrace technology and place a bet because I believe \nthere is tremendous merit in it. However, if we change the law to \nproduce less competition, not more, to concentrate the power into fewer \nand fewer hands, to concentrate not only the power of economic \ndecisions--but, I point out to Americans, it will concentrate the power \nof the individuals to be making decisions about what to tell us is \ngoing on in the world--these deals being done in anticipation of this \nlaw being changed will present Americans in their homes with fewer news \nchoices. Fewer people will be telling us what is going on out there in \nthe world.\n  I would love to be able to stand on this floor and vote for a piece \nof legislation that changes the law. I believe strongly, first of all, \nthat there needs to be preferential rates for education. I believe \nstrongly what the Senator from North Dakota is saying, that \nconcentration in television stations would be a mistake. I believe \nstrongly, as well, that we are far better off, instead of having a 10-\npart test that the Federal Communications Commission is going to look \nat to determine whether there is competition, to have the Department of \nJustice with a role in making the decision regarding entry by the \nregional Bell operating companies into the long distance market.\n  Mr. President, earlier, before I came to the floor, I was discussing \nwith staff the reconciliation bill, trying to prepare myself for that \ndebate. There is a lot about it that we do not know yet. We have not \nseen the details on the Medicaid proposal or the Medicare proposal, and \nthere is a lot of discussion on the tax side of it and so forth.\n  One of the things I have said to staff is--and I will say to the \npeople at home when discussing this--before we can talk about what kind \nof a budget we have here in Washington, we have to have jobs and growth \nand income out there in the private sector. That is where the money \ncomes from. One of the most remarkable constants in this town over the \nlast 70-80 years, really--is that the percentage of money that we \nwithdraw for Federal expenditures from the economy has stayed, except \nfor World War II and the Vietnam war, roughly 19 percent. It is about \n$1 out of $5 we bring to Washington for a variety of things. One of the \ndisturbing things I find is that we are transferring more and more of \nthat and investing less of it. Almost 7 cents out of every 10 cents, or \n70 cents out of every dollar today, is transferred out for retirement, \nhealth care, or other sorts of things. That is a real concern.\n  We now know there is a great deal of consensus--and some may not \nbelieve this, but I believe that it is important for us to have laws, \nwhether it is the regulations we have or the tax laws we have, and it \nis important for us to have expenditure patterns that produce economic \ngrowth.\n  Without economic growth, without people out there that are willing to \ninvest money and willing to run the risk, whether it is a big or small \nbusiness, it seems to me that we have serious problems.\n  Indeed, during the week that we took off to be at home last week, the \nCensus Bureau came out with numbers that showed that as a result of the \neconomic growth that we have been enjoying in the last 15-some months, \nwe have seen the rates of poverty drop--not just the rates of poverty, \nbut the number of people who are trapped in poverty has decreased. In \nalmost every State--certainly in Nebraska--as a result of economic \ngrowth, we saw a substantial decrease of almost 20 percent in the \nnumber of people who are in poverty.\n  Now, the alarming thing in that--we know if we have rules and \nregulations and tax structure and expenditure patterns that produce \neconomic growth, which we have to constantly watch and make sure that \nwe have, if we have economic growth then we do see the boats of those \nwho are poor begin to lift, a good piece of news.\n  However, the Census Bureau said there is a continuation of the \nwidening between the economic haves--those in the work force, not on \nwelfare, at the lower end of the economic spectrum --and those like \nMembers of Congress that are at the higher end of the economic \nspectrum. There is a widening gap. The market growth all by itself does \nnot seem to be fixing that problem.\n  One of the downward pressures upon wages in this country is the \nconcentration of power. No question about it. You cannot read whether \nit is a bank merger or a megamedia deal that the Senator from North \nDakota talked about earlier, every single one of the transactions talks \nabout thousands of people being laid off. Every one.\n  You have the Time-Warner-Turner deal up there earlier, that was the \nmost egregious example, because they said 5,000 to 10,000 jobs would be \nlost. However, the good news is Ted Turner will get $20 million a year \nfor 5 years and a convicted felon will get $50 million--Mike Milken.\n  Workers out there are saying, well, we are doing everything we are \nsupposed to be doing; should the laws of this country be written so \nthat people can come in and merge the deal? And maybe it is a good \ndeal. I am not coming down here proposing we change the law to prohibit \nthis, but it is painfully obvious that inside of this transaction we \nare creating something that will create significant problems: 5,000 to \n10,000 people being laid off, and a couple of guys making a heck of a \nlot of money.\n  It is not like we are talking about somebody starting a chain of \nrestaurants or somebody--a doctor or somebody--that started a business \nfrom scratch.\n  These are companies that made their money as a consequence of a \nGovernment franchise. They were given the right to broadcast. They were \ngiven the \n\n[[Page S 15149]]\nright to operate cable companies. They did not go out there and start \nthis business out there in the wild blue yonder.\n  Mr. BURNS. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BURNS. Would you also relate what you are talking about to the \nHomestead Act?\n  Were the farms and lands granted to individual ownership by an act of \nthe Homestead Act?\n  Mr. KERREY. If you want to talk of the Homestead Act, it has many \nspecific requirements for the individual to develop, and if they worked \nthe land and developed the land, they owned the land.\n  Mr. BURNS. Would you make the same comparison that spectrum--even \nthough granted by this Government--has no value unless investment is \nmade in equipment to make it valuable in the Government, I suggest to \nmy friend in Nebraska, the Government did not go out there and buy--did \nnot put up the tower, did not pay for the technology.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to acknowledge that is the case, in fact. No \nquestion that it is true that when we give somebody a monopoly \nfranchise, when we give them that and say it is yours, there is no \nquestion they have to make an investment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Did we not make the same requirements when we gave the \nland, probably what your house sets on, and our house and my house, \nprobably the folks up there, did we not make the same demand that we \nhad to make----\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Montana, what is \nthe point? I acknowledge that is the case.\n  Mr. BURNS. The point is that the land was granted and then there was \na property right. The point is there was a property right--they could \nbuy and sell that land from that point on without Government intrusion.\n  I just want to make that comparison, and I also ask is there anything \nin this act----\n  Mr. KERREY. I can answer the question, now I understand what the \nSenator is saying.\n  You are saying that bandwidth and a piece of real estate are the \nsame? They are not the same. In that regard they are not the same. The \npeople's airwaves are licensed.\n  Mr. BURNS. If it were not for the Homestead Act you could say it is \npeople's land.\n  Mr. KERREY. It is not the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Montana, did the Senator \nbelieve we should not pass laws restricting what broadcasters can put \nover the airwaves? We do not have similar laws for people in their \nhome. I can engage in any kind of discussion I want inside my house.\n  Do you think, I ask the Senator from Montana, should we have \npornography laws in place or let the market dictate--they own it, for \ngosh sakes. Let them put whatever they want over the airwaves. Does the \nSenator from Montana believe the Government should not write decency \nlaws in place to protect the communities?\n  Mr. BURNS. I imagine if you did that on private land you will have a \nneighbor holler at you.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask the Senator from Montana a question: Does he \nbelieve that the people of the United States, having granted a \nfranchise to somebody to operate a service using a piece of the \nfrequency bandwidth, should say, ``You own it, do whatever you want? It \nis yours, have some fun with it. If you want to show pornography on \ntelevision at 6 o'clock go do it.''\n  I am asking the Senator from Montana, does he believe that the \npeople's laws should be written to protect against pornography, or does \nhe believe we ought to change the laws to say, no, you own that, we get \nrid of pornography laws, let the market take care of it?\n  Mr. BURNS. I say there are certain rules but there are rules and \nregulations placed on land ownership.\n  I want to say that the land originally that was purchased by this \nGovernment through the Louisiana Purchase was paid for by the taxpayers \nof this country, taken from the Treasury. And then it was given, 160 \nacres to anybody that wanted it, who could stake it out and build a \nhouse and make it produce. After that it becomes--\n  I say what is the difference when you take a grant from a Government \non a resource----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me reclaim my time, if the Senator would indulge me.\n  Mr. KERREY. I have the floor, Mr. President. I yielded to the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana to ask a question and we have gone \nbeyond that.\n  I am perfectly willing to have a debate about the comparative \nanalysis between the Homestead Act and private property and franchises \ngranted to phone companies to have a monopoly to deliver a local \ntelephone service or to a television station or radio station to \nbroadcast over public airspace.\n  I am perfectly willing to acknowledge certainly there is a similarity \nin having granted that franchise that people make substantial \ninvestments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would yield, the Senator from Montana \nraises an interesting but irrelevant question.\n  It is always interesting to hear irrelevant questions but this is \nirrelevant.\n  I guess the proposition you are trying to develop here is that \nconcentration does not matter. If you receive a franchise to send a \ntelevision signal, you have that and you do what you want. If you want \nto concentrate and bring them into one ownership pattern in this \ncountry that is fine.\n  The issue here we are talking about is concentration--not the \ntelevision band, but the concentration.\n  I bet the Senator from Montana cares a little bit about concentration \nin the meatpacking industry. We have not talked about that. But I bet \nwhen you have three, four, five companies commanding 85 to 90 percent \nof the meatpacking industry, creating the neck on top of that bottle \nthat forces down ranchers and holds their prices down, I bet the \nSenator from Montana cares about that.\n  If he does, and I think he does, and I care not only about that but I \ncare about the big agrifactories that will be the superagrifactories \nfarming America pretty soon, the fewer family farmers we have the more \nconcentration you have and the less advantage you will have for the \nconsumer because it is not in this country's interest to see \nconcentration. It is in this country's interest to see broad-based \neconomic ownership.\n  If it is true that the Senator from Montana believes that \nconcentration in the meatpacking industry is a problem, and I think he \ndoes, and God bless him for that, I think that is in the interest of \nMontana ranchers and North Dakota ranchers to believe that, is there a \npoint at which the Senator from Montana would believe that \nconcentration in this industry is a problem?\n  If there is, then we ought to debate where is that point. He may \nfigure you can have a dozen more of these mergers and there is not a \nproblem but this will be a point, I assume, where he might also think \nthat the concentration in an industry we are moving about ideas and \ninformation is as dangerous in this country as the concentration in the \nmeatpacking industry is to his ranchers.\n  If that is the case, then we ought to be debating not whether \nconcentration is good or bad, but how many more of these does one need \nto see before one understands that saying the sky is the limit on the \nnumber of television stations you can own is good for America. That is \nthe point we are making today.\n  Mr. BURNS. I would get very upset. We have already filed an action, \nas far as IBP is concerned, on meat packing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So the Senator agrees the concentration of the \nmeatpacking industry is damaging?\n  Mr. BURNS. I would. I would be very concerned about this. But there \nis nothing in this piece of legislation as passed by this Senate that \nrepealed the Sherman Antitrust Act. We did not repeal the Clayton Act, \nor the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.\n  In other words, the Justice Department is not cut out of this. \nSomebody has to bring an action, and I imagine before now--and, \nremember, this is happening under the present law. This is happening \nunder the present law. Not under one we are going to go to conference \non.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But some of this is happening in anticipation of us \npassing what my colleague and others have supported. In fact, some of \nthese mergers now have more television stations involved than they are \npermitted to hold. Why would they do that? Because \n\n[[Page S 15150]]\nthey know some in here have said we want to take the limits off the \nnumber of television stations you can own, so, because they are going \nto do that for us, we are going to start gearing up and have more \nstations than the current law allows. So they are anticipating what you \nare going to do for them. I am saying what you are going to do for them \nis not good for this country, that is the point.\n  Mr. BURNS. This Senator is not going to get into the business of \nforecasting what might happen. I am saying this is probably the biggest \njobs bill we will pass. I just wanted to throw that in there.\n  Do we repeal any of those antitrust acts that are now the law of the \nland? No. And, on spectrum, has it any value at all until someone makes \nthe investment to make it valuable? And then does it become a property \nright? That is what we have to see.\n  Those of us who live in the West--I think the Senator from North \nDakota is very sound in his thinking, and understands the same values \nthat I understand, because western North Dakota and eastern Montana are \nawfully a lot alike, on the way they think. But, if we took that case, \nbasically, then maybe we should not have granted all that land to \nprivate ownership. Maybe we should have Government control all the way. \nIn other words, I do not know how it is halfway/halfway/halfway.\n  But I ask those questions. I would be concerned about concentration \nbecause I think we will finally get to a point where Justice will have \nto step in on the meatpacking industry. But we have the laws in place \nfor them to do so. The same laws would apply to concentration here.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My point is--and let me restate the point, probably more \nclearly. My point is on both areas of this bill. One is the trigger of \nwhen you have competition in the local telephone exchange so the \nmonopoly carriers there, the Bell systems, are allowed to go out and \ncompete against long-distance carriers. That trigger is a trigger that \ndoes not have the active participation of the Justice Department \ndetermining when there is competition. So you have, in my judgment, \nlargely eliminated or limited Justice's role. Second, my point is we \nhave affirmatively changed the law in this legislation that says: We \nused to say you can only own 12 television stations in this country \nbecause we thought that was in the public interest, but, guess what, we \nhave folks here generous enough to believe you ought to be able to own \nas many as you like, the sky is the limit. Both of those changes, both \nof those actions taken by this Chamber, in my judgment, move against \nthe public interest. That is the point of it.\n  The fact is, there are things in this bill that are good. I agree \nwith that. And we ought to do a bill. I agree with that. But you move \nthis bill with those provisions in it forward and it is going to get \nvetoed and it ought to get vetoed. That is the point of it.\n  We are about to appoint conferees to sit and have a conference, and \nthere is not much disagreement between the House and Senate on these \nprovisions, unfortunately. We have sort of the same mindset. My point \nis, it is a mindset not good for the people of this country.\n  The Senator from Montana makes some interesting points on the issue \nof spectrum. ``Is it not true that when spectrum is given someone and \nthat person makes an investment, does that not enhance the value of the \nspectrum?'' So, of course, the Senator wins a debate we were not \nhaving. Of course. That is not the point. The point is concentration.\n  It is the point in both areas we are talking about, the telephone \nservice and competition, the issue of concentration, and the issue of \nwhen the Department of Justice has a role and what role. And also the \nissue of concentration of media ownership.\n  I should put up a couple of other charts. I had a chart of TCI, a \nvery large cable company, and a chart with Viacom, which has \nsubstantial holdings in a number of areas.\n  Let me point out, it is not my intention to say many of these \ncompanies are bad companies. They are wonderful companies, that have \ndone breathtaking things in communications for which I offer them my \nheartfelt congratulations. Substantial progress has been made as a \nresult of inventive people who work in these companies.\n  My point is concentration of ownership. I am a Jeffersonian Democrat. \nI am one of those people who believe broad-based economic ownership and \nhealthy, robust competition is what advances and drives the best \ninterests of this country. Concentration always augers against the \ninterests of the market system in this country, in my judgment.\n  I will be happy to yield again to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have said about all I need to say on \nthis subject, having talked on it previously. I just say again, I would \nlove to vote for a piece of legislation. I hope the conference \ncommittee comes back with one in a form I am able to vote for it. I am \nprepared not to just embrace the future but to make a bet, based on my \nstrong belief that there is tremendous opportunity in education, \ntremendous opportunity for jobs in these new technologies.\n  But there are 100 million households in this country and each one of \nthose individual households has very little economic power. When it \ncomes time for them to make a purchase of cable service or phone \nservice, when they are buying information services they are not buying \nat $1 million a month. They are buying at $20, $30, $40, $50 a month; \nvery little economic power, very little. And the 16,000 school \ndistricts in America that operate individual schools at the local \nlevel, they have very little economic power. Both as a consumer of \ntelecommunications services and as somebody who has been working with \nschool districts in Nebraska, trying to get them hooked up to the \nInternet, trying to get them enhanced information services, I can tell \nyou that when you do not have much economic power you do not have much \nchoice. You do not have much leverage. You do not have much \nopportunity.\n  These guys who are doing these deals, they have real power. When you \nhave a couple of billion dollars you can leverage an awful lot. But \nwhen you do not have much economic power you cannot.\n  The importance of this is not only consumer choice, not only the \nkinds of decisions that our citizens will be making as a consequence of \nwho tells them what is going on in the world--and they are getting \nfewer and fewer numbers of people telling them what is going on in the \nworld--not only is it relevant for those individuals in the household, \nbut it is terribly relevant for our economy. Our economy has been \nrobust and develops as a consequence of a competitive environment. The \ncompetition that matters the most is that entrepreneur who starts in \nbusiness, who says, ``I would like to approach that household, I would \nlike to sell packaged information services in the households in Omaha, \nthe households throughout this country, I would like to be able to \napproach those consumers and try to give them a competitive option and \na competitive alternative.''\n  Those are the people that this legislation ignores. This legislation \nhas been put together with far more concern about the national \ncompanies, the regional companies--whether it is long distance or \nlocal--who come here and say this is what this is going to do for me, \nthis is what it is going to do for the other guy.\n  This has been a balancing act from the beginning, between a range of \ncorporations, long distance and local versus cable versus publishers \nversus all these big guys and gals who come into Washington and have \naccess and are able to come and talk to us. This has not been put \ntogether by the entrepreneurs of America. It has not been put together \nby the consumers of America. It has not been put together by people who \nare either going to create the jobs--and most of the new jobs are not \ngoing to be created by these megacompanies. They are going to be \ncreated by the smaller startup companies. It has not been put together, \nin my judgment, in a fashion that is going to enable competition to \nreally produce the benefits this Nation, I think, deserves and needs \nand expects.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was originally considering, along with \nthe Senator from Nebraska, offering a motion to instruct conferees this \nmorning. But it turned out to be something that we thought was probably \nnot \n\n[[Page S 15151]]\nfruitful and not the thing to do. So we, instead, came to the floor to \ndescribe a couple of major areas of this bill that tell us, and I think \ntell a lot of people, this bill is in trouble.\n  I hope after a lot of reflection that conferees will recant or repent \nor rethink these two issues and address the issue of competition in the \nright way. You cannot advertise competition when in fact the product \nyou are describing is enhancing concentration. That is mislabeling. \nThere is much to commend this legislation for, but these areas are of \ngreat concern to us.\n  I hope very much that we get a different result out of this \nconference. We decided not to offer a motion to instruct. But there is \ngoing to be a lot of attention paid to this conference by us, and by a \nlot of others in this country. The result of this conference will have \na significant impact on what people in this country will experience in \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have finished my presentation. The \nSenator from Nebraska has finished. The Senator from Vermont wanted 3 \nor 4 or 5 minutes. I will allow the Senator from Vermont to take \nwhatever time he wishes and ask that he return the remaining time.\n  It is my understanding that the other side does not intend to use his \ntime. When the Senator from Vermont completes his statement, we are \nfinished with respect to the time agreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from North Dakota. I \nwas at another hearing, and I heard this debate was proceeding on the \nfloor. I am concerned that we may end up in a situation with this \nconference where, among other things, the Senate does not even have \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee on the conference.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nThurmond, who chairs the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and I have written to the majority and minority leaders on \nthis legislation asking that we be named, or people from our \nsubcommittee on antitrust be named to the conference. I believe the \nHouse has named a number of Judiciary Committee members to their \nconference. Yet, we do not have anybody from the Judiciary Committee \nhere.\n  There are significant antitrust issues. There are significant \nconsumer issues. There are significant competitive issues, all of which \nhave been looked at, explored and discussed by the Judiciary Committee. \nYet, Senate Judiciary members will have no input in the conference, and \nwe all know the bill is going to be written in conference.\n  When we remove competitive incentives, we all know what happens. Take \na look at the cable industry. If you are fortunate enough to get cable \ntelevision in Fairfax County, VA, you are faced with using antiquated \nequipment in the form of a set-top box that is kept on only because the \nconsumers have to pay a monthly fee to use it even though the stuff \nwould be in the trash bin otherwise. You pay a significant amount of \nmoney. But they can do that. They can give you an inferior product. \nThey can give you out-of-date equipment. They can charge you for the \nuse of outdated equipment because the cable company has a monopoly.\n  We are going to see some of the same things happen here without \ncompetition and without the consumer being considered in any way, shape \nor manner.\n  This bothers me a great, great deal, and it should bother all \nSenators, as it does Senator Thurmond and myself. This is not a \nconservative issue. Obviously, the two of us join on this question. \nBut, rather, it is a basic, good-sense consumer issue. If you end up \ngetting gouged in your cost, the people gouged will be both Republicans \nand Democrats and Independents. The people gouged will be in the North, \nthe South, the East, and the West. One thing they will all share in \ncommon may not be a political ideology, but it will be the pain they \nwill feel in their pocketbooks.\n  Yesterday, the House appointed 34 conferees to this conference. Of \nthose 34, 14 of them came from the House Judiciary Committee. We do not \nsee--as yet anyway--any Senate Judiciary conferees at all. They have \n14. We do not even see any coming from the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  As I said, earlier, Senator Thurmond and I sent a letter to the \nchairman and the ranking members of the Commerce Committee making clear \nour view that you should have Senate Judiciary Committee members. We \nwould help with the conference to assure that those issues relating to \nantitrust and competition are resolved in a principled manner, good \nboth for American business and American consumers.\n  If anyone would look at the hearings that Senator Thurmond and I and \nother members of our subcommittee have held on telecommunications \nlegislation, they would see stressed the need for telecommunications \nreform both for business and for consumers.\n  Certainly, it does not take any special knowledge to know how \ncritical telecommunications is to the economic health of our country, \nor to the education of our children, or to the delivery of health care \nservices to our citizens, or to the overall quality of life in this \ncountry. In fact, the explosion of all these new technologies in \ntelecommunications has fueled many of our newest innovations.\n  In the way I run my office--I know the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer does the same--we do virtually everything in telecommunications \nby our computers. Just as frequently as we see memos or letters on \npaper, we also see electronic messages sent by computers. I stay \nconnected by computer and telephone at home in the Washington area, in \nmy home in Vermont, and at my office here at the Capitol. It is a \ngiven. When I get to Vermont this weekend, I will in effect be able to \nbring my office and my files, my filing cabinets, my staff, and \neverything else with me with a laptop computer. More and more of us do \nthat. More and more of us are more efficient doing that.\n  But when we have legislation like this, we want to make sure that it \nexpands those abilities and not contract them. Our challenge is to keep \npace with the changes in the marketplace. But, if in keeping pace with \nthem you pass legislation that stifles the growth of the industry, that \nquashes the opportunity presented by rapidly expanding \ntelecommunications technology, then we have done a disservice to the \ncountry. We have done a disservice to consumers. We have done a \ndisservice to business. We have done a disservice to the competitive \nedge of our Nation as we go into the next century.\n  So we have to make sure that our laws governing our \ntelecommunications industries provide for future growth but to the \nbenefit of consumers. We have to make sure that the promise of this \nlegislation to open up competition in telecommunications is fulfilled \nbecause that is the bottom-line purpose of this legislation: to open up \ncompetition in telecommunications. If we do it wrong, we will not see \nnew competition. We will see competition stifled. We will not see new \ninnovation. We will see innovation stifled. We will not see consumers \nbenefited. We will see consumers harmed. We will not see a cutting-edge \nindustry having a chance to expand, but rather see the cutting-edge \nindustry facing a dead end.\n  We have to understand that the Senate telecommunications bill is \nsignificantly different from the one passed by the House. This \nconference is going to be one of the most complicated, complex and \ndifficult ones we have had in years. The conference is going to have to \npick and choose between provisions in the two bills, provisions that \nare in many cases unreconcilable. They are not provisions like in an \nappropriations bill where maybe we can just split the difference. It is \na case that you are either going to have to craft an entirely new \nprovision or drop one or the other.\n  I think that given that situation it would be helpful to have input \nof Members with expert knowledge in antitrust issues. In fact, on the \nmodification of final judgment, the MFJ, the House, to their credit, \nrealizes that and has put Judiciary Committee members on the \nconference. The Senate has yet to do it.\n  In fact, the administration now threatens to veto this legislation \nfor a number of reasons, including the need \n\n[[Page S 15152]]\nfor a stronger test for Bell company entry into the long-distance \nbusiness and also a more meaningful role for the Justice Department.\n  I also share the administration's concern about the legislation not \nonly taking the lid off but also promoting increased cable rates. I \nmean, we have already lived through a period of skyrocketing cable \nrates. Congress took action to address the problem of cable rate \nincreases when we passed the 1992 Cable Act over a Presidential veto. \nLet us not go backward in time, but go forward with responsible \ntelecommunications reform.\n  Again, I use Fairfax County as an example. Here you see rates go up \nfor antiquated equipment. Rates go up, we are told, for all these \nchannels we get, most of which I doubt if anybody including the cable \nsystem ever watch. But if at 3 o'clock in the morning, you are moved \nwith a great desire to buy 10 pounds of zircons, you have at least five \nchannels that you are paying for to know where you can buy those 10 \npounds of zircons. Or, if you need to have your soul saved there are at \nleast 10 different people at any given time who will tell you that your \nsoul will be saved but only if you send the money to them. I guess they \ngive you a plaque saying you have been saved. None of the 10 says why \nthe other 9 should not get the money and why you get less soul \nsalvation from them.\n  Well, that is fine, but I just wonder whether there might be a little \nmore filtering, a little more selectivity, if there was competition \nhere. Without competition, their rates go up. We see the same thing in \nlocal telephone service. Their rates go up because competition is not \nyet available.\n  Now, we know that there is a need for new legislation. Certainly the \nlegislation from the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and early 1980's cannot \nkeep up with the technology of today. But let us make sure we do not \nturn the clock back both for business and consumers. Rather, give us a \nchance to use the marketing and technological genius of our great \ncountry as we go into the next century.\n  I worry also about issues like criminal penalties for engaging in \nconstitutionally protected speech that occurs over computer networks. \nRight now a provision in the Senate telecommunications bill would \npenalize you, if you are, for example, a botanist and click onto an \nonline article on wild orchids, but suddenly find something that is not \nthe kind of wild orchid you grow in your planter but reference to an \nobscene movie. The fact that you even clicked on, downloaded and found \nout what it was, you could be prosecuted. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer uses the Internet as I do, uses his computer as I do. Not that \nthis would ever happen, but suppose he sends me a message disagreeing--\nI say it would probably never happen--but disagreeing with a political \nposition I took. And suppose I sent back a message to him and in the \nheat of the moment was less than senatorial in my courtesy toward him \nand used terms that neither he nor I would use. I use this, of course, \nas a hypothetical, Mr. President. I could be prosecuted under this bill \nfor doing it.\n  The interesting thing is he might be prosecuted for receiving it even \nbefore he knew what was in there, and certainly should he get incensed \nby what he received he could be in a real heap of hurt if he sent back, \nand you're one, too.\n  These are the kinds of silly things that we have crafted in this \ntelecommunications bill that we ought to take a second look at. It \nmight make us all feel good at the moment, but the long-range \nimplications are weird and we ought to look at all of these issues.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the distinguished \nranking members of both of those committees and so many other Members \nin this body, Republicans and Democrats alike, have worked so hard to \nget a bill out of here. Let us not in almost a sense of final relief of \nthrowing it out the door, throw out something that is going to come \nback and bite us. It will not just bite the 100 of us, but hundreds of \nmillions of consumers and dozens and dozens of businesses that deserve \nbetter.\n  So let us appoint Judiciary Committee members. It does not guarantee \nthat everything that I might want or Senator Thurmond might want would \nbe on that bill by any means. But it might mean that those with \nexpertise in the areas of antitrust, first amendment rights, and so on, \nwould have a choice, and we might have better legislation as a result.\n  Mr. President, I understand that neither the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota nor anybody else wishes to speak over here.\n  I might ask the distinguished Senator from South Dakota if it is his \nsame feeling as the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, that upon \ncompletion of this we just yield back all the time?\n  I understand it is, Mr. President, and I yield back all time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would just like to make a couple of \nremarks regarding the distinguished Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In that case I think I will reserve the remainder of the \ntime, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would say that through this \nlegislation we are trying to address and correct some of the problems \nraised, and we will be proceeding with the conferees after they are \nagreed to. I thank all of my colleagues who have participated in this \ndebate, and I am prepared to yield back the remainder of our time on \nthis side.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate disagrees \nwith the amendments of the House, agrees to a conference requested by \nthe House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair \nappoints the following conferees: Senators Pressler, Stevens, McCain, \nBurns, Gorton, Lott, Hollings, Inouye, Ford, Exon, and Rockefeller.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15144-5", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15152-S15153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HOUSE-SENATE CONFERENCE ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORM HAS IMPLICATIONS \n            FOR FIRST AMENDMENT APPLICATION TO THE INTERNET\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Senate appointed Members to \nthe House-Senate conference committee on telecommunications reform. The \nhistoric nature of this legislation and its effect on the lives of \nevery citizen of this country goes well beyond the issues associated \nwith regulation of telephony, cable rates, and other forms of \ncommunications. Mr. President, this legislation has dramatic \nimplications for the first amendment rights of every American.\n  Mr. President, I am referring to the precedent-setting provisions in \nS. 652 and H.R. 1555 regarding indecency on the Internet. I am here \ntoday to urge each Senate conferee to take the first amendment issues \nof these bills seriously and to consider the ramifications of these \nprovisions not just for speech on the Internet but for all speech in \nthis country. During conference deliberations, I urge Senate conferees \nto strike the potentially unconstitutional provisions regarding on-line \nindecency contained in both the Senate and House versions of this \nlegislation.\n  The issue of Government censorship of the Internet is a critical \nfirst amendment matter. Guaranteeing the Internet is free of speech \nrestrictions, other than the statutory restrictions on obscenity and \npornography on the Internet which already exist, should be of concern \nto all Americans who want to be able to freely discuss issues of \nimportance to them regardless of whether others might view those \nstatements as offensive or distasteful.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, the Exon-Coats amendment, added to S. \n652 on the Senate floor, included provisions which I believe violate \nthe first amendment rights of Internet users and will have a chilling \neffect on further economic and technological development of this \nexciting new form of \n\n[[Page S 15153]]\ntelecommunications. When this matter was considered on the Senate \nfloor, I urged my colleagues to reject the Exon-Coats amendment in \nfavor of legislation requiring the Department of Justice to carefully \nstudy the applicability of existing obscenity statutes to computer \nnetworks, which Senator Leahy and I offered as an alternative.\n  Specifically I have objected to the indecency provisions of S. 652 \nfor the following reasons:\n  First, indecent speech, unlike obscenity, is protected under the \nfirst amendment to the U.S. Constitution; second, an outright ban on \nindecent speech on computer networks is not the least restrictive means \nof protecting children from exposure to such speech on the Internet. \nThere are a number of existing tools available today to allow parents \nto protect their children from materials which they find inappropriate; \nthird, a ban on indecent speech to minors on the Internet will \nunnecessarily require adults to self-censor their communications on the \nInternet; fourth, since indecency will be defined by community \nstandards, protected speech by adults will be diminished to what might \nbe considered decent in the most conservative community in the United \nStates and to what might be appropriate for very young children; fifth, \nthe on-line indecency provisions will establish different standards for \nthe same material that appears in print and on the computer screen. \nWorks that are completely legal in the bookstore or on the library \nshelf would be criminal if transmitted over computer networks; sixth, \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that the degree to which content can be \nregulated depends on the characteristics of the media. The unique \nnature of interactive media must be considered when determining how \nbest to protect children. S. 652 ignores the degree to which users have \ncontrol over the materials to which they are exposed as well as the \ndecentralized nature of interactive technology which liken it more to \nprint media than broadcast media.\n  Mr. President, the Senate was not alone in its rush to judgment on \nthe controversial and highly emotional issue of pornography accessed \nvia computer networks. Section 403 of H.R. 1555, known as the Hyde \namendment, raises equally serious concerns with respect to the first \namendment and appears antithetical to other provisions contained in the \nHouse bill. The prohibitions against on-line indecency contained in the \nHyde language will have a similar chilling effect on the on-line \ncommunications of adults. The Hyde amendment is also inconsistent with \nthe more market oriented and less intrusive provisions of section 104 \nof H.R. 1555, the On-Line Family Empowerment Act introduced by \nCongressmen Cox and Wyden, as adopted by the House. Section 104 \nrecognizes that first amendment protections must apply to on-line \ncommunications by prohibiting FCC content regulation of the Internet. \nThe Cox-Wyden provisions also promote the use of existing technology to \nempower parents to protect their children from objectionable materials \non the Internet, and encourages on-line service providers to self-\npolice offensive communications over their private services.\n  In addition, the Hyde amendment is incompatible with the pro-first \namendment provisions of section 110 of H.R. 1555, which requires a \nreport by the Department of Justice [DOJ] on existing criminal \nobscenity and child pornography statutes and their applicability to \ncyber-crime. Section 110 also requires an evaluation of the technical \nmeans available to enable parents to exercise control over the \ninformation that their children receive on the Internet. Perhaps most \nsignificantly, section 110 embraces the application of first amendment \nspeech protections to interactive media. H.R. 1555, while embracing the \nprinciples of restraint with respect to new criminal sanctions on \nprotected speech and the promotion of a free-market parental \nempowerment approach, simultaneously ignores both of those axioms with \nthe Hyde provision. By imposing new criminal sanctions on indecent \nspeech and amending existing criminal statutes, the Hyde amendment \nrushes to judgment before the DOJ study has even begun.\n  Mr. President, recently the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first \never congressional hearing on the issue of cyberporn. Based on the \ntestimony of the witnesses, which included parents as well as victims \nof cyberporn, it became clear that the objectionable communications on \nthe Internet are already covered by existing criminal statutes. The \nconcerns raised at the hearing centered upon trafficking of child \npornography, the proliferation of obscenity, and the solicitation and \nvictimization of minors via the Internet. However, those offenses are \nalready violations of criminal law. Indeed, recent press accounts \nindicate that law enforcement officers are already aggressively \nprosecuting on-line users for violations of criminal law relating to \nobscenity and child pornography.\n  It is critical that we use law enforcement resources to prosecute \ncriminal activity conducted via the Internet and not be distracted by \nthe issue of indecency which has not been identified as a serious \nconcern by users or parents. It was clear, during our recent Senate \nhearing, that the witnesses' concerns about the Internet did not relate \nto indecent speech or the so-called seven dirty words. It is incumbent \nupon Congress to wait for the results of the study required by H.R. \n1555 before embracing overly restrictive, potentially unnecessary, and \npossibly unconstitutional prohibitions on indecent speech contained in \nboth versions of telecommunications reform legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge the conference committee to reject the Exon-\nCoats and Hyde provisions during its deliberations and to maintain the \nCox-Wyden amendment adopted overwhelmingly by the House of \nRepresentatives. If the United States is to ever fully realize the \nbenefits of interactive telecommunications technology, we cannot allow \nthe heavy hand of Congress to unduly interfere with communications on \nthis medium.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, I urge Senate conferees to recognize that \nif the first amendment has any relevancy at all in the 1990's, it must \nbe applied to speech on the Internet. As Members of this body sworn to \nuphold the Constitution we cannot take a cafeteria style approach to \nthe first amendment, protecting the same speech in some forms of media \nand not in others. Shifting political views about what types of speech \nare viewed as distasteful should not be allowed to determine what is or \nis not an appropriate use of electronic communications. While the \ncurrent target of our political climate is indecent speech--the so-\ncalled seven dirty words--a weakening of first amendment protections \ncould lead to the censorship of other crucial types of speech, \nincluding religious expression and political dissent.\n  I believe the censorship of the Internet is a perilous road for the \nCongress to walk down. It sets a dangerous precedent for first \namendment protections and it is unclear where that road will end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15152-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15153-S15155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHILDREN'S TELEVISION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the discussion \nthat I gather a few of my colleagues here in the Senate began earlier \nin the day as a result of the fact that conferees have been appointed \nto deal with the telecommunications bills that have passed both the \nSenate and the other body. These are very important bills dealing with \na rapidly expanding, rapidly changing, ever more influential sector of \nnot only our economy but our lives, that of telecommunications.\n  I rise today not to talk about the corporate structures that are \noverlapping or the technical details of the revolutionary changes \noccurring in telecommunications but to talk about the content, talk \nabout what is broadcast on these increasingly important parts of our \nlives and particularly to focus on the ever-present box, the \ntelevision, in our homes and the impact that what is on television has \non our kids and therefore on our society.\n  The Senate and the House included in their telecommunications bills \nthe so-called V chip, or violence chip, or C chip, as we like to call \nit, choice chip provisions that I was privileged to cosponsor with the \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], but which was supported by a \nvery strong bipartisan group in the Senate to create the technical \ncapacity in parents and viewers generally to have some control over \nwhat comes through the television screen and affects our kids and also \nto require the industry to create a rating \n\n[[Page S 15154]]\nsystem that would make it easier for a parent or anyone to block out \nshows either rated as too violent or containing lewd material, language \nor scenes or otherwise--all of that I think an expression of what I am \nhearing and I would guess the occupant of the chair, the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, is hearing from his constituents in New Hampshire, \nthat what we are seeing on television is becoming ever more morally \nquestionable; so much sexually inappropriate material is working its \nway into what is known as the family viewing hours from 7 to 9 in the \nevening, and it is having an effect on our kids.\n  I find over and over as I talk to parents in Connecticut that they \nwill say to me: Please do something about the violence and sex and lewd \nlanguage on television and movies and music and video games because all \nof this is making us feel as if we are in a struggle with these other \ngreat, very powerful entertainment forces in our society to effect the \ngrowth and maturation of our own kids.\n  They say to me, ``You know, we're trying to give our kids values. \nWe're trying to give them a sense of priorities and discipline, and \nthen the television music, movies, video games come along and seem to \nbe competing with the values we're trying to give our kids. So please \ntry to help.'' And the V chip component of these two telecommunications \nbills is critical to that effort. And I hope that the conferees will \nkeep the V chip component in there.\n  I know that the television industry is lobbying against it. But it is \nnot censorship. It is really about citizenship. It is really about the \ntelevision industry upholding its responsibility to the community. And \nit is about empowering parents and viewers generally to at least have \nsome greater opportunity to control what is coming through the \ntelevision screen into their homes affecting their children and their \nfamilies. And it may in some sense, in doing that, make it easier for \nthose of us who are viewers to express our opinions by what we are \nwatching and what we are blocking out to the networks that we want \nbetter programming. We want programming that better reflects the values \nof the American people, which too much programming today simply does \nnot.\n  Mr. President, I want to now focus for a moment on another arena in \nwhich this struggle to upgrade the television and to hope that it can \ndo something other than downgrading or degrading our culture and \naffecting our kids; and that is to call the attention of my colleagues \nto a significant debate taking place at the Federal Communications \nCommission about the responsibility of the broadcast television \nindustry to serve the educational needs of America's children.\n  What has stirred this debate is a ground breaking proposal being \nadvocated by the Commission's Chairman, Reed Hundt, that would require \na minimum amount of educational programming each week from each \ntelevision station in America, 3 hours a week at first, growing \nultimately to 5 hours.\n  Before the FCC closes its public comment period on this subject next \nweek, I want to take this opportunity to share with my colleagues why I \nbelieve this issue should be of such concern to us and the FCC and why \nI am so grateful to Chairman Hundt for taking the initiative here.\n  I begin, Mr. President, with a little history. Congress has clearly \nbeen concerned about the content of television programming for our kids \nfor a long time. Congress acted on that concern in 1990 when we adopted \nthe Children's Television Act of 1990. And passing the legislation--\nincidentally, it passed with overwhelming, again, bipartisan majorities \nin both Houses--Congress made an unambiguous statement about \ntelevision's extraordinary potential as an educational resource and our \ndispleasure at seeing that potential squandered. Congress also made an \nequally unambiguous statement about the responsibility of the \nbroadcasters as what might be called public fiduciaries in meeting the \neducational needs of and potentials of our children.\n  The fact is that the broadcasters have always been required the serve \nthe public interest as a condition of receiving access to the public's \nairwaves, which is how they transmit to us, over airwaves that we, the \npublic, own.\n  The report language for the Children's Television Act of 1990 states \nexplicitly that as part of that obligation--I quote --``broadcasters \ncan and indeed must be required to render public service to children.''\n  To meet that standard, the Children's Television Act set specific \ngoals for the industry. We asked them to increase the number of hours \nof quality educational programming for children that are on the air. We \nchose, I think in good faith and wisely, appropriately at the time, not \nto mandate a set number of hours of programming, instead, to make an \nappeal through the legislation to the television industry and to hope \nand trust that they would meet with specific action to broad goals we \narticulated.\n  Mr. President, I am sad to say that 5 years later it is clear that \nthat trust has not been vindicated. Not only has there been no \nnoticeable increase in the amount of quality children's programming on \nthe air, but the fact is that the spirit of the act has been trod upon. \nSome local broadcast outlets have actually made a mockery of the act's \nrequirements by publicly claiming that programs such as the ``Jetsons'' \nand ``Super Mario Brothers'' are educational. The ``Jetsons'' can be \nfun, but I would not say that it is educational.\n  Mr. President, just yesterday The Washington Post reported on a study \nthat was released by Dale Kunkel, a researcher at the University of \nCalifornia in Santa Barbara, that concluded--it was an update of an \nearlier 1993 report on the broadcasters' compliance with the Children's \nTelevision Act. The conclusion was that the law has had little effect \non the quantity of educational programs to be found in 48 randomly \nselected TV stations around the country.\n  Mr. Kunkel concluded that the vaguely written law allows broadcasters \nto engage in what he describes as ``creative relabeling'' of programs \nwith dubious educational value. And there he points to stations that \nhave claimed that the beloved, but usually not educational, ``Yogi \nBear'' is an educational television program according to the study, and \nthe claim by one station as to ``The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.''\n  The researchers found that broadcasters reported airing an average of \n3.4 hours per week of educational shows last year, exactly the same \namount as reported after the law became effective. But he said that the \naverages have been inflated by such shows as ``Yogi Bear,'' ``Sonic the \nHedgehog,'' ``X-Men'' and other shows, including a Pittsburgh station \nthat put ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' an enjoyable show but not \neducational by my standards, into the education category.\n  Another in Portland, ME, claimed ``Woody Woodpecker'' and ``Bugs \nBunny and Friends'' were educational, and five stations listed the \n``Biker Mice From Mars'' as educational programs, obviously making a \nmockery of the intention of the act.\n  To add insult to the mockery, I would offer this testimony, one \nrecent report that said one station in Cincinnati went so far as to \nlist two Phil Donahue shows as educational to improve its compliance \nwith the Children's Television Act. And the content of those two shows \nwere: The first one on ``Teen-Age Strippers and Their Moms'' and, \nsecond, ``Parents Who Allow Teenagers to Have Sex at Home,'' which is \npart of the normal fare on the daytime television talk shows, a subject \nfor another series of comments in terms of the impact it is having on \npeople who are watching and kids who watch, but surely not educational.\n  Mr. President, this kind of callous disregard for kids is all too \nevident in what we are seeing coming over the television screen. As a \nstudy by the Center for Media Education detailed a couple years ago, \nthe few educational programs that make it on the air have been too \noften ``ghettoized,'' you might say, in the early morning hours when \nfew children are watching. Much of the programming that does see the \nlight of day is largely used as a marketing vehicle for the greatest, \nlatest toys. And a number of those action-oriented shows are tinged \nwith what a recent study by the UCLA Center for Communication Policy \ncalled sinister combat violence, which as many parents can attest, \nstudy after study has shown, \n\n[[Page S 15155]]\noften translates into imitative aggressive behavior.\n  So let us be painfully candid about what seems to be happening here. \nRather than serving the public interests, the industry has too often \nbeen serving our kids garbage. And it has an effect on them in our \nsociety. We have given the broadcast networks, their affiliates and \nindependent local stations, use of the public airwaves, and they have \nnot used those airwaves well.\n  Too often our children have been subjected to a diet featuring ever \nlarger helpings of morally questionable programs meant for adults that \nare appearing at hours when children and families are watching, and \nchildren's shows, as my friend, Congressman Ed Markey of Massachusetts, \na leader in this effort, recently said, offer the kids' minds the \nnutritional value of a twinkie. Congressman Markey is right.\n  In pursuing this path, the broadcasters, I think, are not only \nignoring their legal obligations but, in a broader sense, their moral \nobligations to the larger community to which they belong. Knowing how \npowerful a median television is and knowing that the average young \nviewer watches 27 hours a week of television, the people who are \nrunning the American television industry, which, in a sense, is our \nNation's electronic village, must recognize that they have a greater \nresponsibility to wield their power carefully and constructively.\n  This all really comes down, Mr. President, to a question of values. \nWhat are we saying to our kids and about our kids when we allow them to \nbe subjected to the kind of lowest common denominator trash that they, \ntoo often, are forced or choose to watch on television? How can we \nexpect our kids to appreciate the importance of education which parents \nare trying to convey to them and to recognize the necessity for self-\ndiscipline, indeed, sometimes for sacrifice, in order to learn and to \nimprove one's place in life when so much of what is on television \ntreats knowledge as either irrelevant or worthy of disrespect?\n  I stress the word ``we'' here, because our society, as a whole, I \nthink, shares the blame for the status quo. We have ignored the \nwarnings of people like Newt Minow, Peggy Charren, and dozens of other \nadvocates for kids who have warned us about the impact of what is \ncoming across television has on our children and our society.\n  I have spoken about this subject before, Mr. President. No one is \nprepared to say violence on television and in the movies and music and \nvideo games is the cause of the ever greater violence in our society. \nNo one is prepared to say that the way in which sexual behavior is \ntreated so casually, without consequence, without warning, without \nawareness of a sense of responsibility, is the sole cause of some of \nthe moral breakdown in our society, the moral breakdown of families, \nthe outrageous epidemic of babies being born to women unmarried, \nparticularly teenage women. But I cannot help but believe while the \ntreatment of sex and violence on television is not the cause of those \ntwo fundamental problems our society is threatened with, it has been a \ncontributor, and, in that sense, we all share some responsibility for \nmaking it better, including those at the Federal Communications \nCommission who have not done as much as they could have up until now \nand now have the opportunity, thanks to the proposal that Reed Hundt \nhas made to begin a new era.\n  This proposal would make significant changes in the rules \nimplementing the Children's Television Act, which, taken as a whole, \nwould guarantee that the broadcasters know exactly what is expected of \nthem in terms of meeting their obligations to serve the needs of our \nkids. The demands are modest; some have even said too modest. They \nshould not put an undue burden on the television industry. Indeed, the \nFCC proposal proves that this is not an either/or equation, that we can \nbe both sensitive to the educational needs of our children and the \neconomic needs of the broadcast industry.\n  In drafting these proposals, Chairman Hundt has been guided by the \nprecept that we should do whatever we can to enable the market to work \nmore efficiently. For instance, the proposal would require that each \nidentify what programs are deemed educational and to alert parents \nabout the air time, time in which those shows would be on the air.\n  Such a requirement should help stimulate demand for more and better \nchildren's programming, without putting a hardship on the industry. The \nnew rules would also ask stations to enhance parental access to their \nchildren's television reports. This requirement would make it easier \nfor parents rather than the Government to enforce compliance with the \nlaw.\n  In the end, though, I must say that I share Reed Hundt's judgment \nthat regardless of the changes, the market will probably continue to \nunderserve children unless the FCC steps in and explicitly requires a \ncommitment from the broadcast industry to provide some minimal amount \nof programming every week for our kids.\n  The competitive pressures seem to be so great in the industry that \none broadcast outlet will not unilaterally arm itself with educational \nprogramming and risk giving ground to a rival.\n  So I think the best solution will be to guarantee a level playing \nfield and assure that no broadcaster is put at a disadvantage by \noffering quality children's programming. This proposal, for a minimum \nof 3 hours a week educational programming for kids, I think will create \nthat level playing field.\n  The solution the Commission is considering is more than fair. As \nPeggy Charren has pointed out, the broadcasters claim they are already \nairing an average of more than 3 hours a week of educational \nprogramming. Assuming that is true, they should have no problem \nwhatsoever in meeting the 3-hour obligation that Chairman Hundt is \nproposing.\n  On the other side, if implemented, this proposal will present \nfamilies, especially those without access to cable, with a real \npositive alternative to the growing level of offensive and vacuous \nprogramming on the air today. In other words, it will give families an \noasis in what too often has been the intellectual and moral desert of \ncontemporary television.\n  That relief is something that parents want. I referred earlier to \ninformal conversations I have had with parents in Connecticut, but to \nmake it somewhat more scientific, in a recent poll, 82 percent of those \nsurveyed said that there is not enough educational programming on \ntelevision today, and nearly 60 percent supported a minimum requirement \nof broadcasters to show at least 1 hour a day of enriching programming, \nin effect, going well beyond the standard that Chairman Hundt is \nproposing at the FCC.\n  Like those parents who answered that poll, it is my hope that these \nnew rules will inspire more kids to become, if you will, power \nthinkers, power builders, power growers instead of Power Rangers.\n  I was reminded of television's potential as an educational tool in a \nstudy released this spring by John Wright of Aletha Huston of the \nUniversity of Kansas. After working with 250 low-income preschoolers, \nthe researchers found that children who regularly viewed educational \nprogramming not only were better prepared for school but actually \nperformed better on verbal and math tests, and that is what this is all \nabout.\n  The FCC will be making a decision on this proposal probably next \nmonth, and the outcome, unfortunately, is uncertain. I hope that my \ncolleagues and members of the public, parents, advocates for children, \nwill let the Federal Communications Commission know where they stand; \nthat we remain in Congress committed to the Children's Television Act \nand the principle of serving the public interest; that our children \ndeserve something better from television than a choice between ``Dumb \nand Dumber.''\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. It strikes me, looking at \nthe Presiding Officer, that I should make clear his years in television \nonly contributed to the well-being and intellectual awareness of those \nwho watched his shows.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the American public's dissatisfaction \nwith the Congress is again on the rise. The American public's faith in \nits elected leaders is waning, and I think there are reasons for this \ndisturbing trend.\n  I think it is because when the people look at Washington, DC, they \nare beginning again to see what they have seen in years past. They see \nbusiness as usual. They see politicians putting self-interest first and \npolitics first. They see politicians perhaps then moving to parochial \ninterests or just the interests of a small part of the country. The \nnational interest, it seems, follows somewhere after the special \ninterests. But it takes a long time, as people watch this body \ndeliberate, for them to see us finally get to the national interest. It \nsees a body in deliberation that finds it very difficult to confront \nthe issues that the people have actually sent us here to confront.\n  In short, I think the American people see an imperial Congress, a \nCongress that is perceived to be arrogant and indifferent and out of \ntouch, and seen so because the agenda of the people is accorded a \nstanding which is simply disproportionately low compared to the \nstanding of the political interests, the special interests, the \nprovincial or parochial interests.\n  I think it is important that we begin again to restate and \nredemonstrate our commitment to the agenda of the American people. As \nthe people grow in their dissatisfaction, they manifest their \ndisapproval in a number of ways which are clear and apparent.\n  Approval ratings of Congress are at an all-time low again. We have \nmanaged to snatch from the jaws of victory a defeat here. The American \npeople were beginning to think that they could count on us for reform. \nAs a matter of fact, there are a number of substantial reforms which we \nhave undertaken. We have made a commitment to balance the budget in 7 \nyears, and that is important. And we are on track for doing it. That is \nsignificantly different than the President of the United States who \nsaid he wants to balance the budget in 10 years. But if you look \nthrough the smoke and mirrors of those 10 years, you find that they are \npredicated upon administration figures, and they do not have the \nintegrity or validity of the Congressional Budget Office bipartisan \nfigures that the Congress is using.\n  It is a shame when we are making that kind of progress, when we are \ndoing welfare reform that is substantial and will make a real \ndifference, when we are addressing major issues, that we again are \nfalling in the approval of the American people. But I think it is \nbecause they see some of the endemic, old-time politics as usual rising \nagain to the surface. You see our two-party system being questioned and \npeople talking about a third party and people discussing the potential \nof independent candidacies with an alarming frequency and with a \ntremendous--well, it is an alarming array of support. There is a new \ndesire for a third party and a reincarnation again of Ross Perot.\n  I think we need to demonstrate that, as American people, we are a \ndifferent kind of Congress, that this Congress which was elected in \n1994 is a Congress where our rhetoric is matched by our resolve. It is \na Congress where our agenda meets the agenda and the challenges of the \nAmerican people. It is a Congress where our greatest concern is not \nlosing a vote but losing the faith of the American people.\n  I think in order to reacquire the confidence of the people we have to \nbe willing again to tackle the toughest issues--issues like the \nbalanced budget and term limits which represent fundamental systemic \nreform. We now have the opportunity to keep the faith on term limits. \nWe are in the process of making good on our commitment for a balanced \nbudget. But we have an opportunity to keep the faith on term limits. To \ndo so will require courage--not the courage of shying away from fights \nand delaying votes, but the courage of meeting our challenges and \nkeeping the faith with the American people. We came here to change \nWashington. We need to ensure that Washington does not change us.\n  There are lessons to be learned, lessons about how to get things \ndone, about how to be most effective, about how not to spin our wheels, \nhow to take advantage of the rules so we are not dislocated in our \nefforts for achievement by those who are much more familiar with the \nprocess than we are.\n  But there are things that we do not want to learn here in Washington. \nWe do not want to learn about sacrificing our principles or setting \naside the agenda of the American people.\n  We do not want to learn how to avoid or skirt dealing with the issues \nfor which we were sent here. We do not want to learn to act just for \npolitical expedience. Those would be substantial lessons, but they \nwould be lessons which would drive us away from the American people and \ndrive the wedge of insecurity and a lack of confidence between the \npeople and their representatives.\n  We must always be sure that we are ready to fight for principles, \nalways stand up for what we know is right even if it means losing a \nvote.\n  As you well know, Mr. President, I am speaking about our commitment \nto address the issue of term limits. Why are term limits important? \nBecause they help restore one of the first principles of the American \npeople and the American Republic, and that is representative democracy. \nTerm limits help ensure that there are competitive elections. When \nincumbents are running for public office, even in years where there is \nas much revolutionary change as there was in 1994, incumbents win 91 \npercent of the time. Yes, even in the revolution of 1994, incumbents \nwon 91 percent of elections where they were seeking reelection.\n  How? Well, they use their biggest perk. That is incumbency. If you \nlook at the data about who raises the most funds and who can just \nsimply blow away the competition, it is the fact that incumbents have \nthe ability to amass these war chests. They obviously have the most \neasy access to the media. They speak from an official position. And \nincumbency becomes a perk which is so big that it tilts the playing \nfield. It is unfair to expect that there would be a massive infusion of \nthe will of the people against incumbency, at least few are asking for \nit in the election, because the incumbents are so inordinately favored \nwith the tools of politics--access to the podium and the resources that \nare necessary to buy advertising.\n  We need term limits to help ensure accountability. Individuals who \nknow that they will be returning to their districts or to their home \nStates to live under the very laws that they enact, I believe, will \nhave a different kind of incentive to deal with the public interest \nrather than the special interests or rather than the provincial \ninterests or rather than the political interests, to deal with the \ninterests of this Nation. The national interests of America would be \nelevated if we were to embrace the concept of term limits.\n  Term limits would also help to ensure the right kind of voice of the \npeople in Government by making it possible for new people and new ideas \nto come here. We need to open the doors of Government to the citizens \nof this country, and I think having reasonable \n\n[[Page S 15157]]\nterm limits would make it possible not only for more people to serve \nbut for groups of people that have previously been unrepresented to \nhave the opportunity for running in elections where there are open \nseats. Those open seat elections are the kinds of elections that can \nprovide opportunity for newcomers to the process--the minorities, the \nwomen who would seek to be candidates.\n  Incumbency is such an advantage that that tilted playing field, added \nto the disadvantage of people who do not have a heritage of running for \npublic office, makes their access to public office almost impossible. \nTerm limits would help remedy that problem. We need to return to the \nconcept of a citizen legislature. We need a new respect for ideas that \ncome from the people, not from the power. When we allow the voice of \nthe people to be heard, we will really again begin to see a restoration \nof the public confidence in American Government.\n  Now, the problem of term limits and the enactment of term limits is a \nsignificant one, and it is compounded by the events of recent days. \nLast year, the executive branch, the Clinton administration, sent its \nlawyers from the Justice Department into court to argue in the Thornton \ncase against the right of States to impose term limits on Members of \nCongress. So the executive branch has clearly stated--at least the \nClinton administration has--that it is against the right of the people \nas expressed in 23 of the States already that tried to impose term \nlimits on their States and on their State's representatives to the \nCongress. The Clinton administration has said that door is slammed \nshut. The executive branch opposes that, went to court, and argued in \nthe Supreme Court against it.\n  The people know that there are three branches of Government, and they \nlooked to the judicial branch, they looked to the Supreme Court until \nlast spring when the Supreme Court again slammed the door of self-\ngovernment in their faces, saying you do not have a right in your State \nto say how long any individual would be eligible for service in the \nU.S. Congress. It is not up to you. We know better than you here in \nWashington. We will slam that door shut.\n  Having exhausted the potential of the executive branch and having \nexperienced the disappointment of a ruling in the judicial branch, the \npeople of America, seeking a branch of Government confident in the \nvoice of the people, confident in wanting to recognize the inputs of \npeople, wanting to swing wide the door of self-government rather than \nto hold it shut, the people of America are looking now to the Congress, \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate.\n  Earlier in the year, we scheduled that on this day and the day \npreceding--yesterday--we would devote these 2 days to a debate of term \nlimits and a vote on term limits. It would be the first time in history \nthat we would have done so, and we would have been able to vote on an \namendment that passed out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  That amendment was passed out not only with a majority but with a \nbipartisan majority and sent to the floor of this Senate for \nconsideration, and, well, we are simply not debating that. As a \nresponse to our change in plans, I simply do not want us to avoid \nconfronting this issue that the American people expect us to confront.\n  Will we win a vote? Since the Thornton case, where the State of \nArkansas's laws were struck down by the Supreme Court, it means that we \nwill have to have 67 votes in order to win enough support for a \nconstitutional amendment in this Chamber and two-thirds, of course, in \nthe House of Representatives. Frankly, that is unlikely. But that does \nnot mean we should not begin. And the American people deserve a vote on \nthis issue because we promised them we would give them a vote on this \nissue and because they deserve a vote on this issue to identify who the \nsupporters are and who the supporters are not.\n  Seventy-four percent of the people of this country registered their \napproval for term limits; 23 States have actually tried to enact them \non a State-by-State basis in spite of the fact that the Supreme Court \nhas said it cannot be done, and two additional States will be voting on \nterm limits in the South in the next couple weeks.\n  I think it is time for us Members of the Senate to respond to our own \ncommitment to have a vote on term limits, and that is why I have \noffered an amendment to this measure which is now being considered on \nour relationship to our neighbor to the south, to Cuba, and saying we \nneed a sense of the Senate providing a marker for every Member of this \nbody to cast a ballot either in favor of term limits or against term \nlimits. I look forward to a vote on that amendment. I look forward to a \nvote on that amendment in the near future, a vote that will not be \nbinding, no, because it is just a sense of the Senate--not binding, but \nit will be revealing, a vote that will finally allow the American \npeople to know where Senators stand on this very important issue.\n  I believe term limits provides an opportunity for us to justifiably \nregain the confidence of the American people because a vote on term \nlimits is something we promised the American people. It is something we \nshould deliver, not just because we promised it but because the people \nof America want it. It is a part of the agenda of the American people \nand as such it must be a part of the agenda of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for this opportunity, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask that further proceedings under the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15156-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15157-S15162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FRAUD IN THE MEDICARE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I could not believe my eyes this morning \nwhen I opened up the front page of the newspaper. And here is the \nheadline, Mr. President: ``Gingrich places low priority on Medicare \ncrooks, defends cutting anti-fraud defenses.''\n  Well, what is this all about, Mr. President? Well, what it is about \nis the House bill, the House bill on Medicare reform, which I think \nought to be titled, ``The Scam Artist Protection Act.'' But, Mr. \nPresident, do not take my word for it. Here is a letter dated September \n29 from the inspector general's office of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  It says:\n\n       However, if enacted, certain major provisions of H.R. \n     2389--\n\n  The House bill.\n\n     would cripple the efforts of law enforcement agencies to \n     control health care fraud and abuse in the Medicare program \n     and to bring wrongdoers to justice.\n\n  ``Would cripple their efforts.'' And so the Speaker yesterday says, \n``It is all right. No big deal.'' He said that it is more important to \nlock up murderers and rapists than dishonest doctors. Well, it is \nimportant to lock up murderers and rapists. You bet it is. But what \ndoes that have to do with Medicare fraud? Talk about using a logic that \njust about takes all right there.\n  But even more astounding is this quote attributed to the Speaker. \nWhen he was pressed on it, he said that they might be willing to \nnegotiate on it. He said--this is a quote attributed to the Speaker--\n``We can be talked out of it if there is enough public pressure.''\n  I will repeat that:\n\n       We can be talked out of it if there is enough public \n     pressure.\n\n  Talked out of what? Talked out of easing the antifraud measures that \nwe now have in the law?\n  I think in that statement is a tacit acknowledgment by the Speaker \nthat they are, indeed, opening the doors to more fraud and abuse in \nMedicare. But he said if there is enough public pressure, we can change \nit.\n  If we can slip it through in the dark of night, if we can do it \nbehind closed doors, if we can ram it through in a hurry and the public \ndoes not know about it, we will do it. But if the public finds out \nabout it and they put pressure on us, well then, we will change it.\n  Mr. President, I am here to start putting pressure on us. The public \nought to put pressure on us, because what has been happening in \nMedicare is billions of dollars in proportion. The ripoffs, the fraud, \nthe waste and abuse is ongoing and getting worse instead of better, \n\n[[Page S 15158]]\nand the few minimal laws that we have that permit the inspector \ngeneral's office to go after the crooks in Medicare are now being \nweakened in the House bill and the inspector general said so. She said \nit would cripple the efforts of law enforcement agencies to control \nhealth care fraud and abuse.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated September 29 from the inspector general's office \noutlining the provisions in the House bill that would, indeed, cripple \ntheir efforts.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Department of Health\n\n\n                                             & Human Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 1995.\n     Re H.R. 2389: ``Safeguarding Medicare Integrity Act of \n         1995.''\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: You requested our views regarding the \n     newly introduced H.R. 2389, which we understand may be \n     considered in the deliberations concerning the ``Medicare \n     Preservation Act.'' We strongly support the expressed \n     objective of H.R. 2389 of reducing the fraud and abuse which \n     plagues the Medicare program. The proposed legislation \n     contains some meritorious provisions. However, if enacted, \n     certain major provisions of H.R. 2389 would cripple the \n     efforts of law enforcement agencies to control health care \n     fraud and abuse in the Medicare program and to bring \n     wrongdoers to justice.\n       The General Accounting Office estimates the loss to \n     Medicare from fraud and abuse at 10 percent of total Medicare \n     expenditures, or about $18 billion. We recommend two steps to \n     decrease this problem: strengthen the relevant legal \n     authorities, and increase the funding for law enforcement \n     efforts. Some worthy concepts have been included in H.R. \n     2389, and we support them. For example, we support:\n       A voluntary disclosure program, which allows corporations \n     to blow the whistle on themselves if upper management finds \n     wrongdoing has occurred, with carefully defined relief for \n     the corporation from qui tam suits under the False Claims Act \n     (but not waiver by the Secretary of sanctions);\n       Minimum periods of exclusion (mostly parallel with periods \n     of exclusion currently in regulations) with respect to \n     existing exclusion authorities from Medicare and Medicaid; \n     and\n       Increases in the maximum penalty amounts which may be \n     imposed under the civil monetary penalty laws regarding \n     health care fraud.\n       As stated above, however, H.R. 2389 contains several \n     provisions which would seriously erode our ability to control \n     Medicare fraud and abuse, including most notably: making the \n     civil monetary penalty and anti-kickback laws considerably \n     more lenient, the unprecedented creation of an advisory \n     opinion mechanism on intent-based statutes, and a trust fund \n     concept which would fund only private contractors (not law \n     enforcement). Our specific comments on these matters follow.\n\n\n 1. making civil monetary penalties for fraudulent claims more lenient \n   by relieving providers of the duty to use reasonable diligence to \n               ensure their claims are true and accurate\n\n       Background: The existing civil monetary penalty (CMP) \n     provisions regarding false claims were enacted by Congress in \n     the 1980's as an administrative remedy, with cases tried by \n     administrative law judges with appeals to Federal court. In \n     choosing the ``knows or should know'' standard for the mental \n     element of the offense, Congress chose a standard which is \n     well defined in the Restatement of Torts, Second, Section 12. \n     The term ``should know'' places a duty on health care \n     providers to use ``reasonable diligence'' to ensure that \n     claims submitted to Medicare are true and accurate. The \n     reason this standard was chosen was that the Medicare system \n     is heavily reliant on the honesty and good faith of providers \n     in submitting their claims. The overwhelming majority of \n     claims are never audited or investigated.\n       Note that the ``should know'' standard does not impose \n     liability for honest mistakes. If the provider exercises \n     reasonable diligence and still makes a mistake, the provider \n     is not liable. No administrative complaint or decision issued \n     by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has \n     found an honest mistake to be the basis for CMP sanction.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 201 would redefine the term \n     ``should know'' in a manner which does away with the duty on \n     providers to exercise reasonable diligence to submit true and \n     accurate claims. Under this definition, providers would only \n     be liable if they act with ``deliberate ignorance'' of false \n     claims or if they act with ``reckless disregard'' of false \n     claims. In an era when there is great concern about fraud and \n     abuse of the Medicare program, it would not be appropriate to \n     relieve providers of the duty to use ``reasonable diligence'' \n     to ensure that their claims are true and accurate.\n       In addition, the bill treats the CMP authority currently \n     provided to the Secretary in an inconsistent manner. On one \n     hand, it proposes an increase in the amounts of most CMPs \n     which may be imposed under the Social Security Act. Yet, it \n     would significantly curtail enforcement of these sanction \n     authorities by raising the level of culpability which must \n     be proven by the Government in order to impose CMPs. It \n     would be far preferable not to make any changes to the CMP \n     statutes at this time.\n\n\n   2. making the anti-kickback statute more lenient by requiring the \n government to prove that ``the significant'' intent of the defendant \n                              was unlawful\n\n       Background: The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal \n     offense knowingly and willfully (intentionally) to offer or \n     receive anything of value in exchange for the referral of \n     Medicare or Medicaid business. The statute is designed to \n     ensure that medical decisions are not influenced by financial \n     rewards from third parties. Kickbacks result in more Medicare \n     services being ordered than otherwise, and law enforcement \n     experts agree that unlawful kickbacks are very common and \n     constitute a serious problem in the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs.\n       The two biggest health care fraud cases in history were \n     largely based on unlawful kickbacks. In 1994, National \n     Medical Enterprises, a chain of psychiatric hospitals, paid \n     $379 million for giving kickbacks for patient referrals, and \n     other improprieties. In 1995, Caremark, Inc. paid $161 \n     million for giving kickbacks to physicians who ordered very \n     expensive Caremark home infusion products.\n       Most kickbacks have sophisticated disguises, like \n     consultation arrangements, returns on investments, etc. These \n     disguises are hard for the Government to penetrate. Proving a \n     kickback case is difficult. There is no record of trivial \n     cases being prosecuted under this statute.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 201 would require the \n     Government to prove that ``the significant purpose'' of a \n     payment was to induce referrals of business. The phrase ``the \n     significant'' implies there can only be one ``significant'' \n     purpose of a payment. If so, at least 51 percent of the \n     motivation of a payment must be shown to be unlawful. \n     Although this proposal may have a superficial appeal, if \n     enacted it would threaten the Government's ability to \n     prosecute all but the most blatant kickback arrangements.\n       The courts interpreting the anti-kickback statute agree \n     that the statute applies to the payment of remuneration ``if \n     one purpose of the payment was to induce referrals.'' United \n     States v. Greber, 760 F.2d 68, 69 (3d Cir. 1985) (emphasis \n     added). If payments were intended to induce a physician to \n     refer patients, the statute has been violated, even if the \n     payments were also intended (in part) to compensate for \n     legitimate services. Id. at 72. See also: United States v. \n     Kats, 871 F.2d 105, 108 (1989); United States v. Bay State \n     Ambulance, 874 F.2d 20, 29-30 (1st. Cir. 1989). The proposed \n     amendment would overturn these court decisions.\n       However, the nature of kickbacks and the health care \n     industry requires the interpretation adopted by Greber and \n     its progeny. to prove that a defendant had the improper \n     intent necessary to violate the anti-kickback statute, the \n     prosecution must establish the defendant's state of mind, or \n     intent. As with any intent-based statute, the prosecution \n     cannot get directly inside the defendant's head. The \n     prosecution must rely on circumstantial evidence to prove \n     improper intent. Circumstantial evidence consists of \n     documents relevant to the transaction, testimony about what \n     the defendant said to business associates or potential \n     customers, etc. These types of evidence are rarely clear \n     about the purposes and motivations of the defendant. The \n     difficulties of establishing intent are multiplied by the \n     complexity, size, and dynamism of the health care industry, \n     as well as the sophistication of most kickback scheme \n     participants. Documents are ``pre-sanitized'' by expert \n     attorneys. Most defendants are careful what they say. In most \n     kickback prosecutions, the Government has a difficult task to \n     prove beyond a reasonable doubt that even one purpose of a \n     payment is to induce referrals.\n       If the Government had to prove that inducement of referrals \n     was ``the significant'' reason for the payment, many common \n     kickback schemes would be allowed to proliferate. In today's \n     health care industry, very few kickback arrangements involve \n     the bald payment of money for patients. Most kickbacks have \n     sophisticated disguises. Providers can usually argue that any \n     suspect payment serves one or more ``legitimate purposes.'' \n     For example, payments made to induce referrals often also \n     compensate a physician who is providing health care items or \n     services. Some payments to referral sources may be disguised \n     as returns on investments. Similarly, many lease arrangements \n     that indisputably involve the bona fide use of space \n     incorporate some inducement to refer in the lease rates. In \n     all of these examples, and countless others, it is impossible \n     to qualify what portions of payments are made for nefarious \n     versus legitimate purposes.\n       Where the defendant could argue that there was some \n     legitimate purpose for the payment, the prosecution would \n     have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, through \n     circumstantial evidence, that the defendant actually had \n     another motive that was ``the significant'' reason. For the \n     vast majority of the present-day kickback schemes, the \n     proposed amendment would place an insurmountable burden of \n     proof on the Government.\n     \n[[Page S 15159]]\n\n\n\n   3. creation of an easily abused exception from the anti-kickback \n             statute for certain managed care arrangements\n\n       Background: There is great variety and innovation occurring \n     in the managed care industry. Some managed care \n     organizations, such as most health maintenance organizations \n     (HMOs) doing business with Medicare, consist of providers who \n     assume financial risk for the quantity of medical services \n     needed by the population they serve. In this context, the \n     incentive to offer kickbacks for referrals of patients for \n     additional services is minimized, since the providers are at \n     risk for the additional costs of those services. If anything, \n     the incentives are to reduce services. Many other managed \n     care organizations exist in the fee for service system, where \n     the traditional incentives to order more services and pay \n     kickbacks for referrals remain. In the fee for service \n     system, the payer (like Medicare and private insurance plans) \n     is at financial risk of additional services, not the managed \n     care organization. While broad protection from the anti-\n     kickback statute may be appropriate for capitated, at-risk \n     entities like the HMO described above, such protection for \n     managed care organizations in the fee for service system \n     would invite serious abuse.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 202 would establish broad new \n     exceptions under the anti-kickback statute for ``any \n     capitation, risk-sharing, or disease management program.'' \n     The lack of definition of these terms would result in a huge \n     opportunity for abusive arrangements to fit within this \n     proposed exception. What is ``risk-sharing?'' Is not any \n     insurance a form of risk sharing? What is a ``disease \n     management program?'' Does not that term include most of \n     health care?\n       Nefarious organizations could easily escape the kickback \n     statute by simply rearranging their agreements to fit within \n     the exception. For example, if a facility wanted to pay \n     doctors for referrals, the facility could escape kickback \n     liability by establishing some device whereby the doctors \n     share in the business risk of profit and loss of the business \n     (i.e., they would share some risk, at least theoretically). \n     Then, the organization could pay blatant kickbacks for every \n     referral with impunity.\n       If the concern is that the kickback statute is hurting \n     innovation, as observed above, there is now an explosion of \n     innovation in the health care industry, especially in managed \n     care. No one in Government is suggesting that HMOs or \n     preferred provider arrangements, etc., formed in good faith, \n     violate the kickback statute. There has never been any action \n     against any such arrangement under the statute.\n\n\n   4. inappropriate expansion of the exception to the anti-kickback \n                         statute for discounts\n\n       Background. Medicare/Medicaid discounts are beneficial and \n     to be encouraged with one critical condition: that Medicare \n     and/or Medicaid receive and participate fully in the \n     discount. For example, if the Medicare reasonable charge for \n     a Part B item or service is $100, Medicare would pay $80 of \n     the bill and the copayment would be $20. If a 20 percent \n     discount is applied to this bill, the charge should be $80, \n     and Medicare would pay $64 (80 percent of the $80) and the \n     copayment would be $16. If the discount is not shared with \n     Medicare (which would be improper), the bill to Medicare \n     would falsely show a $100 charge. Medicare would pay $80, but \n     the copayment would be $0. This discount has not been shared \n     with Medicare.\n       Many discounting programs are designed expressly to \n     transfer the benefit of discounts away from Medicare. The \n     scheme is to give little or no discount on an item or service \n     separately billed to Medicare, and give large discounts on \n     items not separately billed to Medicare. This scheme results \n     in Medicare paying a higher percentage for the separately \n     billed item or service than it should.\n       For example, a lab offers a deep discount on lab work for \n     which Medicare pays a predetermined fee (such as lab tests \n     paid by Medicare to the facility as part of a bundled \n     payment), if the facility refers to the lab its separately \n     billed Medicare lab work, for which no discount is given. The \n     lab calls this a ``combination'' discount, yet is a discount \n     on some items and not on others. Another example is where \n     ancillary or noncovered items are furnished free, if a \n     provider pays full price for a separately billed item, such \n     as where the purchase of incontinence supplies is accompanied \n     by a ``free'' adult diaper. Medicare has not shared in these \n     combination discounts.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal. Section 202 would permit discounts on \n     one item in a combination to be treated as discounts on \n     another item in the combination. This sounds innocent, but it \n     is not. Medicare would be a big loser. Discounting should be \n     permissible for a supplier to offer a discount on a \n     combination of items or services, so long as every item or \n     service separately billed to Medicare or Medicaid receives no \n     less of a discount than is applied to other items in the \n     combination. If the items or services separately billed to \n     Medicare or Medicaid receive less of a discount than other \n     items in the combination, Medicare and Medicaid are not \n     receiving their fair share of the discounts.\n\n\n   5. unprecedented mechanism for advisory opinions on intent-based \n             statutes, including the anti-kickback statute\n\n       Background: The Government already offers more advice on \n     the anti-kickback statute than is provided regarding any \n     other criminal provision in the United States Code.\n       Industry groups have been seeking advisory opinions under \n     the anti-kickback statute for many years, with vigorous \n     opposition by the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the HHS \n     Office of Inspector General (OIG) under the last three \n     administrations, as well as the National Association of \n     Attorneys General. In 1987, Congress rejected calls to \n     require advisory opinions under this statute. As a \n     compromise, Congress required HHS, in consultation with the \n     Attorney General, to issue ``safe harbor'' regulations \n     describing conduct which would not be subject to criminal \n     prosecution or exclusion. See Section 14 of Public Law 100-\n     93.\n       To date, the OIG has issued 13 final anti-kickback ``safe \n     harbor'' rules and solicited comment on 8 additional proposed \n     safe harbor rules, for a total of 21 final and proposed safe \n     harbors. Over 50 pages of explanatory material has been \n     published in the Federal Register regarding these proposed \n     and final rules. In addition, the OIG has issued six general \n     ``fraud alerts'' describing activity which is suspect under \n     the anti-kickback statute. Thus, the Government gives \n     providers guidance on what is clearly permissible (safe \n     harbors) under the anti-kickback statute and what we consider \n     illegal (fraud alerts).\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal. HHS would be required to issue advisory \n     opinions to the public on the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback \n     statute (section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act, as well \n     as all other criminal authorities, civil monetary penalty and \n     exclusion authorities pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid. \n     HHS would be required to respond to requests for advisory \n     opinions within 30 days.\n       HHS would be authorized to charge requestors a user fee, \n     but there is not provision for this fee to be credited to \n     HHS. Fees would therefore be deposited in the Treasury as \n     miscellaneous receipts.\n       Major problems with anti-kickback advisory opinions \n     include:\n       Advisory opinions on intent-based statutes (such as the \n     anti-kickback statute) are impractical if not impossible. \n     Because of the inherently subjective, factual nature of \n     intent, it would be impossible for HHS to determine intent \n     based solely upon a written submission from the requestor. \n     Indeed, it does not make sense for a requestor to ask the \n     Government to determine the requestor's own intent. \n     Obviously, the requester already knows what their intent is.\n       None of the 11 existing advisory opinion processes in the \n     Federal Government provide advisory opinions regarding the \n     issue of the requestor's intent. An advisory opinion process \n     for an intent-based statute is without precedent in U.S. law.\n       The advisory process in H.R. 2389 would severely hamper the \n     Government's ability to prosecute health care fraud. Even \n     with appropriate written caveats, defense counsel will hold \n     up a stack of advisory opinions before the jury and claim \n     that the dependent read them and honestly believed (however \n     irrationally) that he or she was not violating the law. The \n     prosecution would have to disprove this defense beyond a \n     reasonable doubt. This will seriously affect the likelihood \n     of conviction of those offering kickbacks.\n       Advisory opinions would likely require enormous resources \n     and many full time equivalents (FTE) at HHS. The user fees in \n     the bill would go to the Treasury, not to HHS. Even if they \n     did go to HHS, appropriations committees tend to view them as \n     offsets to appropriations. There are no estimates of number \n     of likely requests, number of FTE required, etc. Also, HHS is \n     permanently downsizing, even as it faces massive structural \n     and program changes. The possible result of the bill is a \n     diversion of hundreds of anti-fraud workers to handle the \n     advisory opinions.\n       For the above reasons, DOJ, HHS/OIG and the National \n     Association of Attorneys General strongly oppose advisory \n     opinions under the anti-kickback statute, and all other \n     intent-based statutes.\n\n\n    6. creation of trust fund mechanism which does not benefit law \n                              enforcement\n\n       Background: In our view, the most significant step Congress \n     could undertake to reduce fraud and abuse would be to \n     increase the resources devoted to investigating false claims, \n     kickbacks and other serious misconduct. It is important to \n     recognize that the law enforcement effort to control Medicare \n     fraud is surprisingly small and diminishing. There is \n     evidence of increasing Medicare fraud and abuse, and \n     Medicare expenditures continue to grow substantially. Yet, \n     the staff of the HHS/OIG, the agency with primary \n     enforcement authority over Medicare, has declined from \n     1,411 employees in 1991 to just over 900 today. (Note: 259 \n     of the 1,411 positions were transferred to the Social \n     Security Administration). Approximately half of these FTE \n     are devoted to Medicare investigations, audits and program \n     evaluations. As a result of downsizing, HHS/OIG has had to \n     close 17 OIG investigative offices and we now lack an \n     investigative presence in 24 States. The OIG has only \n     about 140 investigators for all Medicare cases nationwide. \n     By way of contrast, the State of New York gainfully \n     employs about 300 persons to control Medicaid fraud in \n     that State alone.\n       Ironically, the investigative activity of OIG pays for \n     itself many times over. Over the last 5 years, every dollars \n     devoted to OIG investigations of health care fraud and abuse \n     has yielded an average return of over $7 to \n\n[[Page S 15160]]\n     the Federal Treasury, Medicare trust funds, and State Medicaid \n     programs. In addition, an increase in enforcement also \n     generates increased deterrence, due to the increased chance \n     of fraud being caught. For these reasons, many fraud control \n     bills contain a proposal to recycle monies recovered from \n     wrongdoers into increased law enforcement. The amount an \n     agency gets should not be related to how much it generates, \n     so that it could not be viewed as a ``bounty.'' The Attorney \n     General and the Secretary of HHS would decide on \n     disbursements from the fund. We believe such proposals would \n     strengthen our ability to protect Medicare from wrongdoers \n     and at no cost to the taxpayers. The parties who actually \n     perpetrate fraud would ``foot the bill.''\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 106 would create a funding \n     mechanism using fines and penalties recovered by law \n     enforcement agencies from serious wrongdoers. But none of the \n     money would be used to help bring others to justice. Instead, \n     all the funds would be used only by private contractors for \n     ``soft'' claims review, such as, medical and utilization \n     review, audits of cost reports, and provider education.\n       The above functions are indeed necessary, and they are now \n     being conducted primarily by the Medicare carriers and \n     intermediaries. Since the bill would prohibit carriers and \n     intermediaries from performing these functions in the future, \n     there appears to be no increase in these functions, but only \n     a different funding mechanism.\n       These ``soft'' review and education functions are no \n     substitute for investigation and prosecution of those who \n     intend to defraud Medicare. The funding mechanism in H.R. \n     2389 will not result in any more Medicare convictions and \n     sanctions.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In summary, H.R. 2389 would:\n       Relieve providers of the legal duty to use reasonable \n     diligence to ensure that the claims they submit are true and \n     accurate; this is the effect of increasing the Government's \n     burden of proof in civil monetary penalty cases;\n       Substantially increase the Government's burden of proof in \n     anti-kickback cases;\n       Create new exemptions to the anti-kickback statute which \n     could readily be exploited by those who wish to pay rewards \n     to physicians for referrals of patients;\n       Create an advisory opinion process on an intent-based \n     criminal statute, a process without precedent in current law; \n     since the fees for advisory opinions would not be available \n     to HHS, our scarce law enforcement resources would be \n     diverted into hiring advisory opinion writers; and\n       Create a fund to use monies recovered from wrongdoers by \n     law enforcement agencies, but the fund would not be available \n     to assist the law enforcement efforts; all the monies would \n     be used by private contractors only for ``soft'' payment \n     review and education functions.\n       In our view, enactment of the bill with these provisions \n     would cripple our ability to reduce fraud and abuse in the \n     Medicare program and to bring wrongdoers to justice.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 June Gibbs Brown,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the last several years when I was \nChair of the Subcommittee on Appropriations that funded HCFA and \nMedicare, we held a series of hearings, and I requested GAO to do a \nnumber of studies on waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare system.\n  What we have uncovered is mind boggling: HCFA paying for 240 yards of \ntape per person per day--Medicare paying that. Medicare paying over \nsome $200 for a blood glucose tester that you can buy down at Kmart for \n$49.99. Medicare is paying thousands of dollars for devices that only \ncost $100. Foam cushions that cost about $50 that Medicare is paying \n$880 each for.\n  The list goes on and on and on, and we know it is happening out \nthere. We know how medical suppliers are scamming the system, double \nbilling going on. We have documentation. GAO has documented this in the \npast.\n  Last year, I asked the GAO to do a study just on medical supplies--\njust on medical supplies. They started their study in about May or June \n1994, and the study was completed in August of this year. They issued \ntheir report.\n  GAO went to Medicare and said, ``We want to take a representative \nsample of bills that you have paid for medical supplies.''\n  You have to understand, Mr. President, that when Medicare pays a bill \nfor medical supplies, they do not even know what they are paying for, \nbecause all of the supplies are put under one code, 270. So Medicare \npays a bill, code 270, medical supplies, $20,000. They have no idea \nwhat is in there, because they do not require it to be itemized. \nImagine that.\n  So GAO went to Medicare, got a representative sample, went behind the \ncode to the suppliers, to the nursing homes, to the hospitals and said, \n``OK, we want the itemized account.''\n  Guess what they found? Now this will knock your socks off. They found \nthat that 89 percent--89 percent--of the claims should have been \ntotally or partially denied; 61 percent of the money spent should never \nhave been paid out--61 percent.\n  Then you ask the question: How much did Medicare pay last year for \nmedical supplies? The answer, $6.8 billion. If you can extrapolate from \nthis sample and say that 61 percent of that money should not have been \npaid out, you are talking about $4 billion--$4 billion. Maybe we cannot \nget it all, but could we get $3 billion? I bet we could. How about even \n$2 billion? We ought to be able to save that. Multiply that over 7 \nyears, which is what we are talking about here, and you can see that is \na pretty good chunk of money. And that is just medical supplies, that \nis just tape and bandages, things like that. We are not even talking \nabout durable medical equipment. We are not talking about the double \nbilling that goes on. That is just one, just medical supplies. It does \nnot include oxygen, and it does not include ambulances, orthotic \ndevices. It does not include durable medical equipment. It is just the \nbandages, $6.8 billion, and 61 percent should not have been paid.\n  A lot of this is fraud. A lot of it comes about because scam artists \nknow that they can game the system.\n  Why would they do that? Are there not enough penalties? Would they \nnot be afraid of getting caught? The fact is that in 24 States, the \ninspector general's office does not even have a presence. They are not \neven in 24 States.\n  Right now, Medicare reviews about 5 percent of the claims. So if you \nwant to scam the system, you want to put in fraudulent claims, your \nchances are 5 percent that you are even going to be reviewed, and out \nof the reviews, they may or may not do something based upon that. If \nyou are in one of the 24 States where there is not an inspector general \noperating, the sky is the limit.\n  That is why fraud is so rampant in the Medicare system today. What \nthe Speaker says is that is fine, that is a low priority. We do have \nsome antifraud legislation on the books, as inadequate as it is right \nnow. The House bill weakens it even further, and the Speaker says that \nis fine, but he says if the public catches on to it and they put on \nenough pressure, maybe we will change it.\n  I hope the public does put on the pressure, because we do have to \nchange it. The House will say, well, they put more money into the IG's \noffice, they put $100 million into the inspector general's office. So \nyou give more money into the inspector general, then you put the \nhandcuffs on it by making it so they cannot prove fraud. That is \nexactly what they have done.\n  Mr. President, we have to not put waste, fraud, and abuse in the back \nseat, we ought to put it in the front seat. We have to attack that. I \ndo not think it is right, I do not think it is fair for this Congress, \nfor the Speaker of the House to say, ``OK, we're going to double your \npremiums for the elderly, we're going to double your deductibles, but \nwe're going to let the crooks go, we're not going to crack down on \nthem.''\n  Oh, yeah, from what I read, they are going to let the doctors off, \ntoo. They are not going to have to belly up to the bar.\n  One other item before I finish on fraud. I have another report from \nthe inspector general's office issued just this month in October. Here \nis what they found: 13 percent of nursing homes have been offered \ninducements in exchange for allowing suppliers to provide products to \npatients in their facilities; 17 percent of nursing homes with \nMedicare-reimbursed products have been offered these inducements. The \ninducements range from free trial products to cameras, blenders, and \ndiamond rings. Fraud, and yet the Speaker says it is too tough the way \nit is, we have to make it even less tough. We have to ease up. One \nother thing, Mr. President, that has disturbed me, came to my attention \nin the last 24 hours. It has to do with the block granting of Medicaid \nto the States. The Finance Committee--the Senate Finance Committee, of \nwhich I am not a member, but I follow closely what it has done--adopted \nan amendment offered by a Republican, Senator Chafee, that says, OK, if \nyou block grant it to the States, \n\n[[Page S 15161]]\nwe still want to have some guarantees. What do we want to guarantee? We \nwant to guarantee that pregnant women who fall under the poverty line \nget medical help under Medicaid; we want to guarantee that all children \nunder the age of 12 get Medicaid medical help; we want to guarantee \nthat all disabled continue to get medical help, as they are today. \nPlus, they want to guarantee that we continue the provisions in law \nthat provide that a spouse does not have to spend all of his or her \nmoney down to nothing and give up their income before Medicaid will \nstart paying for their spouse's long-term care in a nursing home. It is \ncalled the spousal impoverishment provision. It says you cannot \nimpoverish a spouse simply because his or her husband or wife is in a \nnursing home. What does it say? It says basically that, minimum, a \nspouse can keep, I think, a little over $14,000 in assets and can make \na little over $1,200 a month.\n\n  Now, in my view, if a couple saved up all of their lives and they \nhave $50,000 in the bank, and one spouse gets Alzheimer's and cannot be \ncared for and has to go to a nursing home and the other spouse has to \nspend that $50,000 until they get to $14,000 and then Medicaid will \nkick in and start paying, that $14,000 is not a lot of money to have in \nthe bank for a rainy day when you are getting old.\n  So these provisions were left in the Senate-passed Finance Committee \nbill. It passed, as I understand, by a vote of 17 to 3. I picked up \nthis publication, the National Journal of Congress, dated Friday, \nOctober 13, this morning. Here is what it says:\n\n       ``Thursday, Senator Jay Rockefeller said GOP leaders were \n     trying to undo a compromise that preserved the disabled's \n     right to Medicaid,'' the Associated Press reported. \n     Rockefeller and Senator John Chafee won a 17 to 3 Finance \n     panel vote to keep the Medicaid entitlement for poor children \n     and pregnant women, as well as the disabled. But GOP \n     Governors have protested overly prescriptive and onerous \n     provisions in the bill. Roth said Thursday evening, ``It is a \n     matter that is still open.''\n       The AP said, ``Sheila Burke, Dole's Chief of Staff, told \n     reporters, ``The disabled will not be an entitlement.'' \n     Chafee and six other moderates wrote Dole, asking him to \n     ``stand fast in your support for at least a minimal level of \n     support provided to our Nation's most vulnerable \n     populations.''\n\n  Mr. President, I hope this is not true. I hope this is not true that \nnow the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee are going to throw \nout the disabled in our country, that they are going to say, OK, all \nright, we will keep pregnant women in and children up to age 12, but \nthe disabled, you are out the door, you are not entitled to be covered, \nwe are not going to guarantee you coverage--the most vulnerable of our \npopulation, those who are disabled.\n  Mr. President, here is another thing I cannot believe. We got a \nletter the other day, sent to Senator Dole on October 6, signed by 24 \nRepublican Governors, saying that they wanted the block granting of the \nMedicaid bill. They supported that, but they said there are some things \nthey do not like.\n  I will read this from the letter of 24 Republican Governors:\n\n       The bill includes a number of overly prescriptive and \n     onerous provisions that will mitigate against the States' \n     ability to implement reforms.\n\n  What are those onerous provisions? They are that the Senate Finance \nCommittee, by a vote of 17 to 3, on a bipartisan basis, said you have \nto cover pregnant women who fall under the poverty line with medical \ncare, you have to provide for children to age 12 who are in poverty, \nyou have to cover the disabled, and you have to have provide against \nespousal impoverishment. The Republican Governors said that is onerous.\n  I have to ask this, Mr. President. These Governors have said, ``Turn \nMedicaid over to the States. We will take care of it better than the \nFederal Government can take care of it.'' What makes you think that \nthese Republican Governors do not care for the disabled, poor, and the \nwomen as much as Congress? Well, they cannot have it both ways. If \nthese Republican Governors say they do not want these provisions in \nthere that mandate that they continue to cover the disabled, then are \nthey then saying they want to have the freedom to throw the disabled \nout? If the Republican Governors are saying they do not want the \nprovision in there that says we will ensure against spousal \nimpoverishment, are they then saying that they, the Republican \nGovernors, are willing to throw that out?\n  Well, if they are not saying that and if the Republican Governors are \nsaying, oh, no, no, no, no, we will make sure we keep provisions \nagainst spousal impoverishment, we will cover the disabled, pregnant \nwomen, and the children, why do they care if it is in there? You cannot \nhave it both ways.\n  These Republican Governors have shown their hand. If we turn Medicaid \nover to the States without these provisions, they are going to go cut \nthe disabled, pregnant women, children, and cut back on the provisions \nagainst spousal impoverishment. It is right here in this letter, signed \nby 24 Republican Governors.\n  So I think it is becoming clearer as the days roll by, Mr. President, \nthat on the Medicare side, the Speaker and the GOP are turning a blind \neye to the concerns of seniors. But they are giving a wink and a nod to \nthe Medicare crooks.\n  When it comes to Medicare, Mr. Gingrich and his allies are willing to \ntell the seniors they have to pay more, double their premiums, double \ntheir deductibles. They want to take $270 billion out of Medicare and \nuse it for a tax cut for some of the most privileged in our society. \nYet, they are not willing to crack down on those that are scamming the \nsystem, bilking the system of billions of dollars a year. Oh, no, we do \nnot want to do that. Well, I think the public ought to know about it. I \nthink the public is becoming aware of it, Mr. President. I think the \npublic is now beginning to wake up to the fact that we do not need to \ncut $270 billion out of Medicare.\n  The head of Medicare said that maybe $90 billion would get us through \nthe next 10 years; $90 billion would provide for the security of the \nMedicare system through 2006. Think about that. GAO said that 10 \npercent of Medicare goes for waste, fraud, and abuse. That is about $18 \nbillion a year. Well, $18 billion a year for 7 years is $126 billion, \nwhich, over the next 7 years, will go for waste, fraud, and abuse. If \nwe cannot get all the $126 billion, can we get $90 billion of it? We \nmight be able to squeeze enough out of waste, fraud, and abuse to \nensure the viability of Medicare at least for the next 10 years. But, \nno, Republicans say, though, they want $270 billion out of Medicare. \nSock it to the seniors, make them pay double for premiums, double for \ndeductibles, and then they will take that money and give a $245 billion \ntax cut for the most privileged in our society. Not fair, not right. I \nthink the people and the public are beginning to understand that.\n\n  Now, on the Medicaid side, $187 billion of cuts in Medicaid and then \nblock granted to the States. I think the Senate Finance Committee cast \na conscientious vote last week when they said, ``Look, we will block \ngrant to the States but we want to make sure that we cover all pregnant \nwomen who are eligible for Medicaid, all children who are eligible for \nMedicaid, and the disabled.''\n  Now, I understand that they are willing to throw out the disabled. \nThat is unconscionable--unconscionable that some would be willing to \nthrow out the disabled to say that, ``No, we are not going to cover \nyou. You just go plead your case in the States. Go to the Governors.'' \nWell, the Governors told us what they wanted to do in their letter. \nThey found those provisions onerous.\n  Mr. President, it is becoming clearer, in Medicare it is the seniors \nwho get hit. In Medicaid, it is the poor.\n  Here it is right here in contrast, Wednesday, October 11, the \nWashington Post. Here it is. This is it, right here. Two stories, side \nby side, that tell it all.\n  On the right hand side, it says: ``Leaders Pledge Full Tax Cut By \nSenate GOP.'' Full $245 billion tax cut. ``Leaders Pledge Full Tax Cut \nBy Senate GOP.'' The story right next to it: ``Working Poor May Pay the \nHigh Price for Reform.''\n  There you go. It cannot be said any better than that.\n  In Medicare, the disabled, if you are disabled, forget it. You will \nnot have any protections. We throw you out.\n  Well, I hope that is a wrong report. I hope everything I have said \nhere today will prove not to be so. I hope that the Senate Finance \nCommittee will not jettison the most vulnerable in our society, the \ndisabled. If they do, if that is what comes here to the Senate floor, \n\n[[Page S 15162]]\n\nthat we have a Medicaid bill--I do not care how it is wrapped up. If it \nis wrapped up in reconciliation, as you know, we cannot filibuster that \nunder the rules. But if they jettison the disabled, I hope and trust \nthat President Clinton will veto that the second it lands on his desk \nand say to this country that we are not going to make the most \nvulnerable in our society, those who have disabilities, pay for the \n$245 billion tax cut for the most privileged in our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Washington Times]\n\n            Gingrich Places Low Priority on Medicare Crooks\n\n\n                  defends cutting anti-fraud defenses\n\n                          (By Nancy E. Roman)\n\n       House Speaker Newt Gingrich yesterday defended GOP moves to \n     reduce penalties and enforcement efforts against Medicare \n     fraud by saying it's more important to lock up murderers and \n     rapists than dishonest doctors.\n       The Georgia Republican cited ``murderers out after three \n     years'' and ``rapists who don't even get tried'' in response \n     to a question at a seniors gathering to promote the GOP \n     Medicare overhaul. ``For the moment, I'd rather lock up the \n     murderers, the rapists and the drug dealers,'' he said. \n     ``Once we start getting some vacant jail space, I'd be glad \n     to look at it.''\n       The GOP bill in the House would weaken laws against \n     kickbacks and self-referrals in the Medicare program. The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated the seven-year cost \n     of relaxing those laws to be $1.1 billion.\n       Gerald M. Stern, special counsel for health care fraud at \n     the Justice Department, said one provision would overturn a \n     common interpretation of Medicare anti-kickback case law and \n     increase the burden of proof in criminal prosecutions.\n       Rep. Pete Stark, the California Democrat who drafted the \n     anti-kickback and self-referral statutes, called Mr. \n     Gingrich's comments ``arrogant and gratuitous.''\n       ``To put O.J. Simpson, the Menendez brothers and Claus von \n     Bulow in the same category as physicians who get kickbacks \n     and who steal from the government is not the issue,'' Mr. \n     Stark said. ``Republicans are in the position of having \n     weakened protections that we put in [Medicare law] at the \n     urging of the Reagan and Bush administration.''\n       Mr. Stark said Republicans weakened the provisions to shore \n     up support from the American Medical Association, a wealthy \n     lobby representing 300,000 doctors.\n       Rep. Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican and obstetrician who \n     helped draft the new anti-kickback provisions, said the \n     changes simply would put medical professionals on equal \n     footing with other professionals subject to such laws.\n       Courts have interpreted the Medicare anti-kickback law to \n     prohibit a payment if ``one purpose'' of it is to induce \n     referrals of services paid for by Medicare.\n       The GOP bill would change that to ``the significant \n     purpose,'' which Mr. Stern and others said is much harder to \n     prove in court. Under this standard, he said, the government \n     would not have won two big cases this year that led to fines \n     of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n       Kern Smith, an assistant commerce secretary under \n     Presidents Johnson and Kennedy, posed the question about \n     lighter fraud rules to Mr. Gingrich at a forum sponsored by \n     the Coalition to Save Medicare, a group backing the GOP \n     reforms.\n       The 73-year-old Democrat said he's gone ``around the \n     country selling your plan'' but found seniors vexed by the \n     new fraud rules. He said they were hard to defend.\n       ``I've been around Washington for a long time, and you are \n     giving the Democrats something to clobber you with,'' Mr. \n     Smith said.\n       Mr. Gingrich said Republicans are willing to negotiate on \n     fraud and abuse provisions, leaving open the possibility of \n     the bill being changed on the House floor.\n       ``We can be talked out of it if there is enough public \n     pressure,'' he said.\n       A senior House aide yesterday said the legal standard in \n     the anti-kickback law was changed to make it consistent with \n     other such laws ``without a lot of thought, and it is \n     something that could be changed.''\n       Republicans spent much of the summer discussing Medicare \n     changes with seniors, and many found that fraud topped \n     constituents' complaints. Many seniors erroneously thought \n     eliminating fraud and abuse could solve Medicare's money \n     woes.\n       Republicans have created other ways to reduce fraud, such \n     as: allowing seniors to keep a portion of money recovered \n     from fraud cases they report; establishing a voluntary \n     disclosure program for corporate managers who uncover \n     wrongdoing in their companies; and increasing the maximum \n     civil penalties for health care fraud.\n       The CBO estimates that these changes would save $2 billion \n     over seven years.\n       Democrats support some of these changes but argue that \n     relaxing kickback and self-referral laws would undermine the \n     success achieved in reducing Medicare fraud.\n       After Democrats upbraided Republicans for going soft on \n     fraud, the House Ways and Means Committee added $100 million \n     to the budget of the Inspector General's Office to prosecute \n     fraud and abuse. The CBO estimates that the additional money \n     would produce $700 million more in Medicare fraud fines.\n       Rep. Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, ranking Democrat on the \n     Ways and Means Committee, said it will be difficult to block \n     the softer fraud rules without public outcry.\n       ``The Republicans are all marching in lock step,'' Mr. \n     Gibbons said. ``In my lifetime I've never seen anybody march \n     in lock step like this.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Republican Governors Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: Collectively we desire to express our \n     gratitude for the working relationship with you and \n     Republican governors. We share your commitment to balancing \n     the budget and returning responsibilities to the states. Your \n     leadership on these matters is acknowledged and admired. We \n     are writing to you to convey our deep concern with provisions \n     that were included in the Medicaid portion of the \n     reconciliation bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee \n     on September 30.\n       Since January of this year, Republican governors have \n     worked in good faith with Republican leadership on concepts \n     to bring meaningful, urgently needed reforms to the Medicaid \n     program while achieving the Congressional budget targets. As \n     governors representing the unique needs of our individual \n     states, we have not been in total agreement on all aspects of \n     the program. However, throughout this lengthy partnership, we \n     have consistently argued that the fiscal and functional \n     integrity of the program demand freedom from individual and \n     provider entitlements and other mandates on states. The \n     Senate Finance Committee bill ignores this principle.\n       The bill includes a number of overly prescriptive and \n     onerous provisions that will militate against the states \n     ability to implement reforms. Among these are individual \n     entitlements, which create both a huge potential cost shift \n     to states and unlimited potential for litigation; a set-aside \n     for one class of providers; and mandated federal requirements \n     on spousal asset protection.\n       Further, we are concerned that the bill reported out by the \n     Senate Finance Committee will be amended on the Senate floor \n     with additional mandates on states. While we support efforts \n     to reduce the deficit and balance the federal budget we will \n     not sit idly by while the costs associated with this program \n     are shifted to the states.\n       We have kept our commitments to Republican leadership \n     throughout a difficult process of negotiating reforms that \n     states can implement, while protecting the interests of all \n     of our citizens. We are fully prepared to provide health care \n     for our most vulnerable populations, without prescriptions \n     and mandates from the federal government. We are pleased with \n     the flexibility provisions incorporated in the House measure \n     and intend to work for inclusion of such provisions in the \n     final bill.\n       We are hopeful that we can work with the Senate leadership \n     on this most important issue. We urge you to remove mandates \n     and other prescriptive provisions from the Senate bill.\n       It is our sincere hope that we can resolve these issues \n     quickly. As those charged with the actual administration of \n     these programs, we cannot support a combination of individual \n     entitlements and mandate provisions that will subject us to \n     unlimited ligation, and still meet the budget targets.\n           Sincerely,\n         Michael O. Leavitt, Bill Weld, Fife Symington, John G. \n           Roland, Christine T. Whitman, John Engler, Marc \n           Racicot, Gary E. Johnson, George V.

Mr. President, on another subject, with varying frequency \nall Senators occasionally find themselves in the predicament of having \nto be in two places or more at one time. Generally, the problem can be \nresolved by dividing time between conflicting responsibilities. This \nhappened to me yesterday, when the distinguished former Senator from \nTennessee, Jim Sasser, appeared before the Foreign Relations Committee, \nhaving been scheduled a week or so earlier in connection with his \nnomination by President Clinton to serve as United States. Ambassador \nto mainland China, which calls itself the People's Republic of China. \nIf ever there was a misnomer, that is it.\n  In any case, the hearing had been set several days ago for 10 a.m. \nyesterday morning.\n  On Wednesday evening, the distinguished majority leader and the \ndistinguished minority leader of the Senate scheduled the Cuba Libertad \nbill to be the pending business of the Senate at 11 a.m. yesterday. \nThis kind of scheduling happens to all Senators with a high degree of \nfrequency, as I say. And all of us understand that it is endemic to \nSenate procedure.\n  Yesterday morning I knew it would be a tight fit to handle both \nresponsibilities, but I had many times done it before. But yesterday it \ndid not turn out quite that way.\n  In any event, in my opening statement as chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee I wanted to say some positive things about \nformer Senator Sasser's nomination to be Ambassador to Communist China. \nSo, midway through my brief remarks I commented, and I quote myself:\n  When Jim was nominated, I was especially pleased to learn that the \nPresident had nominated a gentleman who hasn't always been that easy on \nthe Communists in Beijing.\n  When Mr. Sasser was in the Senate, in fact, he and I often agreed on \nour respective approaches to China.\n  Between 1988 and 1994 Senator Sasser voted six times to condition the \nrenewal of most-favored-nation trading status for China until the \nChinese made significant progress on human rights. He helped override \nPresident Bush's veto of the legislation prohibiting the President from \nextending MFN until the Chinese cleaned up their act after the massacre \nof 1989.\n  I commend Senator Sasser for standing firm.\n  In his capacity as Senator from Tennessee, Jim Sasser voted to impose \nsome of the very sanctions against China that many U.S. businessmen now \nactively seek to relax--for example, the suspension of the operations \nin China by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Senator Sasser \nsupported restrictions on the transfer of nuclear equipment, materials, \nor technology to China unless specific conditions were met. These were \nhard, tough issues and Senator Sasser chose the right way every time. I \nhope he will continue to stick by his principles in making the \ndecisions he will have to make as Ambassador Sasser.\n  Now that he has been nominated to represent the President and the \nexecutive branch, I trust he will understand, encourage, and support \nthe congressional role in the formulation and adaptation of the United \nStates foreign policy toward China, Taiwan, and Tibet.\n  That was the statement I made yesterday at the hearing.\n  Now, then, I am getting to the point. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of a letter I have this afternoon faxed to \nSenator Sasser be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Jim Sasser,\n     Ambassador Nominate to the People's Republic of China, U.S. \n         Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: It was unfortunate that circumstances yesterday \n     required that I depart from your hearing and go to the Senate \n     Floor to manage a piece of legislation that became the \n     Senate's pending business at 11 a.m.\n       Your comments on two matters after I departed left two \n     significant additional matters that I feel obliged to have \n     you discuss further in a second public hearing on your \n     nomination.\n       They are: (1) Your comment after I had departed, to the \n     effect that you ``corrected the record'' (according to media \n     reports) by testifying that you had become ``less and less \n     convinced'' that it was correct to link trade with China to \n     human rights, and (2) your comments relating to China's \n     threat to disband Hong Kong's Legislative Council.\n       It need not be a lengthy hearing but I believe it essential \n     that there be one. Accordingly, I am asking Admiral Nance and \n     his staff to work with you and the State Department in \n     scheduling your appearance at the most mutually agreeable \n     date and time.\n       It is my intent to schedule a business meeting of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee as quickly as possible for a vote \n     on reporting your nomination to the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jesse Helms.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me read the letter.\n\n       Dear Jim: It was unfortunate that circumstances yesterday \n     required that I depart from your hearing and go to the Senate \n     Floor to manage a piece of legislation that became the \n     Senate's pending business at 11 a.m.\n       Your comments on two matters after I departed left two \n     significant additional matters that I feel obliged to have \n     you discuss further in a second public hearing on your \n     nomination.\n       They are: (1) Your comment after I had departed, to the \n     effect that you ``corrected the record'' (according to media \n     reports) by testifying that you had become ``less and less \n     convinced'' that it was correct to link trade with China to \n     human rights, and (2) your comments relating to China's \n     threat to disband Hong Kong's Legislative Council.\n       It need not be a lengthy hearing but I believe it essential \n     that there be one. Accordingly, I am asking Admiral Nance and \n     his staff to work with you and the State Department in \n     scheduling your appearance at the most mutually agreeable \n     date and time.\n       It is my intent to schedule a business meeting of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee as quickly as possible for a vote \n     on reporting your nomination to the Senate.\n\n  When I made my statement, my positive statement, regarding the Sasser \nnomination, and identified the six votes that Senator Sasser as a \nSenator had cast correctly, he nodded. It never dawned on me that he \nwas going to correct the record after I left the hearing. If he had \nmade any indication of what he was going to do, I would have called the \nSenate floor and said I will be delayed in getting there, because it is \ntime that the American people, and particularly those of us who say we \nrepresent the American people, understand that we become a part of what \nwe condone. For us to condone what is going on in Red China is to be a \npart of it. And that is the reason I want to hear further from Senator \nSasser, about his nomination to be Ambassador to Communist China--which \nthey call the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, yesterday's comments by Mr. Sasser relating to the \nadministration's position on China's threat to disband and abolish the \nHong Kong Legislative Council deserves a bit more comment as well. I do \nnot challenge the opinion expressed by Mr. Sasser on behalf of the \nadministration regarding this action by China. I want to emphasize, \nhowever, that China is sweeping away every vestige of democracy in Hong \nKong. It is a matter that deserves somewhat more detailed understanding \nby Americans of precisely what is at stake in Hong Kong.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a front page \narticle of the South China Morning Post faxed to me from Hong Kong be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the South China Morning Post, Oct. 13, 1995]\n\n           U.S. Nominee Says China Has Right To Disband Legco\n\n                            (By Simon Beck)\n\n       The nominee to become U.S. Ambassador to China last night \n     appeared to side with Beijing one the Hong Kong question, \n     saying China was not required to keep the Legislative Council \n     in place after 1997.\n\n[[Page S 15164]]\n\n       Even though former senator James Sasser said he hoped China \n     would not carry out its threat to abolish Legco, his remarks \n     at this sensitive time are certain to be viewed with alarm.\n       Until now, successive administrations have lent strong \n     support to widening the democratic franchise in the \n     territory. Governor Chris Patten was praised for his brave \n     stand in going ahead with his reforms in the face of violent \n     opposition from Beijing, Democratic Party leader Martin Lee \n     Chu-ming was recently feted in the U.S. and awarded the \n     American Bar Association Human Rights Award.\n       But speaking at his Senate confirmation hearing late last \n     night, Mr. Sasser said: ``Governor Patten has sought to \n     `enlarge it' [the 1984 Joint Declaration] to some extent by \n     his encouragement of the democratic movement in Hong Kong.\n       ``The Chinese have indicated that they are not going to \n     abide by this democratic election of legislative councillors, \n     and clearly by the covenant of 1984, they are not required \n     to. But I am hopeful they will reconsider that.''\n       His comments appeared to conflict with the passion in the \n     US for supporting the continuation of Hong Kong's rights and \n     freedoms after 1997.\n       In June, senators joined senior officials in declaring US \n     determination to stay deeply involved in the future of the \n     territory.\n       China came under fire from all sides for blocking the Court \n     of Final Appeal and for vowing to dismantle the Legislative \n     Council.\n       Assistant Secretary of State Winslow Lord said the Legco \n     issue had caused great concern to Washington and warned that \n     apparent moves by China to put pressure on civil servants \n     were ``making many in the career rank uncomfortable at a time \n     when Beijing should instead be reassuring them''.\n       Former US attorney-general Dick Thornburgh said China ``has \n     signalled its intention to renege on virtually all of the \n     guarantees it made to preserve Hong Kong's legal system and \n     the rule of law''.\n       He said he was troubled by the lack of attention that Hong \n     Kong and its people were receiving despite the gravity of the \n     developments taking place in the territory.\n       Beijing has warned Britain not to ``internationalise'' the \n     Hong Kong issue and the US not to interfere in China's \n     internal affairs.\n       Foreign Relations Committee chairman Senator Jesse Helms, a \n     staunch critic of China, promised to ``expedite'' Mr. \n     Sasser's confirmation for the Beijing job.\n       A vote could come within one week at which Mr. Sasser is \n     expected to be easily confirmed.\n       Mr. Sasser vowed to push for human rights improvements in \n     China, stick firmly to the United States' one-China policy \n     and promote US trade with Beijing.\n       Mr. Sasser told senators: ``Some people say China needs us \n     more than we need China. The reality is that China and the \n     United States need each other.''\n       Asked by several senators how he would handle Tibet and \n     other human rights issues, he replied: ``I intend at every \n     appropriate occasion and on occasions when it might not seem \n     appropriate to make the views of the administration known in \n     this regard.\n       ``The American people expect the Chinese Government to \n     respect the human rights of its own citizens.''\n       The White House made a symbolic gesture of support for its \n     nominee, by sending Vice-President Al Gore to urge the \n     committee to support Mr. Sasser, whom he described ``a man of \n     stature, wisdom and authority''.\n       Mr. Sasser, who when he was a senator voted six times to \n     link China's trading status to human rights, said he had \n     changed his mind and now believed that trading with China was \n     the best way to encourage freedom and democracy in that \n     country.\n       On Taiwan, he defended the administration's one-China \n     policy.\n       If he is confirmed before October 24, Mr. Sasser said he \n     hoped to take part in the summit meeting in New York between \n     presidents Jiang Zemin and Bill Clinton.\n       The only question as to Mr. Sasser's competence in the job \n     was raised by Senator Craig Thomas, who pointed out that the \n     past five ambassadors were career diplomats with much China \n     experience, and not political appointees like Mr. Sasser.\n       However, Mr. Sasser, a Democrat who lost his Senate seat \n     last year, said he had spent recent months studying Chinese \n     language and politics at Harvard University and the Foreign \n     Service Institute.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.

This has been something that has bothered me, not only in Cuba \nbut in Nicaragua and other countries in the hemisphere, and I think the \nPresident is doing exemplary service, not only for our citizens, but \ncitizens around the world in confronting the issue of the confiscation \nof property in our world today, and without compensation and without \nappropriate redress.\n  So I compliment the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15164-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15164-S15165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE FISCAL AFFAIRS OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I also appreciate your accepting the \nduty of presiding so that I might make a comment or two about a number \nof the speeches that have been made as amendments and commentary at the \ntime of discussing your bill that had nothing whatsoever to do with \nyour bill.\n  From the other side of the aisle, we have heard repeatedly criticism \nof the efforts of the new majority to take charge of the fiscal affairs \nof the United States, even though the vast majority of the American \npeople sent this new majority here to do just that. They have rejected \nthe status quo. They have rejected the concept of spending money we do \nnot have. They have rejected the prospect of robbing the future of its \nopportunity because there are no resources left. They have rejected the \nidea that this Nation not stumble into the next century 5 years from \nnow. Yet, all we hear is the same song sheet--leave everything the way \nit is, and reject the pleas of the American people to take charge of \nour own financial house.\n  I tell you. It is mind-boggling.\n  We have said there are four things that must happen. We must balance \nour budgets. Eighty-eight percent of the American people say we must \nbalance our budget. Are we deaf? They want the budget balanced, and for \ngood reason. They have to balance their own checkbooks. They have to \nbalance the checkbooks of their businesses. And they know nations have \nto do the same thing.\n  I was reading in the bipartisan entitlement commission report just \nthe other day where it said--and it ought to be a loud wake-up call for \nevery American, and certainly for the President and for every American \npolicymaker. It says this: It says that within 10 years--that is a snap \nof a finger--within 10 years all U.S. resources will be exhausted by \njust five programs. Just five--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nFederal retirement, and the interest on our debt. And there is nothing \nleft. We will not be debating a B-2 bomber. There will not be one, nor \nanything else to defend the Nation, nor a school lunch program nor a \nTransportation Department nor a Commerce Department nor any of them. No \nAmerican, no Member of this Senate, not a person who has abused their \nfinancial affairs can carry out their mission--not a person, not a \nfamily, not a business, not a community and yes, Mr. President, not \neven nations. No generation of Americans has ever given the future a \ncountry crippled. But we are perilously close to doing just that.\n  Mr. President, we have said we must balance our budgets so that we \nquit adding debt. We have said we want to save Medicare because the \ntrustees have said it is going bankrupt, and we want to protect it and \npreserve it. And we want to save $270 billion, not for a tax increase, \nbut by law to keep it in the Medicare Trust Fund so that its solvency \nis pushed out years from now so that it does not go bankrupt, so that \nthe current beneficiaries will not have the program closed, and, \nimportantly, so the beneficiaries to come will have it in place.\n  We said welfare as it is known must come to an end. You would be hard \npressed to find a single citizen in this \n\n[[Page S 15165]]\n\ncountry that would not agree with that--balance the budget, protect \nMedicare, alter welfare, and, Mr. President, the fourth item is lower \ntaxes.\n  You would think that was a travesty from what we have heard on the \nfloor; that it is an absolute sin to talk about lowering taxes on the \nAmerican working family.\n  When Ozzie and Harriet were the preeminent American family, Ozzie \nsent 2 percent of his paycheck to this town. If Ozzie was here today, \nfirst of all his family would be completely different and not look a \nbit like what it was then, mainly because he would be sending 25 \npercent of every dime he earned to this town. Would it be any wonder \nthat Harriet would not be in the house? She would have to be working.\n  Balance our budget--America wants that done; protect Medicare--\nAmerica wants that done; change welfare--America wants that done; lower \nthe financial burden on middle America so that it can do the job it is \nsupposed to do with its own family and without a Washington caretaker--\nAmerica wants that done.\n  Boy, you would never think that from what we have heard the last 2 \ndays. I tell you. Where America is and where those speeches are is \ntotally different.\n  A couple more things, and then I will allow the Presiding Officer to \nget on with his business of the day.\n  One, where has the President been in this debate? First, during the \ncampaign, he said he was going to balance the budget in 5 years. I do \nnot know what happened to that promise. He was going to balance the \nbudget in 5 years. Then we offered a balanced budget, and he said, I am \nnot offering any budget.\n  That is real leadership. That did not play very well in America.\n  So he says, OK, I am going to offer a budget. I will balance it in 10 \nyears, and it will be easier to do. He has gone all over the country \nsaying that. There is only one problem. That budget never balances, \never--not in 7 years, not in 5 years, not in 7, not in 10; never.\n  How do I know that? Because the Congressional Budget Office, which he \ntold a joint session of Congress is the numbers we should use, says it \nwill not. The only thing that says it will is the President and his own \nbudget makers.\n  Mr. President, your budget does not balance, and that is not \nleadership, and it is not what America is asking for.\n  The last thing I am going to say is this, Mr. President. That is a \nsober message, that all our money would be gone for five things in less \nthan 10 years; that Medicare is going bankrupt. We have to really get \ntough on managing our financial affairs.\n  That is a tough message, but America needs to know that at the end of \nthe day, if we take charge of our business, if we run this country the \nway our forefathers would have us do it, the way those who went to \nEurope to defend it would have us do it, we will send America into the \nnext century with more hope and more opportunity than is even \ndescribable. We will lower interest rates. That will affect everybody \nwho buys a car or a refrigerator or a home or has to borrow money to \nsend kids to school. We will lower the economic pressure on those \nfamilies. We will leave more money for them to manage their education, \ntheir housing, their retirement. We will create millions of new jobs--\nmillions of new jobs. We will be strong. We will be the only \nsuperpower, and we will have the muscle to defend it.\n  This happens very quickly if we just start taking charge of our \nbusiness. If nothing else would motivate you to do it, the kinds of \nresults that come from managing our affairs ought to make every \nAmerican be calling their Congressman, their Senator, and, yes, the \nPresident and say: Get on with this. Do this for me. Do this for my \nfamily. And, yes, do this for our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to provide \nfor a Jones Act wavier for a boat owned by a resident of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  The owner of the boat, Mr. Chip Frederick of Virginia, intends to use \nthe boat to begin a boat charter business.\n  In the 103d Congress, H.R. 3281, was introduced which provided for a \nJones Act waiver for Mr. Frederick's boat. The bill was never \nconsidered by the Senate and thereafter died after the session ended.\n  Mr. Frederick purchased his boat from a dealer he believed to be \nreputable. The dealer informed him that the boat could serve as an \nexcellent charter boat and could be licensed for both commercial and \ncharter uses. After Mr. Frederick purchased the boat, he discovered \nthat additional upgrades were needed to prepare the boat for commercial \nuse. When Mr. Frederick attempted to license the boat for commercial \nuse, he was informed that the boat could not be licensed because it was \nbuilt in Taiwan. Since that time, the dealer has closed his business \nand cannot be located. During the past few years, this potentially \nsuccessful business has been placed on hold. In anticipation of \nbeginning this new business, Mr. Frederick had hired a crew and support \nstaff, but as time elapsed, he has been forced to lay off several \nemployees.\n  When you consider the facts of this case, Mr. Frederick has made a \nsizable investment in a boat he purchased with misleading information. \nA Jones Act waiver will allow for Mr. Frederick to begin his new \nbusiness and create more jobs in his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15166-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 386\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 386, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the tax-free \ntreatment of education savings accounts established through certain \nState programs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1032\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the names of the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Nickles] and the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1032, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to provide nonrecognition treatment for certain transfers \nby common trust funds to regulated investment companies.\n\n\n                                S. 1271\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1271, a bill \nto amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n\n\n                                S. 1274\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Breaux] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1274, a bill to amend the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act to improve management of remediation waste, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1299\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pryor, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1299, a bill to bring \nopportunity to small business and taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15166-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15166-S15167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n   THE CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                     DOLE AMENDMENTS NOS. 2920-2921\n\n  Mr. DOLE submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe amendment No. 2898 proposed by him to the bill (H.R. 927) seeking \ninternational sanctions against the Castro government in Cuba, to plan \nfor support of a transition government leading to a democratically \nelected government in Cuba, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 2920\n\n       At the end of Title I concerning international sanctions \n     against the Castro government, insert the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, immigration has been in the news a \ngreat deal over the past few months. The debate usually fails \ncompletely to account for the vast difference between legal and illegal \nimmigration. Amidst calls for increased enforcement of our laws against \nillegal immigration to the United States--enforcement which I strongly \nsupport--we see proposals aimed at cutting back admissions of legal \nimmigrants: those immigrants who play by the rules and enter our Nation \nthe correct way.\n  In general, I oppose the idea of further restricting legal \nimmigration to the United States, and particularly oppose drastic cuts \nin family-based immigration. Those foreigners who demonstrate the \ninitiative to move to the United States are among the most industrious \nand motivated members of their own nations. Like the immigrants who \narrived in America before them, they come to this country to join their \nfamilies and to carve out opportunities for themselves. In doing so, \nthey enrich our country economically, culturally, and socially. Those \nwho support cuts in legal immigration often do so without identifying \nany concrete \n\n[[Page S 15168]]\nreason for these cuts, repeating only that the ``national interest'' \njustifies restricting both legal and illegal immigration. I cannot see \nhow preventing worthy immigrants from reuniting with their families is \nin our national interest.\n  Today, I would like to focus on one particular category of legal \nimmigrants who face the threat of a locked door to the United States: \nthe brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, who are currently eligible \nfor immigrant visas under the fourth family preference category in our \nimmigration laws. Currently, 65,000 immigrants enter the United States \nannually under this category, and hundreds of thousands of others face \na backlog. Both Barbara Jordan's Commission on Immigration Reform and \nvarious Members of Congress have proposed eliminating this family \npreference category outright. I have great concerns about these \nproposals on two levels.\n  First, proponents of elimination of the fourth family preference \njustify their proposals by emphasizing that our family-based \nimmigration system should focus on the nuclear family, and that the \nsibling relationships protected by the fourth preference category are \ntoo attenuated to qualify as a priority in our immigration policy. I \nthink that if we were to survey the American public, we would find that \npeople of every ethnic and racial background value sibling \nrelationships so much that they would--and do--fully support an \nimmigration system that reunifies siblings as well as nuclear family \nmembers. While the public is undoubtedly and justifiably concerned \nabout illegal immigration, I have seen no evidence that it devalues \nlegal immigration generally, or sibling relationships in particular, in \nthe manner suggested by those who propose eliminating the fourth family \npreference. In fact, quite the contrary.\n  Second, I am especially concerned about the effect of elimination of \nthe fourth preference on those individuals who are currently in the \nbacklog. These prospective immigrants and their sponsors--who are \ncitizens of the United States--have expended substantial resources and \nfunds in attaining eligibility for an immigrant visa. They have played \nby the rules, and waited patiently for their numbers to come up. As \nmuch as these individuals want to reunite with their siblings, they \nhave decided against taking the rash but convenient step of entering or \nstaying in the United States illegally. It would be fundamentally \nunfair for the United States to take the money and run without \nfulfilling its commitment to these individuals.\n  I submit for the Record a New York Times article from September 24, \n1995, which tells the story of Sonya Canton, a naturalized American \ncitizen. She has two sisters, one of whom has illegally overstayed her \nvisa to the United States, is living here today legally under the 1986 \namnesty, and will soon become eligible for citizenship; and the other \nof whom waits patiently in the fourth preference backlog, having paid \nboth her fees and her dues. Mrs. Canton states: ``It is some kind of \ninjustice when those who played by the rules can't get in, but those \nwho broke the rules are now going to become citizens.'' I could not say \nit any better. At the very least, proposals to reform the fourth \npreference should, as a matter of fairness, provide for those in the \ncurrent backlog.\n  I bring to this issue a personal perspective. The director of my \nChicago office, Nancy Chen, has sponsored two of her brothers into the \nUnited States under the fourth preference. Both of them live near her \nin Illinois, and both are productive members of society with good jobs. \nThe closeness and industry demonstrated by this family is the very \nbehavior we should applaud and encourage. I fear that by eliminating \nthe fourth preference category we do just the opposite, and call on my \ncolleagues in Congress and on the administration to find a more \nsuitable solution in this area--one that, at the very least, treats \nthose backlogged visa applicants with the fairness they deserve.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the New York Times, September 24, 1995]\n\n                  Narrowing the U.S. Immigration Gate\n\n                            (By Seth Mydans)\n\n       Seventeen years ago, Sonya Canton, an American citizen born \n     in the Philippines, petitioned for her sister, a banker, to \n     join her here under the family-reunification policy that has \n     been the basic principle of United States immigration law for \n     30 years.\n       While she was waiting, a second sister, who sold exotic \n     seashells for a living, visited the United States as a \n     tourist, liked the place and decided to stay on illegally \n     with her three children.\n       To this sister's surprise and good fortune, in 1986 \n     Congress offered amnesty to illegal immigrants, and she and \n     her children became legal residents, eligible for \n     citizenship. Today she works as a saleswoman in a department \n     store, and her children have all graduated from high school \n     with honors.\n       Meanwhile, as a banker sister continues to wait, the mood \n     of the country, and of Congress, has changed. Struggling to \n     stem a flood of legal and illegal immigrants, Congress is \n     preparing to cut deeply into family-reunification quotes this \n     fall and drop people like her from eligibility.\n       If the changes are enacted, the United States would shut \n     the door on about 2.4 million people--the brothers, sisters \n     and adult children of citizens and legal residents--who have \n     waited for years or decades to enter the country as legal \n     immigrants. That number nearly matches the three million \n     illegal immigrants granted amnesty in 1986.\n       ``It is some kind of injustice when those who played by the \n     rules can't get in, but those who broke the rules are now \n     going to become citizens,'' said Ms. Canton, an import \n     specialist for the United States Customs Service.\n       But even immigration advocates concede that the current law \n     has become unwieldy, with a total of 3.5 million people \n     waiting--some in lines that stretch for 40 years or more--to \n     join relatives in the United States.\n       In some countries, like the Philippines, the projected wait \n     for American visas is so long that the categories for \n     siblings and adult children effectively no longer exist. \n     Nonetheless, the applications keep coming in, and the lines \n     grow longer. The solution most favored by Congress is to \n     focus on the nuclear family and to eliminate from eligibility \n     those with less immediate ties.\n       ``I don't think there is any risk that family unity will be \n     eliminated as a basis for immigration to the United States,'' \n     said Arthur C. Helton, an immigration expert with the Open \n     Society Institute, a lobbying group in New York that studies \n     international issues. ``But what that means in a number of \n     specific contexts will be redefined, and a focus on the \n     immediate nuclear family will emerge.''\n       That approach became evident when a Presidential commission \n     led by Barbara Jordan, a Democrat and former Representative \n     from Texas, recently began drafting proposed changes in the \n     immigration law. In an interim report issued in June, the \n     commission recommended, among other things, allowing citizens \n     and legal residents to bring in only spouses and minor, \n     unmarried children--not their siblings or adult children.\n       Congress is now considering a number of immigration bills. \n     The most far-reaching was submitted in June by Representative \n     Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who heads the House \n     subcommittee on immigration. His bill is in the hands of the \n     House Judiciary Committee. In the Senate, Alan K. Simpson, \n     Republican of Wyoming, is preparing to introduce a similar \n     bill.\n       The Smith and Simpson measures largely attack illegal \n     immigration; they propose stronger border controls, workplace \n     enforcement and deportation procedures. In addressing legal \n     immigration, the bills drastically cut family-reunification \n     admissions by making the siblings and grown children of legal \n     residents and citizens no longer eligible for immigration. \n     The Smith bill would reduce the number of legal immigrants to \n     535,000 a year, compared with about 800,000 last year.\n       The changes would reduce the waiting lists and speed the \n     entry of the spouses and minor children of legal residents. \n     Currently, the spouses and minor children of United States \n     citizens can enter immediately, without a numerical quota. \n     But about 1.1 million spouses and minor children of legal \n     residents are caught in the backlog, along with siblings and \n     children over 21.\n       Apart from family reunification, the primary avenue for \n     immigration into the United States is employment.\n       The 1986 amnesty is partly responsible for the flood of \n     applicants that has created pressure for the changes. About \n     80 percent of the spouses and minor children on the \n     immigration waiting lists are relatives of those who won \n     legal residence under that law, Government figures show.\n       The total family-preference waiting list of 3.5 million is \n     twice as long as when the amnesty law took effect. Under \n     current quotas, only 253,721 of those waiting will receive \n     visas this year, even as the list of applicants grows longer.\n       The backlog includes one million applicants from Mexico and \n     about 500,000 from the Philippines. Before the 1986 amnesty, \n     the Philippines was the largest source of legal immigrants \n     into the United States. Those countries are followed by \n     India, China, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, Taiwan, South \n     Korea, El Salvador and Haiti.\n       Short of raising the ceiling for immigration, there seems \n     to be little way to accommodate the lengthening waiting list \n     of siblings and adult children.\n       ``Clearly the public mood and the practical realities of \n     today's America require that we cut down on immigration,'' \n     said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for \n     American Immigration Reform, an independent lobbying group.\n\n[[Page S 15169]]\n\n       Calling the Jordan, Smith and Simpson proposals ``an effort \n     to strike a balance,'' he said, ``We have to make these \n     decisions based on what is in our national interest.'' He \n     added, ``We have no duty or obligation to people who have \n     been waiting in line because the system is impractical in the \n     first place.''\n       But opponents say the cuts are politically motivated and \n     unnecessary. ``Since when did the United States become too \n     small for the parents and children and brothers and sisters \n     of United States citizens?'' asked Frank Sharry, executive \n     director of the National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigration \n     lobbying group. ``The idea of bringing in energetic newcomers \n     who are helped by family members to get a leg up in this \n     society is something that has worked for 300 years.''\n       He added, ``For a Congress that prides itself in being pro-\n     family, it seem hypocritical to cut family immigration by 30 \n     percent.''\n       One potential victim of the expected changes is Leticia \n     Chong, a Filipino nurse who has played by the rules and \n     prospered. She entered the country legally in 1981, became a \n     legal resident, obtained both business and nursing degrees \n     here and brought up five Philippines-born children to become \n     American doctors, nurses and engineers. Today they are all \n     either citizens or legal residents.\n       Her problem is her sixth and last child, an engineering \n     student who will turn 21 this month, having waited in vain \n     for his name to come up in the backlog of petitions for minor \n     children of legal residents. He now enters the category of \n     adult children, and--like Ms. Canton's banker sister--he \n     would simply be dropped from eligibility under the proposed \n     changes.\n       ``He has been here since he was 11 years old,'' Mrs. Chong \n     said. ``He has friends here. His family is here. This is his \n     home. What will he do if he has to go back to the \n     Philippines?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15167-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE MONTSHIRE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE 1995 WINNER OF THE NATIONAL \n                         MUSEUM SERVICES AWARD\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on Friday, October 6, 1995, the \nInstitute of Museum Services announced the winners of the 1995 National \nAwards for Museum Services. The awards were presented to five museums \nthat demonstrated success in attracting new audiences, developing \ninnovative programming which address educational, social, economic, and \nenvironmental issues, and entering into collaborations with other \npublic institutions in the community. Winners received the awards at a \nspecial White House ceremony. I am so proud that one of the museums \nchosen to be honored this year comes from the State of Vermont. The \nMontshire Museum of Science in Norwich, VT is a recipient of the 1995 \nNational Museum Service Award. Serving both Vermont and New Hampshire, \nthe Montshire Museum is a model of creativity, usefulness, and public \nservice.\n  The Montshire Museum is an outstanding science museum that has \nenriched the cultural and educational life of the Norwich community and \nsurrounding environs. It has set itself apart through a commitment to \nspecial activities and exhibitions, bringing unique vitality and \npurpose to innovative programming. For years, the Montshire Museum has \nbeen making learning science fun and accessible for people of all ages. \nFor example, the Montshire has developed educational exhibitions that \ninform visitors about recycling and ``precycling,'' or making smart \npurchasing decisions as part of its work in partnership with the \nHartford Community Center for Recycling and Waste Management. As a \nresult of the Montshire Museum's commitment, thousands who have come to \nthe center to dispose of waste have had an opportunity to learn more \nabout recycling and making smarter, more environmentally friendly \npurchasing decisions. In addition, the Montshire has been a leader in \ncreating a new community computer network housed in the museum--a great \nasset to all served by the museum. Clearly, this small science museum \nhas taken a leadership role in making a difference to its community.\n  Since it was established 20 years ago, the Montshire Museum has made \nan enormous impact on presenting unique educational opportunities for \nthe people of Vermont and New Hampshire. It is truly an example of \nexcellence in partnership and learning. My sincere congratulations to \nDavid Goudy, director of the Montshire Museum and to Bruce Pipes, \nchairman of the board--as well as to the all of the other committed \nindividuals working at the Montshire Museum--for this exceptional \nhonor. I am certain that it will continue to make a positive difference \nin our State that will last far into the future. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15169-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO MAJ. GEN. JAMES M. HURLEY, USAF, ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like the Senate to recognize \nMaj. Gen. James M. Hurley on the occasion of his retirement from active \nduty with the U.S. Air Force. General Hurley will retire from his \nposition as the Director of Plans and Programs at Headquarters Air \nCombat Command at Langley AFB, VA.

Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' \nattention to a report recently released by the Violence Policy Center \nwhich refutes one of the most persistent criticisms of the assault \nweapon ban--that assault weapons are not used by criminals. The ban on \nsemiautomatic assault weapons, enacted into law last year, has been the \nsubject of intense criticism and unfortunately seems to be the target \nof an almost inevitable repeal effort in this Congress. This report \nshould help clarify the real dangers posed by these weapons.\n  Despite the support of numerous law enforcement groups, and \ncompelling testimony to the contrary, many opponents of the assault \nweapon ban claim that assault weapons are rarely used in crimes, and \npose little threat to law enforcement personnel. This report, based on \na survey of newspaper clips from across the nation from February to \nJuly, 1995, provides further evidence to the contrary. \n\n[[Page S 15170]]\n\n  The survey identifies eight police officers killed and nine wounded \nby assault weapons during this 5-month period. It documents 20 separate \nincidents in which at least 43 law enforcement officers were confronted \nby assailants armed with assault weapons. This figure only includes \nincidents where these weapons posed an imminent threat to the officers, \nnot incidents where assault weapons were found on suspects or \nconfiscated during the course of an investigation or arrest. Twelve of \nthe 20 incidents involved AK-47 assault rifles or TEC-9 assault \npistols, both of which are explicitly banned by the Federal \nlegislation. The study finds that at least 1 in 10 law enforcement \nofficers killed in the line of duty will be felled by assault weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues to read this report, and seriously consider the \npublic safety and public policy issues involved in this issue. We \nshould heed the voices of the many law enforcement groups which \nstrongly support the ban. We should not repeal the assault weapon ban \nbefore it is given chance to make a difference. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15169-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRESSIONAL AWARD ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S.

Res. 180\n\n       Whereas the Week Without Violence, a public-awareness \n     campaign designed to inspire alternatives to the problem of \n     violence in our society, falls on October 15, 1995, through \n     October 21, 1995;\n       Whereas the prevalence of violence in our society has \n     become increasingly disturbing, as reflected by the fact that \n     2,000,000 people are injured each year as a result of violent \n     crime, with a staggering 24,500 reported murders in 1993 and \n     with losses from medical expenses, lost pay, property, and \n     other crime-related costs totaling billions of dollars each \n     year;\n       Whereas studies show that violence against women in their \n     own homes causes more total injuries to women than rape, \n     muggings, and car accidents combined and that one-half of all \n     women who are murdered in the United States are killed by \n     their male partners;\n       Whereas violence has invaded our homes and communities and \n     is exacting a terrible toll on our country's youth;\n       Whereas children below the age of 12 are the victims of 1 \n     in 4 violent juvenile victimizations reported to law \n     enforcement, adding up to roughly 600,000 violent incidents \n     involving children under the age of 12 each year;\n       Whereas studies show that childhood abuse and neglect \n     increases a child's odds of future delinquency and adult \n     criminality and that today's juvenile victims are tomorrow's \n     repeat offenders;\n       Whereas the risk of violent victimization of children and \n     young adults has increased in recent years;\n       Whereas according to FBI statistics, on a typical day in \n     1992, 7 juveniles were murdered;\n       Whereas from 1985 to 1992, nearly 17,000 persons under the \n     age of 18 were murdered;\n       Whereas the YWCA, as the oldest women's membership movement \n     in the United States, continues its long history as an \n     advocate for women's rights, racial justice, and nonviolent \n     approaches to resolving many of society's most troubling \n     problems;\n       Whereas the chapters of the YWCA provide a wide range of \n     valuable programs for women all across the country, including \n     job training programs, child care, battered women's shelters, \n     support programs for victims of rape and sexual assault, and \n     legal advocacy;\n       Whereas the YWCA Week Without Violence campaign will take \n     an active approach to confront the problem of violence head-\n     on, with a grassroots effort to prevent violence from making \n     further inroads into our schools, community organizations, \n     workplaces, neighborhoods, and homes;\n       Whereas the Week Without Violence will provide a forum for \n     examining viable solutions for keeping violence against \n     women, men, and children out of our homes and communities;\n       Whereas national and local groups will inspire and educate \n     our communities about effective alternatives to violence; and\n       Whereas the YWCA Week Without Violence is both a challenge \n     and a clarion call to all Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate encourages all Americans to spend \n     7 days without committing, condoning, or contributing to \n     violence and proclaims the week of October 15, 1995, through \n     October 21, 1995, as the ``Week Without Violence''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to support \npassage of Senate Resolution 180, declaring next week the ``Week \nWithout Violence.'' This week is part of what I hope will be a \ntremendous public awareness campaign to educate Americans about the \nthreat of violence in our society and to offer alternatives to this \ngrave problem.\n  None of us is immune from the violence in our communities. In rural \nand urban areas across this country, men, women, and children are at \nrisk. They are at risk not just on the streets, but all too often in \ntheir homes or in their schools.\n  I enthusiastically join Senator Bradley and others in supporting this \nresolution; it calls on Americans to spend a week without committing, \ncondoning, ignoring, or contributing to violence.\n  Teaching people that violence is not acceptable and educating victims \nof violence to seek out protection will save lives. The issue of \nviolence deserves national attention and demands community involvement. \nI hope and believe that the focus of the ``Week Without Violence'' will \nbe a small but significant step in decreasing the scourge of violence \nin our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15170-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15170-S15176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT of 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Research studies have demonstrated that administration \n     of antiviral medication during pregnancy can significantly \n     reduce the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus \n     (commonly known as HIV) from an infected mother to her baby.\n       (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \n     recommended that all pregnant \n\n[[Page S 15173]]\n     women receive HIV counseling; voluntary, confidential HIV testing; and \n     appropriate medical treatment (including antiviral therapy) \n     and support services.\n       (3) The provision of such testing without access to such \n     counseling, treatment, and services will not improve the \n     health of the woman or the child.\n       (4) The provision of such counseling, testing, treatment, \n     and services can reduce the number of pediatric cases of \n     acquired immune deficiency syndrome, can improve access to \n     and provision of medical care for the woman, and can provide \n     opportunities for counseling to reduce transmission among \n     adults.\n       (5) The provision of such counseling, testing, treatment, \n     and services can reduce the overall cost of pediatric cases \n     of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\n       (6) The cancellation or limitation of health insurance or \n     other health coverage on the basis of HIV status should be \n     impermissible under applicable law. Such cancellation or \n     limitation could result in disincentives for appropriate \n     counseling, testing, treatment, and services.\n       (7) For the reasons specified in paragraphs (1) through \n     (6)--\n       (A) mandatory counseling and voluntary testing of pregnant \n     women should be the standard of care; and\n       (B) the relevant medical organizations as well as public \n     health officials should issue guidelines making such \n     counseling and testing the standard of care.\n       (b) Additional Requirements for Grants.--Part B (42 U.S.C. \n     300ff-21 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in section 2611, by adding at the end the following \n     sentence: ``The authority of the Secretary to provide grants \n     under this part is subject to section 2673D (relating to the \n     testing of pregnant women and newborn infants).''; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 2616 the following section:\n\n     ``SEC. 2616A.

Mr. President, I understand that S. 1322, introduced \nearlier by myself is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The clerk will read the bill for the first time.\n  The bill (S. 1322) was read the first time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for its second reading.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been asked to object and do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as indicated, I have introduced S. 1322, the \nJerusalem Embassy Relocation Act of 1995. I am pleased to do so with \nthe distinguished senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, as \nthe lead cosponsor. As the Senate knows, Senator Moynihan has been the \nexpert and the leader on Jerusalem for his entire career. I am pleased \nthat he has joined with Senator Kyl, Senator Inouye and other \ncosponsors in this important legislation. I would like to take special \nnote of the roles of Senator Kyl and Senator Inouye in developing this \nlegislation, and in agreeing to the changes included today.\n  This legislation is very similar to S. 770, introduced on May 9, \n1995. S. 770 \n\n[[Page S 15177]]\ncurrently has 62 cosponsors--and 61 of them are included on the \nlegislation I am introducing today. There is one major change between \nS. 770 and S. 1322--the provision requiring groundbreaking in 1996 for \nconstruction of a new Embassy has been deleted, and minor or conforming \nchanges have been made. All major provisions are identical: Findings on \nthe importance of Jerusalem, statement of policy on recognizing \nJerusalem as the capital of Israel, semiannual reporting requirements, \nand, most important, the requirement that the American Embassy be open \nin Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.\n  A number of Members expressed concern about the potential impact of \nthe requirement for breaking ground on construction next year. Clearly \n62 percent of the Senate was comfortable with the provision. The lead \ncosponsor, Senator Kyl, felt particularly strongly about some action \noccurring next year--the 3000th anniversary of Jerusalem. But Senator \nKyl and the other cosponsors have agreed to remove the requirement in \nthe interests of gaining even broader support.\n\n  All of us in the Senate are aware of the possible impact our actions \ncould have on the peace process in the Middle East. We want the peace \nprocess to succeed. As I said upon introducing S. 770, ``the peace \nprocess has made great strides and our commitment to that process in \nunchallengeable.'' Last spring, the fate of the declaration of \nprinciples ``Phase II'' agreement was very much up in the air. The July \ndeadline was missed. The August deadline was missed. Fortunately, the \nOslo II accord was signed last month. Implementation is underway. While \nalways subject to disruption and always under attack from extremists, \nthe pace process is working. The toughest issues are yet to be resolved \nin final status talks, including Jerusalem.\n  In my view, the United States does not have to wait for the end of \nfinal status talks to begin the process of moving the United States \nEmbassy to Jerusalem. As both S. 770 and today's legislation state: \n``Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of Israel and the \nUnited States Embassy should be officially open in Jerusalem no later \nthan May 31, 1999.'' In my view, we should begin the process of moving \nnow and we should conclude it by May 31, 1999. That is the bottom line, \nand that is what S. 1322 does.\n\n  In the 5 months since the introduction of S. 770, the Clinton \nadministration has done nothing to bridge our differences. A \nquestionable legal opinion was offered and a veto threat was made, but \nno substantive contacts have occurred. Not one. I am disappointed the \nadministration has ignored what is obviously a strong bipartisan \nmajority in the Senate. I am disappointed the administration has made \nno effort at all to communicate with the lead sponsors of this \nlegislation. Our hope is to unify, not to divide, on the sensitive \nissue of Jerusalem. Our hope is to move ahead on this issue. Our hope \nis the administration will support the legislation to move the Embassy. \nIn 2 weeks, Prime Minister Rabin, mayor of Jerusalem Olmert and \nhundreds of others will assemble in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol to \ncommemorate the 3000th anniversary of Jerusalem. Many of us noted that \nthe American Ambassador to Israel could not find the time to attend \nopening ceremonies for the 3000th anniversary of Jerusalem in Israel. I \nam confident that the Congress will celebrate this historic event in a \nmuch more appropriate manner.\n  In the coming days I expect additional cosponsors will be added to \nthe Jerusalem embassy legislation. I also expect decisions to be made \nin the administration and in the Congress about how and when to proceed \nwith this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a legal analysis supporting the \nconstitutionality of this legislation along with a comparison of S. 770 \nand S. 1322, be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Legal Time, Oct. 9, 1995]\n\n                     Can Congress Move an Embassy?\n\n                        (By Malvina Halberstam)\n\n       This year marks 3,000 years since Jerusalem was first \n     established as the capital of a Jewish state, by King David. \n     Although the city has been ruled by many empires and states \n     since then, it has never been the capital of any other \n     country. It was formally re-established as the capital of \n     Israel in 1950. In a fitting tribute to the 3,000th \n     anniversary, Sens. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) \n     introduced a bill on May 9 of this year to move the U.S. \n     embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n       Besides the policy issue, which have been the subject of \n     considerable debate, the Dole-Kyl bill raises interesting \n     questions concerning the scope of congressional and executive \n     authority in the conduct of foreign affairs, and the extent \n     to which Congress can use its appropriations power to \n     influence executive action in this area.\n       The proposed Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation \n     Act, which has 60 cosponsors, makes a number of findings, \n     including that Jerusalem has been the Israeli capital since \n     1950 and that the United States maintains its embassy in the \n     functioning capital of every country except Israel. The bill \n     declares it to be U.S. policy to recognize Jerusalem as the \n     capital of Israel, to begin breaking ground for construction \n     of the embassy in Jerusalem no later than Dec. 31, 1996, and \n     officially to open the embassy no later than May 31, 1999.\n       The provides that at least $5 million in 1995, $25 million \n     in 1996, and $75 million in 1997 of the funds authorized to \n     be appropriated for the State Department's acquisition and \n     maintenance of buildings abroad shall be made available for \n     the construction and other costs associated with the \n     relocation. It further provides that not more than 50 percent \n     of those funds appropriated in 1997 may be obligated until \n     the secretary of state reports to Congress that construction \n     has begun and that not more than 50 percent of the funds \n     appropriated in 1999 may be obligated until the secretary \n     reports to Congress that the Jerusalem embassy has officially \n     opened.\n       President Bill Clinton has opposed the legislation on \n     policy grounds, and the Justice Department has prepared a \n     memorandum arguing that the bill is unconstitutional. \n     Essentially, the department argues (1) that the bill \n     interferes with the president's power to conduct foreign \n     affairs and make decisions pertaining to recognition, and (2) \n     that the bill is an inappropriate exercise of Congress' \n     appropriations power because it includes an unconstitutional \n     condition.\n\n\n                     the ``foreign affairs'' power\n\n       Contrary to popular impression, the Constitution does not \n     vest the foreign affairs power in the president. It does not \n     vest the foreign affairs power in any branch. Indeed, it \n     makes no reference to ``foreign affairs.''\n       The Constitution vests some powers that impact on foreign \n     affairs in the president, others in the president and the \n     Senate jointly, and still others in Congress. It provides \n     that the president ``shall receive ambassadors.'' It gives \n     him the power to appoint ambassadors, but only with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, and to make treaties, \n     provided two-thirds of the senators concur.\n       The Constitution also gives Congress a number of powers \n     affecting foreign affairs, including the power to ``regulate \n     commerce with foreign nations''; to ``establish uniform rules \n     of naturalization''; to ``coin money and regulate the value \n     thereof, and of foreign coin''; to ``define and punish \n     piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and \n     offenses against the law of nations''; to ``declare war, \n     grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules \n     concerning capture on land and water''; and to ``raise and \n     support armies,'' and ``provide and maintain a navy.'' As \n     Edward Corwin put it in The President: Office and Powers, \n     1787-1984, ``the Constitution . . . is an invitation to \n     struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign \n     policy.''\n       Probably the most comprehensive Supreme Court discussion of \n     the foreign affairs power is Justice George Sutherland's \n     opinion in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. \n     (1936). In that case, the Court sustained a statute \n     authorizing the executive to order an embargo on arms to \n     Brazil--a delegation of congressional authority unacceptable \n     at that time with respect to domestic regulation. Sutherland \n     argued that in foreign affairs, as distinct from domestic \n     affairs, the authority of the federal government does not \n     depend on a grant of power from the states. Turning to the \n     specific issue before the Court, the president's authority to \n     declare an embargo, Sutherland stated, ``We are dealing here \n     not alone with an authority vested in the President by \n     exercise of legislative power, but with such an authority \n     plus the very delicate plenary and exclusive power of the \n     President as the sole organ of the federal government in the \n     field of international relations.''\n       In addition to making no reference to ``foreign affairs,'' \n     the Constitution also makes no reference to ``recognition'' \n     of foreign states. The provision that the president ``shall \n     receive ambassadors,'' now considered the basis of the \n     president's power over recognition, was described by \n     Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 69 as ``more a matter of \n     dignity than of authority'' and ``a circumstance which will \n     be without consequence.''\n       Historically, however, presidents have made decisions on \n     recognition, starting with George Washington's recognition of \n     the French Republic. In United States v. Belmont (1937) and \n     United States v. Pink (1942), the Supreme Court implicitly \n     accepted the executive's authority over recognition when it \n     held that an executive agreement recognizing the Soviet \n     government and providing for settlement of claims between the \n\n\n[[Page S 15178]]\n     United States and the Soviet Union superseded inconsistent state law.\n       Both the Court's reference to the president's broad foreign \n     affairs powers in Curtiss-Wright (and other cases cited in \n     the Justice Department memo), and the Court's implied \n     acceptance of the executive's authority to recognize foreign \n     governments to Belmont and Pink were made in situations in \n     which Congress either delegated authority to the executive or \n     was silent. None involved a conflict between Congress and the \n     president.\n\n\n                         fluctuating authority\n\n       Indeed, the Supreme Court has never held that Congress \n     could not exercise one of its constitutional powers because \n     doing so would interfere with the president's conduct of \n     foreign affairs. The Court has held the converse: that \n     presidential action, which might have been constitutional if \n     Congress had not acted, was unconstitutional because it was \n     inconsistent with legislation enacted by Congress. In \n     Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), the Court \n     held that, notwithstanding his constitutional power as \n     commander in chief, President Harry Truman's seizure of the \n     steel mills to ensure that a threatened strike did not stop \n     the production of steel needed for the Korean War, was \n     illegal because it was inconsistent with the Taft-Hartley Act \n     for resolving labor disputes. Justice Robert Jackson, who had \n     been President Franklin Roosevelt's attorney general and was \n     a strong proponent of broad executive authority, concurred in \n     what has become the classic statement on the relationship \n     between executive and legislative power. Jackson wrote: \n     Presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate, depending \n     upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress. \n     . . .\n       1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or \n     implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its \n     maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own \n     right plus all the Congress can delegate. In these \n     circumstances, and in these only, may he be said (for what it \n     may be worth) to personify the federal sovereignty. If his \n     act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances, it \n     usually means that the Federal Government as an undivided \n     whole lacks power. . . .\n       2. When the President acts in absence of either a \n     congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely \n     upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of \n     twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent \n     authority, or in which its distribution in uncertain. \n     Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence \n     may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not \n     invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility. \n     In this area, any actual test of power is likely to depend on \n     the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables \n     rather than on abstract theories of law.\n       3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the \n     expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its \n     lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own \n     constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of \n     Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive \n     presidential control in such a case only by disabling the \n     Congress from acting upon the subject. Presidential claim to \n     a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be \n     scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the \n     equilibrium established by our constitutional system.\n       Justice Jackson cited Curtiss-Wright as an example of the \n     first class of cases and noted that ``that case involved not \n     the President's power to act without Congressional authority, \n     but the question of his authority to act under and in accord \n     with an Act of Congress.'' Jackson concluded, ``It was \n     intimated that the President might act in external affairs \n     without congressional authority, but not that he might act \n     contrary to an Act of Congress.''\n       Admittedly, the Dole-Kyl bill does not explicitly require \n     the president to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem. However, \n     the findings that Jerusalem is the Israeli capital and that \n     Israel is the only state in which the U.S. embassy is not in \n     the capital, the assertion that it is U.S. policy that the \n     embassy be in Jerusalem, the allocation of funds for \n     relocation and construction of an embassy there, and the \n     prohibition on the use of some funds appropriated to the \n     State Department if construction is not started by December \n     1996 and completed by May 1999, all clearly indicate the \n     purpose of Congress to commence construction of a U.S. \n     embassy in Jerusalem no later than December 1996 and to open \n     that embassy no later than May 1999.\n\n\n                          the jackson analysis\n\n       Under the Jackson analysis, were the president to take \n     ``measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of \n     Congress,'' his power would be ``at its lowest ebb.'' He \n     could ``rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus \n     any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.'' Such \n     exclusive presidential control could be sustained ``only by \n     disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.'' While \n     the question has never been decided, it is unlikely that a \n     court would hold that the president's authority to receive \n     ambassadors (his power to appoint ambassadors requires the \n     advice and consent of the Senate), minus the power of \n     Congress under the necessary and proper clause and the \n     spending clause of Article I, is sufficient to disable \n     Congress from acting upon the subject.\n       Both the necessary and proper clause and the spending \n     clause have been broadly interpreted to permit Congress to \n     legislate on a wide range of matters. Neither limits \n     congressional action to the matters enumerated in Article 1, \n     Sec. 8.\n       The necessary and proper clause authorizes Congress to make \n     not only all laws necessary and proper to implement the \n     enumerated powers of Congress, but all laws necessary and \n     proper to execute all powers vested in the government of the \n     United States or in any department or office thereof. Thus, \n     even if recognition were deemed an executive power--on the \n     basis of historical precedent, if not constitutional \n     provision--Congress has the power under this clause to enact \n     legislation concerning the location of U.S. embassies.\n       The Dole-Kyl bill is also clearly a proper exercise of \n     Congress' spending power. That the use of the spending power \n     is not limited to those areas that Congress can otherwise \n     regulate was made clear in United States v. Butler (1936). \n     Justice Owen Roberts, writing for the majority, stated, [The \n     first clause of Article I, Sec. 8] confers a power separate \n     and distinct from these later enumerated, is not restricted \n     in meaning by the grant of them, and Congress consequently \n     has a substantive power to tax and to appropriate, limited \n     only by the requirement that it shall be exercised to provide \n     for the general welfare of the United States [emphasis \n     added].\n       The Justice Department memo argues, correctly, that \n     Congress cannot use the spending power to impose \n     unconstitutional conditions. Thus, the Supreme Court has \n     held that Congress cannot use the appropriations power to \n     violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment, \n     Flast v. Cohen (1968); the compensation clause in Article \n     III, United States v. Will (1980); or the prohibition on \n     bills of attainder in Article I, Sec. 9, United States v. \n     Lovett (1946). The principle that has emerged is that \n     Congress cannot use the spending power to achieve that \n     which the Constitution prohibits. But neither \n     appropriating funds for relocation and construction of an \n     embassy nor limiting expenditure of funds appropriated for \n     the acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad if \n     construction is not started and completed on specified \n     dates violates any prohibition of the Constitution.\n       The Justice memo relies on Butler, the only case in which \n     the Court has held a federal appropriation invalid because of \n     the unconstitutionality of a condition that did not involve \n     infringement of individual rights. In that case, decided more \n     than half a century ago, the majority took the position that \n     Congress could not use federal funds to induce states to \n     enact regulations that Congress could not enact under its \n     enumerated powers. Within a year of that decision, however, \n     the Court (in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis and Helvering v. \n     Davis (1937) sustained conditional appropriations in areas \n     outside the scope of Congress' enumerated powers. Since then, \n     Congress has enacted numerous statutes in which it used the \n     spending power to achieve results that it could not have \n     achieved by regulating directly.\n       Most recently, in South Dakota v. Dole (1987), the Supreme \n     Court rejected a state argument that Congress could not use \n     federal highway funding to achieve a national minimum \n     drinking age because the 21st Amendment gave the states the \n     power to make that decision. After reviewing its earlier \n     decisions, the Court stated, These cases establish that the \n     ``independent constitutional bar'' limitation on the spending \n     power is not, as petitioner suggests, a prohibition on the \n     indirect achievement of objectives which Congress is not \n     empowered to achieve directly. Instead, we think that the \n     language in our earlier opinions stands for the \n     unexceptionable proposition that the power may not be used to \n     induce the States to engage in activities that would \n     themselves be unconstitutional.\n\n\n                      congress' power of the purse\n\n       Moreover, in Butler the Court held that Congress could not \n     use the spending power to limit states' rights. The Court has \n     never held that Congress cannot limit the proper exercise of \n     power by another branch of the federal government through the \n     use of its appropriations authority unless the matter falls \n     within Congress' enumerated powers. Such a holding would \n     vitiate one of the most important--if not the most \n     important--of the checks and balances: Congress' power of the \n     purse. As the U.S. District Court for the District of \n     Columbia stated in United States v. Oliver North (1988), \n     [t]hough the parameters of Congress' powers may be contested, \n     Congress surely has a role to play in aspects of foreign \n     affairs, as the Constitution expressly recognizes and the \n     Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed. The most \n     prominent among those Congressional powers is of course \n     the general appropriations power.\n       That Congress can use the spending power to limit the \n     executive's constitutional powers is well established. \n     Consider, for example, the president's power as commander in \n     chief. Although the Constitution provides that the president \n     shall be commander in chief, and the Supreme Court stated \n     almost 150 years ago that this encompasses the power ``to \n     direct the movements of the naval and military forces at his \n     command and to employ them in the manner he may deem most \n     effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy'' \n     (Fleming v. Page (1850)), Congress has repeatedly used its \n     funding power to limit military action by the president. \n     Indeed, in some of the challenges to the \n\n[[Page S 15179]]\n     Vietnam War, courts have stated that Congress' failure to prohibit the \n     president from using funds for the war (or for certain \n     aspects of it) constituted authorization. If Congress can \n     exercise its appropriations power to limit the president's \n     power as commander in chief--a power specifically provided \n     for in the Constitution--a fortiori it can exercise the \n     appropriations power to limit the president's foreign affairs \n     power--a power not expressly vested in the president, but \n     implied from other powers and shared with Congress.\n       Since World War II, Congress has consistently used \n     appropriations as a means of controlling some aspects of \n     foreign policy. In 1989, commentator Louis Fisher \n     characterized the assertion that Congress cannot control \n     foreign affairs by withholding appropriations as ``the most \n     startling constitutional claim emanating from the Iran contra \n     hearings'' (``How Tightly Can Congress Draw the Purse \n     Strings?'' American Journal of International Law). Or, as \n     Professor John Hart Ely put it in his 1993 book, War and \n     Responsibility: Constitutional Lessons of Vietnam and Its \n     Aftermath, assertions ``that foreign affairs just aren't any \n     of Congress's business . . . bear no relation to the language \n     or purposes of the founding document, or the first century \n     and a half of our history.''\n\n\n                        even kissinger conceded\n\n       Even strong proponents of broad executive power in foreign \n     affairs agree that Congress can use the appropriations power \n     to affect the conduct of foreign affairs. Professor Louis \n     Henkin, chief reporter for the latest Restatement of U.S. \n     Foreign Relations Law, has written, ``Congress has insisted \n     and presidents have reluctantly accepted that in foreign \n     affairs as in domestic affairs, spending is expressly \n     entrusted to Congress. . . .'' And then Secretary of State \n     Henry Kissinger conceded, following the executive \n     confrontations with Congress during the Vietnam War: The \n     decade long struggle in this country over executive dominance \n     in foreign affairs is over. The recognition that Congress is \n     a coequal branch of government is the dominant fact of \n     national politics today. The executive accepts that Congress \n     must have both the sense and the reality of participation \n     foreign policy must be a shared enterprise.\n       Whatever the respective powers of Congress and the \n     president to decide whether to recognize a foreign state--a \n     question on which the Constitution is silent and the Supreme \n     Court has never ruled--that issue is not raised by the Dole-\n     Kyl bill. Rather, the issues are whether Congress can enact \n     legislation that may affect U.S. foreign policy interests, \n     and whether it can achieve its ends through use of the \n     appropriations power. Long-established practice, the writings \n     of scholars and statesmen, and judicial decisions all \n     indicate that the answer to both is clearly yes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    Comparison of S. 770 and S. 1322\n\n       The withholding of funds pending groundbreaking for a new \n     embassy in Jerusalem in 1996 has been deleted (Section \n     3(a)(2) and section 3(b) of S. 770).\n       A new finding concerning a 1990 resolution on Jerusalem \n     passed by Congress has been added (finding 9 of S. 1322).\n       The statement of policy has been amended to include \n     reference to Jerusalem being undivided and open to all ethnic \n     and religious groups.\n       The statement of policy has been re-worded to use \n     ``relocated'' rather than ``officially open'' in reference to \n     the Embassy (section 3).\n       Fiscal Year 1995 funding (section 4 of S. 770) has been \n     deleted.\n       Funding for relocation costs in fiscal year 1996 and fiscal \n     year 1997 has been modified to be discretionary rather than \n     mandatory (section 4 of S. 1322).\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senators \nDole, Moynihan, Kyl and Inouye and most of my other colleagues in \nintroducing the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act, S. \n1322. I hope that this bill will gain the support of all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, Jerusalem is and always shall be the capital of \nIsrael. Jerusalem is a unified city in which the rights of all faiths \nhave been respected. The Embassy of the United States of America to \nIsrael should be in that country's capital, the city of Jerusalem.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with many of my colleagues in sending a \nletter to the Secretary of State encouraging the administration to \nbegin planning for relocation of the U.S. Embassy to the city of \nJerusalem. This process must move forward.\n  The bill we are introducing today establishes U.S. policy that \nJerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the state of Israel.\n  The bill also establishes a timetable for construction and relocation \nof the U.S. Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem by May 31, 1995. The \nSecretary of State is required to present an implementation plan to the \nSenate within 30 days of enactment and provide a progress report every \n6 months. The bill allocates substantial initial funding for the \nproject--$25 million in fiscal 1996 and $75 million in fiscal 1997.\n  Like the President and many of my colleagues, I believe we can and \nshould move forward to establish the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in a \nmanner consistent with the continued negotiation and implementation of \nthe peace process which achieved another significant step last month. \nThe modification to this legislation from the version earlier \nintroduced, S. 770, will ensure that this can be accomplished. There is \nno change in the real result of the bill: The opening of the U.S. \nEmbassy in Jerusalem by May 31, 1999.\n  Mr. President, the Jerusalem 3,000 celebration underway in Israel and \nthroughout the world commemorates the 3,000th anniversary of King \nDavid's entry into Jerusalem. There could be no more fitting occasion \nthan this celebration to commit America to finally establish our \nEmbassy in Jerusalem by the end of the decade.\n  With the adoption of the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation \nAct and continued progress in the peace process, we can enter the 21st \ncentury with the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, the capital of a safe and \nsecure Israel, at peace with her Arab neighbors, in an economically \nprosperous Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15176-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, if \ncloture is invoked on Tuesday, the Senate can be expected to be in \nsession into the evening in order to complete action on the Cuban \nsanctions bill. A third cloture motion was filed today. Therefore, if \ncloture is not invoked on Tuesday, a third vote will occur during \nWednesday's session.\n  Also during next week's session, the Senate can be expected to \nconsider any of the following items: Labor HHS appropriations bill, if \na consent agreement can be reached after brief consideration; NASA \nauthorization; Amtrak authorization; available appropriations \nconference reports.\n  I am also going to announce that the first cloture vote will not be \nbefore 5 p.m. on Tuesday. To clarify, there will not be any votes until \n5 p.m.\n  Let me also announce that under the able leadership of Senator Roth \nof the Senate Finance Committee, the Republicans have completed action \non the tax part of the reconciliation package--$245 billion in tax \ncuts; as far as family tax credits, $500. It is permanent.\n  There are a lot of good features in this bill: capital gains rate \nreduction, estate tax, family, health, businesses, a number of \nprovisions that I think the American people will certainly find to \ntheir liking. I want to compliment the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee. This is his first tax bill. \n\n[[Page S 15180]]\n\n  Last week, we were working on our goal to reach the reconciliation \npackage on the budget resolution. I congratulate Senator Roth from \nDelaware. He has done an outstanding job in a very short time.\n  It is my understanding that hopefully some time next week the full \nSenate Finance Committee will meet for markup on the tax provisions of \nthe bill, and we will be able to take up the reconciliation package on \nthe Senate floor, hopefully on Tuesday, October 24, under a 20-hour \ntime agreement. So we should finish it without much difficulty that \nweek.\n  I will say that everybody wants us to complete action on welfare \nreform. It is my hope on Tuesday we will be in a position to appoint \nconferees. I am advised by the Democratic leader that that may be \npossible on Tuesday. I hope that is the case.\n  We need to work very quickly on trying to reach some accommodation \nwith the House and hopefully have the same strong bipartisan support we \nhad on the vote in the Senate when the vote was 87 to 12, with one \nabsentee. I hope we can come back to the Senate with a bill that can be \nsupported by every one of the 87, plus maybe some of the others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/13/senate-section/article/S15179-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECESS UNTIL 9:45 A.M., TUESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1995\n\n   Mr. DOLE.
